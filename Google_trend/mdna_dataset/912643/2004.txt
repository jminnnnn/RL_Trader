ITEM 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations           Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. When used in this report, in the Companys press releases and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases believes, anticipates, expects, intends, estimates, should, may or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the following: risks associated with the development of new products, market acceptance of new products and services, technological obsolescence, dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers, risks associated with the Companys dependence on proprietary technology and the long customer sales cycle. The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements.   11        Readers are urged to carefully review the various disclosures made by the Company in this report, including in particular Exhibit 99.1 to this report, and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect the Companys business.         Operating Results.  The following table sets forth certain financial data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated:                                                                                                         For the Years Ended                          December 31,         December 31,         December 30,                2003         2002         2001         Net sales              100    %              100    %              100    %       Cost of sales              57                   55                   55                                                                               Gross profit              43                   45                   45           Operating expenses:                                                                   Sales and marketing              16                   19                   16            General and administrative              11                   10                   10            Research and development              9                   8                   7                                                                               Total operating expenses              36                   37                   33                                                                              Operating income              7                   8                   12           Gain (loss) on foreign currency              (1    )              (1    )              1            Interest expense, net              (4    )              (6    )              (7    )       Other expense, net                                                    (1    )                                                                          Net income applicable to common shareholders              2    %              1    %              5    %                                                                                   Market Trends.  The demand for rugged mobile computers continues to expand on a worldwide basis. The availability of high-powered portable computer technology coupled with application specific technologies and the proliferation of wireless communications contributes to the increased demand. The Company expects increased requirements to improve the efficiency in field-based work forces to link field workers into corporate information systems. Customers are demanding more functionality for less money due to recent short-term decreases in capital spending among public safety, military and private field forces worldwide. The Company expects the market for ruggedized computers to grow in 2004 where total-cost-of-ownership studies have proved the value of rugged platforms used in the field is significantly higher then consumer grade notebooks, with OEM customers being the highest growth segment for the Company. Increased spending in telecommunications, military, homeland defense are driving the need for rugged building blocks that the Company can provide to large OEM solution providers.         Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations.  The following table summarizes the Companys future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations, including payments due by period. All current contractual obligations are related to operating leases.

Financial Reporting Release (FRR) No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. The discussion and analysis of the Companys financial condition and results of operations are based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or   12        conditions. Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements.        Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The accounting policies which the Company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition, inventories and warranties.         Revenue Recognition . The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB 101), as amended by SAB 101A, 101B and 104. SAB 101 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.        The Companys revenue recognition policy is significant because the Companys revenue is a key component of its results of operations. The Company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment of its products. In certain limited situations, at the customers written request, the Company enters into bill and hold transactions whereby title transfers to the customer, but the product does not ship until a specified later date. The Company recognizes revenues associated with bill and hold arrangements when the product is complete, ready to ship, and all bill and hold revenue recognition criteria have been met. Accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based on experience. Service revenue, including non-warranty work and related parts sales, is recognized as earned. Extended warranty contracts are offered, generally as a separately priced arrangement with the customer. Revenues related to extended warranties are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements. The Company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and SAB 101, as amended.         Inventories . Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out cost method, or market value. The Companys inventory monitoring controls reduce the potential for write-downs of inventory due to obsolescence; however, there can be no assurance that future inventory write-downs will not be required. Inventory is coded to reflect the product for which it is primarily used, allowing the Company to better manage its inventory and to assist in making forecast updates.        The Company reviews its inventory quantities on hand quarterly and records a provision for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon usage and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.         Warranties . The Company warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for one year from the date of purchase with the exception of the ReVolution which has a three-year limited warranty on some components and a one-year warranty on some devices and accessories. Warranty costs for existing products, including parts and labor, are estimated based on actual historical experience. Management uses that historical data to accrue reserves to cover estimated costs based on units in the field under warranty. Management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy. While the Companys warranty costs have historically been within its expectations and the provisions established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs it has in the past.        While the Company engages in product quality programs and processes, the Companys warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Companys estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.         Related Party Transactions.  The Company sells certain products to Kontron and the Kontron group of companies for further resale outside North America. These sales were approximately $0.9 million in 2003, $1.1 million in 2002, and $1.3 million in 2001. The Company also buys products from these related entities for further resale within North America. These purchases were approximately $4.2 million in 2003, $2.0 million in 2002, and 0.8 million in 2001. The Company and the Kontron group of companies are operating under agreements regarding the sales and purchases from each other.        Included in the financial statements are approximately $185,000 and $119,900 of related party receivables and approximately $959,600 and $412,400 of related party payables as of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, respectively.        The Company has a credit line agreement with Kontron to provide up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($10.6 million   13        based on December 31, 2003 exchange rate). Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at 8% per annum (payable monthly). The maturity date of the note is July 1, 2011. Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were approximately $7.1 million at December 31, 2003 and approximately $7.5 million at December 31, 2002. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion.        On December 3, 2003, the Company announced that it had received an offer from Kontron AG expressing the interest of Kontron AG to acquire all of the shares of the Companys common stock not currently owned or controlled by Kontron AG. Kontron AG offered to pay $0.45 per share of common stock. The Companys board of directors has formed a special committee comprised solely of independent directors to review the offer from Kontron AG. On January 8, 2004, the Company announced that the special committee hired Stonehill Group, LLP as its financial adviser. Fredrikson & Byron, P.A., serves as legal counsel to the special committee. The special committee is continuing to work with its financial and legal advisers to evaluate and assess Kontron AGs offer. There can be no assurance, however, that a transaction with Kontron AG ultimately will be consummated. In addition, the Company and the special committee continue to incur expenses for legal, financial and accounting advisers which are required to be paid by the Company whether or not a transaction is consummated.         Accounting Pronouncements . In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). FIN 45 establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for a companys obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. A guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the obligation it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee, including the ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur. The objective of the initial measurement of that liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception. FIN 45 also requires expanded disclosure of information related to product warranty amounts recorded in the financial statements. The Company adopted the provision effective for the quarter ended March 31, 2003. The implementation of this interpretation does not have a significant impact on the financial statements; however, it requires additional footnote disclosures.        The Company warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for one year from the date of purchase with the exception of the ReVolution which has a three-year limited warranty on some components and a one-year warranty on some devices and accessories. Warranty costs for existing products, including parts and labor, are estimated based on actual historical experience. Management uses that historical data to accrue reserves to cover estimated costs based on units in the field. Management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy.        As required under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), the following table presents the changes in the Companys warranty liability for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002:                                                                                                                                                                     Aggregate Changes in                                                        Aggregate         the Liability for                                                        Reductions in the         Accruals Related to         Aggregate Changes in                                              Liability for         Product Warranties         the Liability for Accruals                          Beginning         Payments Made         Issued During the          Related to Pre-Existing         Ending      Year         Balance         Under the Warranties         Reporting Periods          Warranties         Balance         2003         $    332,169              $    (135,828    )         $    135,828              $    (129,169    )         $    203,000            2002              332,169                   (170,084    )              170,084                                      332,169                    In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transition and Disclosure. SFAS No. 148 amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures about an entitys accounting policy with respect to stock-based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements.        The Company has adopted the disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 148. Accordingly, under the provisions of SFAS No. 123, the Company applies Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans. In accordance with APB 25, no compensation expense was recognized as the exercise price of the Companys stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and the exercise price and number of shares subject to grant were fixed. If the Company had elected to recognize   14        compensation expense based on the fair value of the options granted at the date of grant and in respect to shares issuable under the Companys equity compensation plans as prescribed by SFAS No. 123, net income and diluted earnings per share using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated in the table below:                                                                                     2003         2002         2001         Net income, as reported         $    177,246              $    148,722              $    940,359            Deduct: Total stock-based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards              (231,579    )              (265,274    )              (29,642    )                                                                          Pro forma net income (loss)         $    (54,333    )         $    (116,552    )         $    910,717                                                                              Net income (loss) per share:                                                                  Basic and diluted  as reported         $    .01              $    .01              $    .06            Basic and diluted  pro forma                                 (.01    )              .06                    In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 is applicable for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003. The implementation of this statement does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.        In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Many of those instruments were previously classified as equity. Some of the provisions of this Statement are consistent with the current definition of liabilities in FASB Concepts Statement No. 6,  Elements of Financial Statements.  The remaining provisions of this Statement are consistent with the Boards proposal to revise that definition to encompass certain obligations that a reporting entity can or must settle by issuing its own equity shares, depending on the nature of the relationship established between the holder and the issuer. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The implementation of this statement does not have a significant impact on the financial statements.   COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002           Net Sales.  Net sales for 2003 were $12.0 million, a decrease of $0.2 million or 2% from 2002 net sales of $12.2 million. Unit volumes of the 8000 Series represented 29% of total units in 2003 compared to 52% in 2002. The decrease is due to reduced demand for the product. Unit volumes of the EnVoy product represented 38% of total units in 2003 compared to 14% in 2002. The increase in sales was attributable to two large orders with Visteon and Jackson County, Michigan Sheriffs department in 2003 with no comparable large orders in 2002. Unit volumes of ReVolution presented 19% of total units in 2003. The Company began shipping the ReVolution in March 2003 so year-over-year figures are not available. Sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server represented 11% of total units in 2003 compared to 22% in 2002. The decrease in sales was attributable to a large United States Army order in 2002 with no comparable large orders in 2003. Revenue for the E-Tool product included development fees. Combined unit volumes of the Field Lite, Power Lite and IN Rave represented 4% of total units in 2003 compared to 10% in 2002. The decrease is due to reduced demand for these products.   15             Sales by product line were as follows:                                                                                     2003         2002         2001         8000 Series         $    4,401,000              $    6,365,000              $    7,770,000            EnVoy              3,230,000                   1,520,000                   2,235,000            ReVolution              1,641,000    (1)                                             2000 Series              1,578,000                   2,879,000                   5,905,000            E-Tool              398,000    (2)                                             Field Lite              439,000    (3)              599,000    (3)              248,000    (3)       Power Lite              156,000    (3)              256,000    (3)              13,000    (3)       IN Rave              20,000    (3)              119,000    (3)              89,000    (3)       5000 Series              117,000    (4)              487,000    (4)              1,046,000    (4)                                                                                    $    11,980,000              $    12,225,000              $    17,306,000                                                                                           (1)         The ReVolution was introduced in 2003.           (2)         Includes payment for E-Tool development fees.           (3)         The Field Lite, Power Lite and IN Rave are Kontron products. The Company began marketing these products in 2001.           (4)         The 5000 Series product was discontinued in fiscal year 2000. Revenues in 2001, 2002 and 2003 related to sales of remaining units on hand.             International sales decreased to $1.3 million, or 11% of net sales in 2003 from $1.6 million, or 13% of net sales in 2002. The majority of international sales are in Europe, including $0.8 million in 2003 and $0.9 million in 2002. The Company believes that international sales as a percentage of net sales for the year 2004 will be in the low- to mid-teen % range with little impact on the Companys results of operations and liquidity. The Company records all sales in U.S. Dollars.         Gross Margin.  Gross margin decreased to $5.1 million in 2003 from $5.5 million in 2002. Gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to 43% in 2003 as compared to 45% in 2002 due to the mix of products sold. The Companys gross margin will fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including mix of products sold, inventory obsolescence, the proportion of international sales, large customer contracts (with the associated volume discounts) and other manufacturing expenses.         Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the Companys standard one-year warranty program on all products with the exception of the ReVolution which has a three-year limited warranty on some components and a one-year warranty on some devices and accessories. Sales and marketing expenses were $1.9 million in 2003, a decrease of $0.4 million as compared to $2.3 million in 2002. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 16% in 2003 as compared to 19% in 2002. The decrease is due to aggregate changes in the warranty liability for accruals related to pre-existing warranties, in addition to a change in the commission payment structure and lower advertising costs.         General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses include the Companys executive, finance, information services and human resources departments. These expenses stayed consistent at $1.2 million in 2003 and 2002. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 11% in 2003 as compared to 10% in 2002. The increase in percent is due to slightly lower revenue in 2003 over which to allocate the expenses.         Research and Development.  Research and development expenses are incurred in the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses increased to $1.1 million in 2003 from $1.0 million in 2002. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses increased to 9% in 2003 from 8% in 2002. The increase is due to higher development costs.         Loss on Currency Conversion.  The Companys credit agreements with Kontron allow for borrowings which are payable in Euros. In the second quarter of 2001, the Company began utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to protect against significant fluctuations in net income (loss) caused by changes in Euro exchange rates. The Companys practice is to enter into a forward contract at the end of each quarter and settle the contract at the end of the subsequent quarter. The Company records gains and losses on these derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes) in net income (loss) in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Derivatives and Hedging Activities. For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company recorded a net loss on currency conversion of   16        $140,080. For the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a net loss on currency conversion of $169,222. As of December 31, 2003, the Company entered into a new forward contract whereby the Company can hedge up to 5.8 million Euros.        The Company currently has no other balances or transactions conducted in a foreign currency.         Interest Expense, Net.  Net interest expense of $0.5 million was recorded in 2003 compared to $0.7 million in 2002. The decrease in interest expense is due to the reduction of the interest rate of the Kontron note payable from 10% to 8%, effective March 1, 2003, in addition to a $1,655,000 reduction of the principal balance as part of a February 2003 repayment.   COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND DECEMBER 30, 2001           Net Sales.  Net sales for 2002 were $12.2 million, a decrease of $5.1 million or 29% from 2001 net sales of $17.3 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a large order from the United States Army in 2001 with no comparable large orders in 2002, in addition to general economic conditions. Unit volumes of the 8000 Series represented 52% of total units in 2002 compared to 45% in 2001. The increase in percent was due to lower overall sales in 2002. The decreased dollars were due to general economic conditions. Sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server represented 22% of total units in 2002 compared to 34% in 2001. The decrease in sales was attributable to the large United States Army order in 2001 with no comparable large orders in 2002. Unit volumes of the EnVoy product represented 14% of total units in 2002 compared to 13% in 2001. Combined unit volumes of the Field Lite, IN Rave and Power Lite represented 10% of total units in 2002 compared to 2% in 2001. The Company began marketing these products in mid-year 2001 so year-over-year figures are not comparable.        Sales by product line were as follows:                                                                                     2002         2001         2000         8000 Series         $    6,365,000              $    7,770,000              $    5,313,000            2000 Series              2,879,000                   5,905,000                   4,796,000            EnVoy              1,520,000    (1)              2,235,000    (1)                          Field Lite              599,000    (2)              248,000    (2)                          IN Rave              119,000    (2)              89,000    (2)                          Power Lite              256,000    (2)              13,000    (2)                          7000 Series                  (3)                  (3)              1,826,000    (3)       5000 Series              487,000    (4)              1,046,000    (4)              3,761,000    (4)                                                                                    $    12,225,000              $    17,306,000              $    15,696,000                                                                                           (1)         The EnVoy product was introduced in 2001.           (2)         The Field Lite, IN Rave and Power Lite are Kontron products. The Company began marketing these products in 2001.           (3)         The 7000 Series product was discontinued and replaced with the 8000 Series product in fiscal year 2000.           (4)         The 5000 Series product was discontinued in fiscal year 2000. Revenues in 2001 and 2002 related to sales of remaining units on hand.             International sales decreased to $1.6 million, or 13% of sales in 2002 from $2.4 million, or 14% of net sales in 2001. The majority of international sales are in Europe, including $0.9 million in 2002 and $1.9 million in 2001.         Gross Margin.  Gross margin decreased to $5.5 million in 2002 from $7.8 million in 2001. Gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, remained constant at 45% in 2002 and 2001. The Companys gross margin will fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including mix of products sold, inventory obsolescence, the proportion of international sales, large customer contracts (with the associated volume discounts) and other manufacturing expenses.         Sales and Marketing.  Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the Companys standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were $2.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $0.4 million as compared to $2.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses increased to 19% in 2002 as compared to 16% in 2001. The decreased dollars are due to lower sales commissions paid on lower revenue. The increased percent is due to lower revenue over which to allocate the costs.   17              General and Administrative.  General and administrative expenses include the Companys executive, finance, information services and human resources departments. These expenses decreased to $1.2 million in 2002 compared to $1.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses stayed constant at 10% in 2002 and 2001. The decreased dollars are due to lower legal fees and bad debt expense.         Research and Development.  Research and development expenses are incurred in the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses decreased to $1.0 million in 2002 from $1.2 million in 2001. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses increased to 8% in 2002 from 7% in 2001. The decreased dollars are due to sharing research and development costs with Kontron and the synergy gained by the combined efforts. The increased percent is due to lower revenue over which to allocate the costs.         Loss on Foreign Currency.  The Companys credit agreements with Kontron allow for borrowings which are payable in Euros.        In the second quarter of 2001, the Company began utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to protect against significant fluctuations in net income (loss) caused by changes in Euro exchange rates. The Companys practice is to enter into a forward contract at the end of each quarter and settle the contract at the end of the subsequent quarter. The Company records gains and losses on these derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes) in net income (loss) in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, Derivatives and Hedging Activities, and also marks the related debt instrument to market under SFAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation. These loss amounts are included in the net foreign currency loss of $169,222 recorded in 2002 and the net foreign currency gain of $207,664 recorded in 2001. As of December 31, 2002, the Companys forward contract arrangements allowed the Company to hedge up to 7.0 million Euros.         Interest Expense, Net.  Net interest expense of $0.7 million was recorded in 2002 compared to $1.3 million in 2001. The decrease in interest expense is due to the repayment of the subordinated notes in September 2001 and a reduction of the interest rate on the Kontron note payable from 11% to 10% effective July 2002. Additionally, financing costs of $882,000 related to warrants issued in September 1999 were amortized over the two-year term of the subordinated notes. On February 27, 2003, the Company repaid $2.0 million to Kontron.         Other Expense, Net .  There were no costs booked to other expense in 2002 compared to approximately $119,700 in 2001. The majority of the 2001 costs were related to the payments that were required to be made under a legal settlement. On April 28, 2000, the Company entered into an Engagement Agreement with Goldsmith, Agio, Helms & Lynner, Ltd. (GAH) to act as its agent to assist with a merger, sale or similar transaction, for a minimum period of six months. The Company cancelled the agreement with GAH after being approached by Kontron about the transaction that eventually closed in December 2000. GAH pursued legal proceedings against the Company and in September 2001, an arbitrator found that the Company was required to pay damages of $792,000 to GAH. These costs were classified as other expense in the Companys 2001 and 2000 statements of operations.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES          For the third consecutive year, the Company achieved profitability and had a positive cash flow from operating activities in two of the three prior years. The Company realizes that continuous management of sales, gross margins and cash is necessary to improve liquidity. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving these measures. Circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity include changes in technology, dependence on key customers, decrease in demand for the Companys products and reliance on Kontron for financing and research and development support.        In 2004, one of the Companys focus areas is long-term growth by introducing new products that will further penetrate existing markets as well as new and growing markets. In 2003, the Company introduced enhancements to existing product lines: an enhanced EnVoy with a Kontron-designed faster CPU module, the FW8500 with enhanced features and performance based on another Kontron-designed CPU module, and a new 12.1 high-bright display option for EnVoy. The ReVolution began shipping in early 2003 and went into full production in early fall 2003. The ReVolution offers the Company new market opportunities that the existing, mature products do not have the features to achieve. Additional new products are planned to replace older products and allow for growth through 2004. The Company continues to be focused on further cost reductions through on-going product re-design initiatives by Kontron worldwide mobile design teams.   18             As in 2003, the Company intends to continue funding its own cash needs in 2004 without assistance from Kontron. To be successful, the Company will focus on increased sales and profitability, in addition to working capital management. In 2003, the Company incurred charges for interest expense to Kontron of approximately $548,000, relating to the note payable to Kontron. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company repaid $2.0 million to Kontron. However, there can be no assurance that additional repayments will be possible.        Kontron has provided the Company with a written agreement to provide financial support to enable the Company to meet its cash flow needs and obligations as and when they become due through December 31, 2004, if necessary. As of December 31, 2003, Kontron controlled approximately 65% of the Company. The Company has a line of credit agreement with Kontron which allows for borrowings of up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($10.6 million based on December 31, 2003 exchange rate.) Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at 8% per annum (payable monthly). The maturity date of the note is July 1, 2011. Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were approximately $7.1 million at December 31, 2003 and $7.5 million at December 31, 2002.        In the first quarter of 2003, the Company repaid $2.0 million to Kontron, consisting of approximately $345,000 in accrued interest and approximately $1,655,000 in principal. However, due to the weakening dollar against the Euro, the note payable to Kontron only decreased by approximately $358,000 during 2003. The Company has a $750,000 line of credit with a commercial bank and if necessary, intends to use this line of credit to fund potential cash requirements in excess of its current cash flow projection. The line of credit expires May 15, 2004. There were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit at December 31, 2003.        The Companys cash balance as of December 31, 2003 was $1.7 million as compared to the December 31, 2002 balance of $2.0 million and the December 30, 2001 balance of $2.1 million. The Companys accounts receivable balance was $2.7 million at December 31, 2003, $3.1 million at December 31, 2002 and $3.0 million at December 30, 2001. The difference between 2003 and 2002 is due to lower sales in the fourth quarter of 2003 compared to the fourth quarter of 2002. Net inventories were $1.7 million at December 31, 2003, increased from $1.0 million at December 31, 2002 and $1.2 million at December 30, 2001. The change from 2003 to 2002 was attributable to related party purchases of the ReVolution product with no comparable purchases in 2002 and due to a reduction in the inventory reserve related to the disposal of unsalable products that did not have a material effect on net income as reported. Deferred revenue was $0.7 million at December 31, 2003, $1.1 million at December 31, 2002 and $1.3 million at December 30, 2001. The change from 2003 to 2002 was attributable to reduced sales of extended warranties. Accounts payable was $1.1 million at December 31, 2003, $0.8 million at December 31, 2002 and $1.3 million at December 30, 2001. The increase from 2003 to 2002 was attributable to related party purchases of the ReVolution product with no comparable purchases in 2002.        The Company purchased approximately $8,000 of property, plant and equipment in 2003 as compared to $55,000 in 2002. The Company anticipates purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2004 will remain consistent with 2003.     ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk          As of December 31, 2003 the Company had approximately $7.1 million outstanding on its line of credit from Kontron. This loan bears interest at 8% per annum, payable monthly. Both the principal amount borrowed under the line of credit and interest payable thereunder are payable in Euros. See the earlier discussion under Foreign Currency Transactions for a description of the foreign currency forward contract in effect. All remaining transactions of the Company are conducted and accounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. Based on its overall foreign currency rate exposure at December 31, 2003, and in light of the Companys currently effective foreign currency forward contract, the Company does not believe that a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would materially adversely affect its financial position or results of operations.        The Company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in its cash and cash equivalents. The Company had $1.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2003. Based on analysis, shifts in money market rates would have an immaterial impact on the Company.   19          ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
