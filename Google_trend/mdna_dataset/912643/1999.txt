The worldwide market for portable computers continues to expand. The availability of high-powered portable computer technology coupled with application specific technologies and the proliferation of wireless communications contributes to the increased demand. The Company expects increased requirements to improve the efficiency in field based work forces and link field workers into corporate information systems.       The Company targets those markets which require portable computing platforms that can perform multiple functions including diagnostics, data acquisition and electronic testing and monitoring. Specifically, the Company is targeting Trucking, Public Services, including Utilities and Public Safety, and Government/Military. Each of these vertical markets continues to experience growth in field service computer application requirements.  8   Comparison of Years Ended January 3, 1999 and January 4, 1998       Net Sales. Net sales for 1998 were $20.0 million, a decrease of $3.8 million or 16% from 1997 net sales of $23.8 million. The decrease in sales was due primarily to several factors relating to the 5000 Series product. During mid- 1998 the 5000 Series II product was released which provided technology upgrades, lower pricing and improved performance and reliability over the 5000 Series I. Sales of the 5000 Series products represented 38% and 46% of net sales or $7.6 million and $10.9 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively. Sales of the 7000 Series product were comparable in 1998 and 1997.       International sales slightly decreased to $5.6 million, or 28% of net sales for 1998, from $6.0 million, or 25% of net sales in 1997. The majority of international sales are in Europe, including $4.0 million in 1998 and $3.4 million in 1997. The Company anticipates that international sales as a percentage of net sales will remain in the mid to upper 20% range with little impact on the Company's results of operations and liquidity.       The Company expects sales growth in 1999 due to increased penetration of key vertical markets, introduction of the 2000 Series platform, and establishment of the professional services organization. The Company is targeting sales in trucking, public services and military/government and has reorganized its sales and marketing efforts to focus on these markets. The 2000 Series line of mobile embedded servers is anticipated to be in production in the second quarter of 1999 and has been designed to enhance sales to customers requiring in-vehicle applications. Additionally, management believes that providing professional services, including consultation, business needs assessment, training and software integration with the Company's products, will increase future sales opportunities.       Delays in the introduction of the 2000 Series platform and/or market acceptance of the product could reduce the Company's projected 1999 sales. In addition, the Company expects revenue growth to fluctuate due to potentially long customer sales cycles.       Gross Profit. Gross profit decreased $3.4 million from $9.2 million in 1997 to $5.8 million in 1998. Gross profit margins, as a percentage of net sales, decreased from 39% to 29%. This decrease was the result of the impact of fixed manufacturing overhead costs allocated over reduced production volume in 1998. Additionally, gross profit was negatively impacted by a $1.0 million write down of inventory in the second quarter of 1998. These charges were due to discontinuation of the 5000 Series I product and other product changes in response to technological and market developments. The Company continues to take steps to strengthen its materials management to reduce the risk of future large write-downs of inventory. With these actions and anticipated unit volume increases offset by potential pricing reductions on larger customer orders, the Company believes gross profit margins should be in the mid 30% range in the near future.       Gross profit for all periods presented reflects the Company's reclassification of certain warranty-related costs from cost of sales to sales and marketing expense. The impact was to decrease cost of sales and increase gross profit by $458,000, or 2% of net sales in 1998 and by $774,500, or 3% of net sales for 1997.       Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, and general advertising and promotion. These expenses also include the costs related to maintaining the Company's standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were $5.5 million in 1998, an increase of $0.5 million as compared to $5.0 million in 1997. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses increased from 21% in 1997 to 27% in 1998. The increase in expenses was primarily due to expansion of the sales force including the addition of the professional services group. The Company intends to continue expanding its sales force as well as investing in advertising and promotion costs within its target markets. The Company anticipates sales and marketing expenses to slightly decrease as a percentage of net sales.  9        General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include the Company's executive, finance, information services and human resources cost centers. These expenses decreased slightly from $3.0 million or 13% of net sales in 1997 to $2.9 million or 15% of net sales in 1998. The Company anticipates holding the growth of general and administrative expenses to a level less than the growth of sales in the near future.       Research and Development. Research and development expenses are incurred in the design, development and testing of new platforms, and in the enhancement and testing of existing products. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses increased from $1.9 million or 8% of net sales in 1997 to $3.2 million or 16% of net sales in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to the introduction of the 5000 Series II and development of the 2000 Series product. The Company anticipates these expenses to increase in the near future to support expanded product and solutions offerings. Additional expenses are also anticipated to support customer-specific professional services including software integration and engineering support.       Product Upgrade and Restructuring Costs. Product upgrade and restructuring costs were $1.5 million or 8% of net sales in 1998. There were no such costs during 1997. These costs related to the discontinuation of the 5000 Series I platform, as well as other internal reorganization efforts. During 1998, the Company introduced the 5000 Series II platform, which has expanded features and increased performance. The Company also established reserves in 1998 to address any customer or upgrade issues with respect to the 5000 Series I. In addition, the Company incurred expenses relating to restructuring and severance costs.       Interest Expense and Other, Net. Net interest income of $158,000 was recorded in 1998 as compared to net interest expense of $258,000 in 1997. Proceeds from the initial public offering were used to repay debt in the first and second quarters of 1997. The Company anticipates to record net interest expense in 1999 as it utilizes its line of credit for working capital purposes to fund its operations.  Comparison of Years Ended January 4, 1998 and January 5, 1997       Net Sales. The Company's net sales increased 82% from $13.1 million in 1996 to $23.8 million in 1997. The increase was primarily attributable to a 97% increase in the number of units sold, offset by both a decrease in the average selling price of the 7000 Series and an increase in sales of the 5000 Series, which carries lower pricing. International sales increased to $6.0 million or 25% of net sales in 1997 as compared to $3.2 million or 24% of net sales in 1996.       Gross Profit. Gross profit increased 77% from $5.2 million in 1996 to $9.2 million in 1997. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit margins decreased slightly from 40% to 39%. The addition of the 5000 Series product at lower margins offset the increase in volume.       Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased from $3.6 million in 1996 to $5.0 million in 1997. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses decreased from 28% in 1996 to 21% in 1997. The increased expenses were primarily due expansion in the Company's direct sales force and sales commissions.       General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses increased from $2.2 million or 17% of net sales in 1996 to $3.0 million or 13% of net sales in 1997. The increase was attributable to additional compensation expense due to an expanded executive management team and the move of primary operations to a new facility.  10        Research and Development. Research and development expenses remained consistent at $1.9 million in 1997 and 1996. These expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales from 14% in 1996 to 8% in 1997. The increase in salaries and related expenses was offset by a reduction in product development costs in 1997.       Interest Expense and Other, Net. Interest expense, net of interest income, decreased from $356,000 in 1996 to $258,000 in 1997. Proceeds from the initial public offering were used to repay debt in March and April of 1997, with interest income earned on remaining proceeds for the rest of the year.  Liquidity and Capital Resources       In March 1997, the Company completed its initial public offering of common stock and received net proceeds of $11.8 million from the sale of 2,125,000 shares. From the proceeds, the Company repaid $6.4 million of loans in 1997. There were no additional loans or credit facilities until November 1998, at which time the Company entered into a two-year $3.0 million line of credit agreement. Borrowings bear interest at the greater of 3% over prime or 9%. Borrowings, as of January 3, 1999, were $682,000. The borrowing base is 75% of eligible receivables plus the lesser of $600,000 or 30% of eligible inventory as defined in the agreement. The availability based on the borrowing base calculation was $1.7 million as of January 3, 1999. For the fourth quarter of 1998, the net loss limitation contained in the agreement was $500,000. The Company has received a written covenant waiver for the fourth quarter reported loss of $712,000. For 1999, the agreement contains an equivalent covenant requiring cumulative year-to-date profit on a quarterly basis. Failure to comply with this covenant could result in default and accelerated repayment requirements.       The Company's cash balance as of January 3, 1999 was $1.7 million as compared to the January 4, 1998 balance of $3.2 million. Cash used for operating activities totaled $1.2 million in 1998 and $3.7 million in 1997. The Company's accounts receivable decreased from $6.4 million at January 4, 1998 to $3.9 million at January 3, 1999. The decrease in accounts receivable was due to increased effort on reducing collection periods and timing of shipments at year- end. Net inventories decreased from $5.0 million at January 4, 1998 to $3.4 million at January 3, 1999. This decrease was due to an enhanced focus on inventory controls. Deferred revenue increased from $0.6 million at January 4, 1998 to $0.8 million at January 3, 1999. This increase was attributable to the sales of extended warranties. Accrued liabilities decreased from $0.5 million at January 4, 1998 to $0.3 million at January 3, 1999, due to timing of payments at year end.       The Company purchased $1.1 million of property, plant and equipment in 1998 as compared to $0.9 million in 1997. The 1998 expenditures related primarily to tooling expenditures for the 5000 Series II and 2000 Series products and leasehold improvements on the new facility. The Company anticipates purchases of property, plant and equipment to slightly decrease compared to prior years as leasehold improvement activity has been completed.       The Company currently anticipates meeting its cash flow needs in 1999 with existing cash on hand and cash expected to be generated from operations, supplemented with line of credit borrowings and other potential financing sources. The Company may also seek additional equity or debt financing to fund expansion of product and service offerings. The timing and amount of any additional capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors including the demand for the Company's products, profitability, cash management operations, growth and many other factors. There can be no assurances that additional financing will be available at all or that it, if available, will be obtainable on terms favorable to the Company and would not be dilutive.  11   Year 2000 Compliance       The year 2000 issue is the result of computer programs using only the last two digits to identify the year. These programs may not be able to interpret dates beyond the year 1999, which could cause computer system failure or other errors disrupting operations. The Company is aware of the potential computing difficulties that the issue presents for the Company's operations in the year 2000 and as a result, has established an internal team, reporting to upper management, to address the issue. This team's focus includes the functioning of the Company's products, internal computer systems and non-computer operations, production processes, key vendors, vital business partners and critical customers.       The Company's major internal information systems software was upgraded during the first quarter of 1998 to ensure year 2000 compliance and provide enhanced systems capabilities. The total cost of the implementation was $110,000. The Company plans to perform other minor upgrades to its software and hardware by mid-1999. Approximately 60% of the expected costs associated with internal systems software alterations have been incurred to date. The Company's internal production processes and non-information systems software are in the process of being assessed. The cost of making them year 2000 compliant is anticipated to be minimal.       Management believes its current products are year 2000 compliant and is offering updated configuration software for products shipped in prior periods. Notification to customers of the availability of updated software has occurred and re-notification of key customers will occur in the second quarter of 1999. Associated costs are expected to be under $100,000. Approximately 75% of the expected costs associated with ensuring the Company's products are year 2000 compliant have been incurred to date.       The source of funds for upgrades to internal software, production processes and previously sold products is existing cash. There are currently no other projects within the Company that are affected by the outlay of significant resources to ensure year 2000 compliance.       The Company's operations with respect to the year 2000 may also be affected by other entities with which the Company transacts business. The Company has requested documentation from its vendors regarding compliance, and will evaluate alternative courses of action for vendors who are not or will not be year 2000 compliant. To date, varying confirmations have been received from the Company's vendors. The Company has identified its critical vendors and is in the process of verifying which are currently year 2000 compliant. Contingency plans will be developed for all critical vendors which are not year 2000 compliant by the end of the second quarter of 1999.       The year 2000 issue creates risk for the Company from unforeseen problems in its own computer systems and from the Company's vendors. Although the Company does not believe that the year 2000 issue will have a material impact on its business, financial position, results of operations or liquidity, it is uncertain as to what extent any failure of the Company's systems or its vendors' systems may have on its operations.       The Company identified all critical, external entities by the end of the first quarter of 1999. Notification of these entities, determination of their year 2000 status and development of alternative plans, if necessary are to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 1999.       Although the Company intends to fully address the year 2000 issue, without further assessment or resources assigned, the Company can give no assurance that the year 2000 issue will not cause significant business disruption, including delays in parts availability resulting in potential shipping delays and/or lost revenues.  12   ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       The Company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on borrowings under the Company's line of credit agreement. The line of credit bears interest based on the Prime Lending Rate. At January 3, 1999, the Company had $682,000 outstanding. Based on analysis, likely interest rate shifts would have an immaterial impact on the Company.       The Company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in its cash and cash equivalents. The Company invests its cash and cash equivalents in money market instruments. The Company had $1.7 million in cash and cash equivalents at January 3, 1999. Based on analysis, likely shifts in money market rates would have an immaterial impact on the Company.       All of the Company's transactions are conducted and accounts are denominated in United States dollars and as such, the Company does not currently have exposure to foreign currency risk.  ITEM 8.
