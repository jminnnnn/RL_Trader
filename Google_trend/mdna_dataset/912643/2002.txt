The demand for rugged mobile computers continues to expand on a worldwide basis. The availability of high-powered portable computer technology coupled with application specific technologies and the proliferation of wireless communications contributes to the increased demand. The Company expects increased requirements to improve the efficiency in field based work forces and link field workers into corporate information systems.       The Company targets markets requiring portable computing platforms that can perform multiple functions including diagnostics, data acquisition and electronic testing, communication and monitoring.       Critical Accounting Policies. Financial Reporting Release (FRR) No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies," requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. The discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.                                         7        Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The accounting policies which the Company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition, inventories and warranties.       Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC      ------------------- Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB 101), as amended by SAB 101A and 101B. SAB 101 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.       The Company's revenue recognition policy is significant because the Company's revenue is a key component of its results of operations. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment of its products. Accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based on experience. Service revenue, including non-warranty work and related parts sales, is recognized as earned. Extended warranty contracts are offered, generally as a separately priced arrangement with the customer. Revenues related to extended warranties are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements. The Company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and SAB 101.       Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value,      ----------- as determined by the first-in, first-out cost method. New inventory monitoring controls were put in place in 2001 to reduce the future write-downs of inventory due to obsolescence and to better manage inventory due to the resumption of in-house manufacturing. All inventory is now coded to reflect the product for which it is primarily used, allowing the Company to better manage its inventory and to assist in making bi-weekly forecast updates. This change has also allowed for improved analysis of the Company's inventory reserve.       The Company reviews its inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required.       Warranties. The Company warrants its products against defects in materials      ---------- and workmanship under normal use and service for one year from the date of purchase. Warranty costs for existing products, including parts and labor, are estimated based on actual historical experience. Management uses that historical data to accrue reserves to cover estimated costs based on units in the field. Management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy. While the Company's warranty costs have historically been within its expectations and the provisions established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs it has in the past.       While the Company engages in product quality programs and processes, the Company's warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Company's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.       Related Party Transactions. The Company sells certain products to Kontron and the Kontron group of companies for further resale outside North America. These sales were approximately $1.3 million in 2001. The Company also buys products from these related entities for further resale within North America. These purchases were approximately $0.8 million in 2001. The Company and the Kontron group of companies are operating under agreements regarding the sales and purchases from each other. Such transactions are in the normal course of business at negotiated prices comparable to similar transactions with other customers and suppliers. Management believes the transactions with Kontron and the Kontron group of companies are at arms length and are under terms no less favorable to the Company than those with other customers or suppliers.       Included in the financial statements are approximately $118,500 of related party receivables and approximately $210,100 of related party payables as of December 30, 2001.       The Company has a credit line agreement with Kontron to provide up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($7.7 million based on December 30, 2001 exchange rate). Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at 11% per annum (payable monthly), with no stated maturity date. Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were $6.9 million at December 30, 2001. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion.                                         8        Accounting Pronouncements. SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", became effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value. SFAS No. 133 requires that changes in the derivative's fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met and requires that a company must formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. SFAS No. 133 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations at adoption; see discussion below regarding foreign currency forward contracts utilized later in 2001.  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000       Net Sales. Net sales for 2001 were $17.3 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 10% from fiscal year 2000 net sales of $15.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a large order from the United States Army for the 2000 Series Embedded Vehicle Server that shipped in the first two quarters of 2001.       Unit volumes of the 8000 Series represented 45% of total units in 2001 compared to 34% in fiscal year 2000. Production of the 8000 Series began in fiscal year 2000, therefore the increase in sales in 2001 was attributable to only a partial year's production in fiscal year 2000. Sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server represented 34% of total units in 2001 compared to 30% in fiscal year 2000. The increase in sales was attributable to the large United States Army order. Unit volumes of the EnVoy product represented 13% in 2001. Production of the EnVoy product began in 2001 and, therefore, there were no comparable sales in fiscal year 2000. Unit volumes of the 5000 Series decreased to 6% of total unit sales in 2001 from 24% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in sales was attributable to the discontinuation of the 5000 Series product that began in fiscal year 2000.       Sales by product line were as follows:                                                               2001             2000             1999                                                        -----------      -----------      -----------        8000 Series.........................................   $ 7,770,000      $ 5,313,000(1)   $        --(1) 2000 Series.........................................     5,905,000        4,796,000        3,700,000 EnVoy...............................................     2,235,000(2)            --               -- Field Lite..........................................       248,000(3)            --               -- IN Rave.............................................        89,000(3)            --               -- Power Lite..........................................        13,000(3)            --               -- 7000 Series.........................................            --(4)     1,826,000(4)     9,037,000 5000 Series.........................................     1,046,000(5)     3,761,000(5)    12,592,000                                                        -----------      -----------      ----------                                                        $17,306,000      $15,696,000      $25,329,000                                                        ===========      ===========      ===========   - ---------- (1)  The 8000 Series product was introduced in fiscal year 2000. (2)  The EnVoy product was introduced in 2001. (3)  The Field Lite, IN Rave and Power Lite are Kontron products. The Company      began marketing these products in 2001. (4)  The 7000 Series product was discontinued and replaced with the 8000 Series      product in fiscal year 2000. (5)  The 5000 Series product was discontinued in 2001.       International sales increased to $2.4 million, or 14% of sales in 2001 from $2.3 million, or 15% of net sales in fiscal year 2000. The majority of international sales are in Europe, including $1.9 million in 2001 and $1.5 million in fiscal year 2000. The Company believes that international sales as a percentage of net sales for the year 2002 will be in the mid-teen to 20% range with little impact on the Company's results of operations and liquidity.       Gross Margin. Gross margin (deficit) increased to $7.8 million in 2001 from $(1.7) million in fiscal year 2000. Gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 45% in 2001 as compared to (11)% in fiscal year 2000. The 2001 gross margin was positively impacted by increased average selling prices, reduced direct material costs due to outsourcing within the Kontron group and improved management of inventory. The fiscal year 2000 gross margin was significantly impacted by $3.1 million of inventory write-downs which resulted from product line close-outs, changes in outsourcing arrangements and other technological and market developments. Excluding the $3.1 million of write-downs, the gross margin in fiscal year 2000 would have been $1.4 million and 9.0% of net sales. The Company's gross margin will fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including mix of products sold, inventory obsolescence, the proportion of international sales, large customer contracts (with the associated volume discounts) and other manufacturing expenses.                                         9        Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the Company's standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were $2.7 million in 2001, a decrease of $1.7 million as compared to $4.4 million in fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 16% in 2001 as compared to 28% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a workforce reduction in fiscal year 2000. The Company anticipates growth of sales and marketing expenses to be less than the growth of sales in the future.       General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include the Company's executive, finance, information services and human resources departments. These expenses decreased to $1.7 million in 2001 compared to $3.9 million in fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 10% in 2001 compared to 25% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease is due to the management workforce reduction that occurred in August 2000, in addition to a reduction in consulting fees. The Company anticipates growth of general and administrative expenses to be less than the growth of sales in the future.       Research and Development. Research and development expenses are incurred in the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses decreased to $1.2 million in 2001 from $4.2 million in fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses decreased to 7% in 2001 from 27% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease is due to sharing research and development costs with Kontron and the synergy gained by the combined efforts, in addition to a workforce reduction in fiscal year 2000. The Company anticipates growth of research and development expenses to be less than the growth of sales in the future.       Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs were $0.5 million, or 3% of net sales in fiscal year 2000. These costs were primarily severance charges due to changes in the Company's management team at the time of the Kontron investment.       Gain on Currency Conversion. The Company's credit agreements with Kontron allow for borrowings which are payable in Euros.       In the second quarter of 2001, the Company began utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to protect against significant fluctuations in net income (loss) caused by changes in Euro exchange rates. The Company's practice is to enter into a forward contract at the beginning of each quarter and settle the contract at the end of the quarter. The Company records gains and losses on these derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes) in net income (loss) in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," and also marks the related debt instrument to market under SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." These gain (loss) amounts are included in the net foreign currency gain of $207,664 recorded in 2001. As of December 30, 2001, the Company's forward contract arrangements allowed the Company to hedge up to 8.0 million Euros.       Interest Income (Expense), Net. Net interest expense of $1.3 million was recorded in 2001 compared to $1.7 million in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in interest expense is due to the repayment of the subordinated notes in September 2001. Additionally, financing costs of $882,000 related to warrants issued in September 1999 were amortized over the two-year term of the subordinated notes. The Company anticipates net interest expense will decrease in 2002 due to the repayment of the subordinated notes. In addition, the Company anticipates a reduction in interest expense in 2002 as a result of the planned repayment of its borrowings from Kontron.       Other Income (Expense), Net. Other expense of approximately $119,700 was recorded in 2001 compared to approximately $641,900 in fiscal year 2000. The majority of the costs are related to the payments that were required to be made to GAH.  COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND JANUARY 2, 2000       Net Sales. Net sales for fiscal year 2000 were $15.7 million, a decrease of $9.6 million or 38% from 1999 net sales of $25.3 million. The decrease in sales was primarily attributable to the delay of the introduction of the 8000 Series Workstation as a result of development and testing delays. Unit volumes of the 5000 Series decreased to 24% of total unit sales in fiscal year 2000 from 42% in 1999. The decrease in sales was attributable to no large customer orders in fiscal year 2000, compared to the large order from Ryder Transportation Services in 1999. Sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server represented 30% of total units in fiscal year 2000. Production of the 2000 Series began in mid-1999 so data is not comparable. Unit volumes of the 8000 Series represented 34% of total units in fiscal year 2000. Production of the 8000 Series began in mid-fiscal year 2000 and, therefore,                                         10   there were no comparable sales in 1999. Unit volumes of the 7000 Series decreased to 12% in fiscal year 2000 from 39% in 1999 due to the replacement of the 7000 Series product with the 8000 Series product.       Sales by product line were as follows:                                           2000             1999            1998                                    -----------      -----------      -----------        7000 Series ....................   $ 1,826,000(1)   $ 9,037,000      $12,445,000 5000 Series ....................     3,761,000(2)    12,592,000        7,547,000 2000 Series ....................     4,796,000        3,700,000           10,000(3) 8000 Series ....................     5,313,000(4)            --(4)            --(4)                                    -----------      -----------      -----------                                    $15,696,000      $25,329,000      $20,002,000                                    ===========      ===========      ===========   - -------------- (1)  The 7000 Series product was discontinued and replaced with the 8000 Series      product in fiscal year 2000. (2)  The 5000 Series product was discontinued in 2001. (3)  The 2000 Series product was introduced in 1998. (4)  The 8000 Series product was introduced in fiscal year 2000.       International sales decreased to $2.3 million, or 15% of sales in fiscal year 2000 from $3.7 million, or 14% of net sales in 1999. The reduction was due to the delayed introduction of the 8000 Series Workstation. The majority of international sales are in Europe, including $1.5 million in fiscal year 2000 and $2.8 million in 1999.       Gross Margin. Gross margin (deficit) decreased to $(1.7) million in fiscal year 2000 from $7.4 million in 1999. Gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, decreased to (11)% in fiscal year 2000 as compared to 29% in 1999. Gross margin was significantly impacted by $3.1 million of write-downs which resulted from product line close-outs, changes in outsourcing arrangements and other technological and market developments. Without the $3.1 million of write-downs, gross margin in fiscal year 2000 would have been $1.4 million and 9.0% of net sales.       The Company outsourced certain manufacturing activities during the first quarter of fiscal year 2000.       Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the Company's standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were $4.4 million in fiscal year 2000, a decrease of $1.2 million as compared to $5.6 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses increased to 28% in fiscal year 2000 as compared to 22% in 1999. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to reductions in advertising, promotions and trade show expenditures as well as a reduction in commissions and incentive compensation due to the reduction in sales.       General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include the Company's executive, finance, information services and human resources departments. These expenses increased to $3.9 million in fiscal year 2000 compared to $3.0 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 25% in fiscal year 2000 compared to 12% in 1999. The increase is primarily due to fees associated with the management services agreement related to the investment by IWHC, and recruitment expenses due to changes in the management team during the first half of the year.       Research and Development. Research and development expenses are incurred in the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses increased to $4.2 million in fiscal year 2000 from $3.4 million in 1999. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses increased to 27% in fiscal year 2000 from 13% in 1999. The increase was primarily due to the development of the 8000 Series Workstation, and re-design effort on the Series 2000 and Series 5000 workstations.       Restructuring Costs. Restructuring costs were $0.5 million in fiscal year 2000, or 3% of net sales, as compared to $0.4 million, or 2% of net sales in 1999. In fiscal year 2000, these costs were primarily severance charges due to changes in the Company's management team at the time of the Kontron investment. In 1999, these costs were due to severance charges from reorganization efforts related to outsourcing the manufacturing and design of products.       Interest Expense and Other, Net. Net interest and other expense of $2.4 million was recorded in fiscal year 2000 as compared to $314,000 in 1999. The increase in interest expense is due to borrowings on the Company's line of credit, interest payments on its subordinated notes, interest payments to Kontron for the operational cash credit line and payments made to GAH under the legal proceeding described in Item 3. In addition, financing costs of $882,000 related to warrants issued in September                                         11   1999 are being amortized over the two-year term of the subordinated notes. Financing costs of $437,500 related to warrants issued to Kontron in June 2000 were amortized from July 2000 through December 2000, the time of the closing of the Kontron equity investment.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       The relationship with Kontron has brought new resources, products, capital and a global sales force. During 2001, the Company began integrating global distribution channels, augmenting go-to-market strategies and reinventing product development and positioning plans. The Company's 2001 focus was to stabilize and reach profitability by reducing overhead and operating costs, increasing the average selling price on products and reducing product direct material costs.       In 2001, the Company had a positive cash flow from operations of $622,641, the first positive operating cash flow in the Company's history, compared to negative cash flows from operations of $11,025,746 and $5,168,905 in fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. While the Company achieved profitability in three of the four quarters in 2001, the Company realizes that continuous management of sales, gross margin and cash is necessary to improve liquidity. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving these measures and increasing its liquidity. Circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity include changes in technology, dependence on key customers, decrease in demand for the Company's products and reliance on Kontron for financing and research and development support.       The Company intends to fund its own cash needs in 2002 without assistance from Kontron. To be successful, the Company will focus on increased sales and profitability, in addition to improved working capital management. The Company has finalized a line of credit with an existing bank and if necessary, intends to use this line of credit to fund potential cash requirements in excess of its current cash flow projection.       On January 29, 2002, Kontron agreed to provide financial support to enable the Company to meet its cash flow needs and obligations as and when they become due through December 31, 2002. On September 28, 2000 (revised November 9, 2000), the Company entered into credit line agreements with Kontron to provide up to $5 million of cash for operations. Borrowings under these agreements bear interest at 11% per annum (payable monthly), and were due on December 15, 2000. The agreement was revised on December 16, 2000 for Kontron to provide up to DM 10 million and further revised on April 1, 2001 to provide up to DM 14 million for operations. On September 1, 2001 and December 28, 2001, the agreement was revised to provide up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($7.7 million based on December 30, 2001 exchange rate). Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at 11% per annum (payable monthly), with no stated maturity date. Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were $6.9 million at December 30, 2001.       The operating line with Kontron increased $3.9 million in 2001, mostly early in the year, to fund increased inventory purchases for large sales in the first and second quarters. As the year progressed, the Company was able to fund its own operations, including the $3 million payoff of subordinated notes in September 2001, without borrowing the equivalent additional funds from Kontron. The Company also anticipates partial repayment of the operating line borrowings with Kontron in 2002.       On June 29, 2000, the Company entered into a Purchase and Option Agreement with FWRKS Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Kontron Embedded Computers AG. The agreement was amended on August 16, 2000. Under the amended agreement, Kontron acquired 6 million shares of common stock of the Company for a purchase price of $5.4 million. In addition, the option Kontron previously granted to Industrial-Works Holding Co., LLC, (IWHC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Glenmount International was amended. As amended, IWHC was granted an option to acquire 62,000 shares of Kontron in exchange for preferred shares of the Company that were convertible into 3.4 million shares of the Company common stock. Both of these matters were approved at a special shareholders meeting held on October 18, 2000 and adjourned to October 27, 2000 and the transactions were closed in December 2000.       In addition, the Company received $2.5 million from FWRKS Acquisition Corp. on June 30, 2000 in the form of a subordinated note bearing interest at 11% per annum with an original maturity date of September 2001. FWRKS Acquisition Corp. also received warrants to purchase 1.25 million shares of common stock exercisable at $1.00 per share. The warrants were exercisable until November 15, 2000, and were recorded at their estimated fair value of $437,500 at the date of issuance. These warrants were cancelled and the subordinated notes were forgiven under the terms of the amended agreement described above.       On March 31, 2000, the Company issued 500,000 shares of the Company's Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to IWHC. The Company recorded a $250,000 charge relating to the beneficial conversion feature associated with this preferred stock. The Company issued a warrant to IWHC to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $2.00 per share in connection with this transaction. Subsequent to March 31, 2000, the conversion rate was adjusted to such that the holders have the                                         12   right to receive a total of 1,041,666 shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series C Convertible Participating Preferred Stock. In connection with this conversion rate adjustment, an additional beneficial conversion feature of $270,833 was recorded.       On February 22, 2000, the Company completed a $4.25 million equity investment by IWHC. In exchange for the $4.25 million investment, the Company issued 4,250,000 shares of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (each share of which was initially convertible into one share of Common Stock). Subsequent to February 22, 2000, the conversion rate was adjusted to such that the holders have the right to receive a total of 4,427,083 shares of common stock upon conversion of the Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock. IWHC received 500,000 warrants exercisable at $1.00 per share. The Company used the net proceeds for market expansion and new product development as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. In December 2000, IWHC tendered all of its shares of Series B and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock to Kontron in exchange for shares of Kontron Common Stock.       In September 1999, the Company completed a private placement of $3.0 million in 11% subordinated notes. The notes were repaid at the September 2001 maturity date. Noteholders also received warrants to purchase 1.5 million shares of common stock exercisable at $1.00 per share. The warrants are exercisable for five years, and were recorded at their estimated fair value of $882,000 at the date of issuance.       The Company's cash balance as of December 30, 2001 was $2.1 million as compared to the December 31, 2000 balance of $0.6 million and the January 2, 2000 balance of $0.1 million. This change from 2001 to fiscal year 2000 was due to cash provided by operations. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $0.6 million in 2001, compared to cash used for operating activities of $11.0 million in fiscal year 2000 and $5.2 million in 1999. The Company's accounts receivable was $3.0 million at December 30, 2001, $3.1 million at December 31, 2000 and $5.1 million at January 2, 2000. Net inventories decreased to $1.2 million at December 30, 2001 from $2.5 million at December 31, 2000 and $4.5 million at January 2, 2000. This change from 2001 to fiscal year 2000 was due to purchases for anticipated sales on the United States Army order that shipped in early 2001. Deferred revenue was $1.3 million at December 30, 2001, $0.7 million at December 31, 2000 and $1.0 million at January 2, 2000. The change from 2001 to fiscal year 2000 was attributable to increased sales of extended warranties. Accounts payable was $1.3 million at December 30, 2001, $3.2 million at December 31, 2000 and $3.8 million at January 2, 2000. Fiscal year 2000 and 1999 balances were high due to purchasing inventory for customer orders in the fourth quarter for anticipated sales in the first quarter with no comparable orders for sales in the first quarter of 2002. Other accrued liabilities decreased to $0.8 million at December 30, 2001 from $1.8 million at December 31, 2000 and $0.5 million at January 2, 2000. The change from 2001 to fiscal year 2000 was due to a $1.2 million liability in fiscal year 2000 with one of the Company's outsourced partners to buy back Series 5000 parts as part of the product discontinuance.       The Company purchased approximately $24,000 of property, plant and equipment in 2001 as compared to $0.3 million in fiscal year 2000 and $0.6 million in 1999. The Company anticipates purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2002 will remain consistent with 2001.  ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       As of December 30, 2001 the Company had $6.9 million outstanding on its line of credit from Kontron. This loan bears interest at 11% per annum, payable monthly. Both the principal amount borrowed under the line of credit and interest payable thereunder are payable in Euros. See the earlier discussion under "Foreign Currency Transactions" for a description of the foreign currency forward contract in effect. All remaining transactions of the Company are conducted and accounts are denominated in United States dollars. Based on its overall foreign currency rate exposure at December 30, 2001, the Company does not believe that a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would materially adversely affect its financial position or results of operations.       The Company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in its cash and cash equivalents. The Company had $2.1 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 30, 2001. Based on analysis, shifts in money market rates would have an immaterial impact on the Company.                                         13   ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
