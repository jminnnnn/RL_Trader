ITEM 7.    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. When used in this report, in the Company's press releases and in oral statements made with the approval of an authorized executive officer, the words or phrases "believes," "anticipates," "expects," "intends," "estimates," "should", "may" or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, the following: risks associated with the development of new products, market acceptance of new products and services, technological obsolescence, dependence on third-party manufacturers and suppliers, risks associated with the Company's dependence on proprietary technology and the long customer sales cycle. The Company wishes to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no                                          7    obligation to revise any forward-looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements. Readers are urged to carefully review the various disclosures made by the Company in this report, including in particular Exhibit 99.1 to this report, and in other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect the Company's business.

The demand for rugged mobile computers continues to expand on a worldwide basis. The availability of high-powered portable computer technology coupled with application specific technologies and the proliferation of wireless communications contributes to the increased demand. The Company expects increased requirements to improve the efficiency in field-based work forces to link field workers into corporate information systems. Customers are demanding more functionality for less money due to recent short-term decreases in capital spending among public safety, military and private field forces worldwide. The Company expects the market for ruggedized computers to grow slightly in the short-term with the biggest opportunity for growth in the low price-point handheld products. Long-term growth is expected in all ruggedized categories due to planned increased spending in homeland security and military operations.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. Financial Reporting Release (FRR) No. 60, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies," requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. The discussion and analysis of the Company's financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of its financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.       Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The accounting policies which the Company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition, inventories and warranties.       Revenue Recognition. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements" (SAB 101), as amended by SAB 101A and 101B. SAB 101 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) the fee is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectibility is reasonably assured. Significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates.                                          8         The Company's revenue recognition policy is significant because the Company's revenue is a key component of its results of operations. The Company generally recognizes revenue upon shipment of its products. In certain limited situations, at the customer's written request, the Company enters into bill and hold transactions whereby title transfers to the customer, but the product does not ship until a specified later date. The Company recognizes revenues associated with bill and hold arrangements when the product is complete, ready to ship, and all bill and hold revenue recognition criteria have been met. Accruals for sales returns and other allowances are provided at the time of shipment based on experience. Service revenue, including non-warranty work and related parts sales, is recognized as earned. Extended warranty contracts are offered, generally as a separately priced arrangement with the customer. Revenues related to extended warranties are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the term of the related agreements. The Company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and SAB 101.       Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, as determined by the first-in, first-out cost method, or market value. The Company's inventory monitoring controls reduce the potential for write-downs of inventory due to obsolescence; however, there can be no assurance that future inventory write-downs will not be required. Inventory is coded to reflect the product for which it is primarily used, allowing the Company to better manage its inventory and to assist in making forecast updates.       The Company reviews its inventory quantities on hand quarterly and records a provision for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon usage and assumptions about future demand and market conditions.       Warranties. The Company warrants its products against defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service for one year from the date of purchase. Warranty costs for existing products, including parts and labor, are estimated based on actual historical experience. Management uses that historical data to accrue reserves to cover estimated costs based on units in the field under warranty. Management reviews the estimated warranty liability on a quarterly basis to determine its adequacy. While the Company's warranty costs have historically been within its expectations and the provisions established, the Company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs it has in the past.       While the Company engages in product quality programs and processes, the Company's warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure. Should actual failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from the Company's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.       RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS. The Company sells certain products to Kontron and the Kontron group of companies for further resale outside North America. These sales were approximately $1.1 million in 2002 and $1.3 million in 2001. The Company also buys products from these related entities for further resale within North America. These purchases were approximately $2.0 million in 2002 and $0.8 million in 2001. The Company and the Kontron group of companies are operating under agreements regarding the sales and purchases from each other. Such transactions are in the normal course of business at negotiated prices comparable to similar transactions with other customers and suppliers. Management believes the transactions with Kontron and the Kontron group of companies are at arms length and are under terms no less favorable to the Company than those with other customers or suppliers.       Included in the financial statements are approximately $119,900 and $118,500 of related party receivables and approximately $412,400 and $210,000 of related party payables as of December 31, 2002 and December 30, 2001.       The Company has a credit line agreement with Kontron to provide up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($8.8 million based on December 31, 2002 exchange rate). Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at 10% per annum (payable monthly). The maturity date of the note is July 1, 2011. Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were approximately $7.5 million at December 31, 2002. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for further discussion.       ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS. In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities". This statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. It also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability. This statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002.       In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" (FIN 45). FIN 45 establishes accounting and disclosure requirements for a company's obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. A guarantor is required to recognize a liability for the obligation it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee, including the ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over                                          9    the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur. The objective of the initial measurement of that liability is the fair value of the guarantee at its inception. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this Interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. FIN 45 also requires expanded disclosure of information related to product warranty amounts recorded in the financial statements. The disclosure provisions are effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2002, and are included within Note 2.       In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation - Transition and Disclosure", an amendment to SFAS No. 123. This standard provides alternative methods of transition for any voluntary changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. It also amends the disclosure requirements to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The new disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2002 and will be effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The annual requirements are included within Notes 2 and 6 and the interim requirements will be adopted in the Company's fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2003.   COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND DECEMBER 30, 2001       NET SALES. Net sales for 2002 were $12.2 million, a decrease of $5.1 million or 29% from 2001 net sales of $17.3 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to a large order from the United States Army in 2001 with no comparable large orders in 2002, in addition to general economic conditions. Unit volumes of the 8000 Series represented 52% of total units in 2002 compared to 45% in 2001. The increase in percent was due to lower overall sales in 2002. The decreased dollars were due to general economic conditions. Sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server represented 22% of total units in 2002 compared to 34% in 2001. The decrease in sales was attributable to the large United States Army order in 2001 with no comparable large orders in 2002. Unit volumes of the EnVoy product represented 14% of total units in 2002 compared to 13% in 2001. Combined unit volumes of the Field Lite, IN Rave and Power Lite represented 10% of total units in 2002 compared to 2% in 2001. The Company began marketing these products in mid-year 2001 so year-over-year figures are not comparable.       Sales by product line were as follows:                                                           2002                2001                2000                                                    ------------        ------------        ------------             8000 Series .............................     $  6,365,000        $  7,770,000        $  5,313,000      2000 Series .............................        2,879,000           5,905,000           4,796,000      EnVoy ...................................        1,520,000(1)        2,235,000(1)               --      Field Lite ..............................          599,000(2)          248,000(2)               --      IN Rave .................................          119,000(2)           89,000(2)               --      Power Lite ..............................          256,000(2)           13,000(2)               --      7000 Series .............................               --(3)               --(3)        1,826,000(3)      5000 Series .............................          487,000(4)        1,046,000(4)        3,761,000(4)                                                    ------------        ------------        ------------                                                    $ 12,225,000        $ 17,306,000        $ 15,696,000                                                    ============        ============        ============   - -------------- (1) The EnVoy product was introduced in 2001. (2) The Field Lite, IN Rave and Power Lite are Kontron products. The Company     began marketing these products in 2001. (3) The 7000 Series product was discontinued and replaced with the 8000 Series     product in fiscal year 2000. (4) The 5000 Series product was discontinued in fiscal year 2000. Revenues in     2001 and 2002 related to sales of remaining units on hand.       International sales decreased to $1.6 million, or 13% of sales in 2002      from $2.4 million, or 14% of net sales in 2001. The majority of international sales are in Europe, including $0.9 million in 2002 and $1.9 million in 2001. The Company believes that international sales as a percentage of net sales for the year 2003 will be in the low- to mid-teen % range with little impact on the Company's results of operations and liquidity.       GROSS MARGIN. Gross margin decreased to $5.5 million in 2002 from $7.8 million in 2001. Gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, remained constant at 45% in 2002 and 2001. The Company's gross margin will fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including mix of products sold, inventory obsolescence, the proportion of international sales, large customer contracts (with the associated volume discounts) and other manufacturing expenses.                                          10         SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the Company's standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were $2.3 million in 2002, a decrease of $0.4 million as compared to $2.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses increased to 19% in 2002 as compared to 16% in 2001. The decreased dollars are due to lower sales commissions paid on lower revenue. The increased percent is due to lower revenue over which to allocate the costs.       GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses include the Company's executive, finance, information services and human resources departments. These expenses decreased to $1.2 million in 2002 compared to $1.7 million in 2001. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses stayed constant at 10% in 2002 and 2001. The decreased dollars are due to lower legal fees and bad debt expense.       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses are incurred in the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses decreased to $1.0 million in 2002 from $1.2 million in 2001. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses increased to 8% in 2002 from 7% in 2001. The decreased dollars are due to sharing research and development costs with Kontron and the synergy gained by the combined efforts. The increased percent is due to lower revenue over which to allocate the costs.       LOSS ON FOREIGN CURRENCY. The Company's credit agreements with Kontron allow for borrowings which are payable in Euros.       In the second quarter of 2001, the Company began utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to protect against significant fluctuations in net income (loss) caused by changes in Euro exchange rates. The Company's practice is to enter into a forward contract at the beginning of each quarter and settle the contract at the end of the quarter. The Company records gains and losses on these derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes) in net income (loss) in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," and also marks the related debt instrument to market under SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." These loss amounts are included in the net foreign currency loss of $169,222 recorded in 2002 and the net foreign currency gain of $207,664 recorded in 2001. As of December 31, 2002, the Company's forward contract arrangements allowed the Company to hedge up to 7.0 million Euros.       INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. Net interest expense of $0.7 million was recorded in 2002 compared to $1.3 million in 2001. The decrease in interest expense is due to the repayment of the subordinated notes in September 2001 and a reduction of the interest rate on the Kontron note payable from 11% to 10% effective July 2002. Additionally, financing costs of $882,000 related to warrants issued in September 1999 were amortized over the two-year term of the subordinated notes. On February 27, 2003, the Company repaid $2.0 million to Kontron. The Company anticipates a reduction in interest expense in 2003 as a result of this repayment plus potential future repayments of its borrowings from Kontron.          OTHER EXPENSE, NET. There were no costs booked to other expense in 2002 compared to approximately $119,700 in 2001. The majority of the 2001 costs were related to the payments that were required to be made under a legal settlement. See related discussion under Item 3, Legal Proceedings.   COMPARISON OF YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 30, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000       NET SALES. Net sales for 2001 were $17.3 million, an increase of $1.6 million or 10% from fiscal year 2000 net sales of $15.7 million. The increase was primarily attributable to a large order from the United States Army for the 2000 Series Embedded Vehicle Server that shipped in the first two quarters of 2001.       Unit volumes of the 8000 Series represented 45% of total units in 2001 compared to 34% in fiscal year 2000. Production of the 8000 Series began in fiscal year 2000, therefore the increase in sales in 2001 was attributable to only a partial year's production in fiscal year 2000. Sales of the 2000 Series Mobile Data Server represented 34% of total units in 2001 compared to 30% in fiscal year 2000. The increase in sales was attributable to the large United States Army order. Unit volumes of the EnVoy product represented 13% in 2001. Production of the EnVoy product began in 2001 and, therefore, there were no comparable sales in fiscal year 2000. Unit volumes of the 5000 Series decreased to 6% of total unit sales in 2001 from 24% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in sales was attributable to the discontinuation of the 5000 Series product that began in fiscal year 2000.                                          11         Sales by product line were as follows:                                                           2001                2000                1999                                                    ------------        ------------        ------------             8000 Series .............................     $  7,770,000        $  5,313,000(1)     $         --(1)      2000 Series .............................        5,905,000           4,796,000           3,700,000      EnVoy ...................................        2,235,000(2)               --                  --      Field Lite ..............................          248,000(3)               --                  --      IN Rave .................................           89,000(3)               --                  --      Power Lite ..............................           13,000(3)               --                  --      7000 Series .............................               --(4)        1,826,000(4)        9,037,000      5000 Series .............................        1,046,000(5)        3,761,000(5)       12,592,000                                                    ------------        ------------        ------------                                                    $ 17,306,000        $ 15,696,000        $ 25,329,000                                                    ============        ============        ============   - -------------- (1) The 8000 Series product was introduced in fiscal year 2000. (2) The EnVoy product was introduced in 2001. (3) The Field Lite, IN Rave and Power Lite are Kontron products. The Company     began marketing these products in 2001. (4) The 7000 Series product was discontinued and replaced with the 8000 Series     product in fiscal year 2000. (5) The 5000 Series product was discontinued in fiscal year 2000. Revenues in     2001 related to sales of remaining units on hand.       International sales increased to $2.4 million, or 14% of sales in 2001 from $2.3 million, or 15% of net sales in fiscal year 2000. The majority of international sales are in Europe, including $1.9 million in 2001 and $1.5 million in fiscal year 2000.       GROSS MARGIN. Gross margin (deficit) increased to $7.8 million in 2001 from $(1.7) million in fiscal year 2000. Gross margins, as a percentage of net sales, increased to 45% in 2001 as compared to (11)% in fiscal year 2000. The 2001 gross margin was positively impacted by increased average selling prices, reduced direct material costs due to outsourcing within the Kontron group and improved management of inventory. The fiscal year 2000 gross margin was significantly impacted by $3.1 million of inventory write-downs which resulted from product line close-outs, changes in outsourcing arrangements and other technological and market developments. Excluding the $3.1 million of write-downs, the gross margin in fiscal year 2000 would have been $1.4 million and 9.0% of net sales.       SALES AND MARKETING. Sales and marketing expenses include salaries, incentive compensation, commissions, travel, trade shows, technical support and professional services personnel and general advertising and promotion. These expenses also include the labor and material costs related to maintaining the Company's standard one-year warranty program. Sales and marketing expenses were $2.7 million in 2001, a decrease of $1.7 million as compared to $4.4 million in fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, sales and marketing expenses decreased to 16% in 2001 as compared to 28% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a workforce reduction in fiscal year 2000.       GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses include the Company's executive, finance, information services and human resources departments. These expenses decreased to $1.7 million in 2001 compared to $3.9 million in fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 10% in 2001 compared to 25% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease is due to the management workforce reduction that occurred in August 2000, in addition to a reduction in consulting fees.       RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. Research and development expenses are incurred in the design, development and testing of new or enhanced products, services and customized computing platforms. All research and development costs are expensed as incurred. These expenses decreased to $1.2 million in 2001 from $4.2 million in fiscal year 2000. As a percentage of net sales, research and development expenses decreased to 7% in 2001 from 27% in fiscal year 2000. The decrease is due to sharing research and development costs with Kontron and the synergy gained by the combined efforts, in addition to a workforce reduction in fiscal year 2000.       RESTRUCTURING COSTS. Restructuring costs were $0.5 million, or 3% of net sales in fiscal year 2000. These costs were primarily severance charges due to changes in the Company's management team at the time of the Kontron investment.       GAIN ON FOREIGN CURRENCY. The Company's credit agreements with Kontron allow for borrowings which are payable in Euros.                                          12         In the second quarter of 2001, the Company began utilizing foreign currency forward contracts to protect against significant fluctuations in net income (loss) caused by changes in Euro exchange rates. The Company's practice is to enter into a forward contract at the beginning of each quarter and settle the contract at the end of the quarter. The Company records gains and losses on these derivative contracts (which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes) in net income (loss) in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 133, "Derivatives and Hedging Activities," and also marks the related debt instrument to market under SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." These gain (loss) amounts are included in the net foreign currency gain of $207,664 recorded in 2001. As of December 30, 2001, the Company's forward contract arrangements allowed the Company to hedge up to 8.0 million Euros.       INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. Net interest expense of $1.3 million was recorded in 2001 compared to $1.7 million in fiscal year 2000. The decrease in interest expense is due to the repayment of the subordinated notes in September 2001. Additionally, financing costs of $882,000 related to warrants issued in September 1999 were amortized over the two-year term of the subordinated notes.       OTHER EXPENSE, NET. Other expense of approximately $119,700 was recorded in 2001 compared to approximately $641,900 in fiscal year 2000. The majority of the costs were related to the payments that were required to be made under a legal settlement. See related discussion under Item 3, Legal Proceedings.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       In 2002, the Company's revenue decreased 29% compared to 2001 due to fewer large customer orders and general economic conditions. Even with the decreased sales, the Company was able to achieve profitability in the fiscal year. The Company realizes that continuous management of sales, gross margin and cash is necessary to improve liquidity. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in achieving these measures. Circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect liquidity include changes in technology, dependence on key customers, decrease in demand for the Company's products and reliance on Kontron for financing and research and development support.       In 2003, one of the Company's focus areas is long-term growth by introducing new products that will further penetrate existing markets as well as new and growing markets. In 2002, the Company introduced three new products: an enhanced EnVoy with a Kontron-designed faster CPU module, the FieldWorks 8500 (FW8500) with enhanced features and performance based on another Kontron-designed CPU module, and a higher-brightness, lower-cost display for the EnVoy and 2000 Series III product lines. In early 2003, the Company is planning production of the ReVolution, marking the re-entry of the Company into the rugged notebook market. The Company continues to be focused on further cost reductions through on-going product re-design initiatives by Kontron worldwide mobile design teams.       As in 2002, the Company intends to continue funding its own cash needs in 2003 without assistance from Kontron. To be successful, the Company will focus on increased sales and profitability, in addition to working capital management. In 2002, the Company incurred charges for interest expense to Kontron of approximately $723,000, relating to the note payable to Kontron. The Company intends to reduce this interest expense in 2003 by making a partial repayment of the note payable to Kontron as the funds are available. On February 27, 2003, the Company repaid $2.0 million to Kontron. However, there can be no assurance that additional repayments will be possible.       Kontron has provided the Company with a written agreement to provide financial support to enable the Company to meet its cash flow needs and obligations as and when they become due through December 31, 2003, if necessary. As of December 31, 2002, Kontron controlled approximately 65% of the Company. The Company has a line of credit agreement with Kontron which allows for borrowings of up to 8.5 million Euros for operations ($8.8 million based on December 31, 2002 exchange rate.) As of December 31, 2002, borrowings under this agreement bear interest at 10% per annum (payable monthly). Prior to third quarter 2002, the note had no stated maturity date. Effective in third quarter 2002, the note was amended to establish a maturity date of July 1, 2011. Because of this amendment, the note was reclassified from current to long-term in the September 30, 2002 balance sheet. Outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were approximately $7.5 million at December 31, 2002. Effective March 1, 2003, Kontron agreed to reduce the interest rate to 8%.       In the first quarter of 2002, the Company repaid $1.0 million to Kontron, consisting of $620,000 in accrued interest and $388,000 in principal. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company repaid an additional $264,000 in accrued interest. In the third quarter of 2002, the Company repaid $200,000 to Kontron, consisting of $178,000 in accrued interest and $22,000 in principal. The Company has finalized a $750,000 line of credit with a commercial bank and if necessary, intends to use this line of credit to fund potential cash requirements in excess of its current cash flow projection. The line of credit expires May 15, 2003. There were no borrowings outstanding on this line of credit at December 31, 2002.                                          13         The Company's cash balance as of December 31, 2002 was $2.0 million, consistent with the December 30, 2001 balance of $2.1 million and compared to the December 31, 2000 balance of $0.6 million. The Company's accounts receivable was $3.1 million at December 31, 2002, $3.0 million at December 30, 2001 and $3.1 million at December 31, 2000. Net inventories decreased to $1.0 million at December 31, 2002 from $1.2 million at December 30, 2001 and $2.5 million at December 31, 2000. The change from 2002 to 2001 was due to slightly higher revenue in the fourth quarter and therefore, lower inventory levels in 2002 compared to 2001. Prepaid expenses decreased to $0.1 million from $0.3 million due to the return of a deposit from a former supplier. Deferred revenue was $1.1 million at December 31, 2002, $1.3 million at December 30, 2001 and $0.7 million at December 31, 2000. The change from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to reduced sales of extended warranties. Accounts payable was $0.8 million at December 31, 2002, $1.3 million at December 30, 2001 and $3.2 million at December 31, 2000. The change from 2001 to 2002 was attributable to a reduction of inventory, in addition to reduced overall expenses. Other accrued liabilities decreased to $0.3 million at December 31, 2002 from $0.8 million at December 30, 2001 and $1.8 million at December 31, 2000. The change from 2001 to 2002 was due to a lower interest balance owed to Kontron at December 31, 2002 compared to December 30, 2001.       The Company purchased approximately $55,000 of property, plant and equipment in 2002 as compared to $24,000 in 2001 and $0.3 million in fiscal year 2000. The Company anticipates purchases of property, plant and equipment in 2003 will remain consistent with 2002.   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       As of December 31, 2002 the Company had approximately $7.5 million outstanding on its line of credit from Kontron. This loan bears interest at 10% per annum, payable monthly. Both the principal amount borrowed under the line of credit and interest payable thereunder are payable in Euros. See the earlier discussion under "Foreign Currency Transactions" for a description of the foreign currency forward contract in effect. All remaining transactions of the Company are conducted and accounts are denominated in United States dollars. Based on its overall foreign currency rate exposure at December 31, 2002, the Company does not believe that a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency rates would materially adversely affect its financial position or results of operations.       The Company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in its cash and cash equivalents. The Company had $2.0 million in cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2002. Based on analysis, shifts in money market rates would have an immaterial impact on the Company.   ITEM 8.
