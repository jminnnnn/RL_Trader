Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations                         Introduction   We provide scheduled ground transportation of cargo on a time-definite basis. As a result of our established transportation schedule and network of terminals, our operating cost structure includes significant fixed costs. Our ability to improve our operating margins will depend on, among other things, our ability to increase the volume of freight moving through our network.   Critical Accounting Policies   A summary of significant accounting policies is disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in our 2004 Form 10-K. Our critical accounting policies are further described under the caption Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies in Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2004 Form 10-K.   Risk Factors   A summary of factors which could affect results and cause results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by us, or on our behalf, are further described under the caption Risk Factors in the Business portion of our 2004 Form 10-K.      19          Results of Operations   The following table shows the percentage relationship of expense items to operating revenue for the periods indicated. In the accompanying discussion, all percentage figures are as a percent of operating revenue with the exception of revenue growth rates.                              Year Ended December 31 COLOR="#000000">                                2004             2003             2002      Operating revenue                         100.0    %                 100.0    %                 100.0    %        Operating expenses:                                                      Purchased transportation                         42.0                     42.3                     43.9            Salaries, wages and employee benefits                         22.2                     22.5                     22.3            Operating leases                         4.5                     5.4                     5.4            Depreciation and amortization                         2.4                     3.0                     3.3            Insurance and claims                         1.9                     2.1                     1.7            Other operating expenses                    SIZE="2">     8.0                SIZE="2">     8.1                SIZE="2">     8.9            Total operating expenses                    SIZE="2">     81.0                SIZE="2">     83.4                SIZE="2">     85.5            Income from operations                    SIZE="2">     19.0                SIZE="2">     16.6                SIZE="2">     14.5            Interest expense                                                                     (0.2    )        Other income, net                    SIZE="2">     0.4                SIZE="2">     0.3                SIZE="2">     0.8            Total other income                    SIZE="2">     0.4                SIZE="2">     0.3                SIZE="2">     0.6            Income before income taxes                         19.4                     16.9                     15.1            Income taxes                    SIZE="2">     7.2                SIZE="2">     6.2                SIZE="2">     5.5            Net income                    SIZE="2">     12.2    %            SIZE="2">     10.7    %            SIZE="2">     9.6    %          Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003   Operating revenue increased by $40.7 million, or 16.9%, to $282.2 million for 2004 from $241.5 million in 2003. Airport-to-airport, which is the largest component of our operating revenue, increased $33.6 million to $238.4 million, accounting for 84.5% of our total operating revenue. During 2004, we experienced a 14.1% increase in tonnage that transited our network as the result of a stronger economy and positive trends among our customer base. Our airport-to-airport business is priced on a per pound basis and the average revenue per pound including the impact of fuel surcharges increased 2.0% for 2004 versus 2003 primarily as the result of a rate increase implemented during the year. Our logistics revenue, which is primarily truckload brokerage and priced on a per mile basis, increased $4.6 million to $24.1 million in 2004. During the year, we increased the number of miles driven to support our logistics revenue by 22.9% while increasing the revenue per mile including the impact of fuel surcharges charged by 0.6%. Accessorial revenue, which includes warehousing services and terminal handling and accounts for our final component of operating revenue, increased $2.5 million to $19.7 million, a 14.0% increase from 2003.   Purchased transportation decreased to 42.0% of operating revenue in 2004 versus 42.3% in the same period of 2003. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributed to a year over year improvement in tonnage transported through the airport-to-airport network and revenue per pound that allowed us to operate our network more efficiently in 2004 versus 2003. During the year, we increased the amount we spent for purchased transportation by $16.4 million, an increase of 16.0%. For 2004, purchased transportation costs for our airport-to-airport network represented 40.6% of airport-to-airport revenue versus 40.9% in 2003. During this period, we were able to increase both the volume and revenue per pound of freight, which enabled us to operate the airport-to-airport network more efficiently. These increases were offset, in part, by an increase in the number of miles needed to operate our system as well as an increase in the average rate per mile paid. For 2004, logistics purchased transportation costs represented 69.4% of logistics revenue versus 70.6% last year. We also increased the amount paid during 2004 for cartage or the local pick up and delivery of freight by 12.1% to $5.0 million.   Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 22.2% of operating revenue in 2004 compared to 22.5% for the same period of 2003. The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue     20           was primarily attributed to a year over year improvement in  tonnage and revenue per pound that allowed us to operate our network more efficiently in 2004 versus 2003. The amounts spent on salaries and wages,  including incentives and health care costs increased 16.0% and 35.5% during 2004, respectively. These increases, however, were offset by a 22.0%  decrease in the amount we spent on workers compensations expenses. This decrease resulted from favorable settlement of prior period claims, as  well as better current year claims experience.     Operating leases, the largest component of which is facility rent, were 4.5% of operating revenue in 2004 compared to 5.4% in the same period of 2003. The decrease in operating leases as a percentage of operating revenue between periods was primarily attributable to an increase in operating revenue as the dollar amount in this category decreased slightly between the two periods.   Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was 2.4% in 2004 compared to 3.0% in the same period of 2003. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in operating revenue and a decrease in depreciation expense from certain assets becoming fully depreciated, including two non-compete agreements which were fully amortized as of December 31, 2003. These decreases were offset, in part, by new depreciation from capital expenditures during 2004.   Insurance and claims were 1.9% of operating revenue in 2004 compared to 2.1% in the same period of 2003. The net increase in insurance and claims was approximately $230,000, primarily as the result of a decrease in our loss development factor as we have had, in general, better insurance claims experience over the last few insurance periods. This decrease, however, was offset by increases in claims amount during the period which were driven primarily by an adverse loss development on one major accident. We are self-insured for each auto liability claim in the amount of $500,000.   Other operating expenses were relatively flat in 2004, accounting for 8.0% of operating revenue compared to 8.1% in the same period of 2003. Other operating expenses include repair and maintenance, license and taxes, driver recruiting and compliance and other miscellaneous expenses.   Income from operations increased by $13.4 million, or 33.3%, to $53.6 million for 2004 compared with $40.2 million for the same period in 2003. The increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the increase in operating revenue, including fuel surcharges, which was offset in part by increases in variable costs associated with operating the network.   Interest expense was $55,000, or less than 0.1% of operating revenue, in 2004 compared with $71,000, or less than 0.1%, for the same period in 2003.   Other income, net was $1.1 million, or 0.4% of operating revenue, in 2004 compared to $0.6 million, or 0.3%, for the same period in 2003. The increase in other income, net resulted from higher interest income attributed to higher yields on higher balances in available-for-sale securities during 2004.   The combined federal and state effective tax rate for 2004 was 37.0% of pre-tax income compared to a rate of 36.6% for the same period in 2003.   As a result of the foregoing factors, net income increased by $8.6 million, or 33.3%, to $34.4 million for 2004 compared to $25.8 million for the same period in 2003.   Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002   Operating revenue increased by $15.4 million, or 6.8%, to $241.5 million for 2003 from $226.1 million in 2002. This increase resulted from an increase in traditional linehaul revenue of $12.0 million to $204.8 million, an increase in logistics revenue of $0.4 million to $19.5 million and an increase in other accessorial revenue of $3.0 million to $17.2 million. Traditional linehaul revenue was impacted during the year by an increase in average weekly tonnage of 3.2%. We experienced the additional benefit of a 2.9% increase in average revenue per pound, including the effect of fuel surcharge, versus 2002.   Purchased transportation represented 42.3% of operating revenue in 2003 compared to 43.9% in 2002. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily the result of an increase in operating revenue combined with a higher utilization of the airport-to-airport network. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in logistics revenue, where purchased transportation costs are traditionally higher as a percent     21          of operating revenue than traditional linehaul purchased transportation costs. For 2003, traditional linehaul and logistics purchased transportation costs represented 40.9% and 70.4%, respectively, of operating revenue, versus 42.3% and 69.8%, respectively, during 2002.   Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 22.5% of operating revenue in 2003 compared to 22.3% for 2002. The increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was attributed to a 0.2% increase in workers compensation expense compared to last year. While we spent a higher dollar amount on wages and benefits during 2003, the increase in operating revenue offset that amount so that the figure essentially remained flat as a percentage of operating revenue.   Operating leases, the largest component of which is facility rent, were 5.4% of operating revenue in 2003 compared to 5.4% in 2002. During 2003, we undertook leases for additional space in several markets of strategic importance which increased the dollar amount of operating leases. The amount of operating revenue we generated during 2003, however, offset the amount of additional rent expense and kept the amount as a percent of operating revenue constant when compared to 2002.   Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was 3.0% in 2003, compared to 3.3% in 2002. During 2003, certain of our assets became fully depreciated causing both the dollar amount spent and the percent of operating revenue to decline from 2002 to 2003.   Insurance and claims were 2.1% of operating revenue in 2003, compared with 1.7% in 2002. The increase in insurance and claims as a percentage of operating revenue resulted primarily from a 0.4% increase in insurance premiums which was caused by a favorable premium adjustment under a retroactive premium insurance policy during the fourth quarter of 2002. Claims experience during 2003 remained flat when compared to 2002 both in terms of dollar amount and as a percent of operating revenue.   Other operating expenses were 8.1% of operating revenue in 2003 compared to 8.9% in 2002. During 2003, our miscellaneous expenses, including bad debt expense, decreased by 0.3% of operating revenue from 2002. Additionally, the amounts paid for other taxes and licenses and fuel decreased by 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, of operating revenue from 2002.   Income from operations increased by $7.5 million, or 22.9%, to $40.2 million for 2003 compared with $32.7 million for 2002. The increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the increase in operating revenue, including fuel surcharge, which was offset by an increase in operating costs associated with operating the network.   Interest expense was $0.1 million, or less than one-tenth of one percent of operating revenue, in 2003, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.2%, for 2002. The decrease in interest expense was the result of the early retirement of debt related to our facility in Columbus, Ohio in December 2002.   Other income, net was $0.6 million, or 0.3% of operating revenue, in 2003, compared to $1.8 million, or 0.8%, for 2002. Other income, net during 2003 consisted primarily of interest income generated by our short-term investments. While we had a larger amount of available-for-sale securities in 2003, we experienced a lower rate of return on those amounts. Other income during 2002 included a $1.3 million settlement paid to us by U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc., a $0.4 million gain on the condemnation of a facility we owned in Atlanta and a $0.5 million charge from the early retirement of debt related to our facility in Columbus, Ohio.   The combined federal and state effective tax rate for 2003 was 36.6% compared to a rate of 36.7% for 2002.   As a result of the foregoing factors, net income increased by $4.2 million, or 19.4%, to $25.8 million for 2003, from $21.6 million in 2002.   Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies   Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in Note 1, the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting     22          policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us (for example, bankruptcy filings, accounts turned over for collection or litigation), we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due. Specifically, amounts that are 90 days or more past due are reserved at 50.0%. If circumstances change (i.e., we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customers ability to meet its financial obligations to us), the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount. Accounts are written off after all means of collection, including legal action, have been exhausted.   Allowance for Revenue Adjustments   Our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation. These adjustments generally arise: (i) when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes (spot quotes) to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system; (ii) when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate; (iii) when billing errors occur; and (iv) when data entry errors occur. When appropriate, permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system. We monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur. During 2004, average revenue adjustments per month were approximately $150,000, on average revenue per month of approximately $23.5 million (less than 0.7% of monthly revenue). In order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable, we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments. Based on this analysis, we establish an allowance for approximately 40-80 days (dependent upon experience in the last twelve months) of average revenue adjustments, adjusted for rebates and billing errors. The lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience. Additionally, the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors (such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted). Both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity.   Self-Insurance Loss Reserves   Given the nature of our operating environment, we are subject to vehicle and general liabililty, workers compensation and health insurance claims. To mitigate a portion of these risks, we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding $500,000 and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding $250,000. The amount of self-insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company-specific and industry data, as well as general economic information. The estimation process for self-insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims. Using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends, management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information. The most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs, the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims, changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date, and expected costs to settle unpaid claims. Management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior years estimation process (referred to as a hindsight analysis) and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis. Additionally, beginning in 2003, we utilize an actuary to evaluate open vehicle liability claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure.     23          Income Taxes   The Company accounts for income taxes using the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.   Liquidity and Capital Resources   We have historically financed our working capital needs, including capital purchases, with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $37.4 million for 2004 compared with $32.7 million in 2003.   Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $51.4 million for 2004 compared with net cash used in investing activities of $25.0 million in 2003. Investing activities consisted primarily of purchases of available-for-sale securities, operating equipment and information systems, and the proceeds from the sales or maturities of available-for-sale securities during 2004. Included in cash provided by investing activities was approximately $1.3 million held in escrow as of December 31, 2003 related to the Atlanta condemnation described in Item 2 of this Form 10-K.   Net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately $2.3 million for 2004 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $2.4 million in 2003. Financing activities included the repayment of long-term debt and capital leases, proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and repurchases of our Common Stock.   We expect net capital expenditures in 2005 for operating equipment and management information systems to be approximately $7.0 million. We intend to fund these expenditures through cash currently on our balance sheet, cash provided by operating activities or borrowings under our credit facility, if necessary. The 2005 capital expenditure budget does not include any allocation for acquisitions.   Our credit facility consists of a working capital line of credit. As long as we comply with the financial covenants and ratios, the credit facility permits us to borrow up to $20.0 million less the amount of any outstanding letters of credit. Interest rates for advances under the facility vary based on how our performance measures against covenants related to total indebtedness, cash flows, results of operations and other ratios. The facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.00% to 1.90% and is unsecured. The facilitys expiration was extended until April 2006 by letter agreement entered into in 2005. At December 31, 2004, we had $15.7 million of available borrowing capacity under the line of credit facility and had utilized $4.3 million of availability for outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2004, we were in compliance with the financial covenants and ratios under the credit facility.   On July 25, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to 3,000,000 shares of our Common Stock. We expect to fund the repurchases of our Common Stock from our cash, available-for-sale securities and cash generated from operating activities. As of December 31, 2004, we had repurchased 1,394,100 shares of our Common Stock for $23.5 million for an average purchase price of $16.83 per share. This includes 60,300 shares that were purchased in December 2004, but not paid for until 2005 representing approximately $1.8 million in accounts payable at year-end.   On February 15, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of our Common Stock to be effected in the form of a stock dividend to shareholders of record as of March 18, 2005. Common Stock issued and additional paid-in capital have been restated to reflect the split for all years presented. All common share and per share data included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been restated to give effect to the stock split.   Prior to February 15, 2005, we had never declared a cash dividend, our policy being to reinvest earnings into our business while retaining adequate cash reserves to fund potential acquisitions. On February 15, 2005, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per share of our Common Stock on a three-for-two stock split-adjusted basis. We expect to continue to pay regular quarterly cash dividends, though each subsequent quarterly dividend is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors.     24          Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   At December 31, 2004, we had letters of credit outstanding from a bank totaling $4.3 million required by our workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers.   Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments   Our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2004 (in thousands) are summarized below:         Contractual Obligations                    Payment Due Period                                Total             Less Than  1 Year             23 Years             45 Years             After 5 Years      Capital lease obligations                      $    1,391                  $    85                   $    178                   $    178                    $950             Operating leases                    SIZE="2">     32,091                SIZE="2">     11,050                SIZE="2">     15,806                SIZE="2">     5,235                SIZE="2">                 Total contractual cash obligations                    SIZE="2">  $    33,482                SIZE="2">  $    11,135                SIZE="2">  $    15,984                SIZE="2">  $    5,413                SIZE="2">    $950               At December 31, 2004, we had no outstanding purchase commitments.   We believe that our available cash, available-for-sale securities, cash expected to be generated from future operations and available borrowings under lines of credit, will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.   Related Party Transactions   Transactions with Landair Transport, Inc.   Scott M. Niswonger, the Chairman of the Board, owns a majority interest in the parent company of Landair Transport, Inc. (Landair). We purchase truckload transportation services from Landair. Matthew J. Jewell, our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, served in these same capacities with Landair until May 2004.   Disclosures regarding amounts charged to Landair and amounts charged by Landair to us for various operational and administrative services are set forth in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.   We purchased $0.2 million, 0.9 million and $1.6 million of truckload transportation services from Landair in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which have been included in purchased transportation in the consolidated statements of income.   Transactions with Sky Night, LLC   We purchase air transportation services from Sky Night, LLC (Sky Night), a limited liability corporation owned by Scott M. Niswonger, the Chairman of the Board. Air charter expense totaled $86,000, $196,000 and $264,000 in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and has been included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.   During 2001, we entered into an agreement to sublease hangar space at our Greeneville, Tennessee headquarters to Sky Night. The initial term of the sublease was for 12 months and the monthly rental rate was determined based on market prices for similar spaces in the area. The sublease term has been extended through July 2005.   Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements   On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 123 (Revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment , which is a revision of SFAS No. 123,  Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation . SFAS No. 123R supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees , and amends SFAS No. 95,  Statement of Cash Flows . Generally, the approach in SFAS No. 123R is similar to the approach described in SFAS No. 123. However, SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an option.     25          SFAS No. 123R must be adopted no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in a period in which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 123R on July 1, 2005. The Company at this time plans to adopt SFAS No. 123R using the modified-retrospective method, restating all prior periods.   As permitted by SFAS No. 123, the Company currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB Opinion No. 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS No. 123Rs fair value method will have significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS No. 123R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted SFAS No. 123R in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS No. 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 123R also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in the periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future, the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such tax deductions is disclosed in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.   In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities . This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,  Consolidated Financial Statements , sets forth criteria under which a company must consolidate certain variable interest entities. Interpretation No. 46 places increased emphasis on controlling financial interests when determining if a company should consolidate a variable interest entity. We adopted the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of the FASB deferring the effective date of FASB Interpretation No. 46 for variable interests held by public companies. The adoption of Interpretation No. 46 had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.   Forward-Looking Statements   This report contains forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and relate to future events or our future financial performance. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of such terms as believes, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, projects or expects. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The following is a list of factors, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: economic factors such as recessions, inflation, higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles, our inability to maintain our historical growth rate because of a decreased volume of freight moving through our network or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network, increasing competition and pricing pressure, surplus inventories, loss of a major customer, the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services rendered, our ability to secure terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates, the inability of our information systems to handle an increased volume of freight moving through our network, changes in fuel prices, claims for property damage, personal injuries or workers compensation, employment matters including rising health care costs, enforcement of and changes in governmental regulations, environmental and tax matters, the handling of hazardous materials, the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner-operators and freight handlers needed to serve our transportation needs and our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions. As a result of the foregoing, no assurance can be given as to future financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   Item 7A.  Quantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Except for capital lease obligations totaling $0.9 million, we had no long-term debt at December 31, 2004. Accordingly, our exposure to market risk related to remaining outstanding debt is not significant.     26          We are also exposed to changes in interest rates from our available-for-sale securities. As a result of the regularly reset interest rates to market rates on the available-for-sale securities we own, a material adverse effect to the fair market value of the investments is unlikely.
