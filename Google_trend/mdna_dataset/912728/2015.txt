Item 3.        Legal Proceedings   From time to time, we are a party to ordinary, routine litigation incidental to and arising in the normal course of our business, most of which involve claims for personal injury, property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight, or workers’ compensation. We do not believe that any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Item 4.        Mine Safety Disclosures      Not applicable. Part II Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Our exposure to market risk relates principally to changes in interest rates and fuel prices. Our interest rate exposure relates principally to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our credit facility. The credit facility, for which no balance was outstanding at or during December 31, 2014 bears interest at variable rates. However, assuming the entire credit facility had been outstanding for 2014, a hypothetical increase in our credit facility borrowing rate of 150 basis points, or an increase in the total effective interest rate from 1.3% to 2.8%, would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $2.3 million and would have decreased our annual cash flow from operations by approximately $2.3 million.     Our only other debt is capital lease obligations totaling $1.5 million.  These lease obligations all bear interest at a fixed rate.  Accordingly, there is no exposure to market risk related to these capital lease obligations.   We are exposed to the effects of changes in the price and availability of diesel fuel, as more fully discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Our cash and cash equivalents are also subject to market risk, primarily interest-rate and credit risk.
