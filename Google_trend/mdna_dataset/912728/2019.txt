Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of such terms as “believes,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “estimates,” “projects” or “expects.” Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The following is a list of factors, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: economic factors such as recessions, inflation, higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles, the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services rendered, the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner-operators and freight handlers as well as contracted, third-party carriers needed to serve our customers’ transportation needs, the inability of our information systems to handle an increased volume of freight moving through our network, the cybersecurity risks related to our information technology systems, changes in fuel prices, our inability to maintain our historical growth rate, including because of a decreased volume of freight or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network, loss of a major customer, whether our service offerings gain market acceptance, increasing competition and pricing pressure, our ability to secure terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates, labor and employment concerns, our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, claims for property damage, personal injuries or workers’ compensation, changes in our self-insurance and third-party insurance, seasonality, enforcement of and changes in governmental regulations, environmental matters, the impact of certain accounting and tax matters, and the handling of hazardous materials. As a result of the foregoing, no assurance can be given as to future financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors The following are important risk factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from our anticipated results or other expectations, including those expressed in any forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other filings with the SEC or in oral presentations such as telephone conferences and webcasts open to the public. You should carefully consider the following factors and consider these in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes in Item 2.        Properties Properties   We believe that we have adequate facilities for conducting our business, including properties owned and leased. Management further believes that in the event replacement property is needed, it will be available on terms and at costs substantially similar to the terms and costs experienced by competitors within the transportation industry.   We own our Columbus, Ohio central sorting facility which is used by our Expedited LTL and TLS segments. The Columbus, Ohio facility is 125,000 square feet with 168 trailer doors. This premier facility can unload, sort and load upwards of 3.7 million pounds in five hours.  We also own facilities near Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, Chicago, Illinois and Atlanta, Georgia, all of which are used by the Expedited LTL segment.  The Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas facility has over 216,000 square feet with 134 trailer doors and approximately 28,000 square feet of office space.  The Chicago, Illinois facility is over 125,000 square feet with 110 trailer doors and over 10,000 square feet of office space.  The Atlanta, Georgia facility is over 142,000 square feet with 118 trailer doors and approximately 12,000 square feet of office space. We lease our shared services headquarters in Greeneville, Tennessee. During 2016, we renewed the lease through 2023. We also lease our executive headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. We lease and maintain 143 additional terminals, office spaces and other properties located in major cities throughout the United States and Canada. Lease terms for these terminals are typically for three to seven years.  As a result of the Towne acquisition,    we currently have 2 idle facilities that we are still leasing. In addition, we have operations in 25 cities operated by independent agents who handle freight for us on a commission basis.      Item 3.        Legal Proceedings   From time to time, we are a party to ordinary, routine litigation incidental to and arising in the normal course of our business, most of which involve claims for personal injury, property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight, or workers’ compensation. We do not believe that any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Item 4.        Mine Safety Disclosures      Not applicable. Part II Item 6.        Selected Financial Data The following table sets forth our selected financial data.

See additional discussion in Note 1, Accounting Policies to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Our exposure to market risk relates principally to changes in interest rates and fuel prices. Our interest rate exposure relates principally to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility. The revolving credit had  $47.5 million  outstanding at  December 31, 2018  and bear interest at variable rates. However, a hypothetical increase in our credit facility borrowing rate of 150 basis points, or an increase in the total effective interest rate from 3.4% to 4.9%, would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $0.6 million and would have decreased our annual cash flow from operations by approximately $0.6 million.   Our only other debt is capital lease obligations totaling  $0.4 million .  These lease obligations all bear interest at a fixed rate.  Accordingly, there is no exposure to market risk related to these capital lease obligations.   We are exposed to the effects of changes in the price and availability of fuel, as more fully discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Our cash and cash equivalents are also subject to market risk, primarily interest-rate and credit risk.
