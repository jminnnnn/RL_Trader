Item 2.        Properties Properties   Management believes that we have adequate facilities for conducting our business, including properties owned and leased. Management further believes that in the event replacement property is needed, it will be available on terms and at costs substantially similar to the terms and costs experienced by competitors within the transportation industry.   We lease our 37,500 square foot headquarters in Greeneville, Tennessee from the Greeneville-Greene County Airport Authority. The initial lease term ended in 2006, and the lease has two ten-year and one five-year renewal options. During 2007, we renewed the lease through 2016.   We lease a 22,250 square foot facility for our national call center which is also located in Greeneville, Tennesee.  The call center lease was initiated in August 2015 and has an approximate seven year term expiring in June 2022. We own our Columbus, Ohio central sorting facility. The expanded Columbus, Ohio facility is 125,000 square feet with 168 trailer doors. This premier facility can unload, sort and load upwards of 3.7 million pounds in five hours. In addition to the expansion, we process-engineered the freight sorting in the expanded building to improve handling efficiencies. The benefits include reductions in the distance each shipment moves in the building to speed up the transfer process, less handling of freight to further improve service integrity and flexibility to operate multiple sorts at the same time. We also own facilities near Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, Chicago, Illinois and Atlanta, Georgia.  The Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas facility has over 216,000 square feet with 134 trailer doors and approximately 28,000 square feet of office space.  The Chicago, Illinois facility is over 125,000 square feet with 110 trailer doors and over 10,000 square feet of office space.  The Atlanta, Georgia facility is over 142,000 square feet with 118 trailer doors and approximately 12,000 square feet of office space.   We lease and maintain 102 additional terminals, office spaces and other properties located in major cities throughout the United States and Canada. Lease terms for these terminals are typically for three to five years.  As a result of the Towne acquisition,    we currently have 15 idle facilities that we are still leasing.  Our plan is to buyout or sublease these remaining facilities. In addition, we have operations in 27 cities operated by independent agents who handle freight for us on a commission basis.      Item 3.        Legal Proceedings   From time to time, we are a party to ordinary, routine litigation incidental to and arising in the normal course of our business, most of which involve claims for personal injury, property damage related to the transportation and handling of freight, or workers’ compensation. We do not believe that any of these pending actions, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow. Item 6.        Selected Financial Data The following table sets forth our selected financial data. The selected financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report.   Year ended   December 31,   December 31,   December 31,   December 31,   December 31,   2015   2014   2013   2012   2011   (In thousands, except per share data) Income Statement Data:                   Operating revenue $ 959,125   $ 780,959   $ 652,481   $ 584,446   $ 536,402 Income from operations 81,772   96,406   84,355   83,532   77,110 Operating margin (1) 8.5 %   12.3 %   12.9 %   14.3 %   14.4 %                     Net income 55,575   61,169   54,467   52,668   47,199 Net income per share:                      Basic $ 1.80   $ 1.99   $ 1.81   $ 1.82   $ 1.62    Diluted $ 1.78   $ 1.96   $ 1.77   $ 1.78   $ 1.60                     Cash dividends declared per common share $ 0.48   $ 0.48   $ 0.40   $ 0.34   $ 0.28                     Balance Sheet Data (at end of period):                   Total assets $ 700,171   $ 539,309   $ 506,269   $ 399,187   $ 341,151 Long-term obligations, net of current portion 28,856   1,275   3   58   333 Shareholders' equity 510,055   463,563   435,865   351,671   286,902                     (1) Income from operations as a percentage of operating revenue items and a $ 17.6 million  increase in cash collected from accounts receivable.  The increases in cash used for accounts payable is mainly attributable to cash paid to settle trade payables assumed with the Towne acquisition. Favorable amendments to prior year returns and net operating loss carryforwards acquired with Towne and applied to current year earnings increased the income tax receivable, driving a $22.9 million increase in cash used for income taxes. The increase in net earnings after consideration of non-cash items is primarily attributable to the increase in deferred income taxes due to provisions for bonus tax depreciation offset by a decrease in net income. Decrease in net income was driven by Towne transaction and integration costs previously discussed. The increase in cash received from accounts receivables is attributable to the collection of acquired Towne trade receivables.  Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $ 100.9 million  for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with approximately $ 127.7 million  used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014.  Investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of $ 61.9 million  used to acquire Towne and net capital expenditures of $38.8 million primarily for new tractors and trailers to replace aging units.  Investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted primarily of $ 90.2 million  used to acquire CST and RGL and MMT and net capital expenditures of $37.5 million primarily for new trailers, vehicles and forklifts to replace aging units. The proceeds from disposal of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were primarily from sales of older trailers and vehicles. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $ 7.1 million  for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with net cash used in financing activities of $ 49.9 million  for the year ended December 31, 2014.  The $ 57.0 million  change in cash from financing activities was attributable to $125.0 million of proceeds from executing a two year term loan in conjunction with the Towne acquisition partly offset by a $ 91.6 million  increase in payments on debt and capital leases. Additionally, there was a $ 3.6 million  decrease in cash from employee stock transactions and related tax benefits. Payments on debt and capital leases increased as the result of higher debt assumed and settled with the acquisition of Towne as compared to CST. The year ended December 31, 2015 also included $ 20.0 million  used to repurchase shares of our common stock, compared to $ 40.0 million  used to repurchase shares of our common stock for the same period in 2014.    Year Ended December 31, 2014 Cash Flows compared to December 31, 2013 Cash Flows Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $91.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to approximately $90.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.  The $0.9 million increase in cash provided by operating activities is mainly attributable to a $8.9 million increase in net earnings after consideration of non-cash Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Our exposure to market risk relates principally to changes in interest rates and fuel prices. Our interest rate exposure relates principally to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility. The revolving credit and term loan facilities had $83.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2015 and bear interest at variable rates. However, a hypothetical increase in our credit facility borrowing rate of 150 basis points, or an increase in the total effective interest rate from 1.4% to 2.9%, would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $1.0 million and would have decreased our annual cash flow from operations by approximately $1.0 million.     Our only other debt is capital lease obligations totaling $1.4 million.  These lease obligations all bear interest at a fixed rate.  Accordingly, there is no exposure to market risk related to these capital lease obligations.   We are exposed to the effects of changes in the price and availability of diesel fuel, as more fully discussed in Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Our cash and cash equivalents are also subject to market risk, primarily interest-rate and credit risk.
