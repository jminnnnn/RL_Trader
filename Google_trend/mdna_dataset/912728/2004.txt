ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   Introduction         We provide scheduled ground transportation of cargo on a time-definite basis. While we operate as one business unit, we break out our revenue into the following three categories: (1) traditional linehaul revenue, which is the portion of our business that falls within our airport-to-airport network; (2) logistics revenue, which includes dedicated or exclusive use truckload operations; and (3) other accessorial revenue, which primarily consists of fee-based ancillary services performed at the local terminal level.       As a result of our established transportation schedule and network of terminals, our operating cost structure includes significant fixed costs. These fixed costs include amounts paid per mile to owner-operators and other outside carriers to service the airport-to-airport network as well as dedicated logistics operations. Additionally, included are operating lease expenses as well as depreciation expense. Our ability to maintain or enhance our profit margins will depend on a number of variables including, but not limited to: (1) our ability to maintain or improve the amount as well as the price per pound of freight moving through our airport-to-airport network; (2) our ability to maintain or improve the efficiency of our airport-to-airport network; (3) our ability to maintain or improve the productivity at the local terminal level; (4) our ability to locate and lease terminal facilities at or near airports at favorable rates; and (5) our ability to effectively manage our vehicle, workers compensation and health care insurance and costs.  Results of Operations         The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of expense items to operating revenue for the periods indicated. In the accompanying discussion, all percentage figures are as a percent of operating revenue with the exception of growth rates.                                                                                              Year Ended December 31                                         2003         2002         2001                                          Operating revenue              100.0    %              100.0    %              100.0    %       Operating expenses:                                                                        Purchased transportation              42.3                   43.9                   42.9                 Salaries, wages and employee benefits              22.5                   22.3                   22.4                 Operating leases              5.4                   5.4                   5.1                 Depreciation and amortization              3.0                   3.3                   3.7                 Insurance and claims              2.1                   1.7                   3.3                 Other operating expenses              8.1                   8.9                   8.7                                                                        Total operating expenses              83.4                   85.5                   86.1                                                                        Income from operations              16.6                   14.5                   13.9                                                                        Interest expense                                 (0.2    )              (0.1    )       Other income, net              0.3                   0.8                   0.4                                                                        Income before income taxes              16.9                   15.1                   14.2           Income taxes              6.2                   5.5                   5.5                                                                        Net income              10.7    %              9.6    %              8.7    %                                                                  28     Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002        Operating revenue increased by $15.4 million, or 6.8%, to $241.5 million for 2003 from $226.1 million in 2002. This increase resulted from an increase in traditional linehaul revenue of $12.0 million to $204.8 million, an increase in logistics revenue of $0.4 million to $19.5 million and an increase in other accessorial revenue of $3.0 million to $17.2 million. Traditional linehaul revenue was impacted during the year by an increase in average weekly tonnage of 3.2%. We experienced the additional benefit of a 2.9% increase in average revenue per pound, including the effect of fuel surcharge, versus 2002.       Purchased transportation represented 42.3% of operating revenue in 2003 compared to 43.9% in 2002. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily the result of an increase in operating revenue combined with a higher utilization of the airport-to-airport network. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in logistics revenue where purchased transportation costs are traditionally higher as a percent of operating revenue than traditional linehaul purchased transportation costs. For 2003, traditional linehaul and logistics purchased transportation costs represented 40.9% and 70.4%, respectively, of operating revenue versus 42.3% and 69.8%, respectively, during 2002.       Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 22.5% of operating revenue in 2003 compared to 22.3% for 2002. The increase in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was attributed to a 0.2% increase in workers compensation expense compared to last year. While we spent a higher dollar amount on wages and benefits during 2003, the increase in operating revenue offset that amount so that the figure essentially remained flat as a percentage of operating revenue.       Operating leases, the largest component of which is facility rent, were 5.4% of operating revenue in 2003 compared to 5.4% in 2002. During 2003, we undertook leases for additional space in several markets of strategic importance which increased the dollar amount of operating leases. The amount of operating revenue we generated during 2003, however, offset the amount of additional rent expense and kept the amount as a percent of operating revenue constant when compared to 2002.       Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was 3.0% in 2003, compared to 3.3% in 2002. During 2003, certain of our assets became fully depreciated causing both the dollar amount spent and the percent of operating revenue to decline from 2002 to 2003.       Insurance and claims were 2.1% of operating revenue in 2003, compared with 1.7% in 2002. The increase in insurance and claims as a percentage of operating revenue resulted primarily from a 0.4% increase in insurance premiums which was caused by a favorable premium adjustment under a retroactive premium insurance policy during the fourth quarter of 2002. Claims experience during 2003 remained flat when compared to 2002 both in terms of dollar amount and as a percent of operating revenue.  29         Other operating expenses were 8.1% of operating revenue in 2003 compared to 8.9% in 2002. During 2003, our miscellaneous expenses, including bad debt expense, decreased by 0.3% of operating revenue from 2002. Additionally, the amounts paid for other taxes and licenses and fuel decreased by 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, of operating revenue from 2002.       Income from operations increased by $7.5 million, or 22.9%, to $40.2 million for 2003 compared with $32.7 million for 2002. The increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the increase in operating revenue, including fuel surcharge, which was offset by an increase in operating costs associated with operating the network.       Interest expense was $0.1 million, or less than one-tenth of one percent of operating revenue, in 2003, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.2%, for 2002. The decrease in interest expense was the result of the early retirement of debt related to our facility in Columbus, Ohio in December 2002.       Other income, net was $0.6 million, or 0.3% of operating revenue, in 2003, compared to $1.8 million, or 0.8%, for 2002. Other income, net during 2003 consisted primarily of interest income generated by our cash equivalents and investments. While we had a larger amount of cash, cash equivalents, and available-for-sale securities in 2003, we experienced a lower rate of return on those amounts. Other income during 2002 included a $1.3 million settlement paid to us by U.S. Xpress Enterprises, Inc., a $0.4 million gain on the condemnation of a facility we owned in Atlanta and a $0.5 million charge from the early retirement of debt related to our facility in Columbus, Ohio.       The combined federal and state effective tax rate for 2003 was 36.6% compared to a rate of 36.7% for 2002.       As a result of the foregoing factors, net income increased by $4.2 million, or 19.4%, to $25.8 million for 2003, from $21.6 million in 2002.  Year Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001        Operating revenue decreased by $1.4 million, or 0.6%, to $226.1 million for 2002 from $227.5 million in 2001. This decrease resulted from a decrease in traditional linehaul revenue of $4.9 million to $192.9 million, an increase in logistics revenue of $3.8 million to $19.2 million and a decrease in other accessorial revenue of $0.3 million to $14.0 million. Traditional linehaul revenue was impacted during the year by an increase in average weekly tonnage of 0.7%. This was offset by a 3.1% decrease in average revenue per pound, including fuel surcharge, versus 2001.       Purchased transportation represented 43.9% of operating revenue in 2002 compared to 42.9% in 2001. The increase in purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily the result of an increase in logistics revenue where purchased transportation costs are traditionally higher as a percent of operating revenue than traditional linehaul purchased transportation costs. For 2002, traditional linehaul and logistics purchased transportation costs represented 42.3% and 69.8%, respectively, of operating revenue versus 42.2% and 62.9%, respectively, during 2001.  30         Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 22.3% of operating revenue in 2002 compared to 22.4% for 2001. The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was attributed to a 0.3% decrease in incentive payments and a 0.1% decrease in workers compensation insurance and expenses that was offset in part by a 0.3% increase in group insurance expenses.       Operating leases, the largest component of which is facility rent, were 5.4% of operating revenue in 2002 compared to 5.1% in 2001. The increase in operating leases as a percentage of operating revenue between periods was primarily attributable to a 0.2% one-time charge associated with the early termination of a leased facility.       Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was 3.3% in 2002, compared to 3.7% in 2001. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was attributable to a 0.5% decrease in amortization expense as we are no longer amortizing goodwill in accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142. The decrease was offset in part by a 0.1% increase in depreciation associated with new operating equipment and information systems.       Insurance and claims were 1.7% of operating revenue in 2002, compared with 3.3% in 2001. The decrease in insurance and claims as a percentage of operating revenue resulted primarily from a 0.6% favorable premium adjustment under a retroactive premium insurance policy during the fourth quarter of 2002. Additionally, we experienced a 0.3% decrease in claims expense in 2002 versus 2001. These decreases were offset by a 0.3% increase in insurance premiums.       Other operating expenses were 8.9% of operating revenue in 2002 compared to 8.7% in 2001. We experienced a 0.4% decrease in fuel costs paid to owner-operators, which was offset by a 0.4% increase in miscellaneous expenses, including increases in repair and maintenance and owner-operator recruiting and retention expenses.       Income from operations increased by $1.0 million, or 3.2%, to $32.7 million for 2002 compared with $31.7 million for 2001. The increase in income from operations was primarily a result of the decrease in non-transportation costs which was offset in part by an increase in transportation costs associated with transporting freight for customers.       Interest expense was $0.3 million, or 0.2% of operating revenue, in 2002, compared to $0.3 million, or 0.1%, for 2001.       Other income, net was $1.8 million, or 0.8% of operating revenue, in 2002, compared to $0.9 million, or 0.4%, for 2001. The increase in other income, net resulted primarily from a $1.3 million settlement with US Xpress Enterprises, Inc. and a $0.4 million gain on the condemnation of a terminal we owned in Atlanta, Georgia offset in part by a $0.5 million charge from the early retirement of debt related to our facility in Columbus, Ohio. Additionally, we earned lower yields on higher balances in both cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities during 2002 versus 2001.  31         The combined federal and state effective tax rate for 2002 was 36.7% compared to a rate of 38.3% for 2001 primarily as a result of better tax planning at the state level in addition to higher tax-exempt interest income from available-for-sale securities.       As a result of the foregoing factors, net income increased by $1.7 million, or 8.5%, to $21.6 million for 2002, from $19.9 million in 2001.  Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies         Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. As disclosed in Note 1, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts         We evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations to us (for example, bankruptcy filings, accounts turned over for collection or litigation), we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due. Specifically, amounts that are 90 days or more past due are reserved at 50%. If circumstances change (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customers ability to meet its financial obligations to us), the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount. Accounts are written off after all means of collection, including legal action, have been exhausted.  Allowance for Revenue Adjustments         Our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation. These adjustments generally arise: (1) when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes (spot quotes) to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system, (2) when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate, (3) when billing errors occur, and (4) when data entry errors occur. When appropriate, permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system. We monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised or that fraud does not occur. During 2003, average revenue adjustments per month were approximately $141,000, on average revenue per month of $20.3 million (less than 1% of monthly revenue). In order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable, we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying  32    these revenue adjustments. Based on this analysis, we establish an allowance for approximately 60-80 days (dependent upon experience in the last twelve months) of average revenue adjustments, adjusted for rebates and billing errors. The lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience. Additionally, the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors (such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted). Both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity.  Self-Insurance Loss Reserves         Given the nature of our operating environment, we are subject to vehicle, workers compensation and health insurance claims. To mitigate a portion of these risks, we maintain insurance for individual vehicle claims exceeding $500,000 and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding $250,000. The amount of self-insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company-specific and industry data, as well as general economic information. The estimation process for self-insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims. Using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends, management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information. The most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs, the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims, changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date, and expected costs to settle unpaid claims. Management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior years estimation process (referred to as a hindsight analysis) and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis. Additionally, beginning in 2003, we utilized an actuary to evaluate open vehicle liability claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure.  Liquidity and Capital Resources         We have historically financed our working capital needs, including capital purchases, with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $32.7 million for 2003 compared with $30.0 million in 2002.       Net cash provided by investing activities was approximately $14.7 million for 2003 compared with net cash used in investing activities of $0.4 million in 2002. Investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of operating equipment and management information systems, and the proceeds from the sales or maturities of available-for-sale securities during 2003.       Net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately $2.4 million for 2003 compared with net cash used in financing activities of $15.2 million in 2002. Financing activities included the repayment of long-term debt and capital leases, proceeds received from the exercise of stock options and repurchases of our common stock.  33         We expect net capital expenditures in 2004 for operating equipment and management information systems to be approximately $7.0 million. We intend to fund these expenditures through cash currently on our balance sheet, cash provided by operating activities or borrowings under our credit facility, if necessary. The 2004 capital expenditure budget does not include any allocation for acquisitions.       Our credit facility consists of a working capital line of credit. As long as we comply with the financial covenants and ratios, the credit facility permits us to borrow up to $20.0 million less the amount of any outstanding letters of credit. Interest rates for advances under the facility vary based on how our performance measures against covenants related to total indebtedness, cash flows, results of operations and other ratios. The facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.00% to 1.90% and is unsecured. The facilitys expiration was extended until April 2005 by letter agreement entered into in 2003. At December 31, 2003, we had $16.3 million of available borrowing capacity under the line of credit facility and had utilized $3.7 million of availability for outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2003, we were in compliance with the financial covenants and ratios under the credit facility.       On July 25, 2002, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to 2,000,000 shares of our common stock. We expect to fund the repurchases of our common stock from our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities and cash generated from operating activities. As of December 31, 2003, we had repurchased 629,000 shares of our common stock for $12.1 million for an average purchase price of $19.20 per share.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements         At December 31, 2003, we had letters of credit outstanding from a bank totaling $3.7 million required by our workers compensation and vehicle liability insurance providers.  Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments         Our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of December 31, 2003 (in thousands) are summarized below:                                                                                                                  Contractual Obligations         Payment Due Period                                                 Less                                                                                                Than 1         2-3                             After                Total         Year         Years         4-5 Years         5 Years                                                     Capital lease obligations         $    1,482              $    84              $    182              $    178              $    1,038                                                                                                            Operating leases              29,181                   10,032                   13,855                   5,245                   49                                                                                                            Total contractual cash obligations         $    30,663              $    10,116              $    14,037              $    5,423              $    1,087                                                                                                                At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding orders for 150 trailers with a cost of approximately $3.0 million which will be delivered and paid for in 2004.  34         We believe that our available cash, cash expected to be generated from future operations and available borrowings under lines of credit, will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.  Related Party Transactions        Transactions with Landair Transport, Inc.        Scott M. Niswonger, the Chairman of the Board, owns a majority interest in the parent company of Landair Transport, Inc. (Landair). We purchase truckload transportation services from Landair. Matthew J. Jewell, our Senior Vice President and General Counsel, serves in the same capacity with Landair.       Disclosures regarding amounts charged to Landair and amounts charged by Landair to us for various operational and administrative services are set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.       We purchased $0.9 million, $1.6 million and $1.7 million of truckload transportation services from Landair in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which have been included in purchased transportation in the consolidated statements of income.      Transactions with Sky Night, LLC         We purchase air transportation services from Sky Night, LLC (Sky Night), a limited liability corporation owned by Scott M. Niswonger, the Chairman of the Board. Air charter expense totaled $196,000, $264,000 and $269,000 in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, and has been included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In addition, we paid salaries and benefits of $-0-, $-0- and $104,000 for two pilots of Sky Night during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which was included in salaries, wages and benefits in the consolidated statements of income.       During 2001, we entered into an agreement to sublease hangar space at our Greeneville, Tennessee headquarters to Sky Night. The initial term of the sublease was for 12 months and the monthly rental rate was determined based on market prices for similar spaces in the area. The sublease term has been extended through July 2004.  Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements         In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46,  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities . This interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51,  Consolidated Financial Statements , sets forth criteria under which a company must consolidate certain variable interest entities. Interpretation No. 46 places increased emphasis on controlling financial interests when determining if a company should consolidate a variable interest entity. We will adopt the provisions of Interpretation No. 46 during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 as a result of the FASB deferring the effective date of FIN 46 for variable interests held by public  35    companies. We do not anticipate adoption to materially impact the consolidated financial statements.       SFAS No. 150,  Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity , issued in May 2003, is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability (or an asset in some circumstances). Adoption of SFAS No. 150 has not had an impact on our financial position or results of operations.  Forward-Looking Statements         This report contains forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements of current condition and relate to future events or our future financial performance. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of such terms as believes, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, projects or expects. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The following is a list of factors, among others, that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements: economic factors such as recessions, inflation, higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles, our inability to maintain our historical growth rate because of a decreased volume of freight moving through our network or decreased average revenue per pound of freight moving through our network, increasing competition and pricing pressure, surplus inventories, loss of a major customer, the creditworthiness of our customers and their ability to pay for services rendered, our ability to secure terminal facilities in desirable locations at reasonable rates, the inability of our information systems to handle an increased volume of freight moving through our network, changes in fuel prices, claims for property damage, personal injuries or workers compensation, employment matters including rising health care costs, enforcement of and changes in governmental regulations, environmental and tax matters, the handling of hazardous materials, the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner-operators and freight handlers needed to serve our transportation needs and our inability to successfully integrate acquisitions. As a result of the foregoing, no assurance can be given as to future financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.    ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK        Except for capital lease obligations totaling $907,000, we had no long-term debt at December 31, 2003. Accordingly, our exposure to market risk related to remaining outstanding debt is not significant.  36         We are also exposed to changes in interest rates from our available-for-sale investments. As a result of the short-term maturity of the investments we own, a material adverse effect to the fair market value of the investments is unlikely.    ITEM 8.
