The increases in operating revenue for 1997 and 1996 were 21.2% and 6.1%, respectively.           Purchased transportation was 32.1% of operating revenue in 1997 compared to 32.8% in 1996 and 36.1% in 1995. The decrease in purchased transportation as a percentage of operating revenue between these years was primarily attributable to a reduction in the ratio of owner-operators to Company drivers during 1997 and 1996. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, approximately 41.0%, 42.0% and 46.0% of the Company's average tractors in service were contracted through owner-operators.           Salaries, wages and benefits were 28.4% of operating revenue in 1997 compared to 27.6% in 1996 and 25.4% in 1995. The increase as a percentage of operating revenue in 1997 and 1996 were due primarily to higher cargo handling wages and terminal managers' salaries required to operate additional terminals and greater operating volumes in the Company's Forward Air operations combined with an increase in the ratio of Company drivers to owner-operators.                                           12    13            Fuel and fuel taxes were 6.1% of operating revenue in 1997 compared to 6.9% in 1996 and 6.0% in 1995. The decrease in fuel and fuel taxes as a percentage of operating revenue during 1997 resulted from a lower average fuel price per gallon coupled with improvements in the average miles per gallon and average revenue per loaded mile of the Company-operated tractor fleet. The increase in fuel and fuel taxes as a percentage of operating revenue during 1996 was primarily attributed to an increase in fuel prices and an increase in the ratio of Company drivers to owner-operators. Approximately 60.0% of the increase in fuel prices during 1996 was passed on to customers in the form of a fuel surcharge.           Operating leases were 3.4%, 3.8% and 4.0% of operating revenue during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively, while depreciation and amortization were 5.9%, 6.7% and 5.9% during the same periods. The decrease in operating leases as a percentage of operating revenue during 1997 and 1996 resulted from increased ownership, rather than leasing, of revenue equipment. The decrease in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of operating revenue is attributable to substantial improvements in equipment utilization during 1997, partially offset by increased ownership of revenue equipment. The increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of operating revenue during 1996 is attributable to an increase in the ratio of Company drivers to owner-operators and increased ownership of revenue equipment.           Insurance and claims were 5.0% of operating revenue in 1997 compared to 5.3% in 1996 and 4.8% in 1995. The changes in insurance and claims expense during 1997 and 1996 resulted from fluctuations in the frequency and severity of accidents between years coupled with changes in claims development trends and lower premium costs.           Other operating expenses were 10.3% of operating revenue in 1997 compared to 11.0% in 1996 and 10.7% in 1995. The decrease in 1997 as a percentage of operating revenue is attributed to both a reduced operating cost structure and improvements in utilization levels in the Company's Truckload operations. Gains (losses) on the sale of revenue equipment (which are netted against other operating expenses) were $(109,000), $413,000, and $503,000 during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.           Interest expense was $2.6 million in 1997 compared to $3.0 million in 1996 and 1995. The decrease in interest expense during 1997 is due to lower average net borrowing during the period.           Other income (expense), net, includes a loss on the disposal of  non-operating equipment of $276,000, $0 and $0 during 1997, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.           The combined federal and state effective tax rates for 1997, 1996 and 1995 were 39.0%, 38.2% and 42.0%, respectively. For information concerning the provision for income taxes, as well as information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates, see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                           13    14            Forward Air Segment: Operating revenue in the Company's Forward Air operations increased by $24.4 and $17.2 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively, and represented approximately 55.0% and 51.0% of the Company's operating revenue for these periods. Operating revenue increases in the Forward Air operations resulted from increasing the number of operating terminals, enhancements to the Forward Air network and greater volume from domestic and international air cargo customers. The operating revenue increase in 1997 is also partially attributed to the acquisition on October 27, 1997 of the air cargo operating assets of Adams Air Cargo, Inc.           Forward Air income from operations increased by $4.5 and $2.1 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The increase in income from operations resulted from higher operating revenue, which was reduced in part by the incremental costs associated with such revenue. In addition, during the third quarter of 1997, the Forward Air operations benefited from non-recurring revenue that resulted from the United Parcel Service strike. This additional revenue, net of variable costs, resulted in an estimated additional $1.2 million of income from operations.           Truckload Segment: Operating revenue in the Company's Truckload operations, including intersegment revenue, increased (decreased) by $9.6 and $(6.0) million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. Operating revenue increases (decreases) in the Truckload operations resulted primarily from fluctuations in equipment utilization and yield. During 1997, 1996 and 1995, the Truckload operations utilized average tractors of 699, 695 and 685, respectively.           Truckload income from operations increased (decreased) by $2.9 and $(3.3) million in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The increase in income from operations in 1997 was due mainly to a lower operating cost ratio resulting from an increase in equipment utilization and yield during the year. The decrease in income from operations in 1996 was due primarily to a higher operating ratio resulting from a decrease in equipment utilization and yield during the year. In addition, during the third quarter of 1997, the Truckload operations benefited from non-recurring revenue generated from the United Parcel Service strike. This additional revenue, net of variable costs, resulted in an estimated additional $200,000 of income from operations.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           The continued growth of the Company's business, and the nature of its operations, have required significant investment in new equipment. The Company has historically financed revenue equipment purchases with cash flows from operations, through borrowing under credit agreements with financial institutions and from proceeds of the initial public offering in November 1993. Working capital needs have generally been met with cash flows from operations and borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $22.6, $12.5 and $15.8 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.           Net cash used in investment activities was approximately $19.0, $6.0 and $21.5 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. Investing activities consisted primarily of the acquisition of additional revenue equipment and enhanced management information systems during 1997,                                            14    15  1996 and 1995, the acquisition of a business in 1997 and the acquisition of a terminal facility in 1996.           Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was approximately $(2.9), $(10.3) and $8.6 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. These financing activities included the Company's continued financing of additional revenue equipment, based upon capital expenditure requirements, coupled with repayment of long-term debt and capital leases with cash generated from operations.           The Company expects net capital expenditures in 1998 for revenue equipment and management information systems, excluding acquisitions, to be less than $25 million. The Company expects to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning credit arrangements. At December 31, 1997, the Company had a line of credit with a bank in the amount of $15.0 million, which expires in May 1999. At December 31, 1997, approximately $4.7 million was available for borrowing under the credit line. At December 31, 1997, the Company also had equipment loan agreements which permit the Company to borrow up to $30.0 million for the purchase of revenue equipment. At December 31, 1997, approximately $15.9 million was available for borrowing under the equipment loan agreements. Management believes that available borrowings under the line of credit agreement, equipment loan agreements, future borrowings under installment notes for revenue equipment, and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to fund its cash needs and anticipated capital expenditures through at least 1998.  IMPACT OF INFLATION           Inflation has not had a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition during the past three years. However, inflation higher than experienced during the past three years could have an adverse effect on the Company's future results.  IMPACT OF YEAR 2000           Some of the Company's older computer programs and systems were written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. As a result, those computer programs have time-sensitive software that recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could cause a system failure or miscalculations causing disruptions of operations, including, among other things, a temporary inability to process transactions, send invoices, or engage in similar normal business activities.           The Company has been in the process of replacing the majority of its key financial and operational systems as a part of upgrading its legacy systems in the normal course of business. This replacement has been a planned approach for the last two years to enhance or better meet its functional business and operational requirements. Management believes that this program will substantially meet or address its Year 2000 issues. In addition to its replacement program, the Company will require modifying some of its software and hardware so that its computer systems                                            15    16  will function properly with respect to dates in the year 2000 and thereafter. The estimated cost of the remaining replacement and modification for the Year 2000 issue is not considered material to the Company's earnings or financial position.           The Company also plans to initiate a formal communication process with all its significant suppliers and large customers to determine the extent to which the Company's interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties' failure to remediate their own Year 2000 issues. There is no guarantee that the systems of other companies on which the Company's systems rely will be timely converted and would not have an adverse effect on the Company's system.           The project is estimated to be completed not later than December 31, 1998, which is prior to any anticipated impact on its operating systems. The Company believes that with modifications to existing software and hardware and conversions to new software, the Year 2000 issue will not pose significant operational problems for its computer systems. However, if such modifications and conversions are not made, or are not completed timely, the Year 2000 issue could have a material impact on the operations of the Company.  IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS           In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income. The Statement is effective for the Company beginning in 1998, and establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components. The Statement requires that all items that are income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company does not expect the effect of adoption of Statement 130 to be material to the consolidated financial statements.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS           The Company, or its executive officers and directors on behalf of the Company, may from time to time make written or oral "forward-looking statements". Written forward-looking statements may appear in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), in press releases and in reports to shareholders. Oral forward-looking statements may be made by the Company's executive officers and directors on behalf of the Company to the press, potential investors, securities analysts and others. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 contains a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. The Company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures. In connection with this "safe harbor" provision, the Company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of the Company. Without limitation, factors that might cause such a difference include economic factors such as recessions, downturns in customer business cycles, competition, surplus inventories, inflation, the loss of a major customer, fuel price increases, higher interest rates, the resale value of the Company's used equipment and the availability and compensation of qualified drivers. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.                                          16     17        ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
