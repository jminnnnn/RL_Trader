ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL           CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION           The Company provides scheduled ground transportation of cargo on a time-definite basis. As a result of the Company's established transportation schedule and network of terminals, its operating cost structure includes significant fixed costs. The Company's ability to improve its operating margins will depend on its ability to increase the volume of freight moved through its network.           The following does not include a discussion and analysis of the truckload carrier business, which has been accounted for as a discontinued operation as a result of the Spin-off.  Results of Operations           The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of expense items to operating revenue for the periods indicated.   \                                                                                Year Ended December 31                                                           -----------------------------------------------------------------                                                                 2000                     1999                    1998                                                           ----------------         ----------------         ---------------        Operating revenue                                                   100.0%                   100.0%                  100.0% Operating expenses:      Purchased transportation                                         42.5                     43.8                    43.2      Salaries, wages and employee benefits                            22.0                     22.4                    23.9      Operating leases                                                  4.7                      5.2                     5.3      Depreciation and amortization                                     2.7                      2.9                     3.3      Insurance and claims                                              1.7                      1.2                     1.8      Other operating expenses                                          9.0                      9.0                    10.2                                                           ----------------         ----------------         --------------- Total operating expenses                                              82.6                     84.5                    87.7                                                           ----------------         ----------------         --------------- Income from operations                                                17.4                     15.5                    12.3                                                           ----------------         ----------------         --------------- Interest expense                                                        --                    (0.5)                   (0.9) Other income, net                                                      0.3                      0.2                      --                                                           ----------------         ----------------         --------------- Income from continuing operations before    income taxes                                                       17.7                     15.2                    11.4 Income taxes                                                           6.8                      5.8                     4.4                                                           ----------------         ----------------         --------------- Income from continuing operations                                    10.9%                     9.4%                    7.0%                                                           ================         ================         ===============   Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1999          Operating revenue increased by $44.1 million, or 25.8%, to $214.9 million for 2000 from $170.8 million in 1999. This increase resulted primarily from increased volume from domestic and international air cargo customers, an increased number of operating terminals and direct shuttles, and enhanced logistics services.                                          18    19           Purchased transportation was 42.5% of operating revenue in 2000 compared to 43.8% in 1999. The decrease in purchased transportation was primarily attributable to operating efficiencies resulting from increased volumes of freight transported through the Forward Air network.          Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 22.0% of operating revenue in 2000 compared to 22.4% in 1999. The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was due primarily to operating efficiencies resulting from increased volumes of freight transported through the Forward Air network.          Operating leases, the largest component of which is terminal rent, were 4.7% of operating revenue in 2000 compared to 5.2% in 1999. This decrease in operating leases as a percentage of revenue was attributable to increased leverage resulting from increased operating revenue.          Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was 2.7% in 2000, compared to 2.9% in 1999. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was attributable to increased utilization of operating equipment during 2000 as a result of increased operating revenue.          Insurance and claims as a percentage of revenue was 1.7% of operating revenue in 2000, compared with 1.2% in 1999. This increase in insurance and claims expense as a percentage of revenue was due primarily to an increase in the frequency and severity of accidents and higher premium costs during 2000.          Other operating expenses were 9.0% of operating revenue in 2000 and 1999.          Income from operations increased by $10.9 million, or 41.3%, to $37.3 million for 2000 compared to $26.4 million for 1999. This increase in income from operations is due primarily to a lower operating cost structure resulting from an increase in operating revenue, which allowed the Company to spread the fixed costs of its network over a larger revenue base. The increase in income from operations during 2000 was partially offset by operating losses of approximately $1.6 million relating to the Company's information technology subsidiary, LogTech Corporation. In 2001, the Company plans to wind-down the LogTech operations and begin offering its information technology services to its existing customer base. The wind-down of LogTech operations will result in an additional estimated $350,000, or $.01 per share, of operating losses during the first quarter of 2001.          Interest expense was $107,000 in 2000 compared to $787,000, or 0.5% of revenue, in 1999. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower average net borrowings during 2000 coupled with the capitalization of interest costs totaling $301,000 during 2000 relating to the development of internal-use software.          The combined federal and state effective tax rate for 2000 was 38.2%, compared to a rate of 38.3% for 1999. For information concerning income taxes, as well as information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.                                          19    20           As a result of the foregoing factors, income from continuing operations increased by $7.4 million, or 46.3%, to $23.4 million for 2000, from $16.0 million in 1999.  Year Ended December 31, 1999 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 1998           Operating revenue increased by $40.4 million, or 31.0%, to $170.8 million for 1999 from $130.4 million in 1998. This increase resulted primarily from increased volume from domestic and international air cargo customers, an increased number of operating terminals and direct shuttles, and enhanced logistics services.           Purchased transportation was 43.8% of operating revenue in 1999 compared to 43.2% in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenue from exclusive use transportation services which have a higher purchased transportation percentage than freight transported through the Forward Air network. The increase in purchased transportation was partially offset by operating efficiencies resulting from increased volumes of freight transported through the Forward Air network.           Salaries, wages and employee benefits were 22.4% of operating revenue in 1999 compared to 23.9% in 1998. The decrease in salaries, wages and employee benefits as a percentage of operating revenue was due primarily to operating efficiencies resulting from increased volumes of freight transported through the Forward Air network coupled with a reduction in the number of Company drivers which were hired initially as a part of the acquisition of certain of the assets of Adams Air Cargo, Inc. in October 1997.           Operating leases, the largest component of which is terminal rent, were 5.2% of operating revenue in 1999 compared to 5.3% in 1998. This decrease was attributable to increased leverage resulting from increased operating revenue.           Depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of operating revenue was 2.9% in 1999, compared to 3.3% in 1998. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was attributable to increased utilization of operating equipment during 1999 as a result of increased operating revenue.           Insurance and claims as a percentage of revenue was 1.2% of operating revenue in 1999, compared with 1.8% in 1998. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in the frequency and severity of accidents and lower premium costs during 1999.           Other operating expenses were 9.0% of operating revenue in 1999 compared to 10.2% in 1998. The decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue was primarily attributable to a lower operating cost structure due to increased operating revenue and a reduction in commissions paid to agent terminals.           Income from operations increased by $10.4 million, or 65.0%, to $26.4 million for 1999 compared to $16.0 million for 1998. This increase in income from operations is due primarily                                          20    21  to a lower operating cost structure resulting from an increase in operating revenue, which allowed the Company to spread the fixed costs of its network over a larger revenue base.           Interest expense was $787,000, or 0.5%, of operating revenue in 1999, compared to $1.2 million, or 0.9%, in 1998. The decrease in interest expense was due to lower average net borrowing during 1999 coupled with the capitalization of interest costs totaling $71,000 during 1999 relating to the development of internal-use software.           The combined federal and state effective tax rate for 1999 was 38.3%, compared to a rate of 38.1% for 1998. For information concerning income taxes, as well as information regarding differences between effective tax rates and statutory rates, see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.           As a result of the foregoing factors, income from continuing operations increased by $6.8 million, or 73.9%, to $16.0 million for 1999, from $9.2 million in 1998.  Liquidity and Capital Resources           Prior to the Spin-off in September 1998, the Company operated its business and the truckload carrier business of Landair Corporation. As a result, the Company's statement of cash flows for 1998 does not reflect the cash flows of its business on a stand-alone basis.           The Company has historically financed its working capital needs, including capital purchases, with cash flows from operations and borrowings under its bank lines of credit. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately $33.8 million for 2000, $20.1 million for 1999 and $1.9 million for 1998. The increases in net cash provided by operating activities in 2000 and 1999 are mainly attributable to growth and improvements in results of operations.           Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $26.9 million in 2000, $13.4 million in 1999 and $17.0 million in 1998. Investing activities consisted primarily of acquisitions in 2000 and 1999 and the $5.0 million capital contribution to Landair Corporation in 1998, along with the purchase of operating equipment and management information systems during all three years.           Net cash provided by financing activities was $2.6 million and $14.6 million in 2000 and 1998, respectively, compared to cash used in financing activities of $1.2 million in 1999. Financing activities included the continued financing of operating equipment and working capital needs, repayment of long-term debt and capital leases, proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, Common Stock issued under the Company's employee stock purchase plan, and Common Stock issued from a public offering.           On May 4, 1999, 1.5 million shares of the Common Stock of the Company were sold under a Form S-3 Registration Statement dated April 23, 1999. The net proceeds of the offering were $18.0 million and were used principally to repay outstanding debt.                                          21    22           The Company expects net capital expenditures in 2001 for operating equipment and management information systems, excluding acquisitions, to be less than $5 million. The Company expects to fund these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its credit facility.           The credit facility consists of a working capital line of credit. As long as the Company complies with several financial covenants and ratios, the credit facility permits it to borrow up to $20.0 million. Interest rates for advances under the facilities vary based on covenants related to total indebtedness, cash flows, results of operations and other ratios. The facility bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.00% to 1.90%, expires in April 2002 and is secured by accounts receivable. The amount the Company can borrow under the line of credit is reduced by the amount of any outstanding letters of credit.           Management believes that the Company's available cash, expected cash generated from future operations and borrowings under available lines of credit, will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months.           On February 24, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock split which was distributed on March 19, 1999. On January 10, 2000, the Board of Directors approved a three-for-two stock split which was distributed on January 28, 2000. All share, earnings per share, dividends per share, and quarterly stock price data included herein and in the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto have been restated to give effect to the stock splits.  Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements           In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133, as amended, is required to be adopted by the Company in 2001. Management does not anticipate that the adoption of the Statement will have a significant effect on the financial position or results of operations of the Company.  Forward-Looking Statements           The Company, or its officers and directors on behalf of the Company, may from time to time make written or oral "forward-looking statements." Written forward-looking statements may appear in documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"), in press releases and in reports to shareholders. Oral forward-looking statements may be made by the Company's officers and directors on behalf of the Company to the press, potential investors, securities analysts and others. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 contains a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. The Company relies on this safe harbor in making such disclosures. In connection with this safe harbor provision, the Company is hereby identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement made by or on behalf of the Company. Without limitation, factors that might cause such a difference include economic factors such as recessions, inflation, higher interest rates and downturns in customer business cycles, the Company's inability                                          22    23  to maintain its historical growth rate due to a decreased volume of freight moving through the Company's network, competition, surplus inventories, loss of a major customer, the ability of the Company's information systems to handle increased volume of freight moving through its network, and the availability and compensation of qualified independent owner-operators to serve the Company's transportation needs. The Company disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK           On May 4, 1999, the Company sold 1.5 million shares of Common Stock in a public offering. The net proceeds of $18.0 million were used principally to repay outstanding debt. With this repayment, the Company's exposure to market risk related to its remaining outstanding debt is not significant.   ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
