ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS.           The following should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this document.  GENERAL           The Company generates revenues primarily through sales of OTC drugs and prescription pharmaceutical products, health and beauty aids, food and beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting cards, photofinishing, photo supplies and seasonal merchandise. Health and beauty products, including OTC drugs, represent the largest of the Company's product categories. The Company's primary costs and expenses consist of (i) inventory costs, (ii) labor expenses and (iii) occupancy costs.           In 1994 and 1995, the Company experienced rapid expansion, growing from 40 stores to 59 stores. However, as a result of liquidity constraints and the need for improved inventory controls, the Company was forced to suspend its store expansion program in late 1995. In early 1996, a strengthened management team led by Anthony Cuti, the Company's new Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, took several measures to improve operations such as decreasing out-of stock occurrences, creating a loss prevention function to control inventory shrink and continuing to invest in MIS.           The Company had sales per square foot of $956 and $1,010 in fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1997, respectively. The Company believes that sales per square foot are a useful measure of comparing the Company's performance to that of its competitors because it is a measure of a store's sales productivity. The Company experienced a decline in sales per square foot from 1993 through 1995 as a result of the opening of additional stores in connection with the Company's expansion plans during that period. The opening of such additional stores resulted in a decline in sales per square foot principally because (i) the average square footage for the new stores was greater than that of the existing store base and (ii) new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales. The Company currently expects that its sales per square foot may decline as it embarks on its plan to increase new store openings during 1998 and 1999. The Company believes that its competitors in the industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar reasons.           In 1997, the Company resumed its store expansion program, opening seven stores. Generally a new Duane Reade store requires an investment of approximately $1.1 million in capital expenditures and working capital. Since 1993, all of the Company's new stores have become profitable on an operating basis within the first full year of operation. Over the next two years, the Company plans to open approximately 30 to 40 stores, primarily in New York City.           Over the past two years, Third Party Plans, including managed care providers and insurance companies, have comprised an increasing percentage of the Company's pharmacy business as the health care industry shifts to managed care. While sales to customers covered by                                         -17-   Third Party Plans results in lower gross profit rates due to competitive pricing, the Company believes that such lower rates are offset by increased volume of pharmacy sales and the opportunity to leverage fixed expenses.           The Company includes stores that have been in operation for at least 13 months for purposes of calculating comparable store sales figures.           The Company's predecessor was founded in 1960. In 1992, Bain Capital formed the Company to acquire the Company's predecessor from its founders through a leveraged buyout, financed primarily with the proceeds from the Zero Coupon Notes and the Senior Notes. In June 1997, investment funds affiliated with DLJMBPII (the "DLJMB Entities"), an affiliate of DLJ, acquired approximately 91.5% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company from Bain Capital and certain other selling securityholders, for approximately $78.7 million in cash, pursuant to a Recapitalization Agreement, dated June 18, 1997 (the "Recapitalization Agreement"). Upon consummation of such purchase, the Company reclassified all of its outstanding capital stock (then consisting of four classes) into one class of common stock, $0.01 par value per share.           Prior to the consummation of the Offering in February 1998, the Company's primary asset was all of the outstanding common stock of Daboco, Inc., a New York corporation ("Daboco"), with Daboco and DRI I, Inc. ("DRI"), a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Daboco, together owning all of the outstanding partnership interest of Duane Reade, a New York general partnership ("Duane Reade") (Daboco owns a 99% partnership interest and DRI owns the remaining 1% partnership interest). Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted through Duane Reade. Concurrently with the consummation of the Offering, Daboco was merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"), resulting in the Company directly owning 99% of the partnership interests of Duane Reade (the "Partnership Interests") and DRI continuing to own a 1% partnership interest. Following the consummation of the Merger, the primary assets of the Company are the Partnership Interest and 100% of the outstanding common stock of DRI.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           The following sets forth the results of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.

The increase was attributable to increased comparable store sales of 7.6% and the inclusion of one new store opened during 1996 for the entire 1997 period and seven new stores opened in 1997.           Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 75.0% for 1997 from 75.6% for 1996, resulting in an increase in gross profit margin to 25.0% for 1997 from 24.4% during 1996. The increase in gross margin resulted from a number of factors including (i) increased contribution from the sale of higher margin merchandise such as cosmetics, vitamins, general merchandise, generic drugs and private label products, (ii) higher promotional allowances received from venders and (iii) occupancy costs that increased at a lesser rate than the rate at which sales increased.                  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $65.4 million or 15.2% of net sales and $59.0 million or 15.5% of net sales in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The percentage decrease in 1997 compared to 1996 resulted principally from lower general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales including the elimination of agreements requiring the annual payment of $1.0 million in management fees to Bain Capital, partially offset by higher selling expenses related to higher store salaries as a percentage of net sales (principally from new stores during the early months of operation). The Company believes, that as the Company's new stores mature, salaries will increase at a lesser rate than store sales.                    Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1997 and 1996 was $5.3 million and $16.2 million, respectively. The decrease in amortization is principally a result of the completion in 1996 of amortization of covenants not to compete and the related write-off of the balance of such amounts during the fourth quarter of 1996.                    Depreciation was $3.5 million and $3.0 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively.                    Store pre-opening expenses increased to $0.8 million in 1997 from $0.1 in 1996 due to the opening of seven new store locations in 1997 compared to one in 1996.                    Net interest expense was $34.5 million in 1997 compared to $32.4 million in 1996. The increase in interest expense was principally due to (i) higher non-cash accretion of the Zero Coupon Notes, (ii) interest related to financing of third party accounts receivable and (iii) increased interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, partially offset by (a) reduced interest on term loan borrowings caused by the decrease in average balance from $72.0 million for 1996 to $67.4 million for 1997 and a decrease in the average interest rate from 9.1% to 8.7% and (b) reduced interest on capital lease obligations.                                       -19-                     The net loss for the Company decreased by $3.2 million from $17.9 million in 1996 to $14.7 million in 1997 primarily as a result of an increase in sales and gross profit margin and a reduction in amortization expense, partially offset by nonrecurring charges (see Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's EBITDA improved by $7.8 million or 22.0% to $43.1 million in 1997 compared to $35.3 million in 1996. EBITDA as a percentage of sales increased to 10.0% in 1997 from 9.3% in 1996.       FISCAL 1996 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1995                    Net sales in 1996 were $381.5 million, an increase of 13.2% over 1995 net sales of $336.9 million. The increase was due to increased comparable store sales of 8.3% and the inclusion of eight stores opened during 1995 for the entire 1996 period and of one store opened in 1996. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to increased pharmacy sales, which increased to 21.8% of total sales in 1996 compared to 19.0% of total sales in 1995.                    Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 75.6% for 1996 from 77.1% for 1995, resulting in an increase in gross profit margin to 24.4% for 1996 from 22.9% for 1995. The increase in gross margin resulted from a number of factors including (i) lower inventory shrink losses, (ii) increased contribution from the sale of generic drugs and private label products, (iii) less promotional activity and (iv) lower rent-to-sales ratios  in stores opened during 1995 and 1994. The increases were partially offset by lower gross margins resulting from sales to customers covered by Third Party Plans.                    Selling, general and administrative expenses were $59.0 million or 15.5% of net sales and $50.3 million or 14.9% of net sales in 1996 and 1995, respectively. The percentage increase in 1996 compared to 1995 resulted principally from higher administrative expenses, including (i) operating costs related to the Company's management information systems department, (ii) administrative salaries and one time executive search and severance expenses and (iii) professional and consulting fees principally for the warehouse and loss prevention areas. The increases were partially offset by lower store operating expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily due to a higher volume of pharmacy sales, which allows the Company to leverage other fixed store operating expenses.                    Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1995 and 1996 was $11.6 million and $16.2 million, respectively. The increase in amortization was caused by an increase in the amortization of covenants not to compete from $8.1 million in 1995 to $11.4 million in 1996 and amortization of systems installation and integration costs in an amount of $1.4 million in 1996. The increase in amortization of covenants not to compete was caused by the write-off of the balance of such intangibles in 1996 resulting from the termination of the related agreements. Amortization of systems installation and integration costs began in 1996.                    The increase in depreciation from $1.9 million in 1995 to $3.0 million in 1996 resulted principally from (i) depreciation of data processing equipment which began in 1996 and (ii) a full year's depreciation in 1996 of assets of eight stores that were opened in 1995.                                       -20-                     Store pre-opening expenses decreased from $1.1 million in 1995 to $0.1 million in 1996 due to the opening of one new store in 1996  compared to eight in 1995.                    Net interest expense increased 7.2% to $32.4 million in 1996 from $30.2 million in 1995. The increase in interest expense was principally due to the higher non-cash accretion of the Zero Coupon Notes offset, in part, by reduced interest on term loan borrowings resulting from the decrease in average outstanding balance from $75.1 million to $72.0 million and a decrease in the average interest rate from 9.5% to 9.1%.                    The net loss for the Company decreased by $0.2 million or 1.1% from $18.1 million in 1995 to $17.9 million in 1996 primarily as a result of increased sales and gross profit margin offset, in part, by increases in selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangibles. The Company's EBITDA increased by $7.9 million or 28.6% to $35.3 million in 1996 compared to $27.4 million in 1995. EBITDA as a percentage of sales increased to 9.3% in 1996 from 8.2% in 1995.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES                    On September 30, 1997, the Company entered into the Old Credit Agreement, which provided for, among other things, $65.5 million of term loans and up to $30.0 million of revolving loans. As of December 27, 1997, outstanding balances thereunder totaled $89.8 million. The Company utilizes cash flow from operations, together with borrowings under the revolving portion of the Old Credit Agreement, to fund working capital needs, investing activities (consisting primarily of capital expenditures) and financing activities (normal debt service requirements, interest payments and repayment of term and revolving loans outstanding).                    In February 1998, the Company successfully completed an initial public offering of its stock which was part of a plan to refinance all of the Company's existing indebtedness (the "Refinancing Plan") in order to enhance the Company's financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and implement capital improvements. The Refinancing Plan resulted in a reduction in the Company's overall indebtedness, a simplification of the Company's capital structure and access to additional borrowings. The principal components of the Refinancing Plan were; (i) the sale by the Company of 6.7 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $102 million; (ii) the execution of a new secured credit agreement (the "Existing Credit Agreement") which provides for borrowings up to approximately $160 million ($130 million of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans); (iii) the issuance of $80 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Notes") for net proceeds of approximately  $77 million; (iv) the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the  Old Credit Agreement, the outstanding principal amount of which was  $89.8 million as of December 27, 1997; (v) the redemption of the Company's outstanding Zero Coupon Notes; (vi) the redemption of the Company's outstanding 12% Senior Notes due 2002; and the (vii) Merger of Daboco with and into the Company. The Company believes the Refinancing Plan will result in a reduction in overall interest expense because total interest expense associated with the Existing Credit Agreement and the New Senior                                         -21-   Subordinated Notes will be less than the total interest expense associated with the 12% Senior Notes due 2002 and the Zero Coupon Notes. The interest rates under the Existing Credit Agreement will be approximately the same as interest rates under the Old Existing Credit Agreement.                    Working capital was $37.5 million and $9.9 million as of December 27, 1997 and December 28, 1996, respectively The increase is primarily due to the Company's investing in forward-buy inventory and increases in inventory related to the opening of additional stores in the first quarter or 1998. The Company's capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores and from the continuing development of new MIS. The Company's ability to open stores in 1996 was limited to a certain degree by liquidity considerations. The Company believes that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plans to open 30 to 40 stores in the next two years. The Company expects to spend approximately $16 million in 1998 on capital expenditures primarily for new and replacement stores. Working capital is also required to support inventory for the Company's existing stores. Historically, the Company has been able to lease its store locations The Company has experienced a significant increase in accounts receivable due to increased pharmacy sales in connection with Third Party Plans, as compared to non-Third Party Plan sales which are generally paid by cash or credit card. However, the Company believes that it has adequately provided for liquidity by entering into a non-recourse factoring arrangement whereby the Company resells accounts receivable associated with Third Party Plans.                    For the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996, net cash provided by operating activities was $12.6 million, compared to $6.7 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 1995. The primary reasons for this increase relate to an increase in operating earnings before the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and interest expenses, partially offset by a decrease in working capital primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable. For the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996, net cash used in investing activities was $3.8 million, compared to $12.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 30,1995. This reduction primarily resulted form a decrease in capital expenditures and decreases in systems development costs. For the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996, net cash used in financing activities was $10.7 million, compared to $4.8 million provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended December 30, 1995. This reduction primarily resulted from decreased borrowings under the Company's then existing credit facility and a decrease in capital lease financing.                    For the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997, net cash used in operating activities was $3.8 million, compared to $12.6 million provided by operating activities during the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996. The primary reasons for this decrease are (i) an increase in inventory and (ii) an increase in accounts receivable due to increased pharmacy sales in connection with Third Party Plans. The Company's significant increase in inventory resulted from management's decision to take advantage of a number of forward purchasing opportunities, accumulate inventory in advance of additional store openings and seasonal inventory buildup during 1997. The Company believes that the activities did not and will not materially adversely affect its liquidity. For the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997, net cash used in investing                                       -22-   activities was $12.4 million, compared to $3.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996. This increase primarily resulted from an increase in capital expenditures during 1997 partially offset by a decrease in systems development costs. For the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997, net cash provided by financing activities was $16.2 million, compared to $10.7 million used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended December 28, 1996. This increase primarily resulted from borrowings under the Old Credit Agreement  which provided for a term loan of $65.5 million and borrowings of  $24.5 million on a revolving credit facility of $30 million. These proceeds  were used to repay the outstanding term loan balance of $69.5 million and  the revolving loan balance of $2.5 million.                    Leases for seven of the Company's stores that generated approximately 10.7% of the Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997 are scheduled to expire before the end of the year 2000. The Company believes that it will be able to renew such leases on economically favorable terms or, alternatively, find other economically attractive locations to lease.                    As of December 27, 1997, approximately 1,800 of the Company's approximately 2,000 employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of such collectively bargaining agreements, the Company is required to pay certain annual increases in salary and benefits to such employees. The Company does not believe that such increases will have a material impact on the Company's liquidity or results of operations.                    Following the implementation of the Refinancing Plan, the Company believes that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement, will be  adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of  principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated  capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the  terms of its debt agreements. The ability of the Company to meet its debt  service obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's operating results, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of its indebtedness in the future. Substantially all of the Company's borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates; therefore, the Company's financial condition will be affected by the changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company expects to enter into interest rate protection agreements to minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.  TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES                                       -23-                     At December 27, 1997, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") of approximately $71.0 million, which are due to expire in the years 2007 through 2012. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through 2012 and thereby reduce or eliminate the Company's federal income taxes otherwise payable. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Code (the "Section 382 Limitation"). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation's stock immediately before an ownership change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership (by value) of that corporation by one or more 5% shareholders (including certain groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5% of that corporation's stock) exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. The Recapitalization caused the Company to experience an ownership change. As a result, the Company currently is subject to an annual Section 382 Limitation of approximately $5.0 million on the amount of NOLs generated prior to the Recapitalization that the Company may utilize to offset future taxable income. In addition, the Company believes that it will generate approximately $42.0 million of NOLs in connection with the Refinancing Plan. Such NOLs will not be subject to the Section 382 Limitation and may be utilized to offset future taxable income. However, there can be no assurance that any NOLs will be able to be utilized by the Company to offset future taxable income or that such NOLs will not become subject to limitation due to future ownership changes  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE                    The Company has several computer software systems which will require modification or upgrading to accommodate the year 2000 and thereafter. The Company believes that all systems can be changed by the end of 1999 and does not expect the cost of the changes to be material to the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  SEASONALITY                    In general, sales of drugstores items such as prescription drugs, OTC drugs and health and beauty care products exhibit limited seasonality in the aggregate, but do vary by product category. Quarterly results are primarily affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale of seasonable products. In view of the Company's recent expansion of seasonal merchandising, the Company expects slightly greater revenue sensitivity relating to seasonality in the future.  INFLATION                    The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on results of operations for the Company during the three years ended December 27 1997.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS                                       -24-                     In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 128, "Earnings per Share," which requires the presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share in a company's financial statements for reporting periods ending subsequent to December 15, 1997. As of December 27,  1997, there were outstanding options to purchase an aggregate of 1.65 million shares of Common Stock, which shares are not included in the  calculation of earnings per share for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 1997  and would not be included in such calculation under the guidance prescribed  by SFAS No. 128 because of the anit-dilutive nature of these instruments.
