ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS      The following should be read in connection with all consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this report.  GENERAL      We generate revenues primarily through sales of OTC drugs and prescription pharmaceutical products, health and beautycare products, food and beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting cards, photofinishing, photo supplies and seasonal merchandise. Health and beauty care products, including OTC drugs, represent our largest product categories. Our primary costs and expenses are (1) inventory costs, (2) labor expenses and (3) occupancy costs.      We have sales per square foot of $847 in fiscal 2000 and $813 in fiscal 1999. We believe that sales per square foot is a useful measure of comparing our performance to that of our competitors because it is a measure of a store's sales productivity. We currently expect that our sales per square foot may decline as we continue with our plan to increase new store openings during fiscal 2001. The opening of these                                         12  additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally because (1) the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than that of the existing store base and (2) new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales. We believe that our competitors in the industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar reasons. Over the next two years, we plan to open 50 to 60 stores, of which approximately two-thirds will be located outside of our primary market of Manhattan, NYC.      On September 11, 1998, we purchased substantially all of the operating assets, including inventory and leases, of Rock Bottom Stores, Inc., a drugstore chain of 38 stores operating primarily in the outer boroughs of New York City. We currently operate 29 of these stores, having sold or closed the remaining nine.      Our primary assets are our ownership of 99% of the outstanding partnership interest of Duane Reade, a New York general partnership, and ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of DRI I Inc. DRI I Inc. owns the remaining 1% partnership interest in Duane Reade. Substantially all of our operations are conducted through Duane Reade. In August 1999, we established two new subsidiaries, Duane Reade International and Duane Reade Realty. Duane Reade distributed to Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc. all rights, title, and interest in all its trademarks, trade names and all other intellectual property rights. In turn, Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc. made a capital contribution of these intellectual property rights to Duane Reade International. This change created a controlled system to manage these intellectual property rights separate and apart from the retail operations. In addition, Duane Reade distributed some of its store leases to Duane Reade Inc. and DRI I Inc., which in turn made a capital contribution of these leases to Duane Reade Realty. Duane Reade Realty is the lessee under certain store leases entered into after its creation. Duane Reade Realty subleases to Duane Reade the properties subject to those leases.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following sets forth the results of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.                                                               2000          1999          1998                                                          --------      --------      --------        Net sales..........................................       100.0 %       100.0%        100.0% Cost of sales......................................        74.6          74.0          73.4                                                           -----         -----         ----- Gross profit.......................................        25.4          26.0          26.6 Selling, general & administrative expenses.........        15.6          16.2          16.1 Depreciation and amortization......................         2.3           2.6           2.4 Store pre-opening expenses.........................         0.1           0.2           0.5                                                           -----         -----         ----- Operating income...................................         7.4           7.0           7.6 Net interest expense...............................         3.6           3.5           4.4                                                           -----         -----         ----- Income before income taxes.........................         3.8           3.5           3.2 Income tax benefit (expense).......................

On a comparable 52-week basis, net sales in 2000 increased 17.0% over the same period in 1999. The increase was due to increased comparable store sales of 7.3% and the inclusion of 21 stores opened during 1999 for the entire 2000 period and 23 net new stores opened in 2000. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to improved pharmacy sales, which increased to 35.4% of total sales in 2000 compared to 31.9% of total sales in 1999.                                         13  Pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front-end sales. Pharmacy and front-end comparable sales increased by 18.8% and 1.8%, respectively.      Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 74.6% for 2000 from 74.0% for 1999, resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to 25.4% for 2000 from 26.0% for 1999. The decrease in gross margin resulted principally from the faster growth rate of lower margin pharmacy sales and the inclusion of the 53rd week in 2000, which included a significant portion of post-holiday markdowns not included in the previous 52-week year.      Selling, general and administrative expenses were $155.6 million, or 15.6% of net sales, and $135.8 million, or 16.2% of net sales, in 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales reflects the favorable leveraging of store operating costs from maturing retail sites, as well as the leveraging of general and administrative expenses against new and comparative store sales growth.      Depreciation and amortization of intangibles in 2000 and 1999 was $23.2 million and $21.4 million, respectively. The increase was attributable to capital spending for property and equipment during 1999 and 2000 as well as amortization expenses for goodwill, pharmacy customer lists and lease acquisition costs for acquisitions completed during 1999 and 2000. This was partially offset by reduced amortization expenses related to a $22.2 million reduction of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 1999, and a change in the estimated useful life of pharmacy customer list acquisitions from 5 to 7 years.      Store pre-opening expenses of $1.4 million related to the opening of 24 stores in 2000 as compared to $1.5 million reflecting 21 store openings in 1999.      Net interest expense increased to $35.9 million in 2000 from $29.3 million in 1999. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher levels of average borrowing and higher interest rates during 2000.      Our income before income taxes increased 26.7% to $38.3 million in 2000 from $30.2 million in 1999.      During 2000, we recorded an income tax provision of $15.6 million, which included certain wage related income tax credits, resulting in an effective tax rate of 40.8%. During 1999, we recorded an income tax benefit of $10.5 million due to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation reserves of $30.8 million.      We recorded net income of $22.7 million in 2000, compared to net income of $40.7 million in 1999. The decrease of $18.0 million is a result of the income tax benefit of $10.5 million recorded in 1999 as compared to the income tax provision of $15.6 million recorded in 2000, partially offset by the increase in pre-tax income of $8.1 million in 2000 versus 1999.  FISCAL 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1998      Net sales in 1999 were $839.8 million, an increase of 43.0% over 1998 net sales of $587.4 million. The increase was due to increased comparable store sales of 8.9% and the inclusion of 33 stores opened during 1998 for the entire 1999 period and 21 new stores opened in 1999. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to increased pharmacy sales, which increased to 31.9% of total sales in 1999 compared to 28.3% of total sales in 1998. Pharmacy sales have followed the general industry trend reflecting accelerated growth rates versus front-end sales.      Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales increased to 74.0% for 1999 from 73.4% for 1998, resulting in a decrease in gross profit margin to 26.0% for 1999 from 26.6% for 1998. The decrease in gross margin resulted principally from pharmacy sales making up a greater percentage of total sales and the impact of lower gross margins in the Rock Bottom stores acquired in September 1998.      Selling, general and administrative expenses were $135.8 million or 16.2% of net sales and $94.6 million or 16.1% of net sales in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The large number of new and immature stores, along with the increased proportion of higher cost pharmacy business, offset the favorable leveraging of expenses associated with sales growth.      The increase in depreciation and amortization of intangibles from $14.2 million in 1998 to $21.4 million in 1999 resulted principally from capital spending on property and equipment during 1998 and 1999 as well as full year amortization and depreciation expenses related to identifiable intangibles, goodwill and                                         14  property and equipment associated with the Rock Bottom Stores acquisition in September 1998. In addition, amortization expenses increased due to the intangible assets associated with the acquisition of a portion of the Love's store chain in May 1999.      Store pre-opening expenses decreased from $3.3 million in 1998 to $1.5 million in 1999 due to the opening of 21 new stores in 1999 compared to 33 in 1998.      Net interest expense increased to $29.3 million in 1999 from $25.6 million in 1998. The increase in interest expense was principally due to higher levels of average borrowing and higher interest rates during 1999.      Our income before income taxes increased 60.9% to $30.2 million in 1999 from $18.8 million in 1998.      During 1999, we recorded an income tax benefit of $10.5 million due to the reversal of deferred tax asset valuation reserves, which were partially offset by the income tax provision for fiscal year 1999. We were not required to record an income tax provision in 1998, as there was no taxable income and our net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax asset had a valuation reserve of 100%.      During 1998 we recorded a $23.6 million extraordinary charge related to the early extinguishment of debt.      We recorded net income of $40.7 million in 1999, compared to a net loss of $4.8 million in 1998. The increase of $45.5 million is a result of higher gross profit as a result of higher sales, the extraordinary charge recorded in 1998, and the income tax benefit recorded in 1999, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative expenses, amortization and depreciation expense.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      In February 1998, we successfully completed an initial public offering, which was part of a plan to refinance all of our then existing indebtedness in order to enhance financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and implement capital improvements. This plan resulted in a reduction in our overall indebtedness, a simplification of our capital structure and access to additional borrowings. The principal components of this plan were: (1) our sale of 6.7 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $102 million; (2) the execution of a new secured credit agreement, which provided for borrowings up to approximately $160 million ($130 million of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans); (3) our issuance of $80 million aggregate principal amount of 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008, for net proceeds of approximately $77 million; (4) the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under our former credit agreement, the outstanding principal amount of which was $89.8 million as of December 27, 1997; (5) the redemption of our outstanding 15% Zero Coupon Senior Subordinated Notes due 2004 and (6) the redemption of our outstanding 12% Senior Notes due 2002.      On August 14, 1998, in connection with the Rock Bottom acquisition, our credit agreement was amended to allow for increased term loan borrowings of $10 million. On September 11, 1998, also in connection with the Rock Bottom acquisition, the credit agreement was amended and restated to increase available term loan borrowings by $70 million, bringing the total permitted borrowings under our credit agreement to $240 million ($210 million of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans).      On March 17, 1999, in connection with additional planned pharmacy acquisitions and capital spending requirements, the credit agreement was amended and restated again to increase available borrowings by $35 million to $275 million ($235 million of term loans and $40 million of revolving loans). On December 16, 1999 the credit agreement was amended to increase permitted revolving loan borrowings to $60 million of which $40 million was actually made available to us at December 25, 1999.      On January 7, 2000 and February 11, 2000 available revolver borrowings were increased by $6.0 million and $4.0 million respectively, bringing total available revolver borrowings to $50 million.      On March 17, 2000, in order to provide us with additional availability of capital for general working capital needs, the credit agreement was amended and restated to permit available term loan borrowings to increase by up to $30 million of which $10 million was actually made available to us. In addition, available revolver borrowings were increased by $5 million, bringing total available borrowings under the credit                                         15  agreement to $300 million ($245 million of term loans and $55 million of revolver loans). We used the additional $10 million proceeds of the term loans to reduce revolver borrowings.      On October 30, 2000, the remaining $20 million resulting from the March 17, 2000 credit agreement restatement was made available, bringing total term loan borrowing to $265 million. The additional funds were again used to reduce revolver borrowings.      On October 31, 2000, the credit agreement was restated to allow for an additional $20 million of term loan borrowing, of which $10 million was made available. This increased our total available borrowings to $330 million ($275 million of term loans and $55 million of revolver loans.) The proceeds of this transaction were applied to the balance of the revolving credit line.      Working capital was $154.5 million as of December 30, 2000 and $120.0 million as of December 25, 1999. The increase is primarily due to increases in inventory related to the opening of 24 additional stores during 2000, and increases in accounts receivable due to additional volume and an increase in the proportion of third party prescription sales.      Our EBITDA increased by $15.6 million, or 18.2%, to $101.4 million in 2000 compared to $85.8 million in 1999. EBITDA as a percentage of sales was 10.1% in 2000, compared to 10.2% in 1999.      For fiscal 2000, net cash provided by operating activities was $22.1 million, compared to $16.9 million for fiscal 1999. The primary reason for the increase in net cash provided was increased earnings from operations partially offset by increases in working capital related to inventory for new stores, accounts receivable and the timing of the year-end at December 30, 2000 versus December 25, 1999. As a result of the additional week and later year-end date in 2000, certain disbursements such as sales tax and payroll were paid prior to the year-end date in 2000, whereas they were paid after year-end in 1999.      For fiscal 2000, net cash used in investing activities was $32.6 million, compared to $45.3 million in fiscal 1999. Net cash used in investing activities in 2000 was for capital expenditures of $29.7 million primarily related to new store openings and the remodeling and renovation of other stores, combined with $2.9 million for lease acquisition and pharmacy file acquisition costs. Net cash used in investing activities in 1999 was due to capital expenditures of $37.2 million, $8.5 million for lease acquisition and pharmacy file acquisition costs, $10.3 million to purchase six Love's stores and a Pasteur Pharmacy offset by proceeds of $10.7 million from the sale of assets.      For fiscal 2000, net cash provided by financing activities was $10.5 million, compared to $28.6 million in fiscal 1999. In both 2000 and 1999, the net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to additional borrowings under our credit agreement.      Our capital requirements primarily result from opening and stocking new stores, remodeling and renovating existing retail locations and from the continuing development of management information systems. We believe that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plan to open approximately 50 to 60 stores during the next two years. We expect to spend approximately $30 million in fiscal 2001 on capital expenditures, primarily for new and replacement stores and an additional $7 million for lease and pharmacy file acquisition costs. We also require working capital to support inventory for our existing stores. Historically, we have been able to lease our store locations.      Leases for 16 of our stores that generated approximately 7.4% of our net sales for fiscal 2000 are scheduled to expire before the end of fiscal 2002. We believe that we will be able to renew these leases on economically favorable terms or, alternatively, find other economically attractive locations to lease.      As of December 30, 2000, approximately 3,700 of our approximately 5,500 employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of these collective bargaining agreements, we are required to pay specified annual increases in salary and benefits to the member employees. We do not believe that these increases will have a material impact on our liquidity or results of operations.      We believe that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including additional borrowings under our credit agreement, will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal                                         16  and interest on our indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the terms of our debt agreements. As of December 30, 2000, we had borrowed approximately $12.5 million under the revolving portion of our bank credit agreement and had approximately $41.7 million of remaining availability. Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that our operating results, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the future. Substantially all of our borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates. Therefore, our financial condition will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates.      The credit agreement contains various covenants that limit or restrict, among other things, subject to certain exceptions, capital expenditures, the incurrence of indebtedness, the creation of liens, transactions with affiliates, restricted payments, investments and acquisitions, mergers, consolidations, dissolutions, asset sales, dividends, distributions, and certain other transactions and business activities by the Company.      Financial performance covenants include interest coverage, leverage ratios, minimum net worth requirements and fixed charge coverage. At December 30, 2000, we were in compliance with all financial performance covenants.      On December 20, 2000, we entered into a two-year interest rate swap in the notional amount of $150.0 million. This swap had an effective date of January 12, 2001 and represented a hedging transaction whereby we would receive interest at a floating rate and pay interest at a fixed LIBOR rate. The effect of this swap is to fix our interest obligations on $150.0 million of floating rate debt for two years at a LIBOR rate of 5.8075% plus the applicable margins as defined in the credit agreement (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). This agreement expires on January 13, 2003.  TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES      At December 30, 2000, we had net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately $23 million, which are due to expire in the years 2007 through 2018. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through 2018 and thereby reduce our federal income taxes otherwise payable. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Code. This Section 382 limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its post-ownership change income. The Section 382 limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation's stock immediately before an ownership change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership (by value) of that corporation by one or more 5% shareholders, (including certain groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5% of that corporation's stock), exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. Our recapitalization in 1997 caused us to experience an ownership change. As a result, we currently are subject to an annual Section 382 limitation of approximately $8.5 million in 2001 and approximately $5.1 million from 2002 to 2007 on the amount of NOLs generated prior to the recapitalization that we may use to offset future taxable income. At December 30, 2000 all of the existing NOLs were subject to this limitation. We cannot assure you that we will be able to use any NOLs to offset future taxable income or that the NOLs will not become subject to limitation due to future ownership changes. Based on our recent and projected performance, however, management believes that it is more likely than not that the full value of the NOLs will be realized.  SEASONALITY      The non-pharmacy business is seasonal in nature, with the Christmas holiday season generating a higher proportion of sales and earnings than other periods. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for an illustration of the effect of seasonality on our results of operations.                                         17  INFLATION      We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations during the three years ended December 30, 2000; however, most recent data available indicates that there has been a modest increase in the overall inflation levels impacting our business and there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material impact in the future.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires that derivative instruments such as options, forward contracts and swaps be recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and provides guidance for recognition of changes in fair value depending on the reason for holding the derivative. On December 20, 2000, the Company entered into a two-year interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $150.0 million, with an effective date of January 12, 2001. The agreement was entered into as an interest rate hedging transaction and will effectively convert $150.0 million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate of interest based on LIBOR. The Company is required to adopt Statement No. 133 for the first quarter of 2001. The adoption of Statement No. 133 is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.      In 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), "Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements." SAB 101 summarizes guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition. The adoption of SAB 101 had no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.      In April 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 44 (FIN 44) "Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation." Among other things, FIN 44 establishes criteria to determine whether modifications to the terms of existing stock option awards will result in compensation expense being recorded. In addition, FIN 44 clarifies the criteria for determining whether a stock based plan is non-compensatory. The adoption of FIN 44 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT MARKET RISK      Our financial results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt that carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding under our credit agreement was approximately $270 million at December 30, 2000. During 1998, in connection with the credit agreement requirements, we entered into an interest rate protection agreement which capped the LIBOR rate at 6.5% on $65 million of our floating rate debt. This agreement expired in November 2000. On December 20, 2000, we purchased a two-year interest rate swap in the notional amount of $150.0 million. This swap has an effective date of January 12, 2001 and represented a hedging transaction to effectively convert $150.0 million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate. This fixed rate is equivalent to a LIBOR rate of 5.8075% plus the applicable margins described in our credit agreement (see note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The 90-day LIBOR rate at December 30, 2000 was 6.8125%. Based on the December 30, 2000 outstanding balances reduced by the $150.0 million interest rate swap described above, a 0.50% change in interest rates would affect pre-tax annual results of operations by approximately $0.6 million. We also had $80 million of Senior Notes outstanding at December 30, 2000. These notes, which bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 9 1/4%, are not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations.      The principal objective of our investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate our funding needs.
