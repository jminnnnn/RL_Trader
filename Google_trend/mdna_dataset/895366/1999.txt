ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS   OF OPERATIONS      The following should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.  GENERAL      The Company generates revenues primarily through sales of OTC drugs and prescription pharmaceutical products, health and beauty aids, food and beverage items, tobacco products, cosmetics, housewares, hosiery, greeting cards, photofinishing, photo supplies and seasonal merchandise. Health and beauty products, including OTC drugs, represent the largest of the Company's product categories. The Company's primary costs and expenses consist of (i) inventory costs, (ii) labor expenses and (iii) occupancy costs.      The Company had sales per square foot of $1,010 and $1,040 in fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1998, respectively. The Company believes that sales per square foot is a useful measure of comparing the Company's performance to that of its competitors because it is a measure of a store's sales productivity. The Company currently expects that its sales per square foot may decline as it continues with its plan to increase new store openings during 1999. The opening of such additional stores may result in a decline in sales per square foot principally because (i) the average square footage for new stores will often be greater than that of the existing store base and (ii) new stores generally take some time to reach a mature level of sales. The Company believes that its competitors in the industry experience increases and decreases in sales per square foot for similar reasons. Over the next two years, the Company plans to open approximately 30 to 40 stores, primarily in New York City.      The Company includes stores that have been in operation for at least 13 months for purposes of calculating comparable store sales figures.      In June 1997, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners II, L.P. ("DLJMBPII") and certain of its affiliates acquired approximately 91.5% of the outstanding capital stock of the Company from Bain Capital and certain other selling securityholders. Upon consummation of such purchase, the Company reclassified all of its outstanding capital stock (then consisting of four classes) into one class of common stock, $0.01 par value per share. In February 1998, the Company successfully completed an initial public offering (the "Offering") of its common stock.      The Company's primary assets are its ownership of 99% of the outstanding partnership interest of Duane Reade, a New York general partnership ("Duane Reade") and ownership of all of the outstanding common stock of DRI I Inc. ("DRI"). DRI owns the remaining 1% partnership interest in Duane Reade. Substantially all of the operations of the Company are conducted through Duane Reade.                                         14  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following sets forth the results of operations as a percentage of sales for the periods indicated.                                                                                                    FISCAL YEAR                                                                                       -------------------------------                                                                                         1998       1997       1996                                                                                       ---------  ---------  ---------        Net Sales...........................................................................      100.0%     100.0%     100.0% Cost of Sales.......................................................................       73.4       75.0       75.6                                                                                       ---------  ---------  --------- Gross profit........................................................................       26.6       25.0       24.4 Selling, general and administrative expenses........................................       16.1       15.2       15.5 Amortization........................................................................        1.3        1.2        4.3 Depreciation........................................................................        1.2        0.8        0.8 Store pre-opening expenses..........................................................        0.6        0.2        0.0 Nonrecurring charges................................................................         --        3.0         --                                                                                       ---------  ---------  --------- Operating income....................................................................        7.6        4.6        3.8 Net interest expense................................................................        4.4        8.0        8.5                                                                                       ---------  ---------  --------- Income (loss) before extraordinary charge...........................................        3.2       (3.4)      (4.7) Extraordinary charge................................................................

The increase was due to increased comparable store sales of 6.5% and the inclusion of seven stores opened during 1997 for the entire 1998 period, 33 new stores opened in 1998, and 28 stores purchased in the Rock Bottom Acquisition. The increase in comparable store sales was primarily attributable to increased pharmacy sales, which increased to 28.3% of total sales in 1998 compared to 25.1% of total sales in 1997.      Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 73.4% for 1998 from 75.0% for 1997, resulting in an increase in gross profit margin to 26.6% for 1998 from 25.0% for 1997. The increase in gross margin resulted principally from contribution from higher margin merchandise such as greeting cards, photo finishing, cosmetics, vitamins, generic drugs and private label products.      Selling, general and administrative expenses were $94.6 million or 16.1% of net sales and $65.4 million or 15.2% of net sales in 1998 and 1997, respectively. The percentage increase in 1998 compared to 1997 resulted principally from higher selling expenses related to higher store salaries as a percentage of net sales and increases in other store-related expenses (principally attributable to new stores during the early months of operation) as well as approximately $1.4 million of nonrecurring transition costs related to the integration of the Rock Bottom stores during the fourth quarter of 1998. Transition costs related to the Rock Botton Acquisition include redundant costs incurred related to the occupancy costs of an additional warehouse, the costs related to maintaining duplicate warehouse and point of sale systems, administrative payroll costs for positions during the integration period and expenses incurred to convert the stores to the Duane Reade format.      Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1998 and 1997 was $7.1 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The increase in amortization resulted principally from the amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangibles related to the Rock Bottom stores as well as increases in the amortization of customer lists and lease acquisition costs for pharmacy acquisitions during 1998.      The increase in depreciation from $3.5 million in 1997 to $7.0 million in 1998 resulted principally from depreciation on the 33 stores opened during 1998, a full year of depreciation expense in 1998 on the seven stores opened during 1997 compared to a partial year of depreciation expense in 1997 and depreciation expense on the 28 Rock Bottom stores.                                         15      Store pre-opening expenses increased from $767,000 in 1997 to $3.3 million in 1998 due to the opening of 33 new stores in 1998 compared to seven in 1997.      Net interest expense decreased 25.7% to $25.6 million in 1998 from $34.5 million in 1997. The decrease in interest expense was principally due to the impact of the debt refinancing completed during February 1998 in connection with the Refinancing Plan (as defined) which resulted in lower overall debt levels and a reduction of interest rates.      The Company's income before extraordinary charge increased by $33.5 million to $18.8 million for 1998 from a net loss of $14.7 million for 1997 as a result of the $12.7 million nonrecurring charges in the prior year period; decreased interest expense; and increased sales and gross profit margin, partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses; store pre-opening expenses; depreciation and amortization. Including the extraordinary charge related to the early extinguishment of debt, the net loss for 1998 was $4.8 million.  FISCAL 1997 COMPARED TO FISCAL 1996      Net sales in 1997 were $429.8 million, an increase of 12.7% over 1996 net sales of $381.5 million. The increase was attributable to increased comparable store sales of 7.6% and the inclusion of one new store opened during 1996 for the entire 1997 period and seven new stores opened in 1997.      Cost of sales as a percentage of net sales decreased to 75.0% for 1997 from 75.6% for 1996, resulting in an increase in gross profit margin to 25.0% for 1997 from 24.4% during 1996. The increase in gross margin resulted from a number of factors including (i) increased contribution from the sale of higher margin merchandise such as cosmetics, vitamins, general merchandise, generic drugs and private label products, (ii) higher promotional allowances received from venders and (iii) occupancy costs that increased at a lesser rate than the rate at which sales increased.      Selling, general and administrative expenses were $65.4 million or 15.2% of net sales and $59.0 million or 15.5% of net sales in 1997 and 1996, respectively. The percentage decrease in 1997 compared to 1996 resulted principally from lower general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales including the elimination of agreements requiring the annual payment of $1.0 million in management fees to Bain Capital, partially offset by higher selling expenses related to higher store salaries as a percentage of net sales (principally from new stores during the early months of operation).      Amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in 1997 and 1996 was $5.3 million and $16.2 million, respectively. The decrease in amortization is principally a result of the completion in 1996 of amortization of covenants not to compete and the related write-off of the balance of such amounts during the fourth quarter of 1996.      Depreciation was $3.5 million and $3.0 million in 1997 and 1996, respectively.      Store pre-opening expenses increased to $0.8 million in 1997 from $0.1 in 1996 due to the opening of seven new store locations in 1997 compared to one in 1996.      Net interest expense was $34.5 million in 1997 compared to $32.4 million in 1996. The increase in interest expense was principally due to (i) higher non-cash accretion of the 15% Senior Subordinated Zero Coupon Notes due 2004 (the "Zero Coupon Notes"), (ii) interest related to financing of third party accounts receivable and (iii) increased interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility, partially offset by (a) reduced interest on term loan borrowings caused by the decrease in average balance from $72.0 million for 1996 to $67.4 million for 1997 and a decrease in the average interest rate from 9.1% to 8.7% and (b) reduced interest on capital lease obligations.      The net loss for the Company decreased by $3.2 million from $17.9 million in 1996 to $14.7 million in 1997 primarily as a result of an increase in sales and gross profit margin and a reduction in amortization expense, partially offset by nonrecurring charges (see Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company's EBITDA improved by $7.8 million or 22.0% to $43.1 million in 1997                                         16  compared to $35.3 million in 1996. EBITDA as a percentage of sales increased to 10.0% in 1997 from 9.3% in 1996.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      In February 1998, the Company successfully completed the Offering, which was part of a plan to refinance all of the Company's then existing indebtedness (the "Refinancing Plan") in order to enhance the Company's financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities and implement capital improvements. The Refinancing Plan resulted in a reduction in the Company's overall indebtedness, a simplification of the Company's capital structure and access to additional borrowings. The principal components of the Refinancing Plan were: (i) the sale by the Company of 6.7 million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately $102 million; (ii) the execution of a new secured credit agreement (the "Existing Credit Agreement"), which provided for borrowings up to approximately $160 million ($130 million of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans); (iii) the issuance of $80 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 9 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2008 (the "Senior Notes") for net proceeds of approximately $77 million; (iv) the repayment of all outstanding borrowings under the Company's former credit agreement, the outstanding principal amount of which was $89.8 million as of December 27, 1997; (v) the redemption of the Company's outstanding Zero Coupon Notes; (vi) the redemption of the Company's outstanding 12% Senior Notes due 2002.      On August 14, 1998, in connection with the Rock Bottom Acquisition, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended to allow for increased term loan borrowings of $10 million. On September 11, 1998, also in connection with the Rock Bottom Acquisition, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended and restated to increase available term loan borrowings by $70 million, bringing the total permitted borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement to $240 million ($210 of term loans and up to $30 million of revolving loans).      Working capital was $90.0 million and $37.5 million as of December 26, 1998 and December 27, 1997, respectively. The increase is primarily due to increases in inventory related to the Rock Bottom Acquisition, the opening of 33 additional stores during 1998 and the Company's increase in its investments in forward-buy inventory. In addition, accounts receivable increased due to additional volume as well as an increase in third party pharmacy receivables due to the Company's decision to no longer factor these receivables.      The Company's EBITDA increased by $19.0 million or 44.0% to $62.0 million in 1998 compared to 1997. EBITDA as a percentage of sales increased to 10.6% in 1998 from 10.0% in 1997.      For the fiscal year ended December 26, 1998, net cash used in operating activities was $7.9 million, compared to $3.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997. The primary reason for this use of cash was an increase in inventory and vendor receivables previously discussed. The Company believes that the activities have not and will not materially adversely affect its liquidity.      For the fiscal year ended December 26, 1998, net cash used in investing activities was $98.2 million, compared to $8.3 million for the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997. The increase reflects the Rock Bottom Acquisition and capital expenditures in 1998 related to store openings and remodeling.      For the fiscal year ended December 26, 1998, net cash provided by financing activities was $106.6 million, compared to $12.1 million for the fiscal year ended December 27, 1997. This increase primarily resulted from proceeds from the Offering, new term loan financing, proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes, the borrowing of $80 million to finance the Rock Bottom Acquisition and related supporting inventory, and the revolving credit facility borrowing, net of repayments for capital lease obligations.      During the third quarter, the Company completed the transfer of its warehouse operations to the distribution center in Maspeth, New York. This new facility, which has doubled the Company's distribution capacity, is located one mile away from the Company's former center. The Company's capital requirements                                         17  primarily result from opening and stocking new stores and from the continuing development of management information systems. The Company believes that there are significant opportunities to open additional stores, and currently plans to open approximately 30 to 40 stores during the next two years. The Company expects to spend approximately $20 million in 1999 on capital expenditures primarily for new and replacement stores. Working capital is also required to support inventory for the Company's existing stores. Historically, the Company has been able to lease its store locations.      Leases for seven of the Company's stores that generated approximately 6.3% of the Company's net sales for the fiscal year ended December 26, 1998 are scheduled to expire before the end of the year 2001. The Company believes that it will be able to renew such leases on economically favorable terms or, alternatively, find other economically attractive locations to lease.      As of December 26, 1998, approximately 2,300 of the Company's approximately 3,500 employees were represented by various labor unions and were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Pursuant to the terms of such collectively bargaining agreements, the Company is required to pay certain annual increases in salary and benefits to such employees. The Company does not believe that such increases will have a material impact on the Company's liquidity or results of operations.      The Company records significant accounts receivable related to pharmacy sales in connection with third party plans. In the past, the Company had a non-recourse factoring arrangement with an independent third party, Pharmacy Fund, Inc. ("Pharmacy Fund") under which the Company sold it accounts receivable associated with the third party plans. On September 8, 1998, Pharmacy Fund declared bankruptcy and no longer purchases the Company's third party plan receivables. The Company believes that it will not suffer any loss from the bankruptcy. The Company plans to collect its own receivables for the foreseeable future.      The Company believes that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flow from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement, will be adequate for at least the next two years to make required payments of principal and interest on the Company's indebtedness, to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements and to comply with the terms of its debt agreements. As of December 26, 1998, the Company had borrowed approximately $16.5 million under the revolving portion of its bank credit facility and had approximately $13.0 million of remaining availability. The ability of the Company to meet its debt service obligations and reduce its total debt will be dependent upon the future performance of the Company and its subsidiaries which, in turn, will be subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other conditions, many of which are beyond the Company's control. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company's operating results, cash flow and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of its indebtedness in the future. Substantially all of the Company's borrowings under the Existing Credit Agreement bear interest at floating rates; therefore, the Company's financial condition will be affected by the changes in prevailing interest rates. The Company has entered into interest rate protection agreements to minimize the impact from a rise in interest rates.  TAX BENEFITS FROM NET OPERATING LOSSES      At December 26, 1998, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") of approximately $107 million, which are due to expire in the years 2007 through 2018. These NOLs may be used to offset future taxable income through 2018 and thereby reduce or eliminate the Company's federal income taxes otherwise payable. The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), imposes significant limitations on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an "ownership change," as defined in Section 382 of the Code (the "Section 382 Limitation"). The Section 382 Limitation is an annual limitation on the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs that a corporation may use to offset its post-ownership change income. The Section 382 Limitation is calculated by multiplying the value of a corporation's stock immediately before an ownership change by the long-term tax-exempt rate (as published by the Internal Revenue Service). Generally, an ownership change occurs with respect to a corporation if the aggregate increase in the percentage of stock ownership (by value) of that corporation by one or more 5%                                         18  shareholders (including certain groups of shareholders who in the aggregate own at least 5% of that corporation's stock) exceeds 50 percentage points over a three-year testing period. The Recapitalization caused the Company to experience an ownership change. As a result, the Company currently is subject to an annual Section 382 Limitation of approximately $5.1 million on the amount of NOLs generated prior to the Recapitalization that the Company may utilize to offset future taxable income. NOLs generated by the Company since the Recapitalization (approximately $37 million) are not subject to the Section 382 Limitation and may be used to offset future taxable income. There can be no assurance that any NOLs will be able to be used by the Company to offset future taxable income or that such NOLs will not become subject to limitation due to future ownership changes.  YEAR 2000 UPDATE      The Company is implementing a program to ensure that the Company computer systems and applications (IT Systems) and non-IT Systems will function properly beyond 1999. This program includes inventorying year 2000 items; assigning priorities to the identified items; assessing year 2000 compliance of items determined to be material to the Company; remediating or preplacing material items that are not year 2000 compliant; and determining contingency plans that may be required.      The Company has completed inventorying and prioritizing year 2000 compliance of its IT Systems and is commencing these phases for its non-IT Systems, which will include surveying significant third party vendors. The Company is upgrading its software and expects this phase to be completed by June 30, 1999.      The Company is using both internal and external resources to address year 2000 issues and believes that the cost of such modifications will approximate $600,000. Approximately $250,000 of this includes system upgrades that had been previously identified for operational enhancements.      Although management expects to complete the upgrading of all of its software by mid-1999, the Company will develop a year 2000 contingency plan before mid-1999 if it appears that the Company will not achieve full year 2000 compliance. Management regularly monitors the status of the year 2000 compliance process.      The failure to correct a material year 2000 problem could result in an interruption in, or failure of, certain normal business activities or operations. Such failures could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. No assurances, however, can be given that the Company will be able to identify and address all year 2000 issues due to their complexity as well as the Company's dependence on the technical skills of employees and independent contractors and on the representations and preparedness of third parties with which the Company does business. Although the Company believes that its efforts are designed to appropriately identify and address year 2000 issues that are subject to the Company's reasonable control, there can be no assurance that year 2000 issues will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition or results of operations.  SEASONALITY      In general, sales of drugstores items such as prescription drugs, OTC drugs and health and beauty care products exhibit limited seasonality in the aggregate, but do vary by product category. Quarterly results are primarily affected by the timing of new store openings and the sale of seasonal products. In view of the Company's recent expansion of seasonal merchandising, the Company expects slightly greater revenue sensitivity relating to seasonality in the future.  INFLATION      The Company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on results of operations for the Company during the three years ended December 26, 1998.                                         19  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      FASB Statement No. 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" requires that derivative instruments such as options, forward contracts and swaps be recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and provides guidance for recognition of changes in fair value depending on the reason for holding the derivative. The Company does not presently have significant transactions involving derivative instruments, but may do so in the future. The Company is required to adopt Statement No. 133 for the first quarter of 2000 and may adopt it earlier.  ITEM 7A. MARKET RISK      The financial results of the Company are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on debt which carries variable interest rates. Variable rate debt outstanding (under the Existing Credit Agreement) was approximately $225 million at December 26, 1998, which is somewhat lower than the Company expects its outstanding variable rate debt to be during the next twelve months. The anticipated outstanding balances, however, are not expected to be materially greater than at December 26, 1998. Based on the December 26, 1998 outstanding balances, a 0.50% change in interest rates would affect annual results of operations by approximately $1.1 million. The Company also has $80 million of Senior Notes outstanding at December 26, 1998. These notes, which bear interest at a fixed 9 1/4%, are not subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations.      The principal objective of the Company's investment management activities is to maintain acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate the funding needs of the Company. As part of its investment management, the Company may use derivative financial products such as interest rate hedges and interest rate swaps. During the year ended December 27, 1997 there were no derivative positions. During the year ended December 26, 1998, in connection with the Existing Credit Agreement requirements, the Company entered into an interest rate protection agreement.                                         20  ITEM 8.
