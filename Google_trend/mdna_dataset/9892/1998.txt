Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results          of Operations and of Financial Conditions     General  Bard is a leading multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of products for the large and growing health care industry.  Worldwide health care expenditures approximated $2.4 trillion in 1997 with about half that amount spent in the United States.  Bard's segment of this industry, itself a multi-billion dollar market, is primarily specialized products used mainly in hospitals, in outpatient centers and in physician's offices to meet the needs of the medical profession in caring for their patients.  The company seeks to focus and concentrate on selected diseases with cost-effective, innovative products and specialized sales forces to maximize Bard's opportunities in managing these diseases.  Summary Results  Consolidated net sales increased 2% in 1997.  Growth was negatively affected by divested and de-emphasized product lines, sales denominated in foreign currencies that weakened against the U.S. dollar and a continued reduction in average selling prices.  Net income and basic earnings per share in 1997 and 1996 were both affected by one-time items.  In 1997 the major one-time item was a $44.1 million ($30.1 million after-tax) charge for the company's  manufacturing restructuring plan.  The plan relates to activities which will be implemented during the next twenty-one months and when completed are estimated to result in pretax cost savings of approximately $43 million annually.  The company's current estimates show a savings of approximately 21 cents per share in 1999 and approximately 40 cents per share in the year 2000 and beyond.  Please refer to page II-5 of this financial review for a summary of one-time items affecting income in the last three years.  Results of Operations - 1997 vs. 1996  Net sales rose 2% to $1.214 billion.  Divested and de-emphasized product lines reduced the growth in 1997 sales by 4%.  Price reductions totaled about 1.5% and the stronger dollar reduced reported sales by 2%.  Excluding these items, sales would have grown approximately 9%.  Sales of vascular products rose 5% in 1997.  Radiology devices showed strong growth, primarily in U.S. markets.  A full year of sales of graft products from the acquisition of IMPRA, Inc. in September 1996 added significantly to the growth rate of vascular products.  Urology product sales grew 5% in 1997.  The Infection Control Foley  catheter and the Contigen Bard collagen implant provided the growth in this area.                                II-3  Results of Operations - 1997 vs. 1996 (continued)  Sales of oncology products increased 5% in 1997.  Specialty venous access devices showed good growth, particularly in international markets.  Biopsy products had good growth in U.S. markets.  Sales of surgical specialty products grew 11% in 1997, propelled by high growth worldwide of mesh products used primarily for hernia repair.  The four product areas discussed above are Bard's emphasis products which accounted for over 93% of total sales in 1997.  The combined growth of emphasis products was 6% in 1997 and would have grown 8% without the negative impact of foreign currencies.  Other product group sales declined 34% in 1997, primarily as a result of the sale and discontinuance of several product lines.  Net sales by product group for the last three years (in millions) are:                            1997        1996       1995   Vascular                 $  457.6    $  434.7   $  410.2 Urology                     319.1       304.1      286.5 Oncology                    224.5       214.2      197.6 Surgery                     129.2       116.4      105.9 Total emphasis products   1,130.4     1,069.4    1,000.2 Other                        83.1       125.0      137.6 Net sales                $1,213.5    $1,194.4   $1,137.8  Sales in the United States rose 1% in 1997 to $793.2 million, representing 65% of worldwide sales.  Sales of emphasis products rose 8% while the decline in de-emphasized product resulted in the small overall increase in U.S. sales.  Vascular and surgical specialty product areas provided the best growth in the U.S.  Sales outside the U.S. increased 2% in 1997 and would have grown 9% without the effect of a 7% reduction in foreign currency translation.  In local currency values, Bard experienced solid sales gains in vascular grafts (helped by the acquisition of IMPRA in 1996), specialty access devices, mesh products and basic urological drainage devices.  The geographic breakdown of sales outside the U.S. for the last three years is:                               1997      1996      1995 Europe, Middle East,             Africa                     61%       62%       62% Asia/Pacific area and                               Western hemisphere,   excluding U.S.              39%       38%       38%                              100%      100%      100%                                II-4  Results of Operations - 1997 vs. 1996 (continued)  Bard's cost of goods sold showed good improvement to 47.2% of sales compared with 48.7% in 1996.  Bard's efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and the acquisition of IMPRA resulted in this improvement.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased almost 7% in 1997 primarily due to a full year of spending associated with the IMPRA acquisition and the costs associated with programming changes for the year 2000.  These expenses grew faster than sales and were at a level of 32.2% of sales in 1997 compared with 30.6% in 1996.  Spending for research and development increased 11% in 1997 to 7% of sales from 6.5% of sales in 1996.  This increase in spending will help ensure that the company has the new products that are essential to Bard's growth.  Additional interest expense for the full year of 1997 related to acquisitions in 1996 (primarily IMPRA in September) and resulted in the increase in total interest expense for the year.  Costs of $9.0 million in 1996 to combine the operations of acquisitions affected income in that year.  There were no such costs in 1997.  Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net of the Notes of Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a summary of items in this category in the last three years.  Included in this category in 1997 are charges of $44.1 million for a manufacturing restructuring plan and $10.5 million associated with the impairment of investments and intangible assets, and a legal settlement.  These charges were partially offset by gains of $17.8 million on the sale of the surgical suction and irrigation product line and $6.7 million from the sales of other product lines and assets.  Income Tax  The effective tax rate was 31.1% in 1997, 10% in 1996 and 29.7% in 1995.  The lower tax rate in 1996 was primarily due to the increased tax benefit in the U.S. related to one-time charges and the reversals of approximately $15 million in tax reserves no longer required.  The tax benefit from operations in Ireland and Puerto Rico favorably affected the tax rate in each year.  Net Income  Net income decreased to $72.3 million in 1997 from $92.5 million in 1996.  This was due in large part to the $44.1 million charge ($30.1 million after-tax) for a manufacturing restructuring plan.  The following chart shows the effect on net income and on basic and diluted earnings per share of one-time items during the last three years.

Results of Operations - 1996 vs. 1995  Net sales totaled $1.194 billion in 1996, a 5% increase over 1995.  Price reductions totaled about 2% worldwide while a stronger dollar reduced reported sales by 1%.  Sales of vascular products rose 6% in 1996 to $434.7 million.  Radiology devices showed strong growth.  Sales of grafts increased sharply as a result of the September 1996 acquisition of IMPRA and sales of cardiac assist devices acquired from St. Jude Medical in January 1996 also added to the vascular growth rate.                                II-6  Results of Operations - 1996 vs. 1995 (continued) Urological product sales totaled $304.1 million in 1996, a 6% increase over 1995.  Basic drainage products and specialty devices contributed to this growth.  The company's growth in urological products was significantly higher in the U.S. than in international markets.  Sales of oncological products grew 8% to $214.2 million in 1996, primarily from a strong increase in the specialty venous access area.  Surgical specialty products were up 10% in 1996 to $116.4 in sales.  Mesh products, which are used primarily in hernia repair, showed a substantial gain in sales.  Worldwide sales of the emphasis products described above grew 7% in 1996 to $1.069 billion and represented 90% of Bard's total sales.  Other products are de-emphasized and sales in this area declined by 9% in 1996 to $125.0 million.  Sales in the United States grew 4% in 1996 to $782.0 million, representing 65% of worldwide sales.  Surgical specialties turned in the highest growth rate of the four emphasis product groups, but the urological area continues to generate the most revenue and also showed good growth.  The good increase in sales of oncological products came primarily from growth in specialty access and biopsy devices.  Vascular sales showed improvement primarily as a result of the 1996 acquisition of IMPRA.  Sales of other, de-emphasized products declined.  Sales outside the U.S. grew 6% in 1996 to $412.4 million, representing 35% of worldwide sales, compared with 34% in 1995.  Growth was highest in the oncological and surgical specialties areas.  Sales of vascular products showed good increases from grafts and radiology devices, and were helped by strong balloon angioplasty sales in Europe.  Sales of urological products showed a small increase with gains primarily in basic drainage and continence products.  The effect of currency translation was to lower international sales by almost 3% for the year.  Excluding this effect, reported international sales would have increased 9% over the prior year.  The cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 48.7% in 1996 and 48.3% in the prior year as market price reductions exceeded the company's gains in manufacturing efficiencies and efforts to shift the mix to higher margin products.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased just over 3% in 1996, lower than the rate of growth in sales, as efforts were increased to lower expenses to help offset some of the effects of price declines.  Also, Bard realized synergies from the two mergers completed late in 1995.  As a percent to total sales, these expenses represented 30.6% in 1996 compared with 31.2% in 1995.                                II-7  Results of Operations - 1996 vs. 1995 (continued)  Research and development spending increased over 2% in 1996, representing 6.5% of sales, slightly less than the ratio to sales in 1995.  In an effort to reduce costs, the company eliminated certain planned spending while continuing sufficient work on the programs needed for Bard's future success.  Additional interest expense related to acquisitions in 1996 resulted in an increase in total interest expense for the year.  Costs to combine the operations of acquisitions of $9.0 million in 1996 and $17.7 million in 1995 affected income in both years.  Other (income) expense, net, in 1996 included charges of $31.0 million for the write down of assets related to guidewire technology, $10.0 million for the closing of certain manufacturing operations and a net amount of $3.5 million for certain legal fees and settlements.  Also included are nonrecurring royalty payments of $9.2 million received in 1996 for prior periods.  No nonrecurring items were recorded in this category in 1995.  The effective income tax rate was 10% in 1996.  Excluding the impact of the first quarter reversal of approximately $15 million in tax reserves no longer required and the increased tax benefit in the U.S. related to the one-time charges discussed previously, the effective tax rate would have been 29.5% compared with 29.7% in 1995.  Net income increased 7% in 1996 and 15% in 1995.  Each year was affected by one-time items as described earlier in this financial review.  Year 2000 Expenditures  The company utilizes software and related technologies that will be affected by the date change in the year 2000.  Marketing, selling and administrative expense in 1997 includes $2.8 million for Year 2000 expenditures.  The company estimates the need for additional expenditures of $5.3 million in 1998, $1.5 million in 1999 and $0.3 million in 2000.  Financial Condition and Liquidity  Bard's financial condition remains strong.  Total debt was reduced by $47.3 million to $443.7 at the end of 1997 and the ratio of total debt to total capitalization declined to 43.6% from 44.9%.  Long-term debt was $340.7 million at December 31, 1997, including $120 million of commercial paper borrowing that remains classified as long-term with the backing of Bard's committed credit facility.  The company has a $300 million syndicated, committed credit facility with a group of 11 banks.  The facility expires in June 2000.                                II-8  Financial Condition and Liquidity  The credit agreement supports a commercial paper program which started in September 1996 with a maximum amount of $350 million, reduced to $300 million effective January 1, 1997.  The company borrows actively under this program.  In addition to the $300 million committed credit agreement, Bard maintains uncommitted credit lines with banks for short-term cash needs and these lines were used as needed during the last three years.  At December 31, 1997, the unused uncommitted lines of credit totaled $254 million.  As now structured, the company expects cash flow from operating activities to exceed capital expenditures and dividend payments.  The company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary.  This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility.  Total cash outlays made for purchases of businesses, patents, trademarks and other related items were approximately $23 million in 1997, $237 million in 1996 and $19 million in 1995 for a total over the last three years of $279 million.  The majority of these investments were for intangible assets, reflecting the premium over book value for these purchases.  The cash outlays exclude common stock valued at $135 million issued in 1995 for the acquisitions of MedChem Products and American Hydro-Surgical.  The majority of the cash outlays were financed with additional debt (which increased a total of $150 million during the three-year period) with the balance coming from cash from operations.  Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market.  Total shares purchased were 955,200 in 1997; 813,700 in 1996 and 75,000 in 1995.  In September 1997 the Board of Directors authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 2 million shares of which 200,000 had been purchased as of December 31, 1997.  Foreign Currency Risk  The company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values.  Contracts have been for the forward purchase of, and options in, currencies in which the company has known or anticipated payments.  These are primarily for intercompany transactions, resulting in a high degree of confidence that the anticipated transactions will take place.  Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide short-term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values.  Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-20 of this report for current details of the company's foreign exchange contracts.                                II-9  Legal Proceedings  For a discussion of pending legal proceedings and related matters, please see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-22.  Acquisitions and Dispositions  For information on the company's acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, please see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-18.  Recently Issued Accounting Standards  In the fourth quarter of 1997, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) 128 which requires the presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share.  Basic earnings per share as calculated in accordance with FAS 128 does not differ from earnings per share reported in prior periods and diluted earnings per share is not materially different from basic earnings per share.  In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income, which establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components, and Statement No. 131, Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information, which establishes revised reporting and disclosure requirement for operating segments.  The company will adopt Statement Nos. 130 and 131 by year-end 1998.  These Statements increase disclosure only and will have no effect on the company's financial position or results of operations.  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information  Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally, including statements regarding cost savings from manufacturing restructuring, may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Because actual results are affected by risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied.  Factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions, competitor's  attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs; fewer medical procedures performed in a cost-conscious environment; the lengthy approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid systems or other non-U.S. reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements for procedures using the                                  II-10  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information (continued)  company's medical devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including litigation regarding product liability; uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; price increases from the company's suppliers of critical components; foreign currency fluctuations; unanticipated business disruptions from Year 2000 issues; the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the company's recent restructuring or in the integration of recently acquired businesses.
