Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations    This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results ofoperations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of the company and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere inthis Form 10-K. Certain statements contained herein may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; see Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-LookingInformation below.    Overview    The company designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individualhealthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe and Japan are the companys largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and EasternEurope are the companys fastest growing markets. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major product groupcategories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group category of other products.    The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon itssuccess in developing, acquiring and marketing differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2013, the companys research and development (R&D) expense as a percentage of net sales was 9.7%.The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may, from time-to-time, consideracquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons. The company spent$498.5 million in 2013, including acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D), for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.    Acquisitions, Divestiture and Legal Developments    Acquisitions   On November 14, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Rochester Medical, Inc. (Rochester Medical),a publicly-held developer and supplier of silicone urinary incontinence and urine drainage products for a purchase price of $262.3 million. Rochester Medicals products expand Bards existing global urology product portfolio including anintermittent self catheter product line as well as other products used to treat male urinary incontinence.   On October 1, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Medafor, Inc. (Medafor),a privately-held developer and supplier of plant-based hemostatic agents. Medafors Arista ®  AH hemostatproducts provide an alternative to other commercially available hemostats, complement Bards Progel ® surgical sealant technology and allow the company to expand its presence in the global surgical hemostat market segment. The total purchase consideration of $206.3 million included the fair value of contingent consideration of up to$80.0 million, which is based on specific revenue-based milestones through June 30, 2015.    On August 29, 2013,the company acquired early-stage technology from 3DT Holdings LLC (3DT), providing the company with the rights to develop and commercialize a novel technology related to peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs). 3DTreceived an up-front cash payment of $29.5 million and is eligible for a milestone payment of up to $5.0 million based upon regulatory product approval. The company recorded the up-front payment as a research and development expense.       II-3    On July 29, 2013, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Loma VistaMedical, Inc., a privately-held company specializing in the development and commercialization of aortic valvuloplasty products, which use noncompliant fiber-based balloon technology. The total purchase consideration of $39.4 million included anup-front cash payment of $32.5 million and the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $8.0 million.    For moreinformation on acquisitions, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Divestiture   On November 1, 2013, the company closed on the sale of certain assets and liabilities of its electrophysiology division (the EPSale) to Boston Scientific Corporation (Boston Scientific) and received net cash proceeds of $267.4 million. The company recorded to other (income) expense, net, a gain on the sale of $213.0 million ($118.5 million after tax). SeeNote 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Legal Developments   In connection with the companys ongoing suit against W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. (Gore) for infringingBards patent number 6,436,135, and in accordance with Bards motion to execute on the judgment regarding the final and non-appealable issues, which the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona (District Court) grantedon October 17, 2013, Bard and Gore jointly submitted an order to the District Court directing that all funds not related to Gores willful infringement be paid to Bard. On November 1, 2013, Gore paid the company $894.3 million in cash(the Gore Proceeds), which amount represented the compensatory damages for infringement, including pre- and post-judgment interest, and the royalties accrued through September 30, 2013. In the fourth quarter 2013, the companyrecorded a gain of $894.3 million ($557.4 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, based on the District Courts October 17, 2013 rulings and the companys receipt of the Gore Proceeds. In addition, in January 2014, thecompany received $37.6 million from Gore, representing Gores calculation of royalties for its infringing sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2013. This royalty payment will be recorded in the first quarter of 2014.   During 2013, the company evaluated certain product liability matters based on information currently available, including: the allegationsand documentation supporting or refuting such allegations; publicly available information regarding similar medical device mass tort settlements; historical information regarding other product liability settlements involving the company; and theprocedural posture and stage of litigation. Based on these, and other factors, the company recorded charges, net of estimated recoveries to other (income) expense, net of approximately $400.7 million ($367.6 million after tax), which recognized theestimated costs for certain product liability, including (with respect to such matters) asserted and unasserted claims, as well as costs to administer the settlements related to such matters. The charges exclude any costs associated with all but oneputative class action lawsuit against the company.    For more information on legal matters, see Note 10 of the notes toconsolidated financial statements.    Healthcare Reform    Significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the PPACA). The PPACA requires, among other things, thecompany to pay a 2.3% excise tax on most U.S. medical device sales beginning in 2013. During 2013, the company recorded to marketing, selling and administration expense an excise tax of $29.4 million.       II-4    Results of Operations    Net Sales    Bards 2013 consolidated net sales increased 3% on both areported basis and constant currency basis over 2012 consolidated net sales. Bards 2012 consolidated net sales increased 2% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) over 2011 consolidated net sales. Net sales on a constantcurrency basis is a non-GAAP measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures below. Price changes had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales byapproximately 100 basis points and 140 basis points for 2013 and 2012, respectively, compared to the prior years. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact ofexchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedgingactivities.    Bards 2013 United States net sales of $2,014.1 million increased 2% compared to $1,967.7 million in 2012.Bards 2013 international net sales of $1,035.4 million increased 5% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to $990.4 million in 2012. Bards 2012 United States net sales increased 1% compared to $1,956.0 million in2011. Bards 2012 international net sales increased 5% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to $940.4 million in 2011.

In November 2013, Bard sold its electrophysiology division to Boston Scientific, retaining only the guidewire and temporary pacing electrode product lines. Consolidated net sales ofvascular products in 2013 decreased 2% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year due to decreases in sales of electrophysiology and vascular graft products. United States net sales of vascular products in 2013decreased 3% compared to the prior year. International net sales of vascular products in 2013 were flat on a reported basis (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of vascular products in 2012were flat on a reported basis (increased 3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year was due to an increase in sales of endovascular products offset by declines in sales of electrophysiology and vascular graft products. United Statesnet sales of vascular products in 2012 decreased 3% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2012 increased 4% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.   Consolidated net sales of endovascular products in 2013 were flat on a reported basis (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis)compared to the prior year. Net sales in this product line were impacted by growth in sales of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon catheters, vena cava filters and biopsy products      II-5    offset by a decline in sales of stents. Consolidated net sales of endovascular products in 2012 increased 2% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.Stents and PTA balloon catheters were the primary contributors to the growth in this product line in 2012. Net sales of stents in 2012 benefited from an issue with the availability of a competitors products.   Consolidated net sales of electrophysiology products in 2013 decreased 8% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis comparedto the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of the electrophysiology division in November 2013. Consolidated net sales of electrophysiology products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) comparedto the prior year.    Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products in 2013 decreased 5% on a reported basis (6% on aconstant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Declining sales in peripheral vasculargrafts was the primary driver of the decrease in both 2013 and 2012.    Urology Products  - Bardmarkets a wide range of products for the urology market, including basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. Bard also markets StatLock ®  catheter stabilization products, which are used to secure many types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies. Bard also markets Targeted Temperature Management   products for therapeutic hypothermia. In November 2013, Bard acquired Rochester Medical, including theirintermittent and male-external catheter product lines. In 2013, consolidated net sales of urology products increased 2% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Sales from the acquired product lines had anominal impact on sales growth for 2013 on a reported basis, and contributed 1 percentage point of growth on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Net sales were also favorably impacted by growth in sales of Targeted TemperatureManagement   products and basic drainage products.These increases were partially offset by declines in sales of continence products, a trend that may continue, andStatLock ®  catheter stabilization products. United States net sales of urology products in 2013 increased 1%compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2013 increased 6% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of urology products in 2012 increased 3% on a reported basis (4% on aconstant currency basis) compared to the prior year due to an increase in net sales of Targeted TemperatureManagement   products, partially offset by declines in sales of urological specialty products, StatLock ®  catheter stabilization products and continence products.

Consolidated net sales of brachytherapy products in 2013 decreased 1% on a reported basis (flat on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of urologicalspecialty products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of brachytherapy products in 2012 decreased 15% on a reported basis (11% on a constant currency basis)compared to the prior year. The brachytherapy market has been losing procedural share to alternative therapies in the United States, a trend that may continue.    Consolidated net sales of continence products in 2013 decreased 7% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of continence products in 2012decreased 8%       II-6    on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Net sales in 2013 and 2012 were impacted by a decline in sales of surgical continence products, a trend that maycontinue. Net sales in 2012 were also impacted by the discontinuation of sales of a bulking continence product.

Costs and Expenses    The following is a summary of costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the following years ended December 31:                             2013 (A)        2012        2011        Cost of goods sold         39.2  %         38.0  %         37.9  %      Marketing, selling and administrative expense         30.2  %         27.6  %         27.4  %      Research and development expense         9.7  %         6.9  %         6.4  %      Interest expense         1.5  %         1.3  %         1.3  %      Other (income) expense, net         (20.3  )%         1.4  %         9.4  %                                                         Total costs and expenses         60.2  %         75.2  %         82.4  %                                                             (A)      Amounts do not add due to rounding.   Cost of goods sold  - Cost of goods sold consists principally of the manufacturing and distribution costs of the companysproducts. The category also includes royalties, amortization of intangible assets and the impact of certain hedging activities. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2013 increased 120 basis points compared to the prior year. Thesecosts as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to decreases in selling prices and an increase in spending for targeted investments. Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2012 and 2013 increased cost of goods sold as apercentage of net sales by approximately 30 basis points over the prior year. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2012 increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year. Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in2011 and 2012 increased cost of goods sold in 2012 as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points over the prior year. These increases were largely offset by cost improvements.   Marketing, selling and administrative  expense  - Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of thecosts associated with the companys sales and administrative organizations. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2013 increased 260 basis points from the prior year primarily due to the new excise tax on U.S. sales of medical devices,targeted investment spending in this area including in emerging markets, and related costs from operations acquired in 2012 and 2013. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2012 increased 20 basis points from the prior year primarily due tocosts from operations acquired in 2011 and continued investments in emerging markets.    Research and development expense - Research and development expense consists principally of the costs related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities, and IPR&D costs arising from the companysbusiness development activities. IPR&D       II-8    payments may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. The following table presents a summary of research and development expense for the followingyears ended December 31:                              2013         2012         2011      (dollars in millions)                                   Research and development      $  262.3          $  199.7          $  181.9         In-process research and development         33.4             3.5             3.5                                                              Total research and development expense      $  295.7          $  203.2          $  185.4                                                             Research and development expense in 2013 increased approximately 31% compared to the prior year periodprimarily due to targeted investments in this area and costs from operations acquired in 2012 and 2013. The increase in IPR&D in 2013 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to charges of $30.0 million related to the acquisition ofearly-stage technology and $3.4 million for an impairment charge related to an IPR&D project. Research and development expense in 2012 increased approximately 10% compared to the prior year driven by the operations of acquisitions.   Interest expense  - Interest expense in 2013 was $45.0 million as compared with 2012 interest expense of $39.6 million and 2011interest expense of $36.4 million. The increase in interest expense in 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to the issuance of $500 million of senior unsecured notes in October 2012. In addition, the increase in interest expense in 2012 was due to higheraverage short-term borrowings than in the prior year.    Other (income) expense, net  - Other (income) expense, net, wasincome of $619.3 million for 2013 and expense of $40.3 million and $271.9 million for 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other (income) expense, net, in 2013 included income of $894.3 million related to the Gore Proceeds and $213.0 million resulting fromthe gain on the EP Sale, partially offset by expenses of $428.0 million for litigation charges, net of recoveries, $25.0 million for annual contributions to the C. R. Bard Foundation, Inc., $17.5 million for divestiture-related charges, $11.3million for acquisition-related items consisting of integration costs and $6.4 million for asset impairments. Other (income) expense, net, in 2012 included charges related to asset impairments of $22.2 million and net restructuring costs of $17.4million.  See Note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Income Tax Provision   The companys effective tax rate for 2013 was 43.2% compared to 27.6% in 2012 and 35.8% in 2011. The effective tax rate for 2013reflected the tax effects of litigation charges, primarily related to product liability claims, which were substantially incurred in a low tax jurisdiction, and the gains related to the Gore Proceeds and the EP Sale, which were incurred in high taxjurisdictions. See Notes 2 and 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The effective tax rate was also impacted by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law on January 2, 2013 and retroactively reinstatedthe research tax credit. Although the reinstatement of this tax credit is retroactive to January 1, 2012, the enactment of this legislation in 2013 precluded the company from recording the benefit in 2012. As a result, the companys incometax provision was reduced by approximately $3.7 million in 2013 to recognize the 2012 benefit of this tax credit that would have been recorded in 2012. The effective tax rate for 2011 reflected the tax effect of a charge for legal settlementsrelated to the Hernia Product Claims, which were incurred in a low tax jurisdiction, and a charge related to the Brachytherapy Matter, part of which was not tax deductible. The tax rate in 2011 also reflected a tax benefit of $17.6 million forcertain tax positions being settled as a result of the completion of U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examinations for the tax years from 2005 through 2007 and certain examinations in other jurisdictions.   Net Income and Earnings per Share Available to Common Shareholders    The company reported 2013 net income of $689.8 million, an increase of 30% from 2012 net income of $530.1 million. The company reported 2013 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of$8.39, an increase of 36% from 2012 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $6.16. Net income in 2013 reflects the Gore Proceeds of $557.4 million, or $6.78 per diluted share, litigation charges, net of recoveries, of $393.5million, or $4.79 per diluted share, gain on the EP Sale of $118.5 million, or $1.44 per       II-9    diluted share, acquisition-related items (primarily consisting of IPR&D charges, integration costs, transaction costs and purchase accounting adjustments) of $34.9 million, or $0.43 perdiluted share, and a contribution to the C. R. Bard Foundation, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $14.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Net income for 2013 also reflects divestiture-related charges of $12.2 million, or $0.15 per dilutedshare, asset impairment charges of $9.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, a $2.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, benefit to the income tax provision associated with the remeasurement of an uncertain tax position as a result of the settlementof the Brachytherapy Matter, and a reversal of certain restructuring costs of $1.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.    Thecompany reported 2012 net income of $530.1 million, an increase of 62% from 2011 net income of $328.0 million. The company reported 2012 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $6.16, an increase of 67% from 2011 dilutedearnings per share available to common shareholders of $3.69. Net income in 2012 reflects asset impairments of $13.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, net restructuring costs of $11.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, and acquisition-relateditems (purchase accounting adjustments, transaction and integration costs and IPR&D charges) of $8.5 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. Net income for 2012 also reflects an increase to the income tax provision of $1.1 million, or $0.01 perdiluted share, due to the write-down of a tax receivable in a foreign jurisdiction.    Liquidity and Capital Resources   The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities.Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided fromoperations continues to be a primary source of funds. The company believes that it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary. The company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financialflexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the following years ended December 31:                              2013         2012         2011      (dollars in millions)                                   Cash and cash equivalents      $  1,066.9          $  896.3          $  596.4                                                              Working capital      $  1,503.9          $  1,399.6          $  773.5                                                              Current ratio         3.56/1             4.13/1             1.84/1                                                             Cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries were $874.0 million and$786.1 million at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. It is the companys intention to permanently reinvest the majority of these funds outside the United States to finance foreign operations, and the companys plans do notdemonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations for currently unforeseen circumstances or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the company would be required to accrue and payU.S. taxes on the earnings associated with these funds. In the United States, ongoing operating cash flows and available borrowings under the companys committed syndicated bank credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity.   For the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,123.3 million,$661.2 million and $721.5 million, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the receipt of the Gore Proceeds, payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims that were lower than amountspreviously recorded in 2011 and the timing of tax payments, partially offset by a settlement payment for the Brachytherapy Matter previously recorded in 2012. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 reflects payments toclaimants for Hernia Product Claims settled in 2011, partially offset by improvements in accounts receivable collections.       II-10    During 2013, the company used $288.3 million in cash for investing activities, $190.1million more than in 2012. During 2012, the company used $98.2 million in cash for investing activities, $674.1 million less than in 2011. Capital expenditures amounted to $69.1 million, $72.6 million and $71.4 million for the years endedDecember 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The company spent $498.5 million in 2013, $159.3 million in 2012 and $557.2 million in 2011 for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies to augment existing product lines. Inaddition, the company received net proceeds from the EP Sale of $267.4 million in 2013. Net cash used in investing activities in 2012 reflects a decrease of $122.1 million related to the release of restricted cash from qualified settlement funds(QSFs) to claimants pursuant to the settlement of certain Hernia Product Claims.   During 2013 and 2012, the company used $663.3 million and $263.2 million in cash for financing activities,respectively, compared to the $3.9 million provided by financing activities in 2011.  Total debt was $1.4 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Total debt to total capitalization was 40.2%, 42.3% and 40.7% atDecember 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The company spent approximately $738.1 million to repurchase 6,559,195 shares of common stock in 2013 compared to $472.4 million to repurchase 4,903,677 shares of common stock in 2012 andapproximately $221.8 million to repurchase 2,519,410 shares of common stock in 2011. Purchases of common stock for 2011 also included a payment of $58.9 million in cash remitted to a bank counterparty upon final settlement under an accelerated sharerepurchase agreement. The company paid cash dividends of $66.5 million,  $66.7 million and $64.6 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.    InSeptember 2013, the company amended its $600 million five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that was scheduled to expire in October 2016. The amendment includes an increase in the aggregate principal amount of credit available under thesyndicated bank credit facility to $750 million and extends the commitment termination date until September 2018. The amended credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. Thefacility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At December 31, 2013, the company was in compliance with thiscovenant. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2013 or 2012.    Contractual Obligations   Payments due under contractual obligations at December 31, 2013, are as follows:                              (dollars in millions)      Total         1 Year         2-3 Years         4-5 Years         5+ Years        Forward contracts      $  75.7          $  75.7          $             $             $            Long-term debt         1,733.0             41.3             332.2             574.4             785.1         Operating lease obligations         177.2             30.3             50.3             39.3             57.3         Acquisition and related milestones         141.2             13.2             127.0             1.0                       Purchase obligations         235.8             195.4             29.0             10.1             1.3         Legal settlements         16.3             16.3                                                   Other long-term liabilities         99.7             8.0             11.0             18.8             61.9                                                                                                   $  2,478.9          $  380.2          $  549.5          $  643.6          $  905.6                                                                                               The table above does not include $58.0 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain taxpositions and $6.6 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which theseliabilities might be paid.    Forward  contracts  - Forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchaseof currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.       II-11    Long-term debt  - Long-term debt includes expected principal and interest payments,including the effect of an interest rate swap contract.    Operating lease obligations  - The company is committedunder noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment.    Acquisition and related milestones  -The company may make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets under various acquisitionand related arrangements. The table above excludes amounts for these milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur.    Purchase obligations  - The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projectedrequirements over the related terms and are entered into in the normal course of business.    Legal settlements  -Payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims, subject to certain settlement conditions, may be made from QSFs.    Otherlong-term liabilities  - The company estimates required funding obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and deferred compensation.    Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures    Net sales on a constantcurrency basis is a non-GAAP measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact onnet sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates arecalculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures isthat they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as replacements of GAAP results.   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingentassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of managements most difficult,subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of thecompanys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. Thecritical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in determining estimates and assumptions might produce a materially different result.   Revenue Recognition  - Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at the point of delivery,and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case of consignmentinventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.       II-12    Royalty revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royaltyrevenue can be objectively determined. If royalty revenue cannot be objectively determined during the quarterly period in which it is earned, then royalty revenue is recognized in the following quarterly period when objective evidence is obtainedand the revenue becomes fixed and determinable.    Share-Based Compensation  - Share-based compensation cost is measuredat the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date, the company utilizes abinomial model. Inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historicalvolatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of impliedvolatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to expected future exercise behavior, the company considers the exercise behavior of pastgrants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date with a term equal to the contractual term of the stock option.   As share-based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimatedforfeitures. The company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant based on historical experience and revises estimates, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.   Contingencies  - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including, for example, product liability matters,environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes regarding agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time. In some cases, theclaimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. The company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and/or costs related to claims, settlements andjudgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues the minimum amount of therange. The company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limits or lessthan otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or others will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. Legal costs associated with thesematters are expensed as incurred. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Income Taxes  - Thecompany operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and internationally. The company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. These positions relate to transfer pricing, thedeductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions, state taxes and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilitiesresulting from such matters. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on the companys best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The reserves are used or reversed once thestatutes of limitation have expired or the position is effectively settled. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial condition and/or liquidity but may be material to its incometax provision and results of operations.    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns  -The company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation      II-13    at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, the averagelength of time to collect receivables, customer creditworthiness and current economic and market trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating theallowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. Thecompany establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product andother market-related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period inwhich the condition exists.    It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtfulaccounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys results of operations and financial condition could be material in theperiod of change.    Acquisitions  - In a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that theidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value, with goodwill being the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. IPR&D is capitalized and recorded as anindefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, and transaction costs are expensed as incurred. When the company acquires net assets that are not accounted for asa business combination, no goodwill is recognized.    IPR&D represents intangible assets acquired in a business combinationthat are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of eachproject or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. The determination of fair value of IPR&Dtakes into consideration: the projects stage of completion as of the acquisition date; the timing and cost of R&D work required to complete the project; the risk of a project not achieving commercial feasibility; and estimated future cashflows. Amounts capitalized as IPR&D are subject to an impairment review, using a fair value-based test, until completion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as to the useful life of theasset and amortization will begin. If the project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset will be written off.    The fair value ofthe liability for contingent consideration recorded on the acquisition date is based on probability weighted estimated cash flow streams, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with accepted valuationmethods. The liability for contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes recorded in earnings until the contingency is resolved.    The judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations.   Goodwill  - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise usinga fair value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment. The fair value of each reporting unit iscalculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-average combination of both market and income approaches. The market approach to estimating fair value is basedprimarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of areporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.       II-14    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  - Intangible assets with finite lives and otherlong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability ofassets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairmentcharge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.    PensionPlans  - The company sponsors pension plans covering certain domestic and foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense andliability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company. In addition, the company also uses subjective factors,such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer orshorter life spans of the participants. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.0 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companysnet pension cost. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.0 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companysnet pension cost.    Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information   Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the companyorally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such asanticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion offuture operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legalproceedings, and financial results. The companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.   In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves thedesign, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often used on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operatingrooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and couldlead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings) and other litigation, product withdrawals, warning letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatoryenforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.

Quantitative and Qualitative DisclosuresAbout Market Risk    Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreigncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in thecompanys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probablecommitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time-to-time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreigncurrency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts willhave a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen. Any gainsand losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreigncurrency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2013 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformlystrengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $1.2 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by$4.6 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.   The companys investment portfolio primarily includes cash equivalents for which the market values are not significantly affected bychanges in interest rates. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt is affected by a change in the medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates because the borrowings generally have longer maturities. The market value of the companysfixed-rate debt including the effect of the related interest rate swap contract effectively converting the 2.875% fixed-rate notes due 2016 to floating-rate instruments approximated $1,435.4 million at December 31, 2013. A sensitivity analysis,assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the debt and related swap are held to maturity, indicates that the market value of the debt and related swap would have approximated $1,366.7 million or$1,504.2 million, respectively, on December 31, 2013.
