Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations    This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results ofoperations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of the company and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere inthis Form 10-K. Certain statements contained herein may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; see Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-LookingInformation below.    Overview    The company designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individualhealthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe, Japan and China are the companys largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America andEastern Europe are the companys fastest growing markets. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major productgroup categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group category of other products.    The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon itssuccess in developing, acquiring and marketing differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2016, the companys research and development (R&D) expense as a percentage of net sales was 7.9%.The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may, from time-to-time, consideracquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons. The company spent$203.7 million in 2016, including acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D), for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.    Acquisitions, Legal and Other Developments    Acquisitions   On January 21, 2016, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Liberator Medical Holdings, Inc. (Liberator), apublicly-held direct-to-consumer distributor of urological catheters, ostomy supplies, mastectomy fashions and diabetic medical supplies for a purchase price of $181.1 million. This acquisition enhanced the companys position in the homehealthcare market in the United States.    On December 3, 2015, the company, through a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, acquiredall of the outstanding shares of Embo Medical Limited (Embo), a privately-held company headquartered in Galway, Ireland, specializing in the development of peripheral embolization devices. The total purchase consideration included anup-front cash payment of $21.0 million and the fair value of future additional milestone payments of up to $22.5 million that are contingent upon specific regulatory and revenue-related milestones being achieved, which had a fair value of $16.6million as of the acquisition date. The acquisition was recognized in the first quarter of 2016 for this foreign subsidiary.  For more information on acquisitions, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.   Legal Developments   During 2016, the company recorded additional charges related to product liability matters, net of estimated recoveries, to other (income)expense, net, of approximately $205 million ($139 million after tax).    For more information on legal matters, see Note 10 ofthe notes to consolidated financial statements.       II-3    Debt Issuance    On May 9, 2016, the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.000% senior unsecured notes due 2026 (3.000% Notes due 2026). Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually.Net proceeds from this offering were approximately $495.6 million, after deducting debt offering costs, consisting of underwriting commissions and offering expenses of $4.3 million and a debt issuance discount of $0.1 million, which were bothrecorded to long-term debt. The debt offering costs and debt issuance discount will be amortized over the term of the notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of outstandingcommercial paper. In addition, the companys forward starting interest rate swap was settled concurrent with the issuance of these notes. See Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.   Medical Device Excise Tax   Beginning in 2013, the medical device industry was required to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on UnitedStates sales of most medical devices. In December 2015, as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, collection of the medical device excise tax was suspended for 2016 and 2017. During 2015, the company recorded to marketing, selling andadministrative expense an excise tax of $26.9 million. The status of the excise tax for sales after December 31, 2017 is uncertain.   Results of Operations    Net Sales   Bards 2016 consolidated net sales increased 9% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) over 2015consolidated net sales. Bards 2015 consolidated net sales increased 3% on a reported basis (6% on a constant currency basis) over 2014 consolidated net sales. Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and shouldnot be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures below. Price changes had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales by approximately 40 basis points and 110 basis points for 2016 and2015, respectively, compared to the prior years. The continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a trend that may continue, had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales for 2016 by approximately one percentage point compared to the prioryear. Exchange rate fluctuations had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales for 2015 by approximately three percentage points compared to the prior year. The primary exchange rate movements that impacted net sales were the movement of theChinese Renminbi, British Pound and the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costsand expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities.    Bards 2016 United Statesnet sales of $2,559.5 million increased 8% compared to $2,378.4 million in 2015. Bards 2016 international net sales of $1,154.5 million increased 11% on a reported basis (15% on a constant currency basis) compared to $1,037.6 million in 2015.Bards 2015 United States net sales increased 5% compared to $2,263.5 million in 2014. Bards 2015 international net sales decreased 2% on a reported basis (increased 8% on a constant currency basis) compared to $1,060.1 million in 2014.      II-4    Presented below is a summary of consolidated net sales by product group category.

Net income in 2016 reflects litigation charges, net, of $139.0 million, or $1.84 per diluted share, amortization of intangible assets of $86.1million, or $1.14 per diluted share, restructuring and productivity initiative costs of $20.2 million, or $0.27 per diluted share, net charges from acquisition-related items (primarily consisting of      II-9    integration costs and purchase accounting adjustments) of $2.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, and an asset impairment of $1.2 million, or $0.02 per diluted share. The current year alsoreflects a $2.6 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, benefit to the income tax provision as a result of the completion of certain IRS examinations.   The company reported 2015 net income of $135.4 million, a decrease of 54% from 2014 net income of $294.5 million. The company reported 2015 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of$1.77, a decrease of 53% from 2014 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $3.76. Net income in 2015 reflects litigation charges, net, of $568.8 million, or $7.43 per diluted share, Gore Proceeds of $131.7 million, or $1.72per diluted share, amortization of intangible assets of $79.3 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, restructuring and productivity initiative costs of $29.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, net charges from acquisition-related items (primarilyconsisting of purchase accounting adjustments, integration costs and transaction costs) of $11.1 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, and an asset impairment of $2.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.   Liquidity and Capital Resources    The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cashflows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be a primary source of funds. The company believesthat it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary. The company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financial flexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for thefollowing years ended December 31:                              2016         2015         2014      (dollars in millions)                                   Cash and cash equivalents      $  905.0          $  950.5          $  960.1                                                              Working capital      $  1,207.5          $  708.6          $  1,339.2                                                              Current ratio         2.09/1             1.56/1             3.18/1                                                             Cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries were $806.0 million and $881.6million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. It is the companys intention to permanently reinvest the majority of these funds outside the United States to finance foreign operations, and the companys plans do not demonstrate aneed to repatriate these funds. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations for currently unforeseen circumstances or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes onthe earnings associated with these funds. In the United States, ongoing operating cash flows and available borrowings under the companys committed syndicated bank credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity.   For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash provided by operating activities was $546.6 million, $798.1 million and$660.0 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to higher payments to claimants for certain product liability matters in the current year period partially offset bylower tax payments in 2016 compared to 2015, a decrease in settlement payments pursuant to an agreement with Medtronic (see Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements) in 2016 compared to 2015 and the receipt of the Gore Proceeds in2015. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the receipt of the Gore Proceeds in 2015, lower tax payments in 2015 compared to 2014, and higher operational cash flows. These increaseswere partially offset by settlement payments pursuant to an agreement with Medtronic and higher payments to claimants for certain product liability matters in the current year period.   During 2016, the company used $423.9 million in cash for investing activities, $212.5 million more than in 2015. During 2015, the companyused $211.4 million in cash for investing activities, $48.1 million more than in       II-10    2014. Capital expenditures amounted to $100.3 million, $102.9 million and $126.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The company spent $203.7 millionin 2016, $98.3 million in 2015 and $13.3 million in 2014 for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies to augment existing product lines. In addition, the company received net proceeds from the sale of financial instruments acquiredin the Medicon Acquisition of $21.0 million in 2015. Net cash used in investing activities reflects an increase of $121.1 million in 2016 and an increase of $31.2 million in both 2015 and 2014 in restricted cash related to payments to qualifiedsettlement funds (QSFs) for certain product liability matters.    During 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company used$149.8 million, $554.1 million and $584.4 million in cash for financing activities, respectively. Total debt was $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total debt to total capitalization was 49.5%, 48.9% and 45.0%at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which reflects net proceeds of $495.6 million from the issuance fixed-rate partially offset by the redemption of other fixed rate debt of $250 million. The company spent approximately $406.9 millionto repurchase 2,000,000 shares of common stock in 2016 compared to $498.7 million to repurchase 2,745,289 shares of common stock in 2015 and $659.6 million to repurchase 4,497,427 shares of common stock in 2014. The company paid cash dividends of$74.6 million, $69.4 million and $66.2 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The company made a contingent milestone payment of $100.0 million in 2014 related to the acquisition of Lutonix, of which $70.0 million represented the fair valuepreviously established at the acquisition date and was included in financing activities.   In November 2016, the company amendedits $1.0 billion five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that was scheduled to expire in November 2020. The amendment extends the commitment termination date until November 2021. The amended credit facility supports the companyscommercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit ratings and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to totalcapitalization. At December 31, 2016, the company was in compliance with this covenant. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2016 or 2015.    Contractual Obligations    Payments due under contractual obligations atDecember 31, 2016, are as follows:                               (dollars in millions)      Total         1 Year         2-3 Years         4-5 Years         5+ Years        Forward contracts      $  243.2          $  213.2          $  30.0          $              $             Long-term debt, including current maturities         2,002.0             53.9             597.5             583.1             767.5         Operating lease obligations         149.0             35.0             51.4             25.6             37.0         Acquisition and related milestones         78.8             14.9             35.0             16.0             12.9         Purchase obligations         397.8             241.4             82.7             36.1             37.6         Legal settlements         605.3             605.3                                                      Other long-term liabilities         130.0             10.9             17.4             15.6             86.1                                                                                                   $  3,606.1          $  1,174.6          $  814.0          $  676.4          $  941.1                                                                                               The table above does not include $21.5 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain taxpositions and $2.6 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which theseliabilities might be paid.    Forward contracts  -Forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchase ofcurrencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.    Long-term debt, including currentmaturities  - Long-term debt, including current maturities, includes expected principal and interest payments.       II-11    Operating lease obligations  - The company is committed under noncancelable operatingleases involving certain facilities and equipment.    Acquisition and related milestones  - The company may make paymentsto third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets under various acquisition and related arrangements. Inaddition, the company is also required to make annual future payments to Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., its former joint venture partner, as part of the Medicon Acquisition. The table above excludes amounts for these milestone payments unlessthe payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur.    Purchase obligations  - The companys business creates a needto enter into commitments with suppliers. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are entered into in the normal course of business.   Legal settlements  - Estimated amounts recorded to accrued expenses for product liability and other legal matters. The table abovedoes not include non-current accruals for product liability and other legal matters of $596.2 million and expected recoveries of $267.3 million, of which $156.2 million was recorded to other current assets, at December 31, 2016. Payments and finalsettlements for certain of these matters are subject to numerous factors and conditions (outside the companys control) that make timing and ultimate resolution uncertain.   Other long-term liabilities  - The company estimates required funding obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefitplans and deferred compensation.    Certain Regulatory Matters    In October 2014 and November 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted directed inspections at two of the companys facilities after which the FDA issuedForm-483s to the company in connection with these inspections. On July 14, 2015, the company received a Warning Letter from the Los Angeles District office of the FDA. The Warning Letter specifically cited quality systems and medicaldevice reporting observations relating to non-conformances previously identified in the Form-483 notices for Glens Falls, New York and Tempe, Arizona and appropriate market clearance or approval of two models of our Recovery Cone Removal Systemsused to retrieve certain implanted filters. The Warning Letter stated that, until the company resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, no premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonablyrelated will be cleared or approved. The company responded to the Form-483 notices and the Warning Letter, and in each case, implemented corrective and preventive actions to address the concerns identified and on February 18, 2016, received marketclearance for the two models of the Recovery Cone Removal Systems. The FDA conducted planned follow-up inspections at the Glens Falls and Tempe facilities during the first quarter of 2016 which resulted in the FDA issuing Form-483s identifyingobservations regarding the quality systems at these facilities. The company responded to the FDA and implemented corrective and preventive actions to address the observations. In May 2016, the FDA notified the company that the FDA required furtherfollow-up re-inspections with respect to the issues cited in the Warning Letter. In November 2016, the FDA re-inspected both the Glenn Falls and Tempe facilities with no inspection observations noted. Subsequently, in December 2016, the FDA notifiedthe company that the observations relating to the Glenn Falls and Tempe facilities contained in the Form-483 notices and the Warning Letter had been satisfactorily resolved and closed out.   In the second quarter of 2016, the FDA conducted an inspection at another of the companys facilities after which the FDA issued aForm-483 to the company in connection with this inspection. The company responded to the FDA, is in the process of addressing the observations in the Form-483, and intends to fully implement corrective and preventive actions to address theFDAs concerns. However, the company cannot give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its response to the Form-483 or to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the Form-483. Although the company cannot give anyassurances that the resolution of this       II-12    matter will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial conditions and/or liquidity, the company does not at this time believe this willhave a material impact on its financial statements.    Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures   Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis tobetter measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis providesan additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchangerate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAP measures are intended tosupplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as replacements of GAAP results.    Critical Accounting Policies andEstimates    The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptionsthat affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accountingpolicies are those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequentperiods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financialstatements. See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in determining estimates and assumptions might produce a materially differentresult.    Revenue Recognition  - Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at thepoint of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case ofconsignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.    Royaltyrevenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalty revenue can be objectively determined. If royalty revenue cannot be objectively determined during the quarterly period in which it is earned, then royalty revenue isrecognized in the following quarterly period when objective evidence is obtained and the revenue becomes fixed and determinable.    Share-Based Compensation  - Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basisover the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life,risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews thetrading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stockoption valuations. With respect to expected future exercise behavior, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve ineffect at the grant date with a term equal to the contractual term of the stock option.       II-13    Contingencies  - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims,including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes regarding agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be knownfor extended periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. The company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and/orcosts related to claims, settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, thecompany accrues the minimum amount of the range. The company records expected recoveries from its product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Amounts recovered under these arrangementsmay be less than the stated coverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or others will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will beotherwise available. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Income Taxes  - The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and internationally. The company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves foruncertain tax positions. These positions relate to transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions, state taxes and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion,adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on the companys best judgment given the facts, circumstances and informationavailable at the reporting date. The reserves are used or reversed once the statutes of limitation have expired or the position is effectively settled. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impacton its financial condition and/or liquidity but may be material to its income tax provision and results of operations.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns  - The company makes estimates of the uncollectibilityof the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reservesnecessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, the average length of time to collect receivables, customer creditworthiness and current economic and market trends. Thecompany establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts deemed uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of thecustomers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating theadjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market-related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditionscause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists.    It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the changeto the underlying factors, the impact to the companys results of operations and financial condition could be material in the period of change.    Acquisitions  - In a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value, with goodwillbeing the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. IPR&D is capitalized and recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, contingent consideration is recorded atfair value at the acquisition date, and transaction costs are expensed as incurred. When the company acquires net assets that are not accounted for as a business combination, no goodwill is recognized.       II-14    IPR&D represents intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are used inresearch and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each projector technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. The determination of fair value of IPR&D takes intoconsideration: the projects stage of completion as of the acquisition date; the timing and cost of R&D work required to complete the project; the risk of a project not achieving commercial feasibility; and estimated future cash flows.Amounts capitalized as IPR&D are subject to an impairment review, using a fair value-based test, until completion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as to the useful life of the assetand amortization will begin. If the project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset will be written off.    The fair value of theliability for contingent consideration recorded on the acquisition date is based on probability weighted estimated cash flow streams, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with accepted valuation methods.The liability for contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes recorded in earnings until the contingency is resolved.    The judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations.   Goodwill  - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise usinga fair-value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment. The fair value of each reporting unit iscalculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-average combination of both market and income approaches. The market approach to estimating fair value is basedprimarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of areporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  - Intangible assets with finite lives and other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flowsexpected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.   Pension Plans  - The company sponsors pension plans covering certain domestic and foreign employees who meeteligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expectedreturn on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company. In 2016, the company changed its method used in calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost. See Note 12 of the notesto consolidated financial statements. In addition, the company also uses subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual resultsdue to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant,would have an estimated $1.5 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost. A       II-15    change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.1 million favorable(unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost.    New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted   In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update that clarifies thedefinition of a business by providing a more robust framework to evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as an acquisition of assets or business. This update is expected to reduce the number of transactions that will be accounted foras an acquisition of a business. The effects of this update will depend on future acquisitions. The company intends to adopt this standard early as of the beginning of Bards 2017 fiscal year.   In November 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires the change in the total of cash, cash equivalents, andrestricted cash to be shown in the statement of cash flows. As a result, transfers between cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash will no longer be presented in the statement of cash flows. This update will be effective as of the beginning ofBards 2018 fiscal year, with early adoption permitted. Other than the impact of this change on the statements of cash flows, this update is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.   In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that requires the immediate recognition of the income taxeffects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory at the time of the transfer. This update will be effective as of the beginning of Bards 2018 fiscal year, with early adoption permitted at the beginning of an annual period. Thecompany is assessing the impact of inter-entity transfers on the companys consolidated financial statements.    In March2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update that includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments, including the income tax items and the classification of these items on thestatement of cash flows. This update will be effective as of the beginning of Bards 2017 fiscal year. This standard will result in the recognition of excess income tax benefits to the consolidated statements of income upon settlement ofshare-based compensation awards, which is largely dependent on the exercise/vesting of awards and variables such as the companys stock price at the time of the exercise/vesting of awards and the exercise price of the underlying awards. Otherthan the recognition of excess income tax benefits which may be material to the consolidated statements of income and the classification of these items on the statements of cash flows, this update is not expected to have a material impact on thecompanys consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to use in theaccounting for leases. The new standard will require, among other items, lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. This standard will be effective as of the beginning ofBards 2019 fiscal year. Other than this impact to the companys consolidated balance sheet, the new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.   In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that provides for a comprehensive model to use in the accounting for revenuearising from contracts with customers. Under this standard, revenue will be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled inexchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to defer this standards effective date for one year, which will now begin with Bards 2018 fiscal year. Under this standard, the companyexpects to recognize royalty revenue in earlier periods than under its current policy, and for other contracts that do not meet the new criteria for recognizing revenue over time. In addition, revenue will be recognized in earlier periods, where thecompany maintains risk of loss for products that are in-transit to the customer. The company has made substantial progress in its evaluation of the new standard, and other than these items, this standard is not expected to have a material      II-16    impact on the companys consolidated financial statements. The company will continue to assess the new standard, as well as updates to the standard that have been proposed by the FASB. Thecompany intends to adopt the standard under the modified retrospective approach beginning with Bards 2018 fiscal year.    Risks andUncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information    Certain statements contained herein or in othercompany documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the factthat they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan,believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current andanticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. The companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made,and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.    In addition, there are substantial risksinherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often used on, or permanently or temporarilyimplanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associatedwith adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings) and other litigation,product withdrawals, warning letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory investigations or enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, resultsof operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.    Because actual results are affected by these and other risks anduncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to thoseaddressed above and those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to:   Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including:                  the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing processes and supply chainprograms or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses;                   the effects of negative publicity and/or adverse media coverage concerning our products, competitors products, the geographic or product marketsin which we compete or our industry in general, which could result in product withdrawals, decreased product demand or adverse reputational effects and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products;                  the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and successfullyintegrate such transactions or to obtain agreements for such transactions on favorable terms;                   the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost-containment pressures or preferences for alternatetherapies;                   the ability to implement, and realize the benefits of, our prior and planned investments in our business, including research and developmentexpenditures focused on new market categories, and our plan to grow in emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States and acquire growth platforms designed to change the mix of our portfolio towards faster, sustainable long-termgrowth;       II-17                the uncertainty of whether research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales;                  the ability to reduce exposure and uncertainty related to tax audits, appeals and litigation;                  the risk that the company may not successfully implement its expansion of its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information system andother productivity initiatives, including ongoing efforts to outsource certain information technology system functions and services;                   internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales force employees;                  the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some ofwhich are more profitable than others, and projected royalty revenue from Gore;                   changes in factors and assumptions or actual results that differ from our assumptions on stock valuation and employee stock option exercise patterns,which could cause compensation and tax expense recorded in future periods to differ significantly from the compensation expense recorded in the current period;                  changes in factors and assumptions could cause pension cost recorded in future periods to differ from the pension cost recorded in the current period;                  the effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in the companys pension plans and the possibility that the company may need to makeadditional contributions to the plans as a result of any decline in the fair value of such assets;                   damage to a facility where our products are manufactured or from which they are distributed, which could render the company unable to manufacture ordistribute one or more products and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets;                  the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assetsspecifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets;                   the ability to obtain appropriate levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all;                  the ability to recover for claims made to our insurance companies or under indemnification obligations to the company and that any amounts recoveredunder these arrangements may not be adequate to cover the companys damages and/or costs; and                   the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities and productivity initiatives to improve the companys overall coststructure and improve efficiency.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign currency exchangerate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companysinternational operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitmentsdenominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time-to-time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currencydenominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have ahigh correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian Dollar, and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expectedto offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent thatforeign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2016 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, thefair value of these contracts would increase by $11.3 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $12.5 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value ofderivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.    The companys investment portfolio primarily includes cash equivalents for which the market values are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the companysfixed-rate debt is affected by a change in the medium- to long-term interest rates because the borrowings generally have longer maturities. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt approximated $1,688.0 million at December 31,2016. A sensitivity analysis, assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates and assuming that the debt is held to maturity, indicates that the market value of the debt would have approximated $1,614.9 million or$1,766.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016.
