Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions    General  For more than 90 years, C. R. Bard, Inc. has committed its resources to creating innovative solutions to meet the needs of both health care providers and their patients. The company is a global leader in the development, manufacture and supply of products and services to the health care industry. Bard addresses the health care opportunity through disease state management - an approach that expands the focus from products and technologies to the underlying clinical condition, thereby positioning the company as an indispensable partner to the deliverers of health care. Bard is committed to developing leadership franchises within the disease states and using these strategic positions to leverage the company's growth.  After a significant divestiture and restructuring program, Bard has demonstrated improved growth and profitability trends in 1999.  Summary Results  Bard reported 1999 net sales of $1,036.5 million, up 7% over 1998 net sales of ongoing products of $968.9 million. The company demonstrated substantial sales growth in each of its four product groups: vascular, urology, oncology and surgery. Bard reported net income of $118.1 million or $2.28 of diluted earnings per share in 1999 compared with net income of $252.3 million or $4.51 of diluted earnings per share in 1998. Both years' earnings include one-time items. Without these one-time items, diluted earnings per share was $2.27 in 1999 and $1.76 in 1998, a 29% increase. Net of one-time items, Bard also significantly increased its margin of net income to net sales to 11.3% from 8.4% in 1998.  Results of Operations - 1999 vs. 1998  Net sales for 1999 totaled $1,036.5 million. Bard reported net sales for 1998 of $1,164.7 million, which included sales from products which were divested during that year. On an ongoing product basis, 1999 net sales represent a 7% increase over 1998 net sales of $968.9 million. Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 1999 net sales by 1.1% and 0.4%, respectively.  Sales of vascular products increased 8% in 1999 to $226.2 million. The electrophysiology and peripheral technology franchises continued to show strong worldwide growth. IMPRA graft sales also displayed healthy growth in 1999.  Urology product group sales increased 4% in 1999 to $353.6 million. Basic drainage products experienced double-digit growth, fueled by outstanding sales of the Infection Control Foley catheter.  Sales of oncology products increased 12% in 1999 to $238.0 million. Specialty access products demonstrated balanced growth worldwide, while interventional products showed particularly strong growth internationally.  Sales of surgery products grew 11% in 1999 to $164.5 million, paced by the mesh product line, used primarily in hernia repair.  The product group areas discussed above represent substantially all of Bard's ongoing product sales.     II-3  Net sales by product group for the last three years (in thousands) are:        1999    1998    1997     Vascular   $ 226,200    $ 209,000    $ 198,000     Urology   353,600    339,800    323,400     Oncology   238,000    213,100    199,100     Surgery	   164,500    148,400    134,800     Other ongoing products   54,200     58,600     58,200      Total ongoing products   1,036,500    968,900    913,500     Divested products   ---     195,800     300,000      Net sales   $1,036,500     $1,164,700     $1,213,500          Net sales in the U. S. of ongoing products rose 7% to $736.7 million. The oncology and surgery products provided the best growth.  Net sales of ongoing products outside the U.S. also increased 7% to $299.8 million, with growth demonstrated by vascular and oncology products. For the year, a stronger dollar had the impact of reducing these sales by 1%.  Bard markets its products through direct selling organizations and selected distributors throughout the world. The geographic breakdown of net sales of ongoing products for each of the last three years is proportioned as follows: United States - 71%, Europe - 19%, Japan - 5% and Other - 5%.  Despite continued pricing pressure, cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales declined from 47.6% in 1998 to 44.6% in 1999. These improved results are due to the company's ongoing manufacturing restructuring programs and the divestitures of the lower-margin cardiology businesses.  Marketing, selling and administrative expense declined 13% in 1999. As a percent of sales, these expenses declined to 31.9% from 32.6% in 1998. This reduction was attributed to the cardiology divestitures and improved efficiency in the company's sales and administration efforts. Reported research and development expense declined 26%, due to the impact of the cardiology divestitures; however, research and development spending on non-divested businesses increased in 1999.  Interest expense declined 27% in 1999 due to lower average debt levels and improved operating cash flow.  Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-24 in this report for a summary of items in this category in the last three years. Included in 1999 is a pretax charge of $8.4 million for the writedown of impaired assets and $2.1 million of interest income.  The company recorded one-time gains in both 1999 and 1998 related to the dispositions of its cardiology product lines. A pretax gain of $9.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999 and a pretax gain of $329.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1998. Please refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-16 for additional disclosure.  The effective tax rate was 31.9% in 1999 and 45.7% in 1998. The 1998 effective tax rate includes the impact of the gain from the disposition of the cardiology businesses, which was taxed at an effective rate of approximately 50%.  II-4  Net Income  In 1999, Bard reported net income of $118.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.28. Excluding the impact of the after-tax gain on the sale of the cardiopulmonary business of $0.12 and the after-tax impact of the fourth quarter writedown of impaired assets of ($0.11), diluted earnings per share was $2.27.  In 1998, Bard reported net income of $252.3 million or diluted earnings per share of $4.51. Excluding the impact of the after-tax gain on the sale of the cardiology businesses of $2.93, the net after-tax loss from one-time items of ($0.13) and the after-tax impact of the Year 2000 costs of ($0.05), diluted earnings per share was $1.76.  In 1997, Bard reported net income of $72.3 million or diluted earnings per share of $1.26. Excluding the net after-tax loss from one-time items of ($0.38) and the after-tax impact of the Year 2000 costs of ($0.03), diluted earnings per share was $1.67.  Results of Operations - 1998 vs. 1997  Net sales for 1998 totaled $1,164.7 million, which represents a 4% decline from the prior year mostly due to the 1998 divestiture of the cardiology businesses. Full year net sales of ongoing products were $968.9 million, an increase of 6% over comparable 1997 results. Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 1998 reported net sales by 2% and 1%, respectively.  Sales of vascular products rose 6% in 1998. Peripheral technology and electrophysiology devices showed strong worldwide growth.  Urology product sales grew 5% in 1998. The Infection Control Foley catheter and the brachytherapy business provided the majority of the growth in this area.  Sales of oncology products increased 7% in 1998. Specialty access devices showed good growth particularly in international markets.  Sales of surgery products grew 10% in 1998, propelled by high worldwide growth of mesh products, used primarily for hernia repair.  Net sales in the U.S. of ongoing products rose 5% to $687.9 million. The vascular and surgery products provided the best growth.  Net sales of ongoing products outside the U.S. increased 8% to $281.0 million with growth demonstrated by urology, oncology and surgery products.  Global pricing pressures together with the additional expenditures related to Bard's ongoing manufacturing restructuring effort increased cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales to 47.6% in 1998 from 47.2% in 1997.  Marketing, selling and administrative expense declined 3% in 1998. As a percent of net sales, these expenses increased due to the effect of several one-time items such as Year 2000 functionality expenditures. Reported research and development expense declined 15% in 1998 as a result of the sale of the cardiology businesses, while Bard's spending on its ongoing products was consistent with the prior year.  II-5  Interest expense declined 20% in 1998 due primarily to Bard's decision to utilize a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the cardiology businesses to repay short-term debt.  Other (income) expense, net, in 1998 included a net gain of $48.6 million from the settlement of various patent infringement and legal claims, a charge of $34.1 million for the writedown of assets primarily associated with divested businesses and a charge of $6.4 million related to acquired research and development.  In 1998, the company divested several cardiology product lines. These transactions closed in the fourth quarter of 1998 and the company recorded a pretax gain of $329.2 million.  The effective tax rate was 45.7% in 1998 and 31.1% in 1997. The increase in 1998 was largely the result of the sale of the cardiology businesses.  Net Income  In 1998, net income increased to $252.3 million including a gain on the sale of the cardiology businesses and other one-time items as described earlier in this review.  Year 2000 Functionality  Bard did not experience any significant internal business disruptions as a result of the calendar change to the Year 2000 functionality. To date Bard has not observed any significant disruptions at either its major customers or vendors.  The company has reviewed fourth quarter 1999 sales activity and believes that there was no significant customer stocking activity related to Year 2000 preparations. The company does not believe that it will experience significant return activity or lower 2000 sales as a result of Year 2000 activities.  The company's marketing, selling and administrative expense included $3.3 million for IT-related Year 2000 expenditures in 1999, $4.7 million in 1998 and $2.8 million in 1997. The company anticipates that it will spend approximately $800,000 in 2000 for final system tests and retrofitting. These incremental costs do not include existing internal resources allocated to Year 2000 project efforts.  Financial Condition and Liquidity  Bard's financial condition remains strong. Total debt was $288.7 million at December 31, 1999, up from $162.0 million at December 31, 1998. This increase was primarily the result of acquisitions of products and technologies, repurchases of common stock and additions to cash at year-end to address the risk of Year 2000-related liquidity constraints. Total debt to total capitalization was 33.5% at December 31, 1999, compared to 22.2% at December 31, 1998, while net debt, or debt less cash and short-term investments to total capitalization was 25.1% at December 31, 1999, compared to 17.4% at December 31, 1998. Shareholders' investment was impacted in 1999 by the repurchase of $82.7 million of common stock.  The company has a $300 million syndicated, committed credit facility with a group of 12 banks. The company made no borrowings under this credit facility in 1999. The facility expires May 31, 2000. This facility supports a commercial paper program of $300 million. The company borrows actively under this program.     II-6  In addition to the $300 million committed credit facility, Bard maintains uncommitted credit lines with banks for short-term cash needs and these lines were used as needed during the last three years. At December 31, 1999, the unused uncommitted lines of credit totaled $131.5 million.  Cash provided from operations continued to be the company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. The company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility.  Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights, and other related items were approximately $48 million in 1999, $50 million in 1998, and $23 million in 1997. The majority of these investments were for intangible assets, reflecting the premium over book value for these purchases. The majority of the cash outlays were financed with additional debt, with the balance coming from cash from operations.  Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market to replace shares issued under various employee stock plans. In connection with the announced sale of the cardiology businesses, the Board of Directors in July of 1998 authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 10 million shares of common stock. Total shares purchased were 1,629,600 in 1999; 6,295,200 in 1998; and 955,200 in 1997.  Foreign Currency Risk  The company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts and options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. Contracts have been exclusively for the forward purchase of, and options in, currencies in which the company has known or anticipated payments. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide short-term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values.  Please refer to Note 4, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-18 of this report for current details of the company's foreign exchange contracts.  On January 1, 1999, the eleven member countries of the European Union began the transition to a common currency, the "Euro." These participating countries expect the Euro transition to be completed by July 2002.  The company is currently evaluating potential Euro-related issues including: pricing/marketing strategy, conversion of computer systems, existing contracts and currency risk in the participating countries. At the present time, management does not believe the Euro conversion will have a materially adverse impact on our business.

Acquisitions and Dispositions  For information on the company's acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, please see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-16.
