Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results          of Operations and of Financial Conditions     General  Bard is a leading multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of products for the large and growing health care industry.  Worldwide health care expenditures approximated $1.9 trillion in 1993 with about half that amount spent in the United States.  Bard's segment of this industry, itself a multi-billion dollar market, is primarily specialized products used primarily in hospitals, in outpatient centers and in physician's offices to meet the needs of the medical profession in caring for their patients.  The Company seeks to focus and concentrate on selected markets with cost-effective, innovative products and specialized sales forces to maximize the opportunities in these markets.  Operating Results  Net sales decreased 2% in 1993, reflecting the sale of the MedSystems division, the impact of foreign currency translations and the dramatic changes in the industry.  Net income decreased 25%, reflecting several nonrecurring items, primarily the $61 million pretax provision for the settlement with the Justice Department.  1993 Sales Data  Consolidated net sales totaled $970.8 million in 1993, a decrease of $19.4 million or 2% for the year.  Sales were lowered a total of 4% by the impact of the sale of the Bard MedSystems division in February 1993 (3%) and the impact of generally lower foreign currency values (1%).  Sales in 1993 were also negatively affected by a slowdown in U.S. procedural rates, consolidations of health care providers, limited FDA approvals, increasingly conservative medical practices fostered by the growth of managed care and weaker European economies.  Worldwide sales increased 1% in the urological product group.  Good increases in several relatively new specialty devices were partially offset by declines in other areas.  Sales of surgical products decreased 1% but increased 8% after adjusting for the sale of the MedSystems division.  Specialty access, endoscopic, laparo- scopic and blood management products contributed significantly to this increase.  Cardiovascular product sales decreased 5% worldwide with most product areas in this group showing declines.  Sales in the United States decreased 1% in 1993 to $687.9 million, representing 71% of total sales.  Urological product sales increased while sales of surgical products (due to the sale of MedSystems) and cardiovascular products decreased.                                       II-3  Sales outside the U.S. were $282.9 million in 1993, a decline of 3% from 1992 and represented 29% of total sales.  Changes in foreign currency values in 1993 lowered these sales by nearly 5%.  Growth in sales of surgical products were more than offset by decreases in urological and cardiovascular sales.  Sales increases were good in Japan and Germany.    The geographic breakdown of sales outside the U.S. for 1993 is:  Europe, Middle East, Africa - 56%; Japan, Asia/Pacific - 37% and Western Hemisphere, excluding the United States - 7%.  1992 Sales Data  In 1992 consolidated net sales totaled $990.2 million, an increase of $114.2 million or 13% from the prior year.  U.S. sales, which were 70% of total consolidated sales, increased 13% while sales outside the U.S. increased 12% for the year.  Changes in foreign currency values in 1992 accounted for approximately 2 percentage points of the sales growth outside the U.S.  Operating Income  Gross profit margins rose in 1993 for the third straight year.  The rates were 50.9% in 1993, 48.4% in 1992 and 46.6% in 1991.  Productivity gains, cost reductions and a favorable product mix in many product areas contributed to this improvement in the last three years.  A pretax charge of $2.6 million for severance costs related to a plant closing is included in 1993 cost of goods sold.  Bard uses the LIFO method of valuing substantially all U.S. inventories, which results in current costs (higher in a period of inflation) being charged to cost of goods sold.  Bard generally has been able to recover these costs through its strong product position in its markets.  The Company also strives to offset the effect of inflation through its cost reduction programs.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses (which exclude research and development) increased $2.9 million in 1993, or less than 1%.  R&D expenses increased nearly 10% in 1993 as the Company works toward new technologies and enhancements for the future.  Operating income of $128.5 million increased 5.0% in 1993, reflecting the increased gross profit margin and, as a percent of net sales, was 13.2% compared with 12.4% in 1992.  Operating income in 1992 increased 31.6% from 1991 due primarily to a higher gross profit margin.                                       II-4  Other Expense, Net  The 1993 results included a third quarter pretax provision for the Justice Department settlement of $61 million, a fourth quarter pretax gain of $32.7 million from the sale of shares of the common stock of Ventritex, Inc., and a first quarter pretax gain of $10.9 million from the sale of the MedSystems division net of several nonrecurring charges.  The 1992 results included a gain of $5.9 million from the sale of common stock of Ventritex and a comparable amount for provisions for expenses associated with legal and regulatory matters.  Income Tax  The effective income tax rate was 37.2% in 1993, 29.9% in 1992 and 25.6% in 1991.  The increase in 1993 was primarily due to the $61 million Justice Department settlement, which was not fully deductible, and a 1% tax rate increase to 35% effective January 1, 1993.  The increase in the 1992 rate was primarily due to a reduction in the portion of Bard's taxable income being generated outside the United States at lower effective tax rates.  The tax benefit from operations in Puerto Rico and Ireland favorably affected the tax rate in each year.  As a result of the Omnibus Tax Reconciliation Act of 1993, the effective tax rate in 1994 will be affected slightly, primarily due to a reduction in the tax benefit derived from the Company's manufacturing operations in Puerto Rico.  Income  Net income for 1993 totaled $56 million, or $1.07 per share, which was 25% lower than in 1992.  As a percent of sales, net income was 5.8% in 1993 compared with 7.6% in 1992 and 6.5% in 1991.  Nonrecurring items that affected net income in 1993 were (in millions): Gain on sale of Ventritex stock                          $ 19.4 Gain on sale of MedSystems division and other   one-time charges                                          6.0 Severance costs related to plant closing                   (1.8) Effect of accounting change for postretirement   benefits                                                 (6.1) Provision for the Justice Department settlement   agreement                                               (45.4)    Net income effect of nonrecurring items                $(27.9)  After adjusting for these items, net income would have been higher than reported by $27.9 million, or $.53 per share.  In 1992 net income was $1.42 per share, or $75 million in total, which was 31% higher than 1991.                                       II-5  Financial Condition  Bard's financial condition remained strong in 1993.  Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $124 million in 1993 from $103.6 million in 1992.  While the Company had cash outlays totaling $101.4 million for acquisitions of businesses, patents, trademarks and other long-term investments, total debt increased a modest $20 million from $133 million to $153 million in 1993.  The ratio of total debt to total capitalization increased from 25.3% to 28.5% with total capitalization increasing $10.7 million to $536.1 million.  Long-term debt was essentially unchanged at $68.5 million at the end of 1993, with $60 million of it at a fixed rate of 8.69% until scheduled repayment in September 1999.  Bard maintains credit lines with banks for short-term cash needs.  These facilities were used as needed during 1993.  The current unused lines of credit total $141 million.  As now structured, the Company should generate substantially all funds needed for operations and capital expenditures.  The Company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary, including the payments to the Justice Department required as a result of the plea agreement reached in October 1993.  Under the terms of the settlement, $30.5 million is payable 30 days after court approval plus two annual instalments of $15.25 million each.  As presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page II-11 of this report, net cash flows from operating activities totaled $124 million in 1993.  Net income, depreciation and amortization provided a total of $91.5 million, and included the gain on disposal of assets of $50.4 million.  Increases in current liabilities, excluding debt, provided a total of $27 million, including $30.5 million of the $61 million payable under the Justice Department settlement.  Other long-term liabilities increased by $46.2 million, of which $30.5 million is the balance of the settlement amount and $10 million is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation charged to income in the first quarter of 1993.  All other operating activities provided $9.7 million net including a total of $12.9 million provided from decreases in accounts receivable and inventories.  Investing activities used $67.1 million in 1993.  Capital expenditures totaled $30.7 million and proceeds from the sale of assets provided $65 million.  $101.4 million was used for the acquisition of businesses, patents, trademarks and other related items, and long-term investments.  Financing activities in 1993 used a total of $30.4 million.  Common stock purchases used $24.4 million and dividends used $28.2 million.  Other financing activities, primarily proceeds from short-term borrowings, provided $22.2 million net.                                       II-6  Total cash flows, including a $1.3 million translation adjustment, resulted in an increase in cash and short-term investments of $25.2 million.  As noted, capital expenditures in 1993 were $30.7 million compared with $30 million in the prior year.  Expenditures for 1994 are anticipated at $35-$40 million.  Research and development spending was $66.3 million in 1993, up 9.6% from 1992.  Planned expenditures for 1994 are about $80 million, a 20% increase.  Purchases of Bard common stock by the Company totaled (in millions) $24.4, $14.0 and $6.4 in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.  In January 1993 the Board of Directors authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 2 million shares of which 1 million were purchased in 1993.  The Board of Directors declared dividends of 13 cents per share for the first two quarters of 1993 and in July 1993 increased the dividend to 14 cents per share.  At February 1994 the indicated annual dividend rate is 56 cents per share.  Dividends for 1993 of 54 cents per share were up from 50 cents per share paid in 1992.

Acquisitions and Dispositions  In 1993 the Company acquired the operations of Solco Hospital Products Group, Inc., Pilot Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. and Bainbridge Sciences, Inc. in separate transactions for a total of $70 million.  The Bard MedSystems division was sold in 1993 with a pretax gain of $15.9 million.  The 1993 acquisitions, and several other investments and acquisitions in 1993, 1992 and 1991 were not significant to the Company's operations as a whole.
