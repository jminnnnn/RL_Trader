Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results          of Operations and of Financial Conditions     General  Bard is a leading multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of products for the large and growing health care industry.  Worldwide health care expenditures approximated $2.3 trillion in 1996 with about half that amount spent in the United States.  Bard's segment of this industry, itself a multi-billion dollar market, is primarily specialized products used mainly in hospitals, in outpatient centers and in physician's offices to meet the needs of the medical profession in caring for their patients.  We seek to focus and concentrate on selected markets with cost-effective, innovative products and specialized sales forces to maximize our opportunities in these markets.  Summary Results  Consolidated net sales increased 5% in 1996 with the growth well balanced among product groups and geographic areas.  Net income increased 7% and earnings per share rose 6%, with 1996 and 1995 income both affected by one-time charges, which are described below.  One-time Items Affecting Results  Net income was affected in 1996 by one-time charges of $29.8 million, partially offset by a total of $18.6 million for the reversal of tax reserves no longer required and certain other items.   These  charges  and  income  items  are  described  on page II-6 of this financial review and resulted in a net after-tax reduction in income of $11.2 million.  Net income in 1995 was reduced by $13.5 million reflecting the costs of combining the operations of MedChem and AHS into Bard.  Net income in 1994 was reduced by $16.9 million for certain legal fees and settlements.  Results of Operations - 1996 vs. 1995  Net sales totaled $1.194 billion in 1996, a 5% increase over 1995.  Price reductions totaled about 2% worldwide while a stronger dollar reduced reported sales by 1%.  Sales of cardiovascular products rose 5% in 1996 to $394.2 million.  Radiology devices showed strong growth, primarily in markets outside the U.S.  Sales of cardiac assist devices acquired from St. Jude Medical in January 1996 also added to the cardiovascular growth rate.                                II-3  Results of Operations - 1996 vs. 1995 (continued)  Urological product group sales totaled $342.4 million in 1996, a 6% increase over 1995.  Basic drainage products such as Foley catheters and trays, other procedural trays, urinary bags and meters and specialty devices all contributed to this growth.  Our growth in urological products was high in the U.S. market and we continue to try to broaden our international market penetration.  Surgical product group sales increased 4% in 1996 to $457.8 million with the growth in international markets a little higher than in the U.S.  The additional sales generated from the September 1996 IMPRA acquisition contributed significantly to surgical product growth.  Individual areas of good performance continue to be our vascular access catheters and ports, hernia repair fabrics, and orthopaedic irrigation devices.  This was substantially offset by declines in basic drainage and general surgery devices.  Sales in the United States grew 4% in 1996 to $782.0 million, representing 65% of worldwide sales.  Urological turned in the highest growth rate of our three product groups, but surgical continues to generate the most revenue.  Cardiovascular sales showed only a marginal increase in 1996 as fourth quarter new product launches did not have enough time to generate increased sales momentum.  Sales outside the U.S. grew 6% in 1996 to $412.4 million, representing 35% of worldwide sales, compared with 34% in 1995.  Growth was highest in the cardiovascular product area, primarily from strong balloon angioplasty product sales in Europe.  Balloon angioplasty products continued to do better outside the U.S. due to a quicker regulatory approval process in most international markets.  Sales of urological products showed a small increase outside the U.S.  Significant declines in basic surgical suction, irrigation, drainage and general surgery products offset good increases in sales of several other surgical group products.  The effect of currency translation was to lower international sales by almost 3% for the year.  Excluding this effect, reported international sales would have increased 9% over the prior year.  The geographic breakdown of sales outside the U.S. for the last three years is:                              1996      1995      1994 Europe, Middle East,             Africa                     62%       62%       56% Asia/Pacific area and                               Western hemisphere,   excluding U.S.              38%       38%       44%                              100%      100%      100%                                II-4  Results of Operations - 1996 vs. 1995 (continued)  The cost of goods sold increased to 48.7% of sales in 1996 compared with 48.3% in the prior year as price declines exceeded our ability to reduce costs.  Bard historically had been able to recover these costs through its strong product position in its markets or by offsetting the effect of inflation through its cost reduction programs.  Recently, market price reductions have exceeded our gains in manufacturing efficiencies and our efforts to shift our mix to higher margin products.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased just over 3% in 1996, lower than the rate of growth in sales, as efforts were increased to lower expenses to help offset some of the effects of price declines.  Also, we have realized synergies from the two mergers completed late in 1995.  As a percent to total sales, these expenses represented 30.6% in 1996 compared with 31.2% in 1995.  Research and development spending increased over 2% in 1996, representing 6.5% of sales, slightly less than the ratio to sales in 1995.  In our efforts to reduce costs, we eliminated certain planned spending while continuing sufficient work on the programs needed for our future success.  Additional interest expense related to acquisitions in 1996 resulted in an increase in total interest expense for the year.  Costs to combine the operations of acquisitions of $9.0 million in 1996 and $17.7 million in 1995 affected income in both years.  Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for a summary of items in this category in the last three years.  Included in this category in 1996 are charges of $31.0 million for the write down of assets related to guidewire technology, $10.0 million for the closing of certain manufacturing operations and a net amount of $3.5 million for certain legal fees and settlements.  Also included are nonrecurring royalty payments of $9.2 million received in 1996 for prior periods.  Income Tax  The effective income tax rate was 10% in 1996.  Excluding the impact of the first quarter reversal of approximately $15 million in tax reserves no longer required and the increased tax benefit in the U.S. related to the one-time charges discussed previously, the effective tax rate would have been 29.5% compared with 29.7% in 1995.                                II-5  Net Income  Net income increased 7% in 1996 and was affected over the last three years by costs to combine the operations of acquired companies in 1995 and 1996 and by other one-time items in 1994 and 1996.  The effect on net income and earnings per share in the last three years were (in millions except per share amounts):  1996 Reorganization, asset writedown and costs to combine operations            $(29.80) Reversal of tax reserves                 15.00 Prior period royalty payments, legal settlements and other               3.60 Total 1996                             $(11.20) Equivalent per share                   $  (.20)  1995 Costs to combine operations            $(13.50) Equivalent per share                   $(  .24)  1994 Legal fees and settlements             $(16.90) Equivalent per share                   $ ( .30)  After adjusting for the items shown above, net income and earnings per share (EPS) would have been:                           Net Income                                    (millions)          EPS 1996                     $103.7              $1.82 1995                     $100.3              $1.77 1994                     $ 92.5              $1.64  Results of Operations - 1995 vs. 1994  Net sales totaled $1.138 billion in 1995, an increase of 12% over the $1.018 billion originally reported for 1994.  This 12% increase includes 5% from new sales as a result of the two acquisitions Bard made in 1995.  Since they were accounted for as poolings of interests, Bard's restated sales for 1994 are $1.065 billion, resulting in a 7% increase to $1.138 billion in 1995.  Worldwide revenue growth of 10% in 1995 in the urological and surgical product groups combined with a 1% increase in cardiovascular sales, resulted in the consolidated increase of 7%.  All of the growth came from sales outside the U.S. as U.S. sales approximated the prior year's level.  Price reductions totaled 2% on a worldwide basis in 1995 while higher foreign currency values versus the dollar increased total reported sales by 2%.                                II-6  In the urological product group, worldwide sales increased 10% in 1995, all of it from outside the U.S., with a substantial portion the result of a full year's sales of Angiomed products in 1995 versus two months of sales following the acquisition in 1994.  Urological sales in 1994 increased 16% with a majority of the increase a result of sales of the Contigen implant.  Surgical product group sales increased 10% in 1995, a majority of which was outside the U.S.  A full year of sales of Angiomed and Vas-Cath products (acquired in 1994) benefited this area substantially, as did strong growth in sales of vascular access catheters and ports, fabrics and mesh products for hernia repair and gastroenterology devices.  Sales in 1994 of surgical products increased 6% with the areas of vascular access, vascular fabrics and mesh and gastroenterology showing good gains.  Sales of cardiovascular products increased just 1% in 1995.  A full year of Angiomed product sales benefited this area along with good increases in interventional radiology and the FemoStop device.  U.S. sales continued to decline as the company awaited clearance from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for new products from our USCI division.  In 1994, continued weakness in certain cardiovascular product areas resulted in a 3% decline in sales in this group.  Increased sales outside the U.S. were more than offset by declines in the U.S. which continued to be affected by the lack of approvals by the FDA of new products from our USCI division.  Sales in the United States declined slightly in 1995 versus 1994 and represented 66% of total sales.  Total surgical product sales in the U.S. showed good growth with significant increases in sales of vascular access, gastroenterology, hernia repair fabrics and new MedChem products.  Urological product sales in the U.S. were level with 1994 while sales of cardiovascular products declined.  Sales in the United States increased 4% in 1994 and represented 71% of total sales.  Sales of the Contigen implant were the most important contributor to this growth.  Sales growth outside the U.S. continued to be strong in 1995 with a 24% increase over 1994, a significant portion from a full year of sales of Angiomed and Vas-Cath products.  Higher foreign currency values in 1995 contributed 7% of the increase.  Numerous products in all three product groups showed significant gains in revenue in 1995.  Sales outside the U.S. increased 9% in 1994 with a little more than 1% of that growth the result of higher foreign currency values.  The growth was broad-based throughout our product areas and major geographic markets.  Acquisitions accounted for 3% of this growth.                                II-7  The cost of goods sold as a percent of sales was 48.3% in 1995 and 48.2% in 1994.  Productivity gains, cost reductions and a favorable product mix all contributed to reduced costs as a percent of sales for several years through 1994 and these factors almost matched the level of price reductions in 1995.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased by 8.6% as we invested in programs to boost future sales revenue.  The synergies from the two mergers closed late in 1995, and from our divisional reorganization, were not realized by year-end.  As a percent of sales, these expenses were 31.2% in 1995 and 30.7% in 1994.  Research and development spending continued to increase as we worked on new technologies and applications for the future.  The level of spending as a percent to sales was 6.6% in 1995 and 6.7%  in 1994.  Interest expense increased from $16.3 million in 1994 to $24.2 million in 1995 as average debt levels increased as a result of acquisitions made in 1994.  Costs to combine the operations of acquisitions made in 1995 were $17.7 million.  No amounts were recorded in this category in 1994.  Other (income) expense, net in 1994 included a $28.2 million one-time charge for certain legal fees and the settlement of a suit. No nonrecurring items were recorded in 1995 in this category.  The effective income tax rate was 29.7% in 1995 and 27.4% in 1994.  The tax benefit from operations in Puerto Rico and Ireland favorably affected the tax rate each year.  The lower rate in 1994 was primarily due to the one-time charge that was tax effected at U.S. rates.  Net income increased 15% in 1995 and 31% in 1994.  Each year was affected by one-time items as described earlier in this financial review.  Financial Condition and Liquidity  Bard's financial condition remains strong.  While total debt increased by $225.7 million in 1996, primarily for acquisitions, $150 million in long-term debt was issued in the public market and $120 million remains classified as long-term with the backing of our committed credit facility.  The ratio of total debt to total capitalization was at 45% in 1996 compared with 32% in 1995                                 II-8  and 37% in 1994.  In 1995, Bard's equity base was increased with the issuance of common stock for the acquisitions of MedChem Products and American Hydro-Surgical.  In 1995 the company completed the arrangement of a $350 million syndicated, committed credit facility with a group of 15 banks.  With the long-term debt issue in December 1996, the company reduced the credit agreement to $300 million with 11 banks, effective January 1, 1997.  The credit agreement supports a commercial paper program which started in September 1996 with a maximum amount of $350 million, reduced by the company to $300 million effective January 1, 1997.  The company borrows actively under this program.  In addition to the $300 million committed credit agreement, Bard maintains uncommitted credit lines with banks for short-term cash needs and these lines were used as needed during the last three years.  At December 31, 1996 the unused uncommitted lines of credit totaled $239 million.  As now structured, the company expects cash flows from operating activities to exceed capital expenditures and dividend payments.  The company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary.  This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility.  Total cash outlays made for purchases of businesses, patents, trademarks and other related items were $237 million in 1996, $19 million in 1995 and $148 million in 1994 for a total over the last three years of $404 million.  The majority of these investments were for intangible assets, reflecting the premium over book value for these purchases.  The cash outlays exclude common stock valued at $135 million issued in 1995 for the acquisitions of MedChem Products and American Hydro-Surgical.  The majority of the cash outlays were financed with additional debt ($320 million) with the balance coming from cash from operations.  Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market to replace shares issued under various employee stock plans.  Net shares issued under the plans were 699,085 in 1996; 648,943 in 1995; and 318,912 in 1994.  Total shares purchased were 813,700 in 1996; 75,000 in 1995; and 350,000 in 1994.  In June 1996 the Board of Directors authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 1 million  shares  of  which  244,800  had  been  purchased  as  of December 31, 1996.                                II-9  Foreign Currency Risk  The company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values.  Contracts have been exclusively for the forward purchase of currencies in which the company has known or anticipated payments.  These are primarily for intercompany transactions, resulting in a high degree of confidence that the anticipated transactions will take place.  Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide short-term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values.  Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this report for current details of the company's foreign exchange contracts.  Legal Proceedings  For a discussion of pending legal proceedings and related matters, please see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-21.  Acquisitions  For information on the company's acquisitions of businesses, please see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-17.
