Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations    This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results ofoperations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of the company and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere inthis Form 10-K. Certain statements contained herein may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; see Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-LookingInformation below.    Overview    The company designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individualhealthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe, Japan and China are the companys largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America andEastern Europe are the companys fastest growing markets. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major productgroup categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group category of other products.    The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon itssuccess in developing, acquiring and marketing differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2014, the companys research and development (R&D) expense as a percentage of net sales was 9.1%.The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may, from time-to-time, consideracquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons. The company spent$13.3 million in 2014, including acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D), for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.    Product Approval and Legal Developments    Product Approval   On October 10, 2014, the company announced the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the Lutonixdrug-coated percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon for the treatment of vascular disease of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries. This approval follows a unanimous favorable recommendation from the FDAsCirculatory Systems Devices Advisory Panel in June 2014. The Lutonix drug-coated PTA balloon, the first FDA-approved drug-coated PTA balloon in the U.S., is an angioplasty balloon coated with a therapeutic dose of the drug paclitaxel for thetreatment of peripheral arterial disease. The FDAs approval of the Lutonix drug-coated PTA balloon was supported by results of the LEVANT 2 study. Following receipt of regulatory approval, the company launched this product in the United Statesand made a contingent milestone payment of $100 million in October 2014 related to this regulatory approval. See Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Legal Developments    During 2014, the company evaluated certain productliability matters based on information currently available, including but not limited to: its discussions with plaintiffs counsel, the increase in the rate of claims       II-3    being filed (which led the company to increase its estimate of unasserted claims), and the value, number of cases and nature of the inventory of cases with respect to the recent settlements ofclaims by the company and other manufacturers. Based on these, and other factors, the company recorded charges, net of estimated recoveries to other (income) expense, net, of approximately $259.0 million ($238.0 million after tax), which recognizedthe estimated costs for certain product liability matters.    For more information on legal matters, see Note 10 of the notes toconsolidated financial statements.    Results of Operations    Net Sales    Bards 2014 consolidated net sales increased 9% on both areported basis and constant currency basis over 2013 consolidated net sales. Bards 2013 consolidated net sales increased 3% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis over 2012 consolidated net sales. Net sales on a constantcurrency basis is a non-GAAP measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures below. Price changes had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales byapproximately 110 basis points and 100 basis points for 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the prior years. Exchange rate fluctuations had a nominal impact on consolidated net sales for both 2014 and 2013, respectively, compared to the prioryears. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impactof exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities.    Bards 2014 United States net sales of $2,263.5 million increased 12% compared to $2,014.1 million in 2013. Bards 2014 international net sales of $1,060.1 million increased 2% on a reportedbasis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to $1,035.4 million in 2013. Bards 2013 United States net sales increased 2% compared to $1,967.7 million in 2012. Bards 2013 international net sales increased 5% on a reported basis (4%on a constant currency basis) compared to $990.4 million in 2012.    Presented below is a summary of consolidated net sales byproduct group category.

Net income in 2013 reflects the Gore Proceeds of $557.4 million, or $6.78 per diluted share, litigation charges, net of recoveries, of $393.5 million, or $4.79 per diluted share, gain on the EP Sale of$118.5 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, amortization of intangible assets of $60.2 million, or $0.73 per diluted share, acquisition-related items (primarily consisting of IPR&D charges, integration costs, transaction costs and purchaseaccounting adjustments) of $34.9 million, or $0.43 per diluted share, and a contribution to the C. R. Bard Foundation, Inc. in the fourth quarter of 2013 of $14.1 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. Net income for 2013 also reflectsdivestiture-related charges of $12.2 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, asset impairment charges of $9.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, a $2.2 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, benefit to the income tax provision associated with theremeasurement of an uncertain tax position as a result of the settlement of a legal matter, and a reversal of certain restructuring costs of $1.0 million, or $0.01 per diluted share.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    The company assesses its liquidity interms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions ofbusinesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided from operations continues to be a primary source of funds. The       II-9    company believes that it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary. The company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financialflexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the following years ended December 31:                              2014         2013         2012      (dollars in millions)                                   Cash and cash equivalents      $  960.1          $  1,066.9          $  896.3                                                              Working capital      $  1,432.5          $  1,503.9          $  1,399.6                                                              Current ratio         3.33/1             3.56/1             4.13/1                                                             Cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries were $950.9 million and $874.0million at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. It is the companys intention to permanently reinvest the majority of these funds outside the United States to finance foreign operations, and the companys plans do not demonstratea need to repatriate these funds. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations for currently unforeseen circumstances or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the company would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxeson the earnings associated with these funds. In the United States, ongoing operating cash flows and available borrowings under the companys committed syndicated bank credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity.   For the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, net cash provided by operating activities was $660.0 million, $1,123.3 millionand $661.2 million, respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities is primarily due to the receipt of the Gore Proceeds in 2013, partially offset by lower tax payments in 2014, receipt of Gore royalty payments in 2014and a settlement payment for a certain legal matter in 2013. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2013 is primarily due to the receipt of the Gore Proceeds, payments to claimants for product liability matters that were lowerthan amounts paid in 2012 and the timing of tax payments, partially offset by a settlement payment for a certain legal matter previously recorded in 2012.    During 2014, the company used $163.3 million in cash for investing activities, $125.0 million less than in 2013. During 2013, the company used $288.3 million in cash for investing activities, $190.1million more than in 2012. Capital expenditures amounted to $126.6 million, $69.1 million and $72.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The company spent $13.3 million in 2014, $498.5 million in 2013 and$159.3 million in 2012 for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies to augment existing product lines. In addition, the company received net proceeds from the EP Sale of $267.4 million in 2013. Net cash used in investing activitiesin 2014 reflects an increase of $31.2 million in restricted cash related to payments to qualified settlement funds (QSFs) for certain product liability matters. Net cash used in investing activities in 2013 and 2012 reflects decreases of$8.7 million and $122.1 million, respectively, related to the release of restricted cash from QSFs to claimants pursuant to the settlement of certain product liability matters.   During 2014, 2013 and 2012, the company used $584.4 million, $663.3 million and $263.2 million in cash for financing activities,respectively. Total debt was $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Total debt to total capitalization was 45.1%, 40.2% and 42.3% at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The company spentapproximately $659.6 million to repurchase 4,497,427 shares of common stock in 2014 compared to $738.1 million to repurchase 6,559,195 shares of common stock in 2013 and $472.4 million to repurchase 4,903,677 shares of common stock in 2012. Thecompany paid cash dividends of $66.2 million, $66.5 million and $66.7 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The company made a contingent milestone payment of $100.0 million in 2014 related to the acquisition of Lutonix. Inc., of which $70.0million represented the fair value previously established at the acquisition date and was included in financing activities.   In November 2014, the company amended its $750 million five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that was scheduled to expirein September 2018. The amendment extends the commitment termination       II-10    date until November 2019. The amended credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based onthe companys long-term credit ratings and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At December 31, 2014, the company was in compliance with this covenant. The company had commercial paperborrowings outstanding of $78.0 million at December 31, 2014. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2013.    Contractual Obligations    Payments due under contractual obligations atDecember 31, 2014, are as follows:                               (dollars in millions)      Total         1 Year         2-3 Years         4-5 Years         5+ Years        Forward contracts      $  99.4          $  99.4          $              $              $             Short-term borrowings         78.0             78.0                                                      Long-term debt         1,691.6             41.3             329.7             567.5             753.1         Operating lease obligations         156.2             30.5             47.8             28.8             49.1         Acquisition and related milestones         47.1             30.2             12.2             1.5             3.2         Purchase obligations         233.2             202.6             21.8             7.2             1.6         Legal settlements         101.7             101.7                                                      Other long-term liabilities         117.2             6.8             20.7             12.9             76.8                                                                                                   $  2,524.4          $  590.5          $  432.2          $  617.9          $  883.8                                                                                               The table above does not include $36.1 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain taxpositions and $2.9 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which theseliabilities might be paid.    Forward contracts  - Forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchase ofcurrencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.    Short-term borrowings   Short-termborrowings consist of commercial paper.    Long-term debt  - Long-term debt includes expected principal and interestpayments, including the effect of an interest rate swap contract.    Operating lease obligations  - The company iscommitted under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment.    Acquisition and relatedmilestones  - The company may make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets undervarious acquisition and related arrangements. The table above excludes amounts for these milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur.    Purchase obligations  - The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projectedrequirements over the related terms and are entered into in the normal course of business.    Legal settlements  -Payments to claimants for product liability and other legal matters, including those subject to certain settlement conditions that may be made from QSFs. The table above does not include non-current accruals for product liability and other legalmatters of $939.8 million. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the period in which these liabilities might be paid.       II-11    Other long-term liabilities  - The company estimates required funding obligationsrelated to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and deferred compensation.    Certain Regulatory Matters   In October 2014 and November 2014, the FDA conducted directed inspections at two of the companys facilities after which the FDAissued Form-483s to the company in connection with these inspections. The company responded to the FDA, is in the process of addressing the observations in the Form-483s and intends to fully implement corrective and preventive actions toaddress the FDAs concerns. The company cannot give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its responses to the Form-483 observations or as to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the Form-483 observations.   Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures    Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods.Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to bothmanagement and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative ofchanges in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAP measures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not beviewed as replacements of GAAP results.    Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reportedamount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting policies are those thatrequire application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. The followingis not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 ofthe notes to consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in determining estimates and assumptions might produce a materially different result.   Revenue Recognition  - Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at the point of delivery,and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case of consignmentinventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.    Royalty revenue isrecognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalty revenue can be objectively determined. If royalty revenue cannot be objectively determined during the quarterly period in which it is earned, then royalty revenue is recognizedin the following quarterly period when objective evidence is obtained and the revenue becomes fixed and determinable.   Share-Based Compensation  - Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award.Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in the binomial model areassumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical       II-12    volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order todetermine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to expected future exercise behavior, thecompany considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date with a term equal to the contractual term of thestock option.    Contingencies  - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including, for example,product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes regarding agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for extended periods oftime. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. The company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and/or costs related to claims,settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues theminimum amount of the range. The company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the statedcoverage limits or less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or others will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. Legal costsassociated with these matters are expensed as incurred. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.   Income Taxes  - The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and internationally. Thecompany regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. These positions relate to transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions, state taxes and other matters. Although theoutcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on thecompanys best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The reserves are used or reversed once the statutes of limitation have expired or the position is effectively settled. The company believesthat the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial condition and/or liquidity but may be material to its income tax provision and results of operations.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns  - The company makes estimates of the uncollectibilityof the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reservesnecessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, the average length of time to collect receivables, customer creditworthiness and current economic and market trends. Thecompany establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts deemed uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of thecustomers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating theadjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market-related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditionscause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists.    It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the changeto the underlying factors, the impact to the companys results of operations and financial condition could be material in the period of change.       II-13    Acquisitions  - In a business combination, the acquisition method of accountingrequires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value, with goodwill being the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. IPR&D is capitalizedand recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, and transaction costs are expensed as incurred. When the company acquires net assets that arenot accounted for as a business combination, no goodwill is recognized.    IPR&D represents intangible assets acquired in abusiness combination that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the futurecash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. The determination of fairvalue of IPR&D takes into consideration: the projects stage of completion as of the acquisition date; the timing and cost of R&D work required to complete the project; the risk of a project not achieving commercial feasibility; andestimated future cash flows. Amounts capitalized as IPR&D are subject to an impairment review, using a fair value-based test, until completion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as tothe useful life of the asset and amortization will begin. If the project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset will be written off.   The fair value of the liability for contingent consideration recorded on the acquisition date is based on probability weighted estimatedcash flow streams, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with accepted valuation methods. The liability for contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes recordedin earnings until the contingency is resolved.    The judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired andliabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations.    Goodwill  - Goodwill istested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise using a fair-value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which isone level below the companys single reporting segment. The fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-averagecombination of both market and income approaches. The market approach to estimating fair value is based primarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on adiscounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over itsimplied fair value.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  - Intangible assets with finite lives and other long-lived assets,such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held andused by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized inthe amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.    Pension Plans  - The companysponsors pension plans covering certain domestic and foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to theplans. These factors include assumptions about the discount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company. In addition, the company also uses subjective factors, such as withdrawal andmortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing       II-14    market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption,with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.4 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption, withother assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.1 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost.    New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    In May 2014, the FinancialAccounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard that provides for a comprehensive model to use in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under this standard, revenue will be recognized to depict the transfer ofpromised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard will be effective as of the beginning of Bards 2017 fiscalyear. The company is assessing the new standard and has not yet determined the impact to the consolidated financial statements.    Risks andUncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information    Certain statements contained herein or in othercompany documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the factthat they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan,believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current andanticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. The companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made,and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.    In addition, there are substantial risksinherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often used on, or permanently or temporarilyimplanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associatedwith adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings) and other litigation,product withdrawals, warning letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,financial condition and/or liquidity.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Thecompany manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations.The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies.In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time-to-time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. Theinstruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in therelated hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian Dollar, and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in thevalue of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposureexists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2014 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of thesecontracts would increase by $5.2 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $2.9 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contractswould be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.    The companys investment portfolio primarily includes cash equivalents for which the market values are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the companysfixed-rate debt is affected by a change in the medium- to long-term interest rates because the borrowings generally have longer maturities. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt including the effect of the related interest rate swapcontract effectively converting the 2.875% fixed-rate notes due 2016 to floating-rate instruments approximated $1,481.7 million at December 31, 2014. A sensitivity analysis, assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates andassuming that the debt and related swap are held to maturity, indicates that the market value of the debt and related swap would have approximated $1,422.2 million or $1,543.2 million, respectively, at December 31, 2014. OnDecember 12, 2014, the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap contract to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility in anticipation of issuing fixed-rate debt. The companys forward starting swap contract has anotional value of $250 million and a mandatory termination date of May 2016. A sensitivity analysis, assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, indicates that the fair value of the forward starting swap contract would increase by $21.4million, and assuming a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, indicates that the fair value of this contract would decrease by $24.3 million at December 31, 2014.
