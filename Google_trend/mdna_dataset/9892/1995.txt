Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results          of Operations and of Financial Conditions     General  Bard is a leading multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of products for the large and growing health care industry.  Worldwide health care expenditures approximated $2 trillion in 1994 with about half that amount spent in the United States.  Bard's segment of this industry, itself a multi-billion dollar market, is primarily specialized products used mainly in hospitals, in outpatient centers and in physician's offices to meet the needs of the medical profession in caring for their patients.  The Company seeks to focus and concentrate on selected markets with cost-effective, innovative products and specialized sales forces to maximize our opportunities in these markets.  Operating Results  Consolidated net sales increased 5% in 1994, helped by good growth in many product areas.  Net income increased 34%, while earnings per share increased 35%.  The income figures for both 1993 and 1994 were significantly impacted by unusual or nonrecurring charges, described starting on page II-5 in this financial review.  Sales  Consolidated net sales totaled $1,018.2 million in 1994, a 5% increase over 1993.  Significant factors in this growth were good increases in sales of Foley catheters and related procedure trays, specialty access catheters, vascular fabric and mesh products and gastroenterological specialty devices as well as a substantial increase in sales of Bard's Contigen implant.  These areas, along with sales from our 1994 acquisitions and an increase of less than 1% from the effects of foreign currency translations, more than offset some continued weakness in certain cardiovascular product lines and price reductions which totaled 2.6% on a worldwide basis.  Consolidated net sales totaled $970.8 million in 1993, a decrease of $19.4 million or 2% for the year.  Sales were lowered 3% as a result of the sale of the Bard MedSystems division in February 1993 and 1% by the negative impact of generally lower foreign currency values.  Sales in 1993 were also negatively impacted by a slowdown in U.S. procedural rates, consolidations of health care providers, limited FDA approvals, increasingly conservative medical practices fostered by the growth of managed care and weaker European economies.  Consolidated net sales in 1992 totaled $990.2 million, an increase of $114.2 million or 13% for the year, primarily from higher volume, including new and improved products.  The slightly favorable effect from changes in foreign currency values resulted in less than 1% of the 1992 consolidated net sales increase.                                      II-3  Worldwide sales in 1994 increased 16% in the urological product group, with a majority of the increase a result of sales of the Contigen implant.  1993 urological sales increased 1%.  Good increases in several relatively new specialty devices were partially offset by declines in other areas.  Urological sales rose 12% in 1992.  This product group benefited in 1992 from a full year of OEM sales of private label urological products compared with nine months of sales in 1991.  Sales growth from Foley catheter procedure trays and biopsy devices also contributed.  Sales in 1994 of the surgical product group increased 6% with the areas of specialty access, vascular fabrics and mesh and gastroenterology showing good gains.  Adjusting for the sale of the MedSystems division in February 1993, sales in this group increased 7% in 1994.  Sales of surgical products in 1993 decreased 1% but increased 8% after adjusting for the sale of the MedSystems division.  Specialty access, endoscopic, laparoscopic and blood management products contributed significantly to this increase.  In 1992, gains in endoscopic, specialty access, orthopaedic irrigation, vascular fabric and laparoscopic products contributed to a 15% increase in surgical sales.  Continued weakness in certain cardiovascular product areas resulted in a decline in sales in this group of 3% in 1994.  Increased sales outside the U.S. were more than offset by declines in the U.S. which continue to be impacted by the lack of approvals by the Food and Drug Administration of new products from the USCI division.  Cardiovascular product sales decreased 5% worldwide in 1993 with most product areas in this group showing declines.  In 1992 cardiovascular sales increased 12% as the Company gained market share in balloon angioplasty catheters.  Sales increases in guide catheters and electrophysiology and radiology products helped the growth in this area.  Sales in the United States increased 3% in 1994 and represented 70% of total sales.  Sales of Contigen were the most important contributor to this growth.  U.S. sales decreased 1% in 1993 and represented 71% of total sales.  Urological product sales increased while sales of surgical products (due to the sale of MedSystems) and cardiovascular products decreased.  In 1992, U.S. sales increased 13% and represented 70% of total sales.  Surgical product sales showed the highest rate of increase.  Sales outside the U.S. increased 9% in 1994 with a little more than 1% of that growth the result of higher foreign currency values.  The growth was broad-based throughout our product areas and major geographic markets.  Acquisitions accounted for 3% of this growth.  In 1993 sales outside the U.S. declined 3%.  Changes in foreign currency values in 1993 lowered these sales by nearly 5%.  Growth in sales of surgical products were more than offset by decreases in urological and cardiovascular sales.  1992 sales outside the U.S. increased 12% with nearly 2% of that growth the result of changes in foreign currency values.  Sales of urological and cardiovascular products led the way.                                      II-4  The geographic breakdown of sales outside the U.S. for the last three years is:                           1994       1993       1992                  Europe, Middle East    and Africa              57%        56%        58% Japan, Asia/Pacific        35         37         33 Western hemisphere,    excluding U.S.           8          7          9                            100%       100%       100%         Operating Income  Gross profit margins have increased in each of the last three years.  The rates were 51.2% in 1994, 50.9% in 1993 and 48.4% in 1992.  Productivity gains, cost reductions and a favorable product mix in many product areas contributed to this improvement in the last three years.  Bard uses the LIFO method of valuing substantially all U.S. inventories, which results in current costs (higher in a period of inflation) being charged to cost of goods sold.  Bard generally has been able to recover these costs through its strong product position in its markets.  The Company also strives to offset the effect of inflation through its cost reduction programs.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses have been controlled tightly as indicated by increases of less than 1% in total spending in this category in each of the last two years.  As a percent of sales, these expenses represented 29.5% in 1994 compared with 30.8% in 1993 and 29.9% in 1992.  Research and development spending continues to increase as the Company focuses on new technologies and applications for the future.  The Company's 1994 spending of $69.8 million was not as much as originally planned.  The Company continued to focus on opportunities which improve outcomes and/or lower costs.  As a result of the improvements in gross profit margins and tight control of expenses, operating income has improved to 14.8% of sales in 1994 from 13.2% in 1993 and 12.4% in 1992.  Other Expense, Net  Please refer to Note 9, Other Expense, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-22 of this report for a summary of items in this category in the last three years.  In 1994 there was a fourth quarter charge of $28.2 million.  This covered the settlement of a 1992 lawsuit by the inventor of an atherectomy device which Bard is developing and provided for the anticipated future legal costs associated with the ongoing prosecution of the six individuals indicted in October 1993 plus other costs related to the USCI division (please refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements  on  page  II-17 of this report).                                      II-5  Other expense, net in 1993 included a third quarter provision for the Justice Department settlement of $61 million, a fourth quarter gain of $32.7 million from the sale of shares of the common stock of Ventritex, Inc. and a first quarter gain of $10.9 million from the sale of the MedSystems division net of nonrecurring charges.  The 1992 results included a first quarter gain from the sale of common stock of Ventritex.  Income Tax  The effective income tax rate was 27% in 1994, 37% in 1993 and 30% in 1992.  The lower tax rate in 1994 is primarily due to the fourth quarter charge which is tax effected at U.S. rates.  The higher 1993 rate was primarily due to the $61 million Justice Department settlement, which was not fully deductible.  The tax benefit from operations in Puerto Rico and Ireland favorably affected the tax rate in each year, even though the benefit from operations in Puerto Rico was reduced slightly in 1994.  Net Income  Net income increased 34% in 1994 after a 25% decline in 1993 and a 31% increase in 1992.  The net income effect of the 1994 and 1993 unusual or nonrecurring items discussed above in Other Expense, Net plus the after-tax charge of $6.1 million in the first quarter of 1993 for postretirement benefits were (in millions except per share amounts):  1994  Fourth quarter charge for legal fees   and settlement                                $(16.9)  Equivalent per share                            $ (.33)  1993  Gain on sale of Ventritex stock                 $ 19.4 Gain on sale of MedSystems net of   nonrecurring charges                             6.0 Effect of accounting change for   postretirement benefits                         (6.1) Justice Department settlement                    (45.4)  Total 1993                                      $(26.1)  Equivalent per share                            $ (.50)  After adjusting for the unusual or nonrecurring items above for the last two years, income would have been $91.8 million in 1994 and $82.1 million in 1993 while earnings per share would have been $1.77 in 1994 and $1.57 in 1993.                                      II-6  Financial Condition  Bard's financial condition remains strong.  Although total debt increased by $121 million in 1994 to $274 million and the ratio of total debt to total capitalization increased to 38%, we believe this level continues to give the Company sufficient financing flexibility, should the need arise.  Bard maintains credit lines with banks for short-term cash needs and the total amount of these lines was increased substantially in 1994.  These facilities were used as needed during the last three years.  The current unused lines of credit total $241 million.  As now structured, the Company expects cash flow from operating activities to exceed capital expenditures and dividend payments.  The Company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary.  Total cash outlays made for purchases of businesses, patents, trademarks and other related items and long-term investments were $143 million in 1994, $101 million in 1993 and $46 million in 1992 for a total over the last three years of $290 million.  The majority of these investments were for intangible items.  About half of this total was financed with additional debt ($146 million) with the balance coming from cash from operations and proceeds from sales of assets.  Cash from operations contributed to an increase in short-term investments in 1992 and 1993, a substantial portion of which was used in 1994, primarily for acquisitions.  The Company annually purchases an amount of its common stock in the open market large enough at least to replace shares issued under various employee stock plans.  Net shares issued under the plans were 299,400 in 1994; 259,443 in 1993 and 319,480 in 1992.  Total shares purchased were 350,000 in 1994, 1,000,000 in 1993 and 500,000 in 1992.  In January 1993 the Board of Directors authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 2 million shares of which 1,350,000 had been purchased as of December 31, 1994.  Foreign Currency Risk  The Company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values.  Contracts have been exclusively for the forward purchase of currencies in which the Company has known or anticipated payments.  These are primarily for intercompany transactions, resulting in a high degree of confidence that the anticipated transactions will take place.  Monetary assets of the Company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide short-term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values.
