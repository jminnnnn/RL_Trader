Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations    This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results ofoperations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of the company and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere inthis Form 10-K. Certain statements contained herein may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; see Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-LookingInformation below.    Overview    The company designs, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individual healthcareprofessionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe and Japan are the companys largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia and Latin America are thecompanys fastest growing markets. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major product group categories:vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group category of other products.    Thecompanys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon its success in developing, acquiring and marketingdifferentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2012, the companys research and development (R&D) expense as a percentage of net sales was 6.9%. The company expects R&D expense as apercentage of net sales to increase in future years. The company also makes and expects to continue to make selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoinggrowth opportunities. In addition, the company may, from time-to-time, consider acquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain aleadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons. The company spent $159.3 million in 2012, including acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D), for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.   Acquisitions and Other Initiatives    On October 19, 2012, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Neomend, Inc. (Neomend), a privately-held company engaged in the development and commercialization of innovativesurgical sealants. The total purchase consideration of $133.7 million included the fair value of contingent consideration of up to $25 million, which is based on the achievement of sales-based milestones through 2016. Neomends products expandBards existing surgical specialties product portfolio to include the only product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of intraoperative air leaks in connection with thoracic surgery. Neomends proprietarytechnology and pipeline provide the opportunity for future clinical indications across a variety of surgical specialty applications. For more information on acquisitions, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.   During the fourth quarter of 2012, the company committed to a plan (the 2012 Restructuring Plan) to improve its overall coststructure and enhance operational effectiveness. The company expects the 2012 Restructuring Plan to result in the elimination of certain positions and other employee terminations worldwide. In connection with this plan, the company recorded employeeseparation costs under the companys existing severance programs and other costs related to one-time employee termination benefits of $19.2 million ($13.0 million after tax). Substantially all of these costs are expected to be cashexpenditures. The company expects these restructuring costs to result in pre-tax cost savings of approximately $15 million on an annual basis. See Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.       II-3    On October 30, 2012, the company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of1.375% senior unsecured notes due 2018. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually. Net proceeds from this offering were $495.4 million, after deducting debt offering costs, consisting of underwriting commissions and offering expenses, and adebt issuance discount. Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of commercial paper and acquisitions. See Note 9 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.   Healthcare Reform   Significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system were adopted in 2010 in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (thePPACA). The PPACA requires, among other things, the company to pay a 2.3% excise tax on most U.S. medical device sales beginning in 2013. The company has evaluated the impact of this tax on its overall business. Based on forecasted 2013annual U.S. sales, the excise tax is expected to be approximately $40 million.    Results of Operations   Net Sales    Bards2012 consolidated net sales increased 2% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) over 2011 consolidated net sales. Bards 2011 consolidated net sales increased 6% on a reported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) over 2010consolidated net sales. Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures below. Price changes had theeffect of decreasing consolidated net sales by approximately 140 basis points and 70 basis points for 2012 and 2011, respectively, compared to the prior years. The primary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of the Eurocompared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements on operating costs and expenses, costs incurred in othercurrencies and the companys hedging activities.    Bards 2012 United States net sales of $1,967.7 million increased1% compared to $1,956.0 million in 2011. Bards 2012 international net sales of $990.4 million increased 5% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to $940.4 million in 2011. Bards 2011 United States net salesincreased 4% compared to $1,889.0 million in 2010. Bards 2011 international net sales increased 13% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to $831.2 million in 2010.   Presented below is a summary of consolidated net sales by product group category.

Consolidated net sales of vascular products in 2012 were flat on a reported basis (increased 3% on a constant currency basis) compared to      II-4    the prior year due to an increase in sales of endovascular products offset by a decline in sales of electrophysiology and vascular graft products. United States net sales of vascular products in2012 decreased 3% compared to the prior year. International net sales of vascular products in 2012 increased 4% on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The increase in consolidated net sales of vascularproducts in 2011 was due primarily to growth in endovascular products. United States net sales of vascular products in 2011 increased 9% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2011 increased 15% on a reported basis (10% on a constantcurrency basis) compared to the prior year.    Consolidated net sales of endovascular products in 2012 increased 2% on areported basis (5% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of endovascular products in 2011 increased 16% on a reported basis (14% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Stents andpercutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheters were the primary contributors to the growth in this product line in 2012. Net sales of stents in 2012 benefited from an issue with the availability of a competitors products. Percutaneoustransluminal angioplasty balloon catheters, stents and biopsy products were the primary contributors to the growth in this product line in 2011.    Consolidated net sales of electrophysiology products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of electrophysiologyproducts in 2011 increased 2% on a reported basis (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.   Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products in 2012 decreased 6% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared tothe prior year. Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products in 2011 decreased 2% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Declining sales in peripheral vascular grafts were the primary drivers of thedecrease in both 2012 and 2011.    Urology Products  - Bard markets a wide range of products for theurology market, including basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. Bard also markets StatLock ®  catheter stabilization products, which are used to secure many types of catheters sold by Bard and other companies.Bard also markets Targeted Temperature Management   products, acquired in November 2011, for therapeutichypothermia. In 2012, consolidated net sales of urology products increased 3% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. This increase included 5 percentage points of growth on both a reported basis andconstant currency basis from the addition of Targeted Temperature Management   products. This growth was offset by declines in sales of urological specialty products, StatLock ®  catheter stabilization products and continence products, a trend that may continue. United States net sales of urology products in 2012 increased 2% compared to theprior year. International net sales in 2012 increased 6% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The increase in consolidated net sales of urology products in 2011 compared to the prior year was led bygrowth in sales of basic drainage products, StatLock ®  catheter stabilization products and the addition ofTargeted Temperature Management   products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of continence products.United States net sales in 2011 decreased 1% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2011 increased 12% on a reported basis (8% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.

Consolidated net sales of urological specialty products in 2011 increased 2% on a reported basis (1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year.Consolidated net sales of brachytherapy products in 2011 increased 1% on a reported basis (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The brachytherapy market has been losing procedural share to alternative therapies inthe United States, a trend that may continue.    Consolidated net sales of continence products in 2012decreased 8% on a reported basis (7% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of continence products in 2011 decreased 14% on a reported basis (15% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Netsales in 2012 and 2011 were impacted by the discontinuation of sales of a bulking continence product and a decline in sales of surgical continence products, a trend that may continue. Consolidated net sales of the StatLock ®  catheter stabilization product line in 2012 decreased 2% on both a reported basis and constant currency basiscompared to the prior year.

Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2012 increased 10 basis points comparedto the prior year. Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2011 and 2012 increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70 basis points over the prior year. This increase was largely offset by costimprovements. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2011 increased 40 basis points compared to the prior year. Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2010 and 2011 increased cost of goods sold in 2011 as a percentageof net sales by approximately 40 basis points over the prior year.    Marketing, selling and administrative  expense  - Marketing, selling and administrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the companys sales and administrative organizations. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2012 increased 20 basis pointsfrom the prior year primarily due to related costs from operations acquired in 2011 and continued investments in emerging markets. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2011 decreased 50 basis points from the prior year primarily due tocompany-wide spending controls, including the impact of restructuring activities, partially offset by investments in emerging markets.    Research and development expense  - Research and development expense consists principally of the costs related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-partyresearch and development activities, and IPR&D arising from business development activities. IPR&D payments may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. The following table presents a summary ofresearch and development expense for the following years ended December 31:                              2012         2011         2010      (dollars in millions)                                   Research and development      $  199.7          $  181.9          $  182.8         In-process research and development         3.5             3.5             2.6                                                              Total research and development expense      $  203.2          $  185.4          $  185.4                                                                II-7    Research and development expense in 2012 increased approximately 10% compared to the prioryear driven by the operations of recent acquisitions.

Cash provided fromoperations continues to be a primary source of funds. The company believes that it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary. The company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financialflexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the following years ended December 31:                              2012         2011         2010      (dollars in millions)                                   Cash and cash equivalents      $  896.3          $  596.4          $  641.4                                                              Working capital         1,399.6             773.5             1,123.3                                                              Current ratio         4.13/1             1.84/1             3.75/1                                                             Cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries were $786.1 million and$586.9 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. It is the companys intention to permanently reinvest the majority of these funds outside the United States to finance foreign operations, and the companys plans do notdemonstrate a need to repatriate these funds. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations for currently unforeseen circumstances or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the company would be required to accrue and payU.S. taxes on the earnings associated with these funds. In the United States, ongoing operating cash flows and available borrowings under the companys committed syndicated bank credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity.   For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, net cash provided by operating activities was $661.2 million,$721.5 million and $637.8 million respectively. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2012 reflects current year payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims settled in 2011, partially offset by improvements in accountsreceivable collections. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2011 reflects higher net income, excluding non-cash items and the timing of tax payments.    During 2012, the company used $98.2 million in cash for investing activities, $674.1 million less than in 2011. During 2011, the company used $772.3 million in cash for investing activities, $417.2million more than in 2010. Capital expenditures amounted to $72.6 million, $71.4 million and $51.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities in 2012 reflects adecrease of $122.1 million related to the release of restricted cash from qualified settlement funds (QSFs) to claimants pursuant to the proposed settlement of certain Hernia Product Claims. Net cash used for investing activities in 2011reflects an increase of $147.1 million in restricted cash related to payments to QSFs pursuant to the proposed settlement of certain Hernia Product Claims. The company spent $159.3 million in 2012, $557.2 million in 2011 and $303.9 million in2010 for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies to augment existing product lines.    During 2012, thecompany used $263.2 million in cash for financing activities compared to the $3.9 million provided by financing activities in 2011 and the $310.6 million used for financing activities in 2010.  Total debt was $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion atDecember 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. The increase in debt in 2012 reflected the proceeds of $499.4 million from the issuance of senior unsecured notes, net of debt issuance discount. Total debt to total capitalization was42.3%, 40.7% and 37.6% at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The company spent approximately $472.4 million to repurchase 4,903,677 shares of common stock in 2012 compared to approximately $221.8 million to repurchase2,519,410 shares of common stock in 2011 and approximately $1.1 billion to repurchase 12,025,000 shares in 2010. Purchases of common stock for 2011 also included a payment of $58.9 million in cash remitted to the bank counterparty upon final      II-9    settlement under the accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement is included in purchases of common stock in 2011. The repurchases of common stock in 2010 included $750.0 million torepurchase 8,100,000 shares upon initial settlement under the ASR agreement with the bank counterparty. The company paid cash dividends of  $66.7 million, $64.6 million and $66.9 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. In 2010, the company purchased thenoncontrolling interest in its Malaysian operation for $25.9 million.    The company maintains a $600 million five-yearcommitted syndicated bank credit facility that expires in October 2016. The credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on thecompanys long-term credit rating and includes a financial covenant that limits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At December 31, 2012, the company was in compliance with this covenant. The company had no outstandingcommercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2012 and $304.5 million of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2011.   Contractual Obligations   Payments due under contractual obligations at December 31, 2012, are as follows:                              (dollars in millions)      Total         1 Year         2-3 Years         4-5 Years         5+ Years        Forward contracts      $  75.1          $  75.1          $              $              $             Long-term debt         1,773.0             39.7             83.1             329.6             1,320.6         Operating lease obligations         153.5             23.6             38.6             31.7             59.6         Acquisition and related milestones         108.9             2.4             106.5                                     Purchase obligations         201.9             162.3             33.4             5.1             1.1         Legal settlements         25.0             25.0                                                   Other long-term liabilities         102.3             11.4             11.2             15.4             64.3                                                                                                   $  2,439.7          $  339.5          $  272.8          $  381.8          $  1,445.6                                                                                               The table above does not include $43.4 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain taxpositions and $4.8 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which theseliabilities might be paid.    Forward  contracts  - Forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchaseof currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.    Long-term debt  - Long-term debtincludes expected principal and interest payments, including the effect of an interest rate swap contract.   Operating lease obligations  - The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilitiesand equipment.    Acquisition and related milestones  - The company may make payments to third parties when milestones areachieved, such as the achievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets under various acquisition and related arrangements. The table above excludes amounts forthese milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur.    Purchase obligations  - Thecompanys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. These inventory purchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are entered into in the normal course ofbusiness.       II-10    Legal settlements  - Payments to claimants for Hernia Product Claims, subject tocertain settlement conditions, may be made from QSFs.    Other long-term liabilities  - The company estimates requiredfunding obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefit plans and deferred compensation.    Managements Use of Non-GAAPMeasures    Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure. The company analyzes net sales on aconstant currency basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on aconstant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by thecurrent periods exchange rate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAPmeasures are intended to supplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as replacements of GAAP results.    CriticalAccounting Policies and Estimates    The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to makeestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reportingperiod. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertainand may change in subsequent periods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notesto consolidated financial statements. See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in determining estimates and assumptions might producea materially different result.    Revenue Recognition  - Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributorsare recognized at the point of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customerslocation. In the case of consignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.    Share-Based Compensation  - Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basisover the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date, the company utilizes a binomial model. Inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life,risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews thetrading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. This approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stockoption valuations. With respect to expected future exercise behavior, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve ineffect at the grant date with a term equal to the contractual term of the stock option.    As share-based compensation expenseis based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. The company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant based on historical experience and revises estimates, if necessary, insubsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.       II-11    Contingencies  - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims,including, for example, product liability matters, environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known forextended periods of time. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. The company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and/orcosts related to claims, settlements and judgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, thecompany accrues the minimum amount of the range. The company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Amounts recovered under these policies may be less than the statedcoverage limits and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers will pay claims or that coverage will be otherwise available. Legal costs associated with these matters are expensed as incurred.See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Income Taxes  - The company operates in multiple taxingjurisdictions, both within the United States and internationally. The company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. These positions relate to transfer pricing, the deductibility of certain expenses,intercompany transactions and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters. The recognitionand measurement of a tax position is based on the companys best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The reserves are used or reversed once the statutes of limitation have expired or theposition is effectively settled. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial condition and/or liquidity but may be material to its income tax provision and results of operations.   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and Inventory Writedowns  - The company makes estimates of theuncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market. Inestimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, the average length of time to collect receivables, customer creditworthiness and current economictrends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers the lag time between the point of sale and thepayment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts. Inestimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market-related conditions. The company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when suchconditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists.    It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the changeto the underlying factors, the impact to the companys results of operations and financial condition could be material in the period of change.    Acquisitions  - In a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value, with goodwillbeing the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. IPR&D is capitalized and recorded as an indefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, contingent consideration is recorded atfair value at the acquisition date, and transaction costs are expensed as incurred. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technologyand discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. For IPR&D, these methodologies      II-12    include consideration of the risk of a project not achieving commercial feasibility. Amounts allocated to IPR&D are subject to an impairment review, using a fair value-based test, untilcompletion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as to the useful life of the asset and amortization will begin. When the company acquires net assets that are not accounted for as a businesscombination, no goodwill is recognized. The judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact results of operations.   Goodwill  - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at December 31 or more frequently if impairment indicators arise usinga fair value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment. The fair value of each reporting unit iscalculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-average combination of both market and income approaches. The market approach to estimating fair value is basedprimarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of areporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.    Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  - Intangible assets with finite lives and other long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flowsexpected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.   Pension Plans  - The company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreignemployees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about the discountrate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company. In addition, the company also uses subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarialassumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis pointsin the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $0.9 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate ofreturn on plan assets assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $0.9 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost.    New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    In February 2013, theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued a new statement that requires the company to present information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in a single note or onthe face of the financial statements. Under this statement, the company will present the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of AOCI based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification.If a component is not required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety, the company would cross reference to the related footnote for additional information. This FASB statement will be effective beginning in the first quarter of 2013.   Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information   Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the companyorally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical      II-13    or current facts. They use words such as anticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan,believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to product approvals, future performance of current andanticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. The companys forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or as of the date they are made,and the company undertakes no obligation to update its forward-looking statements.    In addition, there are substantial risksinherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves the design, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often used on, or permanently or temporarilyimplanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operating rooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associatedwith adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-district litigation proceedings) and other litigation,product withdrawals, warning letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,financial condition and/or liquidity.    Because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties, thecompany cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significant factors, in addition to those addressed above andthose under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, but are not limited to:   Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including:                  the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing processes and supply chainprograms or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses;                   the effects of negative publicity concerning our products, which could result in product withdrawals or decreased product demand and which could reducemarket or governmental acceptance of our products;                   the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and successfullyintegrate such transactions or to obtain agreements for such transactions on favorable terms;                   the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost-containment pressures or preferences for alternatetherapies;                   the ability to implement, and realize the benefits of, our plans to invest in our business, including our plan to increase research and developmentexpenditures with a focus on new market categories, increase growth in emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States and acquire growth platforms designed to change the mix of our portfolio towards faster, sustainable long-termgrowth;                   the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales;                  the ability to reduce exposure and uncertainty related to tax audits, appeals and litigation;                  internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales force employees;                  the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some ofwhich are more profitable than others;                   changes in factors and assumptions or actual results that differ from our assumptions on stock valuation and employee stock option exercise patterns,which could cause compensation expense recorded in future periods to differ significantly from the compensation expense recorded in the current period;       II-14                changes in factors and assumptions could cause pension cost recorded in future periods to differ from the pension cost recorded in the current period;                  the effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in the companys pension plans and the possibility that the company may need to makeadditional contributions to the plans as a result of any decline in the fair value of such assets;                   damage to a facility where our products are manufactured or from which they are distributed, which could render the company unable to manufacture ordistribute one or more products and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets;                  the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assetsspecifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets;                   the ability to obtain appropriate levels of product liability insurance on reasonable terms;                  the ability to recover for claims made to our insurance companies; and                  the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities, including our 2012 Restructuring Plan, to improve the companysoverall cost structure and improve efficiency.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About MarketRisk     Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign currencyexchange rate fluctuations. The company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in thecompanys international operations. The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probablecommitments denominated in foreign currencies. In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time-to-time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreigncurrency denominated cash flow from operations. The instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts willhave a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian Dollar, the Australian Dollar and the Japanese Yen. Any gainsand losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreigncurrency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2012 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformlystrengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would increase by $3.0 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by$0.1 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.   The companys investment portfolio primarily includes cash equivalents, for which the market values are not significantly affectedby changes in interest rates. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt is affected by a change in the medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates because the borrowings generally have longer maturities. The market value of thecompanys fixed-rate debt including the effect of the related interest rate swap contract effectively converting the 2.875% fixed-rate notes to floating-rate instruments approximated $1,532.1 million at December 31, 2012. A sensitivityanalysis, assuming a 100 basis point increase or decrease in U.S. interest rates and assuming that the debt and related swap are held to maturity, indicates that the market value of the debt and related swap would have approximated $1,444.6 millionor $1,620.8 million, respectively, on December 31, 2012.
