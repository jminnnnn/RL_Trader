Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results          of Operations and of Financial Conditions     General  Bard is a leading multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of products for the large and growing health care industry.  Worldwide health care expenditures approximated $2.5 trillion in 1998 with about half that amount spent in the United States.  Bard's segment of this industry, itself a multi-billion dollar market, is primarily specialized products used mainly in hospitals, in outpatient centers and in physician's offices to meet the needs of the medical profession in caring for their patients.  The company seeks to focus and concentrate on selected markets with cost-effective, innovative products and specialized sales forces to maximize Bard's opportunities in managing these markets.  Summary Results  Net sales for the full year 1998 were $1.165 billion, which include sales of products that were divested during the year.  Full-year sales of ongoing products, which include vascular, urology, oncology and surgery products increased 6% to $968.9 million.  This increase was primarily the result of growth in new and established product lines.  Bard's key franchises remain strong.  The company reported record earnings in 1998 of $252.3 million, which include a gain on the sale of its cardiology businesses as well as several other one-time items.  Without the one-time items reported in both 1998 and 1997, earnings per share would have shown growth consistent with ongoing sales growth.  Results of Operations - 1998 vs. 1997  Net sales for 1998 totaled $1.165 billion, which represents a 4% decline from the prior year mostly due to the 1998 divestiture of  the company's cardiology businesses.  Full year sales of ongoing products were $968.9 million, an increase of 6% over 1997 results.  Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 1998 reported net sales by 2% and 1%, respectively.  Sales of vascular products rose 6% in 1998.  Radiology and electrophysiology devices showed strong worldwide growth.  Graft product sales from our IMPRA division also contributed to the overall growth in the product group.  Urology product sales grew 5% in 1998.  The Infection Control Foley  catheter and our ProSeed brachytherapy business provided the majority of the growth in this area.  Sales of oncological products increased 7% in 1998.  Specialty access devices showed good growth, particularly in international markets.                                II-3  Results of Operations - 1998 vs. 1997 (continued)  Sales of surgery products grew 10% in 1998, propelled by high worldwide growth of mesh products, used primarily for hernia repair.  The product areas discussed above represent substantially all of Bard's ongoing products subsequent to the completion of the cardiology divestiture.  Net sales by product group for the last three years (in millions) are:                            1998        1997       1996   Vascular                 $  209.0    $  198.0   $  160.9 Urology                     339.8       323.4      306.4 Oncology                    213.1       199.1      191.7 Surgery                     148.4       134.8      123.0 Other ongoing products       58.6        58.2       62.6 Total ongoing products      968.9       913.5      844.6 Divested products           195.8       300.0      349.8 Net sales                $1,164.7    $1,213.5   $1,194.4  Sales in the United States of ongoing products rose 5% to $687.9 million.  The vascular and surgery products provided the greatest growth.  Ongoing product sales outside the U.S. increased 8% to $281.0 million with growth demonstrated by urology, oncology and surgery products.  The impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing these sales by 3%.  The geographic breakdown of ongoing product sales for the last three years is:                              1998      1997      1996 United States                 71%       71%       71% Europe                        19%       19%       19% Japan                          5%        5%        4% Other                          5%        5%        6%                              100%      100%      100%  Global pricing pressures together with the additional expenditures related to Bard's ongoing manufacturing restructuring effort increased cost of goods sold as a percent of sales to 47.6% from 47.2% in 1997.  In the fourth quarter when a substantial portion of the cardiology sale was completed, Bard reported improved cost of goods sold as a percent of sales of 45.9% from 47.1% in the prior year quarter.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 3% in 1998.  As a percent of sales, these expenses increased due to the effect of several one-time items such as Year 2000 expenditures.  Reported research and development expense declined 15% as a result of the sale of the cardiology businesses, while Bard's spending on its ongoing products was consistent with the prior year.                                II-4  Results of Operations - 1998 vs. 1997 (continued)  Interest expense declined 20% in 1998 due to Bard's decision to utilize a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the cardiology businesses to repay short-term debt.  In addition, the company elected in June 1998 to prepay a long-term note which further reduced 1998 interest expense.  As a result of a series of strategic initiatives, the company has divested several cardiology product lines.  These transactions closed in the fourth quarter 1998 when the company recorded a pretax gain of $329.2 million.  Please refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-19 for additional information.  Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-28 of this report for a summary of items in this category in the last three years.  Included in this category in 1998 are a net gain of $48.6 million from the settlement of various patent infringement and legal claims and a charge of $34.1 million for the writedown of assets primarily associated with divested businesses.  Income Tax  The effective tax rate was 45.7% in 1998, 31.1% in 1997 and 9.9% in 1996.  The increase in 1998 is largely the result of the sale of the cardiology businesses.  Net Income  In 1998, Bard reported net income of $252.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $4.51.  Excluding the impact of the after-tax gain on the sale of the cardiology businesses of $2.93, the net after-tax loss from one-time items of ($0.13) and the after-tax impact of the Year 2000 costs of ($0.03) diluted earnings per share would have been $1.76.  In 1997, Bard reported net income of $72.3 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.26.  Excluding the net after-tax loss from one-time items of ($0.38) and the after-tax impact of the Year 2000 costs of ($0.03), diluted earnings per share would have been $1.67.   In 1996, Bard reported net income of $92.5 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.61.  Excluding the net after-tax loss from one-time charges of ($0.45) and a reversal of tax reserves of $0.26, diluted earnings per share would have been $1.80.  Results of Operations - 1997 vs. 1996  Net sales rose 2% to $1.214 billion.  Products divested in 1997 reduced the growth in sales by 6%.  Price reductions totaled about 1.5% and the stronger dollar reduced reported net sales by 2%.                                II-5  Results of Operations - 1997 vs. 1996 (continued)  Sales of vascular products rose 23% in 1997.  Radiology devices and a full year of sales of graft products from the acquisition of IMPRA, Inc. both contributed to the growth rate of vascular products.  Urology product sales grew 6% in 1997.  The Infection Control Foley Catheter and the Contigen  Bard's collagen implant provided the growth in this area.  Sales of oncological products increased 4% in 1997.  Both specialty venous access devices and biopsy products showed strong performance.  Sales of surgery products grew 10% in 1997, propelled by high worldwide growth of mesh products, used primarily for hernia repair.  The product areas discussed above represent substantially all of Bard's ongoing products.  The combined growth of ongoing products was 8% in 1997.  Sales in the United States of ongoing products rose 8% in 1997 to $652.6 million.  Vascular and surgery products provided the best growth in the U.S.  Sales outside the U.S. of ongoing products increased 7% to $260.9 million in 1997.  Sales of vascular grafts (helped by the acquisition of IMPRA in 1996), specialty access devices, mesh products and basic urological drainage devices contributed to this growth internationally.  Bard's cost of goods sold improved to 47.2% of sales compared with 48.7% in 1996.  The company's efforts to reduce manufacturing costs and the acquisition of IMPRA resulted in this improvement.  Marketing, selling and administrative expenses increased almost 7% in 1997 primarily due to a full year of spending associated with the IMPRA acquisition and the costs associated with programming changes for the year 2000.  These expenses grew faster than sales and were at a level of 32.2% of sales in 1997 compared with 30.6% in 1996.  Spending for research and development increased 11% in 1997 to 7.1% of sales from 6.5% of sales in 1996.  This increase in spending reflected the continued high cost of competing in the cardiology marketplace.  Additional interest expense for the full year 1997 related to acquisitions in 1996 and resulted in the increase in total interest expense for the year.                                II-6  Results of Operations - 1997 vs. 1996 (continued)  Other (income) expense, net, in 1997 included charges of $44.1 million for a manufacturing restructuring plan and $10.5 million associated with the impairment of investments and intangible assets, and a legal settlement.  These charges were partially offset by gains of $17.8 million on the sale of the surgical suction and irrigation product line and $6.7 million from sales of other product lines and assets.  In addition, costs of $9.0 million in 1996 to combine the operations of acquisitions affected income in that year.  The effective tax rate was 31.1% in 1997 and 9.9% in 1996.  The lower tax rate in 1996 was primarily due to the increased tax benefit in the U.S. related to one-time charges and the reversal of approximately $15 million in tax reserves no longer required.  The  tax benefit from operations in Ireland and Puerto Rico favorably affected the tax rate in each year.  Net income decreased to $72.3 million in 1997 from $92.5 million in 1996.  Both years were affected by one-time items as discussed earlier in this review  Year 2000 Functionality  Bard has a company-wide initiative to address Year 2000 functionality.  A team of management and technical representatives oversees the Year 2000 efforts.  The company divides its Year 2000 initiative into two components, information technology (IT) and non-information technology (Non-IT).  The IT initiative includes purchased and internally developed mainframe and desktop computer systems and applications.  The Non-IT initiative includes suppliers, manufacturing and support systems and the company's customers.  Internal and external resources are being used to identify needs, make the required IT modifications and test Year 2000 functionality.  The identification process of all critical IT applications is complete.  The company is currently on schedule to complete the implementation of all modifications to these applications by the third quarter of 1999.  The company is utilizing both internal and external resources to provide independent system verification and validation of Year 2000 functionality.  This process will continue through the end of 1999 and includes the development and implementation of contingency plans to address unforeseen problems.  The company's Non-IT efforts include ensuring suppliers, manufacturing and support systems and the company's larger customers are Year 2000 functional.  The company is communicating with suppliers that provide critical products or services and customers.   The company is testing significant manufacturing and                                 II-7  Year 2000 Functionality (continued)  support systems.  If as a result of the company's communications or  as a result of the company's testing of Non-IT systems there appear to be potential Year 2000 functionality problems, additional contingency plans under development should minimize these risks.  There can be no guaranty that the systems of other companies on which the company's systems rely will be converted in a timely manner, or that a failure to convert by another company, or a conversion that is incompatible with the company's systems, would not have a material adverse effect on the company.  In addition, there are many risks associated with the Year 2000 issue, including but not limited to the possible failure of the company's computer and information technology systems.  Any failure by a supplier, customer or other entity may have a material adverse financial or operational effect on the company.  The company's marketing, selling and administrative expense included $4.7 million for IT-related Year 2000 expenditures in 1998 and $2.8 million in 1997.  Management believes that the company will incur additional expenses of approximately $3.0 million in 1999.  These incremental costs do not include existing internal resources allocated to the project effort.  These costs and the date on which the company plans to complete the Year 2000 modification and testing processes are based on management's best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future events including the continued availability of certain resources, third-party modification plans and other factors.  However, there can be no guaranty that these estimates will be achieved and actual results could differ from those plans.  Financial Condition and Liquidity  Bard's financial condition substantially strengthened in 1998.  The company received proceeds of approximately $625 million from the fourth quarter sale of its cardiology businesses.  A portion of these proceeds along with a second quarter intellectual property settlement and ongoing operating cash flow were used to retire debt and repurchase common stock.  As a result, total debt was reduced by $281.7 million to $162.0 million at the end of 1998 and the ratio of total debt to total capitalization declined to 22.2% at December 31, 1998 from 43.6% at December 31, 1997.  Shareholders' equity was reduced in 1998 with the repurchase of $264.1 million of common stock.  The company has a $300 million syndicated, committed credit facility with a group of 12 banks.  The company made no borrowings under this credit facility in 1998.  The facility expires in June 2000.  This facility supports a commercial paper program of $300 million.   The  company  borrows  actively  under  this  program.                                II-8  Financial Condition and Liquidity (continued)  In addition to the $300 million committed credit facility, Bard maintains uncommitted credit lines with banks for short-term cash needs and these lines were used as needed during the last three years.  At December 31, 1998 the unused uncommitted lines of credit totaled $255 million.  The company expects cash flow from operating activities to exceed capital expenditures and dividend payments.  The company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary.  The company believes this overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility.  Total cash outlays made for purchases of businesses, patents, trademarks and other related items were approximately $50 million in 1998, $23 million in 1997, and $237 million in 1996.  The majority of these investments were for intangible assets, reflecting the premium over book value for these purchases.  The majority of the cash outlays were financed with additional debt with the balance coming from cash from operations.  Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market to replace shares issued under various employee stock plans.  In connection with the announced sale of the cardiology businesses, the Board of Directors in July 1998 authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 10 million shares of common stock.  Total shares purchases were 6,295,200 in 1998; 955,200 in 1997; and 813,700 in 1996.  Foreign Currency Risk  The company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts and options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values.  Contracts have been exclusively for the forward purchase of, and options in, currencies in which the company has known or anticipated payments.  These are primarily for intercompany transactions, resulting in a high degree of confidence that the anticipated transactions will take place.  Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide short-term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values.  Please refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-22 of this report for further information about the company's foreign exchange contracts.                                II-9  Foreign Currency Risk (continued)  The company continues to review and monitor the impact of a common European currency on its business.  Due to numerous uncertainties, the company cannot at this time accurately estimate the effect one common currency will have on pricing and the resulting impact, if any, on the company's financial condition or results of operations.  Currently, management believes that this impact will not be material.  Legal Proceedings  For a discussion of pending legal proceedings and related matters, please see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-23.  Acquisitions and Dispositions  For information on the company's acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, please see Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page II-19.  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information  Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally, including without limitation statements regarding the use of net proceeds from the sale of the company's cardiology businesses, statements regarding cost savings from restructuring, and statements regarding the company's future performance, may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Because actual results are affected by risks and  uncertainties, the  company  cautions  investors  that  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied.  Factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results include, but are not limited to: health care industry consolidation resulting in customer demands for price concessions; competitors' attempts to gain market share through aggressive marketing programs; fewer medical procedures performed in a cost-conscious environment; the unpredictability of the approval time by the FDA or other government authorities to clear medical devices for commercial release; unanticipated product failures; legislative or administrative reforms to the U.S. Medicare and Medicaid systems or other non-U.S. reimbursement systems in a manner that would significantly reduce reimbursements for procedures using the company's medical devices; the acquisition of key patents by competitors that would have the effect of excluding the company from new market segments; the uncertainty of whether increased research and development expenditures will result in increased sales; unpredictability of existing and future litigation including without  limitation  litigation  regarding  product  liability;                                II-10  Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information (continued)  uncertainty related to tax appeals and litigation; price increases from the company's suppliers of critical components; foreign currency fluctuations; unanticipated business disruptions from Year 2000 issues; the risk that the company may not achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies as a result of the company's restructuring and/or in the integration of acquired businesses or divestitures.
