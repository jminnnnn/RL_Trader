Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations    This managements discussion and analysis provides a review of the results ofoperations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of the company and its subsidiaries. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere inthis Form 10-K. Certain statements contained herein may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995; see Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-LookingInformation below.    Overview    The company designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes and sells medical, surgical, diagnostic and patient care devices. The company sells a broad range of products to hospitals, individualhealthcare professionals, extended care facilities and alternate site facilities on a global basis. Outside the United States, Europe, Japan and China are the companys largest markets, while certain emerging markets in Asia, Latin America andEastern Europe are the companys fastest growing markets. In general, the companys products are intended to be used once and then discarded or either temporarily or permanently implanted. The company reports sales in four major productgroup categories: vascular, urology, oncology and surgical specialties. The company also has a product group category of other products.    The companys earnings are driven by its ability to continue to generate sales of its products and improve operating efficiency. Bards ability to increase sales over time depends upon itssuccess in developing, acquiring and marketing differentiated products that meet the needs of clinicians and their patients. In 2015, the companys research and development (R&D) expense as a percentage of net sales was 7.6%.The company also makes selective acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies, generally focusing on small-to-medium sized transactions to provide ongoing growth opportunities. In addition, the company may, from time-to-time, consideracquisitions of larger, established companies. The company may also periodically divest lines of business in which it is not able to reasonably attain or maintain a leadership position in the market or for other strategic reasons. The company spent$98.3 million in 2015, including acquired in-process R&D (IPR&D), for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies.    Acquisitions, Legal and Other Developments    Acquisitions   On January 21, 2016, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Liberator Medical Holdings, Inc. (Liberator),a publicly-held direct-to-consumer distributor of urological catheters, ostomy supplies, mastectomy fashions and diabetic medical supplies for approximately $181 million. This acquisition is expected to enhance the companys position in thehome healthcare market in the United States. The purchase of Liberator was funded primarily with short-term borrowings.    OnDecember 3, 2015, the company, through a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, acquired all of the outstanding shares of Embo Medical Limited (Embo), a privately-held company headquartered in Galway, Ireland, specializing in thedevelopment of peripheral embolization devices. The total purchase consideration included an up-front cash payment of $21.0 million and the fair value of future contingent consideration of up to $22.5 million. The acquisition will be recognized inthe first quarter of 2016 for this foreign subsidiary. The purchase of Embo was funded by available cash on hand.    OnNovember 2, 2015, the company acquired Kobayashi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.s (Kobayashi) 50% ownership share in Medicon, Inc. (Medicon), through a share redemption (the Medicon Acquisition). Medicon was ajoint venture company equally-owned by the company and Kobayashi and was a distributor of Bards products in Japan. As a result of the Medicon Acquisition, the company now owns 100% of the outstanding shares of Medicon. The acquisition providesthe company with greater control over its operations in       II-3    Japan. The total consideration of $138.0 million, denominated in Japanese Yen, included an up-front cash payment of approximately $24.9 million at closing; the present value of future paymentstotaling approximately $65.8 million; as well as the settlement of an accounts receivable balance due from Medicon of $42.0 million; and the fair value of an off-market supply contract of $5.3 million. The future payments will be paid in JapaneseYen over a 10 year period, subject to exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, the company recorded an expense of $49.6 million ($33.5 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, related to the settlement of a pre-existing contractualrelationship, which included a management fee provision. In connection with the fair value measurement of the companys existing 50% ownership share in Medicon, the company also recorded a gain of $25.5 million to other (income) expense, net.   On July 1, 2015, the company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vascular Pathways, Inc. (VPI), aprivately-held developer and supplier of vascular access devices. The total purchase consideration of $81.5 million included the fair value of future contingent consideration of up to $15 million based on specific revenue-based andmanufacturing-related milestones.    For more information on acquisitions, see Note 2 of the notes to consolidated financialstatements.    Legal Developments    In connection with the companys ongoing suit against W. L. Gore & Associates, Inc. (Gore) for infringing Bards patent number 6,436,135 (the 135 patent), thecompany filed a motion to execute on the judgment on the issue of willfulness, which was granted by the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona on April 23, 2015. On May 1, 2015, Gore paid the company $210.5 million in cash,representing the total amount of the enhanced damages awarded by this District Court due to Gores willfulness and an audit adjustment related to the payment of royalties through September 30, 2013. Amounts received from Gore in May 2015and previously in November 2013 are referred to as the Gore Proceeds. In the second quarter of 2015, the company recorded a gain of $210.5 million ($131.7 million after tax) to other (income) expense, net, based on this DistrictCourts April 23, 2015 ruling and the companys receipt of the May 2015 portion of the Gore Proceeds. On October 5, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Gores petition for a writ of certiorari for review of the decision thatthe 135 patent was infringed and their decision is final and non-appealable.    During 2015, the company recorded additionalcharges related to product liability matters, net of estimated recoveries to other (income) expense, net, of approximately $578.0 million ($553.0 million after tax).    For more information on legal matters, see Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Medical Device Excise Tax    Beginning in 2013, the medical device industrywas required to subsidize healthcare reform in the form of a 2.3% excise tax on United States sales of most medical devices. In December 2015, as part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, collection of the medical device excise tax was suspended for2016 and 2017. During 2015, the company recorded to marketing, selling and administrative expense an excise tax of $26.9 million.    Resultsof Operations    Net Sales    Bards 2015 consolidated net sales increased 3% on a reported basis (6% on a constant currency basis) over 2014 consolidated net sales. Bards 2014 consolidated net sales increased 9% on both areported basis and constant currency basis over 2013 consolidated net sales. Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure and should not be viewed as a replacement of GAAP results. See Managements Use ofNon-GAAP Measures below. Price changes had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales by approximately 110 basis points for both 2015 and 2014 compared to the prior years. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar, a trend that may continue,had the effect of decreasing consolidated net sales for 2015 by approximately three percentage points compared to the prior year. Exchange rate fluctuations had a nominal impact on consolidated net sales for 2014 compared to the prior year. Theprimary exchange rate movement that impacts net sales is the movement of       II-4    the Euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The impact of exchange rate movements on net sales is not indicative of the impact on net earnings due to the offsetting impact of exchange rate movements onoperating costs and expenses, costs incurred in other currencies and the companys hedging activities.    Bards 2015United States net sales of $2,378.4 million increased 5% compared to $2,263.5 million in 2014. Bards 2015 international net sales of $1,037.6 million decreased 2% on a reported basis (increased 8% on a constant currency basis) compared to$1,060.1 million in 2014. Bards 2014 United States net sales increased 12% compared to $2,014.1 million in 2013. Bards 2014 international net sales increased 2% on a reported basis (3% on a constant currency basis) compared to $1,035.4million in 2013.    Presented below is a summary of consolidated net sales by product group category.

Also included within vascular products are royalty payments from Gore. In November 2013, Bard sold certain assets and liabilities of its electrophysiology division (the EPSale) to Boston Scientific Corporation, retaining only the guidewire and temporary pacing electrode product lines. Consolidated net sales of vascular products in 2015 increased 5% on a reported basis (9% on a constant currency basis) comparedto the prior year. This increase was primarily due to growth in sales of endovascular products. United States net sales of vascular products in 2015 increased 7% compared to the prior year. International net sales of vascular products in 2015 wereflat on a reported basis (increased 13% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of vascular products in 2014 increased 12% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Thisincrease includes growth of 18 percentage points on a reported basis (19 percentage points on a constant currency basis) due to royalty payments from Gore, and a decrease of 12 percentage points on both a reported basis and constant currency basisrelated to the divested electrophysiology products as a result of the EP Sale. United States net sales of vascular products in 2014 increased 34% compared to the prior year primarily due to royalty payments from Gore. International net sales in 2014decreased 13% on a reported basis (14% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. The decrease in international net sales in 2014 was primarily due to divested electrophysiology products as a result of the EP Sale and was partiallyoffset by an increase in sales of endovascular products.    Consolidated net sales of endovascular products in 2015 increased 6%on a reported basis (10% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Net sales in this product line were favorably impacted by growth in sales of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon catheters, includingdrug-coated PTA balloon catheters, and biopsy products, and were partially offset by a decline in sales of stents, a trend that may continue. Consolidated net sales of endovascular products in 2014 increased 28% on both a reported basis and constantcurrency basis compared to the prior year. This increase includes growth of 24 percentage points on both a reported basis and constant currency basis due to royalty payments from Gore. Net sales in 2014 were also favorably impacted by growth insales of PTA balloon catheters, including drug-coated PTA balloon catheters, and biopsy products, and were partially offset by a decline in sales of stents.       II-5    Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products in 2015 decreased 6% on a reported basis(flat on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Declining sales of peripheral vascular grafts contributed to the decrease in 2015. Consolidated net sales of vascular graft products in 2014 decreased 3% on both a reported basis andconstant currency basis compared to the prior year. Declining sales of peripheral vascular grafts and dialysis access grafts were the primary contributors to the decrease in 2014.   Urology Products  - Bard markets a wide range of products for the urology market, including basic urologydrainage products, fecal and urinary continence products and urological specialty products. Bard also marketsStatLock ®  catheter stabilization products, which are used to secure many types of catheters sold by Bard andother companies, as well as Targeted Temperature Management products, which are used for therapeutic hypothermia. In 2015, consolidated net sales of urology products increased 1% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) comparedto the prior year. This increase was primarily due to growth in sales of basic drainage products and Targeted Temperature Management products and was partially offset by declines in sales of surgical continence products, a trend that maycontinue, and urological specialty products. United States net sales of urology products in 2015 increased 4% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2015 decreased 5% on a reported basis (increased 3% on a constant currency basis)compared to the prior year. International net sales for 2015 reflected declines in sales of basic drainage products, continence products and urological specialty products. Consolidated net sales of urology products in 2014 increased 8% on both areported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. This includes 7 percentage points of growth on both a reported basis and constant currency basis from the addition of the Rochester Medical Corporation (RochesterMedical) products acquired in November 2013 and growth in sales of basic drainage products and Targeted Temperature Management products. These increases were partially offset by declines in sales of surgical continence products andStatLock ®  catheter stabilization products. United States net sales of urology products in 2014 increased 5%compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2014 increased 12% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year.    Consolidated net sales of basic drainage products in 2015 increased 2% on a reported basis (4% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of basic drainage productsin 2014 increased 7% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year primarily due to sales of the Rochester Medical products.    Consolidated net sales of urological specialty products in 2015 decreased 4% on a reported basis (increased 1% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year primarily due to declines in salesof brachytherapy products. Consolidated net sales of urological specialty products in 2014 increased 5% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to sales of the RochesterMedical products and was partially offset by a decline in sales of brachytherapy products. The brachytherapy market has been losing procedural share to alternative therapies, a trend that may continue.   Consolidated net sales of continence products in 2015 decreased 4% on a reported basis (increased 2% on a constant currency basis)compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to declines in sales of surgical continence products, a trend that may continue, and was partially offset by an increase in sales of continence care products. Consolidated net sales ofcontinence products in 2014 increased 33% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year primarily due to sales of the Rochester Medical products. Net sales in 2014 were also impacted by a decline in sales ofsurgical continence products.    Consolidated net sales of the StatLock ®  catheter stabilization product line in 2015 decreased 2% on a reported basis (flat on a constant currency basis)compared to the prior year. Consolidated net sales of the StatLock ®  catheter stabilization product line in 2014decreased 2% on both a reported basis and constant currency basis compared to the prior year.

In 2015, consolidated net sales of surgical specialty products increased 3% on a reported basis (6% on a constant currency basis) compared to theprior year. This increase is primarily due to growth in sales of biosurgery products and synthetic hernia repair products and was partially offset by a decline in sales of performance irrigation products, a trend that may continue. United States netsales of surgical specialty products in 2015 increased 7% compared to the prior year. International net sales in 2015 decreased 8% on a reported basis (increased 2% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. International net salesfor 2015 reflected declines in sales of synthetic hernia repair products and performance irrigation products and was partially offset by an increase in sales of biosurgery products. In 2014, consolidated net sales of surgical specialty productsincreased 11% on a reported basis (12% on a constant currency basis) compared to the prior year. This increase included 8 percentage points of growth on a reported basis (9 percentage points on a constant currency basis) from the addition of theArista ®  MHP hemostat (Arista) from the acquisition of Medafor, Inc. in October 2013. Net sales in2014 were also favorably impacted by growth in sales of synthetic hernia repair products and were partially offset by declines in sales of natural tissue hernia repair products, performance irrigation products and hernia fixation products. UnitedStates net sales of surgical specialty products in 2014 increased 11% compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to sales of Arista and growth in sales of synthetic hernia repair products and was partially offset by declines insales of natural tissue hernia repair products, performance irrigation products and hernia fixation products.

Costs and Expenses    The following is a summary of costs and expenses as a percentage of net sales for the following years ended December 31:                             2015 (A)        2014        2013 (A)        Cost of goods sold         38.1  %         37.9  %         39.2  %      Marketing, selling and administrative expense         29.6  %         29.5  %         30.2  %      Research and development expense         7.6  %         9.1  %         9.7  %      Interest expense         1.3  %         1.3  %         1.5  %      Other (income) expense, net         13.1  %         8.8  %         (20.3  )%                                                         Total costs and expenses         89.8  %         86.6  %         60.2  %                                                             (A)      Amounts do not add due to rounding.    Cost of goods sold  - Cost of goods sold consists principally of the manufacturing and distribution costs of the companys products. The category also includes royalties paid by the company,amortization of intangible assets and the impact of certain hedging activities. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2015 increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year due to the impact of lower selling prices and exchange ratefluctuations. In addition, incremental amortization of intangible assets primarily related to the Lutonix ® drug-coated PTA balloon and intangible assets acquired in 2015 increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 40 basis points over the prior year. These increases were partially offset by the reversal of a liability withrespect to a certain revenue-based milestone and cost improvements. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales for 2014 decreased 130 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to the impact of royalty payments received from Gore.Incremental amortization of intangible assets acquired in 2013 and 2014 and amortization of intangible assets related to theLutonix ®  drug-coated PTA balloon increased cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales by approximately 70basis points over the prior year.    Marketing, selling and administrative expense  - Marketing, selling andadministrative expense consists principally of the costs associated with the companys sales and administrative organizations. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2015 increased 10 basis points compared to the prior year primarily dueto related costs from operations acquired in 2015. These costs as a percentage of net sales for 2014 decreased 70 basis points from the prior year primarily due to the impact of royalty payments received from Gore, partially offset by continuingtargeted investment spending in this area including in emerging markets, a trend that may continue. In       II-8    addition, these costs for 2014 included a credit of $3.5 million associated with an agreement reached with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) during 2014 related to the excisetax paid on U.S. medical device sales in 2013.    Research and development expense  - Research and development expenseconsists principally of the costs related to internal research and development activities, milestone payments for third-party research and development activities, and IPR&D costs arising from the companys business development activities.IPR&D payments may impact the comparability of the companys results of operations between periods. The following table presents a summary of research and development expense for the following years ended December 31:                             2015         2014         2013      (dollars in millions)                                   Research and development      $  254.7          $  265.9          $  262.3         In-process research and development         4.5             36.1             33.4                                                              Total research and development expense      $  259.2          $  302.0          $  295.7                                                             Research and development expense in 2015 decreased approximately 4% compared to the prior year period.Research and development expense in 2014 increased approximately 1% compared to the prior year period. IPR&D in 2015 and 2014 included charges of $4.5 million and $6.8 million, respectively, related to the impairment of IPR&D projects,primarily due to changes in cash flow assumptions. In addition, IPR&D in 2014 included charges of $26.7 million primarily related to the change in the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration related to the Lutonix, Inc.(Lutonix) acquisition, and $2.6 million related to the acquisition of early-stage technology. IPR&D in 2013 included charges of $30.0 million related to the acquisition of early-stage technology and $3.4 million for an impairmentcharge related to an IPR&D project.    Interest expense  - Interest expense in 2015 was $44.9 million as compared with2014 interest expense of $44.8 million and 2013 interest expense of $45.0 million.    Other (income) expense, net  - Other(income) expense, net, was expense of $449.2 million and $290.9 million for 2015 and 2014, respectively, and income of $619.3 million for 2013. Other (income) expense, net, in 2015 included $595.1 million for litigation charges, net, a gain of$210.5 million related to the 2015 portion of the Gore Proceeds, $41.5 million for restructuring and productivity initiatives costs, and net charges of $24.7 million for acquisition-related items consisting of purchase accounting adjustments andintegration-related costs. Other (income) expense, net, in 2014 included $288.6 million for litigation charges, net, $11.8 million for restructuring and productivity initiative costs, and a gain on sale of an equity investment of $7.1 million. Other(income) expense, net, in 2013 included income of $894.3 million related to the 2013 portion of the Gore Proceeds and $213.0 million resulting from the gain on the EP Sale, partially offset by expenses of $428.0 million for litigation charges, net,$25.0 million for a contribution to the C. R. Bard Foundation, Inc., $17.5 million for divestiture-related charges, $11.3 million for acquisition-related items consisting of integration-related costs and $6.4 million for asset impairments.   Income Tax Provision    The companys effective tax rate for 2015 was 61.2% compared to 33.9% in 2014 and 43.2% in 2013. The effective tax rate for 2015 reflected the tax effects of litigation charges, primarily related toproduct liability claims, which were substantially incurred in a low tax jurisdiction and a gain related to the 2015 portion of the Gore Proceeds, which was incurred in a high tax jurisdiction. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financialstatements.    The effective tax rate for 2014 reflected the tax effects of litigation charges, primarily related to productliability claims, which were substantially incurred in a low tax jurisdiction and a benefit of $10.9 million related to the completion of IRS examinations for the tax years 2008 through 2010. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financialstatements.       II-9    The effective tax rate for 2013 reflected the tax effects of litigation charges, primarilyrelated to product liability claims, which were substantially incurred in a low tax jurisdiction, and the gains related to the 2013 portion of the Gore Proceeds and the EP Sale, which were incurred in high tax jurisdictions. See Notes 2 and 10 ofthe notes to consolidated financial statements. In addition, the income tax provision was reduced by approximately $3.7 million in 2013 to recognize the 2012 benefit of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 which was signed into law onJanuary 2, 2013 and retroactively reinstated the research tax credit.    Net Income and Earnings per Share Available to CommonShareholders    The company reported 2015 net income of $135.4 million, a decrease of 54% from 2014 net income of $294.5million. The company reported 2015 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $1.77, a decrease of 53% from 2014 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $3.76. Net income in 2015 reflects litigationcharges, net, of $568.8 million, or $7.43 per diluted share, the 2015 portion of the Gore Proceeds of $131.7 million, or $1.72 per diluted share, amortization of intangible assets of $79.3 million, or $1.04 per diluted share, restructuring andproductivity initiative costs of $29.4 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, net charges from acquisition-related items (primarily consisting of purchase accounting adjustments, integration costs and transaction costs) of $11.1 million, or $0.15 perdiluted share, and an asset impairment of $2.8 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.    The company reported 2014 net income of$294.5 million, a decrease of 57% from 2013 net income of $689.8 million. The company reported 2014 diluted earnings per share available to common shareholders of $3.76, a decrease of 55% from 2013 diluted earnings per share available to commonshareholders of $8.39. Net income in 2014 reflects litigation charges, net, of $267.2 million, or $3.41 per diluted share, amortization of intangible assets of $72.4 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, net charges from acquisition-related items(consisting of purchase accounting adjustments, integration costs, an IPR&D charge, and transaction costs) of $30.5 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, restructuring and productivity initiative costs of $8.0 million, or $0.10 per diluted share,a gain on sale of an equity investment of $4.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, and an asset impairment of $3.9 million, or $0.05 per diluted share. Net income for 2014 also reflects a credit of $2.3 million, or $0.03 per diluted share,associated with an agreement reached with the IRS during 2014 related to the excise tax paid on U.S. medical device sales in 2013 and a $10.9 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, benefit to the income tax provision as a result of the completion ofIRS examinations for the tax years 2008 through 2010.    Liquidity and Capital Resources   The company assesses its liquidity in terms of its ability to generate cash to fund its operating, investing and financing activities.Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities, capital expenditures, acquisitions of businesses and technologies, cash dividends and common stock repurchases. Cash provided fromoperations continues to be a primary source of funds. The company believes that it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms should it be necessary. The company also believes that its overall financial strength gives it sufficient financialflexibility. The table below summarizes liquidity measures for Bard for the following years ended December 31:                              2015         2014         2013      (dollars in millions)                                   Cash and cash equivalents      $  950.5          $  960.1          $  1,066.9                                                              Working capital      $  831.4          $  1,432.5          $  1,503.9                                                              Current ratio         1.66/1             3.33/1             3.56/1                                                             Cash and cash equivalents held by the companys foreign subsidiaries were $881.6 million and $950.9million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. It is the companys intention to permanently reinvest the majority of these funds outside the United States to finance foreign operations, and the companys plans do not demonstratea need to repatriate these funds. If these funds are needed for U.S. operations for currently unforeseen circumstances or can no longer be permanently reinvested outside the United States, the company      II-10    would be required to accrue and pay U.S. taxes on the earnings associated with these funds. In the United States, ongoing operating cash flows and available borrowings under the companyscommitted syndicated bank credit facility provide it with sufficient liquidity.    For the years ended December 31, 2015,2014 and 2013, net cash provided by operating activities was $798.1 million, $660.0 million and $1,123.3 million, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to 2014 is primarily due to the receipt of the2015 portion of the Gore Proceeds, lower tax payments in 2015 compared to 2014, and higher operational cash flows. These increases were partially offset by settlement payments pursuant to an agreement with Medtronic (see Note 10 of the notes toconsolidated financial statements) and higher payments to claimants for certain product liability matters in the current year period. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2014 compared to 2013 is primarily due to the receiptof the 2013 portion of the Gore Proceeds, partially offset by lower tax payments in 2014 compared to 2013, receipt of Gore royalty payments in 2014 and a settlement payment for a certain legal matter in 2013.   During 2015, the company used $211.4 million in cash for investing activities, $48.1 million more than in 2014. During 2014, the companyused $163.3 million in cash for investing activities, $125.0 million less than in 2013. Capital expenditures amounted to $102.9 million, $126.6 million and $69.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Thecompany spent $98.3 million in 2015, $13.3 million in 2014 and $498.5 million in 2013 for the acquisition of businesses, products and technologies to augment existing product lines. In addition, the company received net proceeds from the sale offinancial instruments acquired in the Medicon Acquisition of $21.0 million in 2015. The company received net proceeds from the EP Sale of $267.4 million in 2013. Net cash used in investing activities in 2015 and 2014 reflects an increase of $31.2million in both years in restricted cash related to payments to qualified settlement funds (QSFs) for certain product liability matters. Net cash used in investing activities in 2013 reflects decreases of $8.7 million related to therelease of restricted cash from QSFs to claimants pursuant to the settlement of certain product liability matters.    During2015, 2014 and 2013, the company used $554.1 million, $584.4 million and $663.3 million in cash for financing activities, respectively. Total debt was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Total debt tototal capitalization was 49%, 45.1% and 40.2% at December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The company spent approximately $498.7 million to repurchase 2,745,289 shares of common stock in 2015 compared to $659.6 million to repurchase4,497,427 shares of common stock in 2014 and $738.1 million to repurchase 6,559,195 shares of common stock in 2013. The company paid cash dividends of $69.4 million, $66.2 million and $66.5 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The companymade a contingent milestone payment of $100.0 million in 2014 related to the acquisition of Lutonix, of which $70.0 million represented the fair value previously established at the acquisition date and was included in financing activities.   In November 2015, the company amended its $750 million five-year committed syndicated bank credit facility that was scheduledto expire in November 2019. The amendment includes an increase in the aggregate principal amount of credit available under the syndicated bank credit facility to $1.0 billion and extends the commitment termination date until November 2020. Theamended credit facility supports the companys commercial paper program and can be used for general corporate purposes. The facility includes pricing based on the companys long-term credit ratings and includes a financial covenant thatlimits the amount of total debt to total capitalization. At December 31, 2015, the company was in compliance with this covenant. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2015. The company had commercial paperborrowings outstanding of $78.0 million at December 31, 2014.    In January 2016, the company redeemed its 2.875% notes due2016, primarily through the issuance of commercial paper.       II-11    Contractual Obligations    Payments due under contractual obligations at December 31, 2015, are as follows:                               (dollars in millions)      Total         1 Year         2-3 Years         4-5 Years         5+ Years        Forward contracts      $  97.2          $  97.2          $              $              $             Long-term debt, including current maturities         1,649.6             290.1             574.4             64.1             721.0         Operating lease obligations         152.7             33.1             46.8             28.1             44.7         Acquisition and related milestones         87.1             23.4             29.8             14.9             19.0         Purchase obligations         415.1             232.5             89.1             42.5             51.0         Legal settlements         516.5             516.5                                                      Other long-term liabilities         145.8             7.8             26.8             17.2             94.0                                                                                                   $  3,064.0          $  1,200.6          $  766.9          $  166.8          $  929.7                                                                                               The table above does not include $22.3 million of the total unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain taxpositions and $2.8 million of associated accrued interest. Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows, the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount and period in which theseliabilities might be paid.    Forward contracts  - Forward contracts obligate the company for the forward purchase ofcurrencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments.    Long-term debt, including currentmaturities  - Long-term debt, including current maturities, includes expected principal and interest payments, including the effect of an interest rate swap contract.    Operating lease obligations  - The company is committed under noncancelable operating leases involving certain facilities and equipment.   Acquisition and related milestones  - The company may make payments to third parties when milestones are achieved, such as theachievement of research and development targets, receipt of regulatory approvals or achievement of performance or operational targets under various acquisition and related arrangements. In addition, the company is also required to make annual futurepayments to Kobayashi, its former joint venture partner, as part of the Medicon Acquisition. The table above excludes amounts for these milestone payments unless the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur.   Purchase obligations  - The companys business creates a need to enter into commitments with suppliers. These inventorypurchase commitments do not exceed the companys projected requirements over the related terms and are entered into in the normal course of business.    Legal settlements  - Estimated amounts recorded to accrued expenses for product liability and other legal matters. The table above does not include non-current accruals for product liability andother legal matters of $657.8 million. Payments and final settlements for certain of these matters are subject to numerous factors and conditions (outside the companys control) that make timing and ultimate resolution uncertain.   Other long-term liabilities  - The company estimates required funding obligations related to its pension and postretirement benefitplans and deferred compensation.    Certain Regulatory Matters    In October 2014 and November 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted directed inspections at two of the companys facilities after which the FDA issuedForm-483s to the company in       II-12    connection with these inspections. The company responded to the FDA, is in the process of addressing the observations in the Form-483s and intends to fully implement corrective andpreventive actions to address the FDAs concerns. On July 14, 2015, the company received a Warning Letter from the Los Angeles District office of the FDA. The Warning Letter specifically cites quality systems and medical device reportingobservations relating to non-conformances previously identified in the Form-483 notices for Glens Falls, New York and Tempe, Arizona and appropriate market clearance or approval of two models of our Recovery Cone Removal Systems used to retrievecertain implanted filters. The Warning Letter states that, until the company resolves the outstanding issues covered by the Warning Letter, no premarket submissions for Class III devices to which the non-conformances are reasonably related will becleared or approved. The company presently has two such submissions before the FDA, which the company does not believe are material to its business. The company intends to fully implement corrective actions to address the concerns identified in theWarning Letter. However, the company cannot give any assurances that the FDA will be satisfied with its response to the Warning Letter or to the expected date of resolution of matters included in the Warning Letter. Although the company cannot giveany assurances that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the companys business, results of operations, financial conditions and/or liquidity, the company does not at this time believe this will have amaterial impact on its financial statements.    Managements Use of Non-GAAP Measures   Net sales on a constant currency basis is a non-GAAP measure. The company analyzes net sales on a constant currency basis tobetter measure the comparability of results between periods. Because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non-operating impact on net sales, the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis providesan additional and meaningful assessment of net sales to both management and the companys investors. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior years local currency sales by the current periods exchangerate. Constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows. The limitation of these non-GAAP measures is that they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis. Non-GAAP measures are intended tosupplement the applicable GAAP disclosures and should not be viewed as replacements of GAAP results.    Critical Accounting Policies andEstimates    The preparation of financial statements requires the companys management to make estimates and assumptionsthat affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accountingpolicies are those that require application of managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequentperiods. The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the companys accounting policies. The companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in the companys notes to consolidated financialstatements. See Note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. The critical accounting policies described below are areas in which managements judgment in determining estimates and assumptions might produce a materially differentresult.    Revenue Recognition  - Generally, sales to end-user customers and European distributors are recognized at thepoint of delivery, and sales to domestic distributors are recognized at the time of shipment. In certain circumstances, end-user customers may require the company to maintain consignment inventory at the customers location. In the case ofconsignment inventories, revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer.    Royaltyrevenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalty revenue can be objectively determined. If royalty revenue cannot be objectively determined during the quarterly period in which it is earned, then royalty revenue isrecognized in the following quarterly period when objective evidence is obtained and the revenue becomes fixed and determinable.       II-13    Share-Based Compensation  - Share-based compensation cost is measured at the grantdate based on the fair value of the award. Generally, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. In order to determine the fair value of stock options on the grant date, the company utilizes a binomialmodel. Inherent in the binomial model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, option life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The expected stock-price volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility ofthe companys stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options. The company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility. Thisapproach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations. With respect to expected future exercise behavior, the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and modelsthe pattern of aggregate exercises. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the grant date with a term equal to the contractual term of the stock option.   Contingencies  - The company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including, for example, product liability matters,environmental matters, employment disputes, disputes regarding agreements and other commercial disputes, the outcomes of which are not within the companys complete control and may not be known for extended periods of time. In some cases, theclaimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. The company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements for damages and/or costs related to claims, settlements andjudgments where the company has assessed that the loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, the company accrues the minimum amount of therange. The company records expected recoveries from its product liability insurance carriers or other parties when those recoveries are probable and collectible. Amounts recovered under these arrangements may be less than the stated coverage limitsor less than otherwise expected and may not be adequate to cover damages and/or costs. In addition, there is no guarantee that insurers or others will pay claims or that coverage or indemnity will be otherwise available. Legal costs associated withthese matters are expensed as incurred. See Note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.    Income Taxes  -The company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions, both within the United States and internationally. The company regularly assesses its tax positions and includes reserves for uncertain tax positions. These positions relate to transfer pricing,the deductibility of certain expenses, intercompany transactions, state taxes and other matters. Although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain, in managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potentialliabilities resulting from such matters. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on the companys best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The reserves are used or reversedonce the statutes of limitation have expired or the position is effectively settled. The company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial condition and/or liquidity but may be material toits income tax provision and results of operations.    Allowance for Doubtful Accounts, Customer Rebates and InventoryWritedowns  - The company makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the companys accounts receivable, amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventoryvaluation at the lower of cost or market. In estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers historical bad debt trends, customer concentrations, the average length of time to collect receivables,customer creditworthiness and current economic and market trends. The company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for amounts deemed uncollectible from customers. In estimating the allowance for customer rebates, management considers thelag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customers rebate claim, customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate. The company establishes an allowance for customer rebates andreduces sales for such rebate amounts. In estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns, management considers product obsolescence, quantity on hand, future demand for the product and other market-related conditions. The company records anadjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value. The company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period in which the condition exists.       II-14    It is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtfulaccounts, customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change. Depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors, the impact to the companys results of operations and financial condition could be material in theperiod of change.    Acquisitions  - In a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that theidentifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed be measured at their fair value, with goodwill being the excess value of consideration paid over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. IPR&D is capitalized and recorded as anindefinite-lived intangible asset at the acquisition date, contingent consideration is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, and transaction costs are expensed as incurred. When the company acquires net assets that are not accounted for asa business combination, no goodwill is recognized.    IPR&D represents intangible assets acquired in a business combinationthat are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility. The amount of the purchase price allocated to IPR&D and other intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flowsof each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values. The discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods. The determination of fair value ofIPR&D takes into consideration: the projects stage of completion as of the acquisition date; the timing and cost of R&D work required to complete the project; the risk of a project not achieving commercial feasibility; and estimatedfuture cash flows. Amounts capitalized as IPR&D are subject to an impairment review, using a fair value-based test, until completion or abandonment of a project. Upon successful completion, a separate determination will be made as to the usefullife of the asset and amortization will begin. If the project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset will be written off.    The fairvalue of the liability for contingent consideration recorded on the acquisition date is based on probability weighted estimated cash flow streams, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with acceptedvaluation methods. The liability for contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes recorded in earnings until the contingency is resolved.   The judgments made in determining fair value assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materiallyimpact results of operations.    Goodwill  - Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at December 31 or morefrequently if impairment indicators arise using a fair-value based test. The company assigns goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions to its four reporting units, each of which is one level below the companys single reporting segment.The fair value of each reporting unit is calculated and compared to its carrying value. In determining the fair value of each reporting unit, the company uses a weighted-average combination of both market and income approaches. The market approachto estimating fair value is based primarily on applying external market information to a historical earnings measure. The income approach to estimating fair value is based on a discounted value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit.If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then the company will record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value.   Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  - Intangible assets with finite lives and other long-lived assets, such as property, plant andequipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The company evaluates the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carryingamount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carryingamount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset.       II-15    Pension Plans  - The company sponsors pension plans covering certain domestic andforeign employees who meet eligibility requirements. Several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans. These factors include assumptions about thediscount rate, expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company. The company changed the method to be used in calculating the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost for2016. See Note 12 of the notes to consolidated financial statements. In addition, the company also uses subjective factors, such as withdrawal and mortality rates, to estimate these factors. The actuarial assumptions used by the company may differmaterially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with otherassumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.6 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost. A change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption, with otherassumptions held constant, would have an estimated $1.2 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the companys net pension cost.    NewAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)issued an accounting standard update that simplifies the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This update requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be reported as non-current in the consolidated balance sheets. This update willbe effective as of the beginning of Bards 2017 fiscal year. Other than the reclassification to non-current of the short-term deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized in the consolidated balance sheets, this update is not expected to havea material impact on the companys consolidated financial statements.    In May 2014, the FASB issued a new accountingstandard that provides for a comprehensive model to use in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Under this standard, revenue will be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in anamount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to defer this standards effective date for one year,which will now begin with Bards 2018 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date beginning with Bards 2017 fiscal year. The company continues to assess the new standard, as well as updates to the standardthat have been proposed by the FASB, and has not yet determined the impact to the consolidated financial statements. The company intends to adopt the new standard beginning with Bards 2018 fiscal year.   Risks and Uncertainties; Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information   Certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the companyorally may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such asanticipate, estimate, expect, project, intend, forecast, plan, believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion offuture operating or financial performance.

In addition, there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business. The companys business involves thedesign, development, manufacture, packaging, distribution and sale of life-sustaining medical devices. These devices are often used on, or permanently or temporarily implanted in, patients in clinically demanding circumstances, such as operatingrooms, emergency units, intensive care and critical care settings, among others. These circumstances, among other factors, can cause the products to become associated with       II-16    adverse clinical events, including patient mortality and injury, and could lead to product liability claims (including lawsuits seeking class action status or seeking to establish multi-districtlitigation proceedings) and other litigation, product withdrawals, warning letters, recalls, field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the companys products, any of which could have a material adverseeffect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.    Because actual results are affected bythese and other risks and uncertainties, the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. It is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties, but the most significantfactors, in addition to those addressed above and those described under Item 1A. Risk Factors, that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include, butare not limited to:    Effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business, including:                  the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies, including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing processes and supply chainprograms or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses;                   the effects of negative publicity and/or adverse media coverage concerning our products, which could result in product withdrawals, decreased productdemand or adverse reputational effects and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products;                   the ability to identify appropriate companies, businesses and technologies as potential acquisition candidates, to consummate and successfullyintegrate such transactions or to obtain agreements for such transactions on favorable terms;                   the reduction in the number of procedures using our devices caused by customers cost-containment pressures or preferences for alternatetherapies;                   the ability to implement, and realize the benefits of, our prior and planned investments in our business, including research and developmentexpenditures focused on new market categories, and our plan to grow in emerging and/or faster-growing markets outside the United States and acquire growth platforms designed to change the mix of our portfolio towards faster, sustainable long-termgrowth;                   the uncertainty of whether research and development expenditures and sales force expansion will result in increased sales;                  the ability to reduce exposure and uncertainty related to tax audits, appeals and litigation;                  the risk that the company may not successfully implement its expansion of its Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) information system andother productivity initiatives, including outsourcing certain information technology system functions;                   internal factors, such as retention of key employees, including sales force employees;                  the ability to achieve earnings forecasts, which are generated based, among other things, on projected volumes and sales of many product types, some ofwhich are more profitable than others, and projected royalty revenue from Gore;                   changes in factors and assumptions or actual results that differ from our assumptions on stock valuation and employee stock option exercise patterns,which could cause compensation expense recorded in future periods to differ significantly from the compensation expense recorded in the current period;                  changes in factors and assumptions could cause pension cost recorded in future periods to differ from the pension cost recorded in the current period;                  the effect of market fluctuations on the value of assets in the companys pension plans and the possibility that the company may need to makeadditional contributions to the plans as a result of any decline in the fair value of such assets;       II-17                damage to a facility where our products are manufactured or from which they are distributed, which could render the company unable to manufacture ordistribute one or more products and may require the company to reduce the output of products at the damaged facility thereby making it difficult to meet product shipping targets;                  the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets of the company resulting from insufficient cash flow generated from such assetsspecifically, or our business more broadly, so as to not allow the company to justify the carrying value of the assets;                   the ability to obtain appropriate levels of insurance on reasonable terms, or at all;                  the ability to recover for claims made to our insurance companies or under indemnification obligations to the company and that any amounts recoveredunder these arrangements may not be adequate to cover the companys damages and/or costs; and                   the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our restructuring activities and productivity initiatives to improve the companys overall coststructure and improve efficiency.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   Bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Thecompany manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments. The companys foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the companys international operations.The companys objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets, liabilities, net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies.In order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the company will from time-to-time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations. Theinstruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions. The company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in therelated hedged cash flow. The principal currencies the company hedges are the Euro, the British Pound, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian Dollar, and the Japanese Yen. Any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in thevalue of the related exposure. Bards risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes. The company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposureexists. A sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at December 31, 2015 indicates that if the U.S. dollar uniformly strengthened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of thesecontracts would increase by $5.5 million, and if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currencies, the fair value of these contracts would decrease by $0.4 million. Any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts wouldbe largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions. These offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis.    The companys investment portfolio primarily includes cash equivalents for which the market values are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the companysfixed-rate debt is affected       II-20    by a change in the medium- to long-term interest rates because the borrowings generally have longer maturities. The market value of the companys fixed-rate debt including the effect of therelated interest rate swap contract effectively converting the 2.875% fixed-rate notes (which matured in January 2016) to floating-rate instruments approximated $1,449.8 million at December 31, 2015. A sensitivity analysis, assuming a 100 basispoint increase or decrease in interest rates and assuming that the debt and related swap are held to maturity, indicates that the market value of the debt and related swap would have approximated $1,404.2 million or $1,498.3 million, respectively,at December 31, 2015. The company maintains a forward starting interest rate swap contract which is intended to manage its exposure to interest rate volatility in anticipation of issuing fixed-rate debt. The forward starting swap contract has anotional value of $250 million and a mandatory termination date of May 2016. A sensitivity analysis, assuming a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, indicates that the fair value of the forward starting swap contract would increase by $22.4million, and assuming a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, indicates that the fair value of this contract would decrease by $25.0 million at December 31, 2015.
