Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and of Financial Conditions    General  For more than 90 years, C. R. Bard, Inc. has committed its resources to creating innovative solutions to meet the needs of both health care providers and their patients. The company is a global leader in the development, manufacture and supply of products and services to the health care industry. Bard addresses the health care opportunity through disease state management - an approach that expands the focus from products and technologies to the underlying clinical condition, thereby positioning the company as an indispensable partner to the deliverers of health care. Bard is committed to developing leadership franchises within these disease states and using these strategic positions to leverage the company's growth.  Summary Results  Bard reported 2000 net sales of $1,098.8 million, up 6% over 1999 net sales of $1,036.5 million. Holding currency rates constant, Bard would have recorded an 8% increase in total net sales over the prior-year period. The company demonstrated growth in each of its four product groups: vascular, urology, oncology and surgery. Bard reported net income of $106.9 million or $2.09 of diluted earnings per share in 2000 compared with net income of $118.1 million or $2.28 of diluted earnings per share in 1999. Both years' earnings include one-time items. Without these one-time items, diluted earnings per share were $2.45 in 2000 and $2.27 in 1999, an 8% increase. Net of one-time items, Bard's margin of net income to net sales improved to 11.4% from 11.3% in 1999.  Results of Operations - 2000 vs. 1999  Net sales for 2000 totaled $1,098.8 million. Bard reported total net sales for 1999 of $1,036.5 million, a 7% increase over ongoing net product sales in 1998. Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 2000 net sales by 1.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Excluding negative currency effects, total net sales would have increased 8% in 2000 and 7% in 1999. Due to these negative currency effects, certain comparisons between 2000 and 1999, where indicated, are made holding currency rates constant.   Sales of vascular products increased 7% in 2000 to $241.2 million. On a constant currency basis, these sales increased 12% over the prior year. The electrophysiology and peripheral technology franchises continued to show strong worldwide growth.  Urology product group sales increased 2% in 2000 to $361.2 million and increased 4% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. Both the Infection Control Foley catheter and brachytheraphy products demonstrated solid sales growth.  Sales of oncology products increased 6% in 2000 to $253.0 million despite the impact of the dialysis catheter recall. Adjusting for the currency impact, these product sales would have increased 8% over the prior year. EndoCinch TM endoscopic suturing system, a device used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and bronchoscopy products were introduced this year. Gastroenterological products showed particularly strong growth internationally.   II-3   Sales of surgery products grew 11% in 2000 to $182.6 million, paced by the mesh product lines, used primarily in hernia repair. On a constant currency basis, these sales increased 12% over the prior year.  Other ongoing product sales grew 12% in 2000 to $60.8 million and increased 13% on a constant currency basis over the prior year. This product group includes irrigation, wound drainage and certain OEM products.  Net sales by product group for the last three years (in thousands) are:        2000   1999    1998    Vascular   $ 241,200   $ 226,200   $ 209,000    Urology   361,200   353,600   339,800    Oncology   253,000   238,000   213,100    Surgery	   182,600   164,500   148,400    Other ongoing products   60,800   54,200   58,600    Total ongoing products   1,098,800   1,036,500   968,900    Divested products   ---   ---   195,800    Net sales   $ 1,098,800   $ 1,036,500   $ 1,164,700         Sales in the U. S. rose 8% to $788.3 million and represented 72% of total net sales. Surgery products provided the best growth domestically. Sales outside the U.S. increased 2% to $310.5 million and represented 28% of total net sales. Oncology products demonstrated the best growth internationally. For the year, excluding negative currency effects, net sales outside the U.S. would have increased 9%.   Bard markets its products through direct selling organizations and selected distributors throughout the world. The geographic breakdown, in percent, of net sales for each of the last three years is presented below:         2000   1999   1998    United States   72%   71%   71%    Europe   17%   19%   19%    Japan   5%   5%   5%    Rest of World	   6%   5%   5%    Total net sales   100%   100%   100%      Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales increased to 45.4% in 2000 from 44.6% in 1999. Pricing pressures, the impact of currency, product recalls and lower margin OEM business all contributed to this increase.  As a percent of sales, marketing, selling and administrative expense was 32.0%, essentially flat as compared with the prior-year figure of 31.9%. Research and development expense remained consistent with the prior year at $53.2 million and was complemented by $68.6 million of spending for acquired technologies. Interest expense was $19.3 million in 2000, also consistent with the prior year.  II-4  Please refer to Note 9, Other (Income) Expense, Net, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of items in this category for the last three years. In 2000, the company announced that it would not exercise its option to acquire the remaining capital stock of Endologix, Inc., a California-based company that had developed an endoluminal graft (ELG) used for the minimally invasive treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms. As a result, the company recorded a pretax charge of $40.3 million ($0.53 per share after tax) for the write-off of the Endologix option and related assets and liabilities.   The company recorded one-time gains in 2000, 1999 and 1998 related to the series of dispositions of its cardiology product lines. In the first quarter of 2000, the company settled all remaining open issues related to these dispositions and recorded a gain of $15.4 million ($0.19 per share after tax). Please refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure.  The effective tax rate was 30.6% in 2000 and 31.9% in 1999.   Net Income  In 2000, Bard reported net income of $106.9 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.09. Foreign exchange and the company's dialysis catheter recall negatively impacted 2000 results by approximately $0.11 and $0.09 per share, respectively. The company recorded several one-time items during 2000. Excluding the after-tax charge relating to the company's decision not to exercise the Endologix option ($0.53 per share after tax), and the net after-tax gain associated with other one-time items, primarily asset dispositions and legal settlements ($0.17 per share after tax), diluted earnings per share was $2.45.   In 1999, Bard reported net income of $118.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.28. Excluding the impact of the after-tax gain on the sale of the cardiopulmonary business of $0.12 per share and the after-tax loss associated with the fourth quarter write-down of impaired assets of $0.11 per share, diluted earnings per share was $2.27.  In 1998, Bard reported net income of $252.3 million or diluted earnings per share of $4.51. Excluding the impact of the after-tax gain on the sale of the cardiology businesses of $2.93 per share, the net after-tax loss from one-time items of $0.13 per share and the after-tax loss from Year 2000 costs of $0.05 per share, diluted earnings per share was $1.76.  Results of Operations - 1999 vs. 1998  Net sales for 1999 totaled $1,036.5 million, which represented a 7% increase over the prior year net sales of ongoing products of $968.9 million. Price reductions and the impact of a stronger dollar had the effect of reducing 1999 reported net sales by 1.1% and 0.4%, respectively.  Sales of vascular products rose 8% in 1999. Peripheral technology and electrophysiology devices showed strong worldwide growth.  II-5  Urology product sales grew 4% in 1999. Basic drainage products experienced double-digit growth, fueled by outstanding sales of infection control catheters.  Sales of oncology products increased 12% in 1999. Specialty access devices showed good growth particularly in international markets.  Sales of surgery products grew 11% in 1999, propelled by high worldwide growth of mesh products, used primarily for hernia repair.  Net sales in the U.S. of ongoing products rose 7% to $730.8 million. The oncology and surgery products provided the best growth.  Net sales of ongoing products outside the U.S. increased 7% to $305.7 million with growth demonstrated by vascular and oncology products.  Cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales declined from 47.6% in 1998 to 44.6% in 1999. This improvement was due to the company's manufacturing restructuring programs and the divestitures of the lower margin cardiology businesses.   Marketing, selling and administrative expense declined 13% in 1999. As a percent of net sales, these expenses declined to 31.9% from 32.6% in 1998. This reduction was attributed to the cardiology divestitures and improved efficiency in the company's sales and administration efforts. Reported research and development expense declined 26% in 1999 due to the impact of the cardiology divestiture.  Interest expense declined 27% in 1999 due to lower average debt levels and improved operating cash flow.  Other (income) expense, net, in 1999 included a pretax charge of $8.4 million for the write-down of impaired assets.  The company recorded one-time gains in both 1999 and 1998 related to the dispositions of its cardiology businesses. A pretax gain of $9.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1999 and a pretax gain of $329.2 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 1998. Please refer to Note 2, Acquisitions and Dispositions, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional disclosure.  The effective tax rate was 31.9% in 1999 and 45.7% in 1998. The 1998 effective tax rate was impacted by the disposition of the cardiology business, which was taxed at approximately a 50% rate.  Net Income  In 1999, net income was $118.1 million or diluted earnings per share of $2.28. Excluding the impact of the after-tax gain on the sale of the cardiopulmonary business of $0.12 per share and the after-tax loss from the fourth quarter write-down of impaired assets of $0.11 per share, diluted earnings per share was $2.27.  II-6  Financial Condition and Liquidity  Bard's financial condition remains strong. Total debt was $205.1 million at December 31, 2000, down from $288.7 million at December 31, 1999. This decrease was the result of improved operating cash flow and the repayment of certain 1999 year-end contingent borrowings. Total debt to total capitalization was 25.0% at December 31, 2000, compared to 33.5% at December 31, 1999, while net debt, or debt less cash and short-term investments, to total capitalization was 12.2% at December 31, 2000, compared to 25.1% at December 31, 1999. Shareholders' investment was impacted in 2000 by the repurchase of $17.8 million of common stock.  In 2000, the company replaced its maturing $300 million committed credit facility with a $200 million five-year committed credit facility that matures in May 2005 and a $100 million 364-day committed credit facility that matures in May 2001. These facilities support an actively used commercial paper program. These facilities carry variable market rates of interest and require annual commitment fees.   At December 31, 2000, there were no borrowings under these facilities. Bard maintains uncommitted credit lines with banks for short-term cash needs and these lines were used as needed during the last three years. At December 31, 2000, the unused uncommitted lines of credit totaled $75.0 million. Cash provided from operations continued to be the company's primary source of funds to finance operating needs, capital expenditures and dividend payments. The company believes it could borrow adequate funds at competitive terms and rates, should it be necessary. This overall financial strength gives Bard sufficient financing flexibility.  Total cash outlays made for the purchase of businesses, patents, trademarks, purchase rights, and other related items were approximately $69 million in 2000, $48 million in 1999 and $50 million in 1998. The majority of these investments were for intangible assets, reflecting the premium over book value for these purchases. These cash outlays were financed with cash from operations and additional debt.  Periodically, the company purchases its common stock in the open market to provide shares for issuance under various employee stock plans. In connection with the announced sale of the cardiology businesses, the Board of Directors in July of 1998 authorized the purchase from time to time of up to 10 million shares of common stock. Total shares purchased were 420,300 in 2000, 1,629,600 in 1999, and 6,295,200 in 1998.  Foreign Currency Risk  The company periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts and options to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in currency values. Contracts have been exclusively for the forward purchase of, and options in, currencies in which the company has known or anticipated sales or payments. Monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide, short-term fluctuations in their equivalent U.S. dollar values. Please refer to Note 4, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the company's foreign exchange contracts.  II-7  On January 1, 1999, the eleven original member countries of the European Union began the transition to a common currency, the Euro. These participating countries expect the Euro transition to be completed by July 2002. The company continues to evaluate potential Euro-related issues including pricing/marketing strategy, conversion of computer systems, existing contracts and currency risk in the participating countries. At the present time, management does not believe the Euro conversion will have a materially adverse impact on our business.  Restructuring  In January 2001, the company announced a series of strategic initiatives aimed at providing greater operating efficiencies, enhancing future funding of research and development and accelerating long-term revenue growth.  These initiatives include the consolidation of all nonmanufacturing U.S. operations into a single location in central New Jersey. In addition, the company will begin a multiyear project to substantially reduce the number of manufacturing facilities worldwide. Finally, the company is exploring alternatives for the consolidation of international administrative functions.  The company expects that the New Jersey consolidation and the manufacturing restructuring will require up to three years to complete and will require a net cash investment of between $140 and $150 million for facilities, software and related infrastructure including personnel costs. The majority of these investments will occur in 2002 and 2003. The company anticipates both one-time charges and incremental operating expenses of approximately $21 million or $0.30 per share after tax in 2001. These costs would be associated with the first phase of the company's manufacturing consolidation project.
