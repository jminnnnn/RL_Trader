Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results\         of Operations  Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources                                         20   Going Concern           For the three years ended December 31, 1997, the Company incurred cumulative net losses of $33.6 million and as of December 31, 1997 ("December 1997") has an accumulated deficit approximating $62.9 million. Furthermore, on August 15, 1997, the Company was delisted from Trading on the NASDAQ because it failed to meet the minimum bid requirements of $1 and the minimum net tangible worth requirement of $1 million. Finally, the Company continues to have operating cash flow short falls in all of its segments other than contractual engineering services segment. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.           Management recognizes the need to increase the profitability of the Company and in conjunction therewith, has discontinued three unprofitable segments and a fourth segment which had nominal revenue sources other than intercompany billings to the Company's subsidiaries.           On May 20, 1997, the Company sold the audio products manufacturing segment, which had accumulated losses of $1.7 million through the date of disposal. The sale of the audio products segment will reduce operating losses and will also eliminate the need to fund cash to the segment. On June 30, 1997, management developed a plan to discontinue the three dimensional products and services segment, which has accumulated losses of $8 million through December 1997 and required accumulated cash infusions from the Company in excess of $5 million through December 1997. Effective December 31, 1997, the Company disposed of the electro mechanical and electro optical products manufacturing and business consulting services segments, which have net accumulated losses of $5.9 million through December 31, 1997 and required cash infusions from the Company in excess of $6 million through December 31, 1996.           Additionally, effective September 1, 1997, the Company formulated a plan to sell the medical diagnostics segment and such sale was consummated on April 2, 1998. The sale of the medical diagnostics segment resulted in a gain which will be recognized by the company in 1998, and provided the Company with approximately $11 million in net cash, disposed of approximately $13.5 million of intangible assets and relieved the Company from approximately $21 million in debt and capital lease obligations, approximately $3 million of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Management currently anticipates that approximately $3 million of the net proceeds from the sale will be used to pay existing creditors of the Company, leaving $8 million for future investment. Management's on-going plans to achieve profitability require the prudent use of the net cash generated form the sale of the medical diagnostics segment. With that in mind, management intends to evaluate the expected return on investment in determining where to invest such cash whether it be invested in existing business segments or in new business ventures.           Management recognizes that the sale of the medical diagnostics segment is only one step in addressing the financial difficulties of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 1997 ("1997"), the contract engineering services segment reported net income of $1 million for the first time since it was acquired by the Company in 1994. However, the medical information services, telecommunications and development stage segments continue to report significant losses, a total of $6.2 million for 1997. Recent attempts to adequately fund the telecommunications segment through both private and public funding have not been successful. Although management plans to continue efforts to raise capital for this segment, no assurances can be given that such efforts will be successful and if they are successful that the segment will be managed to profitable levels once adequate funding is in place. During 1996, the medical information services segment completed an initial public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $3.8 million and an additional $1.6 million from the exercise of stock purchase warrants. To date, significantly all of such proceeds have been depleted and the segment has yet to establish significantly increased revenues while current obligations have increased. In December 1997, certain of the medical information services segment's warrant's were exercised providing the segment with approximately $1.9 million in gross proceeds which management estimates will provide one years operating capital for the segment. The failure of the Company to raise significant capital for the unprofitable segments and to achieve profitability when and if adequate funding is in place may force the Company to reduce or cease operations in unprofitable segments and could ultimately force the Company as a whole to cease operations.  Working Capital Condition           As of December 31, 1996, ("December 1996"), the Company had negative working capital of $5.4 million. As of December 1997, the Company has negative working capital of $18.9 million representing an increase in negative working capital of $13.5 million. Approximately $13.5 million of the negative working capital relates to the net current assets and liabilities of discontinued segments. Excluding the discontinued segments, the Company has approximately $5.3 million in negative working capital for continuing operations. The Company's principal working capital consists of cash and cash equivalents which were $1.3 million at                                         21    December 1997 and $1.2 million at December 1996. For 1997, cash provided by discontinued operations amounted to $1.5 million and net cash provided by (used in) continuing operations was as follows:  Contract Engineering Services                                   $    752,000 Medical Information Services                                    (  1,493,000) Telecommunications                                              (    988,000) Development Stage                                               (     16,000) Corporate and Other                                             (    939,000)                                                                 -------------   Net Cash Used in Continuing Operations                       ($  2,684,000)                                                                ==============           The cash generated by the Contract Engineering Services segment is generated by a publicly held company and as such is not necessarily available to other subsidiaries of the Company. It is imperative that the segments which use significant amounts of cash in operating activities obtain alternative sources of funding, (i.e. equity offerings, debt financing) or increased volume at higher operating margins, in order to continue as operating segments and no assurance can be given that these segments will be able to continue as operating entities.  On April 15, 1998, Mr. George W. Mahoney gave the Company notice that he was exercising his right under his employment agreement with Consolidated to terminate his employment on 90 days' notice.  Mr. Mahoney has advised the Company that in his view the agreement requires the company to pay him a lump sum payment equal to his salary for the balance of the term of the agreement which is approximately $2.4 million.  The Company's board of directors is evaluating the Company's and Mr. Mahoney's respective rights under his employment contract.  Sources of Cash           During 1997, sources of cash, other than from operations, included proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $680,000 and subordinated debt of $139,000, net advances from asset based lenders of $377,000 million, proceeds from the issuance and exercise of subsidiary stock options and stock purchase warrants of $2 million, collections on repayments of notes receivable of $475,000 and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $97,000.  Uses of Cash           During 1997, uses of cash included $118,000 of debt repayments, payments on capital leases of $37,000, expenditures for software development of $462,000, deferred offering costs of $400,000, capital expenditures of $440,000, payments for loans made of $220,000, purchases of marketable securities of $20,000, equity issuance costs of $75,000 and an increase in other assets of $693,000.  Changes in Other Working Capital Assets and Liabilities           From December 1996 to December 1997, working capital assets other than cash decreased $230,000. Accounts receivable increased approximately $1.5 million of which $1.3 million relate to the telecommunications segment. The increase in accounts receivable was partially offset by a decrease in the net current assets of discontinued segments of $1.3 million. During the same period, working capital liabilities increased $13.4 of which $8.5 million relates to the net current liabilities of discontinued segments and $4.9 million relates to continuing operations. Accounts payable and accrued expenses increased $3.4 million due primarily to a build up of trade payables of $1.8 million in the telecommunications segment and $898,000 in corporate and other. The build up in payables for the telecommunications segment is a result of not generating adequate cash flows to cover commitments to vendors and the increase in corporate and other payables is due primarily to an increase in accrued compensation payable to the former chief operating officer. Current debt increased approximately $1 million, which is a factor of $377,000 of net advances from asset-based lenders and approximately $680,000 of new debt net of scheduled repayments. The remaining increase in working capital liabilities is a $902,000 increase in billings on uncompleted projects within the telecommunications and medical information services segments.  Effect of Loan Defaults           The Company is in technical default on loans and interest approximating $7.1 million at December 1997 relating to the discontinued medical diagnostics segment. On October 22, 1997, involuntary petitions (the "Petitions") were filed under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code against certain subsidiaries of the Company operating in the medical diagnostics segment. In January 1998 such petitions were dismissed. Currently, it is estimated that the Company will pay approximately $1.5 million for full settlement of such debt.  Delinquent Payroll Taxes           A subsidiary of the Company, which operated in the discontinued three dimensional products and services segment, owes delinquent payroll taxes and related interest and penalties of approximately $190,000. It is anticipated that such obligations will be repaid during 1998.                                         22   Results of Operations           During 1997, the Company discontinued five of its operating segments, three dimensional products and services, medical diagnostics, electro mechanical and electro optical products manufacturing, business consulting services and audio products manufacturing segments. Additionally, during 1997, the Company is reporting a new segment called development stage, which includes a subsidiary that has not yet developed a salable or marketable product. As a result of the above, the prior period data has been reclassified to conform to the above changes in segment reporting.  Loss from Continuing Operations           Comparing 1997 to the year ended December 31, 1996 ("1996"), the aggregate decrease in loss from continuing operations consisted of the following:                                                                    Income (Loss) from Operations                                                                    1997                  1996                Variance                                                                   ----                  ----                --------                   Contract Engineering Services                       $   1,402,000         $     187,000         $   1,215,000          Medical Information Services                        (   2,863,000)        (   5,843,000)            2,980,000          Telecommunications                                  (   2,018,000)        (     929,000)        (   1,089,000)          Development Stage                                   (      16,000)                   --         (      16,000)          Corporate and Other                                 (   3,343,000)        (   3,143,000)        (     200,000)          Intercompany Transactions                           (     239,000)              180,000         (     419,000)                                                              --------------        -------------         --------------                Loss from Operations                         ($   7,077,000)       ($   9,548,000)        $   2,471,000                                                             ===============       ===============        =============            Comparing 1996 to the year ended December 31, 1995 ("1995"), the aggregate decrease in loss from continuing operations consisted of the following:                                                                  Income (Loss) from Operations                                                                    1996                  1995                Variance                                                                   ----                  ----                --------          Contract Engineering Services                       $     187,000        ($   3,816,000)        $   4,003,000          Medical Information Services                        (   5,843,000)        (   2,274,000)        (   3,569,000)          Telecommunications                                  (     929,000)        (     474,000)        (     455,000)          Corporate and Other                                 (   3,143,000)        (   6,319,000)            3,176,000          Intercompany Transactions                                 180,000         (      27,000)              207,000                                                                    -------         --------------              -------                Loss from Operations                         ($   9,548,000)       ($  12,910,000)        $   3,362,000                                                             ===============       ===============        =============             During 1996, the medical information services segment incurred non-cash expense of $3.7 million from the issuance of below market stock options and stock purchase warrants and $1.8 million from the issuance of common stock in lieu of cash for services rendered. During 1995, contract engineering services and corporate and other includes $2.2 million and $3.9 million, respectively, from the issuance of non-employee directors and consultants stock options.  Other Income and Expense           Interest expense approximated $1.1 million for 1997, 1996 and 1995. Such interest is primarily from advances on receivables from asset based lendors in the contract engineering, medical information services and telecommunications segments. During 1997, the Company realized losses of $368,000 on the sale of marketable securities of which $203,000 relates to the sale of Trans Global Services, Inc. ("Trans Global") stock to the president of Trans Global and $165,000 relates to the sale of Netsmart, Inc. stock to executives of Netsmart, Inc. During 1996 the Company realized $823,000 on the sale of marketable securities primarily from the sale of Netsmart warrants held by the Company. Other net expense amounted to $1.2 million for 1997 of which the major components consist of $500,000 for the Lafayette settlement (see footnote 19 of the financial statements), $140,000 of loss on a joint venture of the medical information services segment and $390,000 of financing costs for the telecommunications segment.                                         23   Income Tax Benefit (Provision)           The Company's benefit (provision) for income taxes was 2.8%, (0.5%) and 0.1% of income before taxes for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The Company will have a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $33.4 million. The net operating loss carryforward expires beginning in 1998 through 2012.  Minority Interest in (Income) Loss of Subsidiaries           For 1997, 1996 and 1995, the minority interest in loss of subsidiaries approximated $2.4 million, $3.1 million and $3.7 million, respectively. Changes in the minority interest in the income and loss of subsidiaries are a result of the inherent differences in the net income and loss of subsidiaries from period to period.  Discontinued Operations           The operations of  discontinued  segments  resulted in losses of $5.3 million, $3 million and $1.1 million for 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The aggregate losses from discontinued operations consists of the following:                                                                    Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations                                                                    1997                  1996                  1995                                                                   ----                  ----                  ----                   Medical Diagnostics                                ($   1,188,000)        $   1,446,000         $   2,682,000          Audio Products Manufacturing                        (     293,000)        (     893,000)        (     544,000)          Electro Mechanical and Electro Optical Products              Manufacturing                                   (   2,604,000)        (   2,164,000)        (   1,184,000)          Business Consulting Services                              221,000               263,000               191,000          Three Dimensional Products and Services             (   1,636,000)        (   1,471,000)        (   2,284,000)          Intercompany Transactions                                 238,000         (     180,000)               27,000                                                                    -------               -------                ------                Loss from Discontinued Operations            ($   5,262,000)       ($   2,999,000)       ($   1,112,000)                                                             ===============       ===============       ===============             The medical diagnostics segment's 1997 loss includes the write-off of deferred offering costs of approximately $750,000 from the terminated public offering, $408,000 for settlement costs paid to former limited partners of one of the medical diagnostics segment's imaging centers and increased legal and professional fees of approximately $1 million. The increased legal fees resulted from litigation that occurred during 1997. Additionally, the 1997 medical diagnostics loss includes $250,000 of estimated losses to be incurred from December 1997 until the date that the sale was consummated.           The audio products manufacturing segment's 1997 loss includes the operating activity through May 20, 1997, the date of disposal and for 1995 includes the operating activity from April 1, 1995, the date of acquisition, through December 31, 1995.           The electro mechanical and electro optical products manufacturing segment includes Televend, Inc. and FMX Corp., which did not start operations until 1996 and as such are not included in 1995. The operations of SpecTec, Inc., the holding company of two operating entities is included in the results of operations for all three years reported.           The business consulting services segment's only significant activity is intersegment sales. The portions of such intersegment among the other discontinued segments are included in the intercompany transaction line of the above table.           The three dimensional products and services segment's 1997 loss includes $250,000 for estimated loss to be incurred from December 1997 until the complete disposal of the segment. The 1995 three dimensional products and services segment loss includes approximately $250,000 of loss from European operations that were shut-down in the first quarter of 1996.           The loss on disposal of segments includes a gain of $129,000 related to the sale of the audio products manufacturing segment and an estimated loss on the disposal of the three dimensional products and services segment of and $465,000.  Consolidated Net Loss           As a result of the foregoing, the Company incurred net losses of $12.7 million, $9.6 million and $11.4 million, respectively and net losses per common share of $0.27, $0.23 and $0.51, respectively, for 1997, 1996 and 1995.  Year 2000 Issues                                         24            The Company's subsidiaries have not conducted a comprehensive review of their computer systems to identify the systems that could be affected by the "Year 2000" issue. The Company plans to address the Year 2000 Issue at the subsidiary level during 1998. All computer systems used by the holding company are already year 2000 compliant. The year 2000 problem is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four to define the applicable year. Any of the Company's programs that have time-sensitive software may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000. This could result in a major system failure or miscalculations. The Company presently is not in a position to determine the short or long-term impact of the Year 2000 Issue on its subsidiaries, however if significant year 2000 Issues exist and are not addressed timely, the impact may have a material adverse effect on the Company as a whole.

Contract Engineering Services           The contract engineering  services segment reflects the operations of Trans Global Services, Inc. ("Trans Global") and its two subsidiaries, Avionics Research Holdings, Inc. ("Avionics") and Resource Management International, Inc. ("RMI"). Trans Global is engaged in the business of providing engineers, designers and technical personnel on a temporary basis to major corporations.           Revenue from technical temporary staffing services is based on the hourly cost of payroll plus a percentage. The success of Trans Global's business will be dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient revenues to enable it to cover its fixed costs and other operating expenses, and to reduce its variable costs, principally its interest. Under its agreements with its clients, Trans Global is required to pay its employees and pay all applicable Federal and state withholding and payroll taxes prior to the receipt of payment from the clients. Furthermore, Trans Global's payments from its clients are based upon the hourly rate paid to the employee, without regard to when payroll taxes are payable with respect to the employee. Accordingly, Trans Global's cost of services are greater during the first part of the year, when Federal Social Security taxes and state unemployment and related taxes, which are based on a specific level of compensation, are due. Thus, until Trans Global satisfies its payroll tax obligations, it will have a lower gross margin than after such obligations are satisfied. Furthermore, to the extent that Trans Global experiences turnover in employees, its gross margin will be adversely affected. For example, in 1997, Social Security taxes are payable on the first $65,400 of compensation. Once that level of compensation is paid with respect to any employee, there is no further requirement for Trans Global to pay Social Security tax for such employee. Since most of Trans Global's employees receive compensation in excess of that amount, Trans Global's costs                                         25   with respect to any employee are significantly higher during the period when it is required to pay Social Security taxes than it is after such taxes have been paid.           For 1997, Trans Global had revenues of $75.7 million reflecting an increase of 21% over the revenues of 1996 and a 20% increase over the revenues of 1995. This increase is significant because it includes the impact of the loss of a sizable contract on January 1, 1996 from one of Trans Global's larger customers. This increase is a reflection of the success of Trans Global's continuing sales and placement efforts. During 1997, approximately 63% of Trans Global's revenue was derived from its three largest clients and 80% of such revenue was derived from its five largest clients. In 1996, approximately 61% and 75% of Trans Global's revenue was derived from those same clients. In 1995, 62% of Trans Global's revenues were derived from the three largest clients. The merger and acquisition trend in the aircraft and aerospace industry is the major reason why a high percentage of Trans Global's revenues are from a small number of clients. However, Trans Global does business with various divisions of each of those clients, who act autonomously when selecting their suppliers. Gross margins for 1997 are 6.5% and 38.8% higher than they were for 1996 and 1995 respectively. This increase can be attributed to Trans Global's recent successful efforts to penetrate the "Information Technology" sector of the marketplace, which generates higher gross margins than Trans Global's more traditional marketplace, as well as Trans Global's strategy to drop those clients with relatively low margins.           Selling, general and administrative expenses exclusive of related party expenses increased by 5.7% compared to 1996 and decreased by 24.8% compared to 1995. The increase in 1997 can be attributed to costs of $322,000 that were incurred with respect to an aborted attempt to raise capital. Although, Trans Global still plans on raising capital through an equity placement those costs associated with the initial placement had to be written off. Trans Global is committed to controlling selling, general and administrative costs as these financial statements illustrate. The decrease in 1997 with respect to the selling, general and administrative expenses incurred in 1995 is due to the high level of expenses in 1995 resulting from the issuance of securities to consultants in 1995 ($2.3 million) and penalties for late withholding taxes ($1 million). Trans Global completed its payment schedule with the Internal Revenue Service in July 1997 and is presently current with regard to all of its taxes.           During 1995, Trans Global incurred $528,000 of acquisition expenses relating to the issuance of securities in connection with the Trans Global Transaction. The acquisition expenses reflect the value of Common Stock issued to a finder in connection with the Trans Global Transaction and in consideration of agreements by certain of Trans Global's stockholders to enter into lock-up agreements. The delivery of such shares of Common Stock was deferred until after Trans Global's certificate of incorporation was amended to increase its authorized Common Stock. No comparable expenses were incurred in 1997 or 1996.           Trans Global finances its payroll obligations by borrowing from a non-affiliated asset-based lender at an interest rate of 2% in excess of prime. Trans Global also pays a fee of 0.3% of the face amount of the invoices financed, regardless of the amount borrowed against the invoice. This reflects a reduction in the financing charges resulting from a June 1995 amendment to its borrowing agreement. Prior to the amendment, Trans Global paid interest at a rate of 4% in excess of prime and a fee of 1% of its borrowings relating to RMI's operations. Pursuant to a letter dated January 29, 1998 the asset-based lender has agreed to continue the present financial agreement through December 31, 1998. The borrowings are secured by a security interest in all of Trans Global's assets. At December 31, 1997, such borrowings from the asset-based lender were approximately $3.6 million. The ability of Trans Global to increase profits is dependent in part upon its ability to reduce its financing costs. The interest rate (exclusive of the fee) payable by Trans Global at December 31, 1997 was 10.50% and at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was 10.25%. During 1997, the interest expense was approximately $775,000 as compared to $712,000 in 1996 and $963,000 in 1995. The increase in interest expense from 1996 to 1997 can be attributed to the increased borrowing during the year as a result of the increase in the accounts receivable borrowing base. The decrease in interest expense from 1995 to 1996 reflects the reduced borrowing rates, which became effective June 1995           Amortization of customer lists and other intangible assets was reduced in 1997 by 26.6% as compared to 1996 and 1995 due to certain intangible assets related to Avionics Research Holdings having been fully amortized during the year.           During 1996 Trans Global established a $300,000 reserve in connection with the claim by the DOL arising from the acquisition of Job Shop assets. In 1997, Trans Global reached an agreement with the DOL and the independent trustee of the Job Shop technical Services, Inc., 401(k) Plan (collectively "DOL"). Trans Global agreed to pay the DOL an aggregate of $300,000 in 18 monthly installments of $16,667 of which nine payments remain as of December 31, 1997.           As a result of the above, Trans Global had net income of approximately $1 million for 1997, as compared with a loss of $681,000 1996 and a loss of $4.7 million in 1995. Trans Global believes that now that it has completed its obligation to the IRS with regard to the delinquent payroll taxes and has resolved the situation with the DOL it will be successful in its negotiations with asset-based lenders towards reducing its finance costs which will increase profits to a greater extent. However, no assurance can be given that Trans Global can or will operate profitably in the future.                                         26   Medical Information Services:           The medical information services segment consists of the activity of two companies, Netsmart Technologies, Inc., ("Netsmart") and Creative Socio Medics, Inc. ("CSM"). For purposes herein, references to Netsmart relate to he operation of both Netsmart and CSM unless indicated otherwise. Netsmart is engaged in developing, marketing and supporting computer software designed to enable health service as well as financial related organizations to provide a range of services in a network-computing environment. Netsmart has developed proprietary network technology utilizing smart cards I financial health care network systems.  Years Ended December 31, 1997 and 1996           Netsmart's revenue for 1997 was $7.9 million, a decrease of approximately $659,000, or 8% from the revenue for 1996 which was $8.5 million. This decrease results from a decrease in revenue from $1,879,000 in 1996 to $95,000 in 1997, from a contract with IBN Inc. ("IBN"). IBN represented Netsmart's most significant customer for 1996, accounting for approximately 22% of revenue. Netsmart is no longer providing professional services to IBN.           Revenue from Netsmart's health information systems continued to represent Netsmart's principal source of revenue in 1997, accounting for $7.6 million or 97% of revenue. The largest component of revenue in 1997 was data center (service bureau) revenue, which increased to $2,235,000 in 1997 from $2,207,000 in 1996, reflecting an increase of 1%. The turnkey systems revenue increased to $2,107,000 in 1997 from $1,663,000 in 1996, reflecting an increase of 27%. This increase is substantially the result of growth in the turnkey backlog and the ability of Netsmart to provide the staff necessary to generate the additional revenue. Maintenance revenue increased to $1,280,000 in 1997 from $1,226,000 in 1996, reflecting a 4% increase. Revenue from third party hardware and software decreased to $1,078,000 in 1997 from $1,114,000 in 1996, a decrease of 3%. Sales of third party hardware and software are made in connection with the sales of turnkey systems. License revenue increased to $737,000 in 1997 from $329,000 in 1996, a 124% increase. License revenue is generated as part of a sale of a turnkey system pursuant to a contract or purchase order that includes development of a turnkey system and maintenance. Netsmart believes that the increase in 1997 installations should enable Netsmart to increase the maintenance revenue in future periods. Revenue associated with methadone turnkey installations, which were partially the result of the Johnson Computer Systems acquisition in October 1997 amounted to $198,000 in 1997.           Revenue from contracts from government agencies represented 34% of revenue for 1997. Netsmart believes that such contracts will continue to represent an important part of its business, particularly its health information systems business.           Gross profit increased to $1,727,000 in 1997 from $1,332,000 in 1996, a 30% increase. The increase in the gross profit was substantially the result of a reduction of costs associated with the IBN contract as well as the increase in revenue from the health information systems mentioned above, particularly the increase in license revenue which is highly margined.           Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.6 million in 1997, a decrease of 36% from the $7.1 million in 1996.  During 1996, Netsmart incurred non cash compensation charges of $3.5 million arising out of the issuance by Netsmart of warrants and options having exercise prices which were less than the market value of the Common Stock at the date of approval by the board of directors. During 1996, Netsmart issued 500,000 common shares to certain note holders and 25,000 common shares to Netsmart's asset based lender. As a result of such issuance, Netsmart incurred a financing cost charge to operations of approximately $1.7 million.  During 1997, Netsmart incurred research and development expenses in the amount of $201,000, which were related to Netsmart's health information systems products. In addition, Netsmart capitalized $204,000 of health information systems software development costs associated with such products as its clinician workstation, BHIS for windows, managed care and methadone dispensing products. Netsmart also capitalized $258,000 of software development costs associated with a customer activated terminal product. The amount of amortization associated with these products in 1997 amounted to $59,000 and was charged to cost of sales. In 1996, Netsmart incurred research and development expenses of $278,000, which were related to Netsmart's contract with IBN and the development of SmartCard products.  During 1997 Netsmart wrote down to net realizable value substantially all of the assets associated with its EDTO division. Such assets consisted of accounts receivable, costs and estimated profits in excess of interim billings, computer equipment, capitalized software and its investment in the CCAC joint venture. The effect of this adjustment resulted in a one time charge to income in the amount of $1.5 million.           In 1997, Netsmart's 50% share of its loss in its joint venture corporation with respect to the development of CCAC software purchased in 1996 decreased from $264,000 in 1996 to $140,000 in 1997.           Interest expense was $308,000 in 1997, a decrease of $164,000, or 35% from the interest expense in 1996. This is a result of a decrease in the average borrowings during 1997. The most significant component of the interest expense on an ongoing basis is the interest payable to Netsmart's asset-based lender. Netsmart pays interest on such loans at a rate equal to prime plus 8 1/2% plus a fee of 5/8% of the face amount of the invoice.                                         27            As a result of the foregoing  factors,  Netsmart incurred a net loss of $3.5 million in 1997 as compared with a net loss of $6.6 million in 1996.   Years Ended December 31, 1996 and 1995           Netsmart's revenue for 1996 was $8.5 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 15% from the revenue for 1995 which was $7.4 million. Approximately $1,550,000 of the increase in revenue was generated pursuant to Netsmart's agreement with IBN. IBN represented Netsmart's most significant customer for 1996, accounting for approximately 22% of revenue. Furthermore, through December 31, 1996 IBN has generated revenue of $2.4 million, or approximately 89.6% of Netsmart's total revenue from the SmartCard systems during the two years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 on a combined basis. The revenue generated to date includes approximately $419,000 of guaranteed royalties. As of December 31, 1996, the contract was more than 80% complete. Netsmart is continuing to provide professional services to IBN, although revenues from such services have declined substantially from the level at the beginning of the year. Netsmart intends to expand its marketing effort for its CarteSmart System, however, at December 31, 1996, Netsmart did not have any significant contracts for the CarteSmart system.           Revenue from Netsmart's health information systems continued to represent Netsmart's principal source of revenue in 1996, accounting for $6.5 million or 76% of revenue. However, as a result of the increase of revenue from SmartCard systems, principally from IBN, revenue from health information systems and services declined as a percentage of total revenue. Except for revenue from the IBN contract, the largest component of revenue in 1996 was data center (service bureau) revenue which increased to $2,207,000 in 1996 from $1,742,000 in 1995, reflecting an increase of 27%. The turnkey systems revenue decreased to $1,663,000 in 1996 from $1,777,000 in 1995, reflecting a decrease of 6%. Maintenance revenue increased to $1,226,000 in 1996 from $1,099,000 in 1995, reflecting a 11% increase. Revenue from third party hardware and software decreased to $1,114,000 in 1996 from $2,148,000 in 1995, a decrease of 48%. Sales of third party hardware and software are made only in connection with the sales of turnkey systems. License revenue increased to $329,000 in 1996 from $162,000 in 1995. License revenue is generated as part of a sale of a turnkey system pursuant to a contract or purchase order that includes development of a turnkey system and maintenance. Netsmart believes that the increase in 1996 installations should enable Netsmart to increase the maintenance revenue in future periods.           Revenue from contracts from government agencies represented 31% of revenue for 1996. Netsmart believes that such contracts will continue to represent an important part of its business, particularly its health information systems business. In 1996, contracts from government agencies accounted for approximately 40% of its revenue from health information systems.           Gross profit decreased to $1,610,000 in 1996 from $1,764,000 in 1995, a 9% decrease. The decrease in the gross profit was substantially the result of costs associated with the completion of the IBN contract. At December 31, 1996 the IBN contract was more than 80% complete.           Selling, general and administrative expenses were $7.1 million in 1996, an increase of 69% from the $4.2 million in 1995.  During 1996, Netsmart incurred non cash compensation charges of $3.5 million arising out of the issuance by Netsmart of warrants and options having exercise prices which were less than the market value of the Common Stock at the date of approval by the board of directors. During 1996, Netsmart issued 500,000 common shares to certain note holders and 25,000 common shares to Netsmart's asset based lender. As a result of such issuance, Netsmart incurred a financing cost charge to operations of approximately $1.7 million.  Additionally, Netsmart wrote off $460,000 of deferred offering costs in 1995.  During 1996, Netsmart incurred research and development expenses in the amount of $278,000, which were related to Netsmart's contract with IBN and the development of SmartCard products. Also during 1996 Netsmart incurred capitalized software development costs in the amount of $279,000 of which $28,000 has been amortized in 1996 and charged to cost of sales. In 1995, Netsmart incurred research and development expenses in the amount of $699,000.           In 1996 Netsmart recognized its 50% share of its loss in its joint venture corporation with respect to the purchase of SATC software. The amount of such loss was $264,000.           Interest expense was $473,000 in 1996, an increase of $118,000, or 33% from the interest expense in 1995. The most significant component of the interest expense on an ongoing basis is the interest payable to Netsmart's asset-based lender, which it pays interest equal to the greater if 18% per annum or prime plus 8% plus a fee of 1% of the face amount of the invoice.           As a result of the foregoing  factors,  Netsmart incurred a net loss of $6.6 million in 1996 as compared with a net loss of $2.9 million in 1995.                                         28   Telecommunications:           This segment consists of the operations of ARC Networks, which is engaged in the business of marketing a wide range of telecommunications services including the resale of local exchange services through Competitive Access Providers ("CAP"), the design and installation of end-user networks in addition to its newly formed debit card services and domestic and international long distance services.           Revenues for 1997 were $9.7 million compared to $5.6 million and $3.3 million 1996 and 1995, respectively, reflecting increases of 73% and 72%, or $4 million and $2.3 million. The following table sets forth the revenues from continuing operations and percentage of revenues during 1997, 1996 and 1995 from each business line.                                                   1997                        1996                        1995                                                ----                        ----                        ----                    Telephone Services           $     7,184,000   75%       $     4,410,000   79%       $     1,275,000    39%           Data Cabling Services              2,464,000   25%             1,173,000   21%             1,978,000    61%                                              ---------                   ---------                   ---------           Total                        $     9,648,000             $     5,583,000             $     3,253,000                                              =========                   =========                   =========            The increase in revenue in 1997 compared to 1996 and 1995 is a result of greater market penetration into the local telephone market, principally NYC, through ARC Network's reseller programs with Teleport Communications Group ("TCG"), a Competitive Local Exchange Carrier and, beginning in April 1997, ARC Network's reseller program with Bell Atlantic, the Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier, and increases in ARC Network's data cabling installation business, respectively.           Sales to customers made through TCG's reseller program increased by $1.3 million, or 45% to $4.3 million in 1997 from $2.9 million in 1996 and sales increased $1.7 million, or 134% in 1996 from $1.3 million in 1995. Sales to customers made through the Bell Atlantic reseller program were $992,000 during 1997. In May 1997, ARC Networks also began reselling long distance phone service through several carriers, but predominantly Frontier Communications. Revenues attributed to long distance in 1997 were $432,000. ARC Networks also recorded $17,000 of commission income on telecommunications products in 1997.           Sales in the Data Cabling Installation line increased 111% in 1997 compared to 1996 but decreased 810,000, or 41%, from 1995 to 1996. In 1997, ARC Networks performed approximately $1 million of services for New York State in connection with updating its buildings for computers and Internet services. ARC Networks also continued to benefit from its subcontract with Mitel Systems, Inc., which is the primary contractor with the NYC Schools to rewire classrooms for computer and Internet services. Sales to Mitel in 1997 and 1996, respectively, were $538,000 and $327,000. At December 31, 1997 ARC Networks had billed unearned revenues, for which the work has not yet been completed, of approximately $1,1 million which will all be recognized in the first half of 1998.           Total cost of revenue operations during 1997 was $8.9 million compared to $5 million and $2.6 million for 1996 and 1995, respectively, reflecting an increase of $3.8 million and $2.6 million, or 75% and 98%, respectively. Total gross margins were 8%, 9% and 2l%, respectively during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.           Gross margins for Arc Networks telephone service were 1%, 7% and 15% during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. The most significant reasons for the continuing decline in Arc Networks' margins are (1) Arc Networks' continuing inability to generate sufficient revenue from its debit card operations to cover both the cost of providing telephone service and the cost of maintaining the equipment used to track debit card usage and (2) significant start-up costs incurred in 1997 in connection with Arc Networks' reseller agreement with Bell Atlantic, which costs are charged to cost of revenue. In addition, although Arc Networks priced the telephone service offered pursuant to the Bell Atlantic program to take advantage of the large volume purchase discount provided by Bell Atlantic, it has not reach the necessary volume level, which had an adverse effect upon its gross margin for such service. No assurance can be given that Arc Networks will generate sufficient volume to enable it to benefit from such discount.           It is ARC Network's intention to significantly restructure the debit card operation by eliminating the unprofitable sale of debit cards on a prepaid basis and only selling cards on a cost plus basis which would allow it to recoup all costs incurred after the card has been used. ARC Networks has experienced problems with the sale of prepaid debit cards because of its inability to price the cards properly and track the usage properly with these cards. ARC Networks believes that it requires approximately $350,000 of sales of cost plus debit cards per month in order to be profitable in this line of business. It currently has orders, which are below that level, however, it is currently negotiating with several large customers, which should enable it to reach the required level of sales to be profitable. In 1998, ARC Networks received an open purchase order from Southern New England Telephone ("SNET") to purchase up to a maximum of $5 million of debit card services. However, there is no commitment from SNET to purchase any                                         29   minimum debit card services and there can be no assurances that ARC Networks will ever generate sufficient debit card business to enable it generate a positive gross margin.           ARC Network's initial focus in the resale of telephone services has been to build its customer base and market share. In this regard, ARC Networks has waived installation charges and has absorbed certain costs and charges relating to signing up new customers and acquiring certain equipment needed to make the connection to the customer. Such costs are being expensed immediately without a corresponding increase in revenue. In addition, $1.8 million and $710,000 of sales in 1997 and 1996 were to one customer at a margin of 5% for service and 10% for recurring charges, such as line features. These sales at lower margins, although not customary, will become a smaller percentage of total sales if revenues continue to grow in this line.           Gross margins for ARC Network's data cabling installation services were 28%, 16% and 9% during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. During the 1997, ARC Networks managed approximately 60 different jobs, principally with the State of New York and Mitel. In 1995 and 1996, the projects received by ARC Networks were based on the lowest bid, where as the jobs currently being received are based on a market niche carved out in the government sector.           Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.7 million, $1.5 million and $1.2 million, or 28%, 26% and 36% of total sales during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. In the second half of 1996, ARC Networks added four sales personnel to promote ARC Network's phone services and a Vice President of Sales, in March 1997 it hired a controller to manage its finances, several supervisors were added to manage its cable installation business as volume in this line continued to grow and a customer service department was established in mid 1997 to support the local telephone market which ARC Networks is penetrating. The customer service department is required by state statute in the various areas in which ARC Networks is selling local phone service. ARC Networks also opened offices in Florida and Illinois in 1997 to begin direct sales efforts in those regions, although these offices were closed before year end due to ARC Network's inability to fund these marketing efforts. As of December 31, 1997, ARC Networks was qualified to sell phone service in 15 states. In this regard, ARC Networks has spent approximately $50,000 in legal fees in 1997. The principal components of selling, general and administrative expenses during 1997 were: personnel costs of $1.4 million, sales commissions of $217,000, travel and trade show expenses of $144,000, costs associated with a failed underwriting of ARC Network's common stock of $162,000, rent and utilities of $125,000, legal and accounting fees of $74,000, advertising of $52,000, office equipment and supplies of $146,000, depreciation expense of $47,000 and provision for bad debts of $30,000. The principle components of selling, general and administrative expenses for 1996 were: personnel costs of $773,000, sales commissions of $144,000, travel and trade show expenses of $151,000, office equipment, supplies and other expenses of $203,000, rent and utilities of $68,000, legal and accounting of $54,000, a provision for bad debts of $55,000 and advertising of $8,000. The principle components of selling, general and administrative expenses for 1995 were: $694,000 for personnel costs, $190,000 for sales commissions, $108,000 for travel and trade show expenses and $124,000 for office equipment, supplies and other expenses, $45,000 for rent and utilities and $18,000 for provision for bad debts.           ARC Networks will be adding a Director of Sales to organize its sales and marketing efforts and its agent program at an estimated cost of $75,000 to $100,000 annually. Offsetting this requirement, in the fourth quarter of 1997, ARC Networks restructured certain positions and eliminated four others, which should produce savings of approximately $450,000 to $500,000 annually. It also has contracted with an advertising firm to provide it with sales and marketing support for its various product lines.           ARC Networks incurred total interest expense of $326,000, $167,000 and $69,000 during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively. ARC Networks obtained an 8% $550,000 loan in February 1997 on which it recorded $39,000 of interest expense. In September 1997, ARC Networks received a 12% $250,000 loan on which it recorded interest expense of $9,000. The loan from ARC Network's asset based lender, which was outstanding in both 1997 and 1996, produced interest expense of $32,000 and 35,000, respectively. The interest rate on such loan was 10.25% for the past two years. Interest expense of $121,000, $107,000 and $69,000 was incurred on loans from related parties during 1997, 1996 and 1995. ARC Networks received a $350,000 equipment loan in 1996 on which interest in 1997 and 1996 was $117,000 and $25,000.           As a result of the above,  ARC Networks  reported net losses of $2.7 million,  $1.1 million and $545,000  during 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.                                         30            Development Stage           The development stage segment consists of a company, which has no operating activity and incurred approximately $16,000 in research and development expenses.  Corporate and Other:  Selling, General and Administrative Expense           Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses increased $200,000 when comparing 1997 to 1996 and decreased by $3.3 million when comparing 1996 to 1995. In 1995 selling, general and administrative expenses included non-cash consulting fee expenses incurred upon the issuance of non-employee directors and consultant's stock options of $3.9 million. No such consulting fees were incurred at the holding company level during 1997 and 1996. The remaining expenses, which consist primarily of executive and administrative salaries and benefits, accounting and legal fees, consulting fees and office expenses, remained relatively level with the prior periods. During 1998, it is anticipated that corporate selling, general and administrative expense levels will be a factor of the activity of additional acquisitions and capitalization activities which cannot be quantified on a prospective basis.  Impact of Inflation:           The Company is subject to normal inflationary trends and anticipates that any increased costs would be passed on to its customers.  Item 7A.
