Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources  At December 31, 1995, it was determined that the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern was dependent upon the success of the Company's subsidiary's marketing efforts and their efforts to obtain sufficient debt and equity to enable them to continue operations. As of the second quarter of 1996, the Company had a significant reduction in losses for five of the segments compared to the second quarter ended June 30, 1995 and also had a significant reduction in corporate and other expenses. However, during the third and fourth quarters, losses increased in such that only two of the segments ended up with significant yearly reduced losses. During the third and fourth quarters, the Contract Engineering Services and Medical Information Services segments incurred significant single item expenses that are not expected to be of a recurring nature, including $300,000 for a contingency settlement and $3,493,000 of noncash expense related to stock issuance's. Furthermore, the Medical Diagnostics segment reported a fourth quarter loss which is the first quarterly loss of this particular segment since it was acquired. As a result of the above, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern as of December 31, 1996 will depend primarily on the ability of the Company to efficiently utilize the funding it received for certain subsidiaries during 1996. Such funding consisted of the following via various sources as follows:  Debt Refinancing  In January and September 1996, the Company refinanced a significant portion of the current subordinated debt that was to be paid by the Medical Diagnostics segment in 1996. Such financing consisted of term loans of $6,000,000, an accounts receivable revolving loan of $6,000,00. As a result of the financing, approximately $12,400,000 of debt that was currently due was replaced by long-term debt.                                         49   Equity Offerings  During August 1996, NetSmart, a subsidiary of the Company operating in the Medical Information Services segment, completed an initial public offering issuing common shares representing approximately 22% of the outstanding shares and received net proceeds of approximately $3,800,000 and additionally, received approximately $1,600,000 upon the exercise of 800,000 stock purchase warrants.  In July 1996 a subsidiary operating in the contract engineering services segment (which is already publicly held), raised $2,000,000 from the sale of common stock via a Regulation S offering. This subsidiary has filed a S-1 registration with respect to the sale of additional equity shares, however, no assurances can be given that such offering will be completed.  A subsidiary of the Company, operating in the Medical Diagnostics segment, filed an S-1 Registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to an initial public offering. No assurances can given that the public offering will be completed.  Working Capital Condition  As of December 31, 1995, the Company had a working capital deficit of $13,359,000. As of December 31, 1996, the Company has negative working capital of $6,729,000 representing a decrease in the working capital deficit of $6,630,000. Due in large part to the aforementioned debt refinancing in the medical diagnostics segment. The Company's continued ability to reduce the working capital deficit relies primarily on the success of continuing efforts to increase the profitability of the underlying subsidiaries. As further explained in the following "Sources of Cash" discussion, restrictions exist with regards to the Company's use of the Medical Diagnostics segment's cash.  Sources of Cash  The Company's principal working capital consists of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were $3,866,000 at December 31, 1996 compared to $1,636,000 at December 31, 1995. During 1996, International Magnetic Imaging, ("IMI") generated approximately $6,887,000 in cash from operations while the remaining segments used approximately $7,009,000 of cash for operations. Pursuant to an IMI financing agreement with a creditor, restrictions exist on the distributions of IMI funds whereby IMI may not make payments out of the ordinary course of IMI operations and specifically, not to the parent company, (Consolidated), or any subsidiary or affiliate. The other segments are thereby required to operate on their own cash flows and as of December 31, 1996 the most significant impact from these restrictions is on the Three Dimensional Products and Services segment and the Electro-Mechanical Electro-Optical Products Manufacturing segments which are currently unable to operate without cash infusions from the parent company, (Consolidated). It is imperative that these segments obtain alternative sources of funding. (i.e. equity offerings, debt financing) or increased volume at higher operating margins, in order to continue as operating segments and no assurance can be given that these segments will be able to continue as operating entities. The remaining segments are less affected by the restrictions on IMI's cash since they operated substantially with their own cash flows during 1996. Sources of cash other than from operations includes proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt of $19,468,000, proceeds from the issuance of stock and the exercise of options and warrants of $10,047,000, collections on repayments of notes receivable of $3,449,000, cash of an acquired company of $1,020,000, and proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $1,244,000.  Uses of Cash  Uses of cash includes the repayment of long-term and subordinated debt of $19,954,000, capital expenditures of $4,920,000, payments on capital leases of $1,565,000, payments for loans made of $3,523,000, purchases of investments of $385,000 and expenditures of $279,000 for software development, $589,000 for deferred offering costs, and $1,369,000 for costs of issuing stock in the medical information services segment.. Other net uses of cash amounted to $292,000.  Changes in Other Working Capital Assets and Liabilities  Significant changes in working capital, other than cash, includes an increase in accounts receivable of $1,918,000 (primarily from an increase in volume primarily from the Contract Engineering Services segment) and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related expenses of approximately $1,692,000 (primarily from an increase in payroll and payroll related obligations of the contract engineering services segment and a $400,000 contingency reserve that was recorded by the same segment).                                         50   Effect of Loan Defaults  The Company is in technical default on loans approximating $7,227,000 as of December 31, 1996 of which $6,300,000 relates to the Medical Diagnostics segment, $325,000 relates to the Audio Products Manufacturing segment, $467,000 relates to the Electro-Mechanical Electro-Optical Products Manufacturing segment and $135,000 relates to the Three Dimensional Products and Services segment. Such default has not had, and is not expected to have a significant impact on the operations of the related segment. The creditors have not called such loans and all amounts are classified as current liabilities in the Company's December 31, 1996 balance sheet.  Results of Operations  Consolidated  operating  losses for 1996 were  $1,774,000  less than in 1995 and were  $1,126,000  less than in 1994.  The operating loss for 1996 includes certain noncash expenses as follows:                                                                    Year Ended                                                                   December 31,                                                                       1996                                                                       ---- Medical Information Services segment - stock   options and stock purchase warrants                             $3,722,000 Medical Information Services segment - issuance   of stock in lieu of cash for services rendered                   1,747,000 Contract Engineering Services segment- issuance   of stock in lieu of cash for services rendered                      80,000 Corporate and Other - consulting expense   from exercise of stock options                                      45,000                                                                       ------ Total noncash Expenses                                            $5,594,000                                                                    =========  For the year ended December 31, 1996, excluding the above noncash expenses, an improvement in operating results was achieved by an increase in overall gross margins of $1,241,000 while operating expenses, other than the $5,594,000 of nonrecurring expenses shown above, decreased by $6,127,000. Additionally, during the same time period, revenues increased $4,827,000. On an overall basis, the consolidated net loss when comparing 1996 to 1995 decreased by $1,790,000 or 16%  The percentage of relative contribution to revenues, gross profit, and selling general and administrative expenses by industry segment is shown in the following tables.

Discussion of Operations by Segment  Contract Engineering Services  The contract engineering services segment reflects the operations of Trans Global Services, Inc. ("TGS") and its two subsidiaries, Avionics Research Holdings, Inc. ("Avionics") and Resource Management International, Inc. ("RMI") from January 1995 through December 31, 1996. During 1995, Avionics and RMI were merged with TGS via a reverse acquisition and references to operations prior to January 1995, relate to the operations of Avionics and RMI as subsidiaries of SISC.  Revenue from technical temporary staffing services is based on the hourly cost of payroll plus a percentage. The success of TGS's business is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient revenues to enable it to cover its fixed costs and other operating expenses, and to reduce its variable costs, primarily interest. Under its agreements with its clients, TGS is required to pay its employees and pay all applicable Federal and state withholding and payroll taxes prior to receipt of payment from the clients. Furthermore, TGS's payments from its clients are based upon the hourly rate paid to the employee, without regard to when payroll taxes are payable with respect to the employee. Accordingly, TGS's cost of services are greater during the first part of the year, when Federal Social Security taxes and state unemployment and related taxes, which are based on a specific level of compensation, are due. Thus, until TGS satisfies its payroll tax obligations, it will have a lower gross margin than after such obligations are satisfied. Furthermore, to the extent that TGS experiences turnover in employees, its gross margin will be adversely affected. For example, in 1996, Social Security taxes are payable on the first $62,700 of compensation. Once that level of compensation is paid with respect to any employee, there is no further requirement for TGS to pay Social Security tax for such employee. Since most of TGS's employees receive compensation in excess of that amount, TGS's costs with respect to any employee are significantly higher during the period when it is required to pay Social Security taxes than it is after such taxes have been paid.  For 1996, TGS had revenues of $62.6 million, reflecting a 1% decrease from the revenue of $63.2 million during 1995. This decrease is attributed to the loss of a contract on January 1, 1996, from one of TGS's larger customers in the aerospace industry. By December 31, 1996, TGS had increased its revenue base so that, at such date, the annual rate of revenue was greater than it was prior to the loss of the customer. During 1996, approximately 61% of TGS's revenue was derived from its three largest clients and 75% of such revenue was derived from its five largest clients. TGS's gross margin for 1996 was 8.2%, as compared to 6.3% for 1995. The increase reflects a higher gross margin on the new contracts entered into by the Company as compared with the lower gross margin on the contract that was lost. For 1995, the Company had revenues of $63.2 million, reflecting a 150% increase in revenue from the revenue of $25.3 million during 1994. During 1994, operations consisted of Avionics for the entire year and RMI from November 22, 1994, the date of acquisition. The increase in revenue in 1995 reflected the inclusion of the operations of RMI for the entire year, as well as an increase in revenue from Avionics' clients resulting from its increased marketing effort. The increase in costs of sales from $23.7 million for 1994 to $59.2 million for 1995 also reflects the inclusion of the operations of RMI. The gross margin was 6.3% for both 1995 and 1994.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2 million, or 31%, from 1995 to 1996 and increased by $5.4 million, or 538%, from 1994 to 1995. The significant fluctuation in operating expenses reflects a number of factors, including the following:           Consulting Fees - During 1995, TGS incurred $2.3 million of noncash          expense from the issuance of securities for consulting services and no          such expenses were incurred in either 1996 or 1994.                                         52            Payroll Tax Penalties - During 1996 and 1995 penalties for late          withholding taxes were $635,000 and $1 million, respectively, and          during 1994, TGS received a credit of $159,000 resulting from the          refund of a previously paid withholding tax penalty.           Acquisition Costs - During 1995, TGS incurred $529,000 of acquisition          expenses relating the issuance of securities in connection with the          reverse acquisition. The acquisition expenses reflect the value of          Common Stock issued as a finder fee and issued in consideration of          agreements by certain of TGS's stockholders to enter into lock-up          agreements. No comparable expenses were incurred in 1996 or 1994.           Operations of RMI - RMI was not acquired until November 1994, and as          such, selling, general and administrative expenses for 1994 did not          include a full year of such amounts which approximated $2.0 million for          1995.           Contingency Reserve - During 1996, the Company established a          contingency reserve of $300,000 in connection with a claim by the DOL          arising from the acquisition of RMI.  Interest expense was approximately $712,000, $963,000 and $696,000 for 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. TGS finances its payroll obligations by borrowing from a non-affiliated asset-based lender at an interest rate of prime plus 2%. TGS also pays a fee of 0.3% of the face amount of the invoices financed, regardless of the amount borrowed against the invoice. This reflects a reduction in the financing charges resulting from a June 1995 amendment to its borrowing agreement. Prior to the amendment, TGS paid interest at a rate of 4% in excess of prime and a fee of 1% of its borrowings relating to RMI's operations. Pursuant to a January 1997 amendment to TGS's agreement with its asset-based lender, on April 1, 1997 or earlier at the request of TGS, the borrowing availability will be reduced to $3.0 million and TGS will pay a fixed monthly fee of $10,500 to the asset-based lender. The fee will be subject to increases to the extent that receivables in any month exceed $10.0 million. The interest rate of 2% in excess of prime will not be affected by the amendment. The borrowings are secured by a security interest in all of the Company's assets. At December 31, 1996, such borrowings from the asset-based lender were approximately $3.7 million. The ability of TGS to operate profitably is dependent in part upon its ability to reduce its financing costs. The interest rates (exclusive of the fee) payable by TGS at December 31, 1996 and 1995 was 10.25%.  As a result of the foregoing, TGS sustained a net loss of $681,000, for 1996, as compared with a loss of $4.7 million, for 1995 and a loss of $434,000 for 1994. TGS believes that, with the reduced level of selling, general and administrative expenses and improved gross margin, which are reflected in the results of its operations for 1996, it can improve its operations by reducing its interest expense through its amended agreement with its asset-based lender combined with a lower level of borrowing and eliminating future late withholding tax penalties, which affected TGS's operations since its organization. TGS may also seek to reduce its financing costs further by seeking to enter into agreements with other financing sources which would offer lower financing costs. However, no assurance can be given that TGS can or will operate profitably in the future.  Medical Diagnostics  This segment consists of the operations of International magnetic Imaging, Inc., ("IMI"), a medical diagnostic imaging company, which primarily performs MRI and other diagnostic imaging modalities, that was purchased in September 1994. In the following analysis of the medical diagnostics segment, the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995, reflect the operations of the Company. The year ended December 31, 1994 includes operations of the centers that were acquired from the predecessor companies for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and operations of the Company for the three months ended December 31, 1994.                                         53   Net patient service revenue for performing MRI and other diagnostic modality procedures increased $3.16 million, or 11%, from 1995 to 1996 and $21.5 million, or 328% from 1994 to 1995. As noted in Table I below, the mix of procedures by class of payer remained relatively level for all years. Additionally, the reimbursement rates remained relatively level from 1995 to 1996 and decreased modestly from 1994 to 1995. Accordingly, the increase in revenues is a result of increases in overall procedure volume which increased 32% from 1995 to 1996 and 9% from 1994 to 1995. A significant portion of the increase in volume for 1996 relates to multi-modality procedures which have a lower reimbursement rate than MRI procedures, and as such, the net patient service revenues increased at a lower percentage than the increase in volume. For 1995, the increase in volume was partially offset by a decrease in reimbursement rates. The revenues earned by IMI in the fourth quarter of 1996 were approximately $600,000 less than the average revenues for the first three quarters of 1996. During the fourth quarter of 1996, two Florida Centers significantly reduced the procedures performed for scan brokers and such decreases in volume are intended to be recaptured by marketing other payer revenue sources, although such recapture has not yet been realized. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 1996, the Puerto Rican Center experienced a decrease in workers compensation procedures because IMI's equipment required an upgrade to become competitive in that market. During the first quarter of 1997, such upgrade has been made. Contractual adjustments, which represent the difference between IMI's standard billing rate and the amount contracted with the payer source, was 49%, 45% and 34%, respectively of gross patient service revenue for 1996, 1995 and 1994. Contractual adjustments increased significantly from 1994 through 1996 due to a general decrease in reimbursement rates from all payer classes and the increase in IMI's brokered scan business which had a substantially lower reimbursement rate than any of IMI's other revenue sources. The participation of IMI with third party insurers requires that IMI accept specified reimbursement rates which are not currently based on capitated contracts.

Other service revenues and management fee income represented only 3.5%, 2.4% and 0.3% of total revenues, respectively, for 1996, 1995 and 1994. Other service revenues and management fee income increased $433,000 from 1995 to 1996 due primarily to the operations of MRI Net and for 1994 to 1995, no significant fluctuation occurred.  IMI's operating expenses for 1996 increased by $4 million, or 18%, from $22.6 million for 1995 to $26.7 million for 1996. The operating expenses for 1995 increased by $371,000, or 2%, from $22.3 million for 1994 to $22.6 million for 1995. The overall increase in operating expenses reflected a number of factors discussed below.                                         54   Radiology fees increased $336,000 or 11% when comparing 1996 to 1995 and $2 million or 194% when comparing 1995 to 1994. For 1996 and 1995, radiology fees were incurred based on cash collections related to services performed. Cash collections for services were $27.4 million and $25.4 million, respectively, for 1996 and 1995, representing an overall increase of approximately 8%. From January through November of 1994 a significant portion of the radiologists were employees of IMI and accordingly, compensation to radiologists of approximately $1.2 million is included in salaries and benefits for 1994. The remaining increase of $700,000, when comparing 1995 and 1994 is due to the fact that the radiology agreements entered into with radiologists and independent radiology companies required larger fees based on the achievement of certain bonus levels and such fees for 1995 were higher than the amounts paid to radiologists when they were employees of IMI in 1994. IMI entered into four radiology agreements which expire approximately four years from December 31, 1996 and which require that radiologists interpret and report the results of the MRI and multi-modality procedures and which require IMI to pay the radiology company's fees based on the terms of the agreements. The following summarizes the four agreements and generally describes their terms.  1)     The Florida Centers - The radiology agreement requires payment by IMI to the radiology company, of fees that range from 10%-20% of collections. Each of the Florida Centers has a separate fee schedule as a part of the agreement. The agreements require increased payment based on Center specific bonus criteria. At the beginning of each year new bonus criteria are negotiated pursuant to the terms of the agreement. For the Florida Centers, over the past two years, the radiology fees have averaged 11% to 12% of cash collections for MRI procedures and 16% to 17% of cash collections for multi-modality procedures.  2)     San Juan Center - The facilities use agreement requires payment by IMI, to the radiology company, of fees that are 10% of cash collections, plus 3% of the annual cash collections between $2 million and $3 million, plus 5% of annual cash collections in excess $3 million. The terms of this agreement are negotiated at the end of each year and may be terminated upon 90 days notice by either party if such negotiations are not successful.  3)     Virginia Center - The radiology agreement, which is effective until March 31, 2000, requires payment by IMI, to the radiology company, of a fixed fee of $275,000 per year plus an incentive of 15% of collections in excess of $2.4 million.  4)     Kansas City Center - The radiology  agreement requires payment by IMI, to the radiology company, of based on the following schedule:                    Procedures                          Fee per                   Interpreted                        Procedure                   -----------                        ---------                   1-275                                  $ 75                   276-350                                $100                   351 and Greater                        $150  Equipment maintenance costs relate primarily to fixed contract payment schedules and generally do not fluctuate from period to period unless repairs and maintenance are required that are not covered by the equipment contracts or new equipment is placed into service or removed from service. Substantially all maintenance costs incurred for 1996, 1995 and 1994 were incurred pursuant to fixed maintenance contracts, and as a result such costs did not fluctuate significantly, increasing $39,000 from 1995 to 1996 and decreasing $57,000 from 1994 to 1995.  Patient service costs and expenses consist primarily of film, contrast agents and utility costs used in the MRI and multi-modality procedures. Such costs increased $289,000, or 15%, from 1995 to 1996. Approximately $104,000 of this increase related to an increase in medical supplies used by a multi-modality Center that performs CAT scans, nuclear medicine, mammography, fluoroscopy and X-ray's which had a significant increase in volume. The remaining increase is due to the additional procedure volume which inherently requires more patient service costs which was partially offset by negotiated decreases in overall per unit film and contrast agent costs. Such costs increased only $12,000, or 1%, from 1994 to 1995 which reflects increases in procedure volume that were offset by modest decreases in film and contrast agent costs.                                         55   Salaries and benefits increased $733,000 or 12% from 1995 to 1996. Of this increase, approximately $105,000 relates to a bonus paid to IMI's chief financial officer, who is also the chief financial officer of Consolidated, for services relating to the DVI loans incurred in 1996. Additionally, during 1996, the Centers increased their hours of operations in order to increase volume. These increased hours of operation required additional personnel in certain Centers and required some overtime in all Centers. The per employee base salary and benefit costs did not significantly increase. Salaries and benefits decreased $1.8 million or 24% from 1994 to 1995. The salaries and benefits for 1994 include approximately $1.2 million paid to radiologists based on fixed fee contracts and 1995 does not include any such amounts paid to radiologists as discussed above. Additionally, during 1995, management implemented a cost reduction plan which included the reduction of overall salary and wage levels which accounts for the remaining decrease in salaries and benefits.  Professional services, consisting primarily of legal, accounting and consulting services, remained relatively level, increasing only $15,000 or 2% when comparing 1995 to 1996. Professional services decreased $643,000, or 45%, from 1994 to 1995, which reflects the significant accounting and legal fees that were incurred by the Company during 1994 in conjunction with the acquisition.  Other management, general and administrative expenses, increased $765,000, or 19%, from 1995 to 1996. During 1996, one of the Centers was in the process of relocating to a new facility and in connection therewith, it rented, on a short-term basis, MRI equipment at a rental cost of approximately $441,000 and was paying rent at two locations on a temporary basis resulting in additional rental expense of $27,000. Other significant increases include $95,000 for an administrative fee paid to DVI related to the revolver loan incurred subsequent to 1995 and $40,000 for compensation to temporary employees of MRI Net who replaced permanent employees whose compensation in 1995 is included under salaries and benefits. During 1995 and 1994, other management, general and administrative expense, remained relatively level, decreasing $80,000 or 2% from 1994 to 1995.  Provision for bad debts increased $1.5 million, or 176%, from 1995 to 1996. Substantially all of this increase reflects an evaluation of the collectibility of receivables from third-party liability payers which were generated prior to the September 30, 1994 acquisition of the Centers. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of 1996, the provision for bad debts was $850,000 greater than the average of the first three quarters of which $350,000 was from the write-off of amounts due from scan brokers who went out of business. The remaining $500,000 increase is due to liability accounts receivable whose aging had reached the point where IMI's receivable policy and evaluation required that such receivables be provided for with an allowance. Revenue from third-party liability payers represented only 4% of revenue for 1996 and 1995. Provision for bad debts decreased $242,000, or 22%, from 1994 to 1995. During 1994 the composition of revenues and the related accounts receivable balances included more payer types with a higher estimate of provision rate than for 1995.  Depreciation and amortization consists of the depreciation of purchased equipment, buildings, leasehold improvements and capital leases and the amortization of goodwill, customer lists, restrictive covenants and loan costs. Depreciation expense increased $224,000, or 8%, from 1995 to 1996, which reflects the addition of equipment in certain Centers, which was partially offset by a decrease in Centers where equipment is fully depreciated as of 1996. Amortization increased $103,000, or 5%, from 1995 to 1996 due to an increase in capitalized loan costs which were incurred at the beginning of 1996 resulting from the subordinated debt refinancing with DVI. Depreciation and amortization expense in total increased $1.2 million, or 33%, from 1994 to 1995, due primarily to increased amortization from the addition of goodwill, restrictive covenants and customer lists as part of the September 30, 1994 acquisition.  Interest and other income increased $368,000, or 191%, from 1995 to 1996. During August of 1995, IMI entered into a joint venture agreement with respect to an MRI Center in the Orlando, Florida area. Income from the joint venture during 1996 and 1995 was $281,000 and $120,000, respectively. Additionally, 1996 includes a change in an estimate related to prior period over-accruals of tangible personal property taxes of approximately $140,000 for the San Juan Center. Other components of interest income and other income were not significant for the September 1996 and 1995 periods. Interest and other income decreased $385,000, or 67%, from 1994 to 1995, which reflects the inclusion in 1994 of approximately $300,000 of debt forgiveness from certain shareholders of nonaffiliated companies, that were not acquired by IMI in the 1994 acquisition.  Interest expense increased $440,000, or 17%, from 1995 to 1996. At the beginning of 1996, IMI refinanced certain Subordinated Notes, which were short-term notes on which the Company paid interest at 7%, with long-term debt with rates varying from 11% to 12%. The increase in interest expense from the higher rate was partially offset by reductions on the debt on which the interest was paid.. Interest expense increased $1.3 million, or 95%, from 1994 to 1995, due to the fact that as a part of the September 30, 1994 acquisition, approximately $20 million in subordinated debt was incurred with interest rates ranging from 4% to 7%. Other increases in interest expense from 1994 to 1995 are due to additions of equipment financing and interest from new capital lease obligations.                                         56   Loss on sale and disposal of assets, which was $28,000, $25,000 and $524,000, respectively for 1996, 1995 and 1994, consisted primarily of leasehold improvements and medical equipment which was sold or disposed of during the periods.  Overall profitability decreased $720,000, or 41% from 1995 to 1996, reflecting increased overall costs in excess of gains in net revenues. During 1996, five of the Centers operated at an aggregate net loss of $784,000 while the remaining Centers generated net income of $1.8 million. During 1995, five of the Centers operated at an aggregate net loss of $2 million while the remaining Centers generated net income of $3.8 million. Overall profitability remained relatively level for 1995 and 1994, reflecting increased overall costs in excess of increased revenue of $13,000. During 1994, two of the Centers operated at an aggregate net loss of $550,000 while the remaining Centers generated net income of $2.3 million.  Electro-Mechanical and Electro-Optical Products Manufacturing:  This segment consists of two companies which manufactures optical encoders, encoded motors and limit programmers, debit card vending machines and various avionics instrumentation devices, a company that markets telephone debit cards which commenced operations in 1995 and a company that designs, develops and integrates all of the critical building blocks of a Fingerprint ID System.  Optical-encoders, encoded motors and limit programmers, debit card vending machines and avionics instrumentation device revenues, when comparing 1996 to 1995, decreased 33% from $4,223,000 for 1995 to $2,837,000 for 1996. Additionally, gross profit was negative for 1996 due primarily to the write-off of obsolete inventory of $350,000 for 1996. Write-off of obsolete inventory for 1995 amounted to $270,000. Excluding such write-offs, the gross profit percentages for 1996 and 1995 were 6% and 12%, respectively. The significant decrease in revenues and gross margins is attributed to lower levels of shipments to existing customers while new customers have not been obtained to replace the lost revenues and the gross margins on current period contracts have lower margins than on revenues that were lost. Selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively level approximating $1,341,000 and $1,380,000 for 1996 and 1995, respectively, reflecting increased spending of approximately $200,000 on developing new technologies, which was offset by planned cutbacks in expenses related to existing operations. Interest expense was approximately $150,000 for both 1996 and 1995. A significant portion of the interest expense is related party interest charged from the parent company, (SIS Capital Corp.) charged on advances made to this segment to fund its operations. Net losses increased from $1,050,000 for 1995 to $1,709,000 for 1996, reflecting the decrease in gross profit while other expenses remained relatively level. In prior periods, this segment focused primarily on sales to the governmental sector and currently management is attempting to place more emphasis on sales to the private sector through the sale of encoders to private manufacturing companies while also trying to capitalize on the recent potential for increased governmental military spending and while there exists a possibility that there will be reversals in government spending cutbacks no assurance can be made that this segment will be able to qualify for the related government contracts. Management plans to continue placing more emphasis on sales to the private sector although no assurances can be given that the segment will ever be able to operate profitably.  Prepaid telephone calling card revenues, gross profit and operating loss, from the date of acquisition through December 31, 1996, approximated $387,000, ($152,000) and $313,000. This segment operates in a highly competitive market and is competing against companies that are larger, more well established and have significantly greater resources. The impact of this competition has required the segment to sell the calling cards at below cost in order to attempt to establish a market presence which has resulted in a negative gross margin. Selling, general and administrative costs were $153,000 from the period of acquisition to December 31, 1996 which consists primarily of salaries and related expenses. Based on the competitive environment that this segment operates in, no assurances can be given that its operations will ever reach profitable levels.  Finger print identification products activity to date have been the costs of developing its products. Such amounts for 1996 approximated $144,000. Due to the nature of a development stage company, no assurances can be given that it will ever be able to develop a marketable product and achieve revenues that will allow it to operate profitably.  Medical Information Services:  The medical information services segments consists of the activity of two companies, Netsmart Technologies, Inc., ("Netsmart") and Creative Socio Medics, Inc.' ("CSM"). CSM was acquired in June 1994 and accounted for all of the revenues and gross margin in this segment for 1994. Since CSM was not a part of the consolidated operations until July 1, 1994, the prior periods operating results are not comparable to those of the years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995. For purposes herein, references to Netsmart relate to the operations of both Netsmart and CSM unless indicated otherwise.                                         57   The segment's revenue for 1996 was $8.5 million, an increase of $1.1 million, or 15% from the revenue for 1995 which was $7.4 million. approximately $1,550,000 of the increase in revenue is due to revenue generated pursuant to an agreement with IBN. IBN represented Netsmart's most significant customer for 1996, accounting for approximately 22% of revenue. Furthermore, through December 31, 1996 IBN has generated revenue of $2.4 million, or approximately 89.6% of Netsmart's total revenue from the SmartCard systems during the two years ended December 31, 1996 and 1995 on a combined basis. The revenue generated to date includes approximately $419,000 of guaranteed royalties. As of December 31, 1996, the contract was more than 80% complete. Netsmart is continuing to provide professional services to IBN, although revenues from such services have declined substantially from the level at the beginning of the year. Netsmart intends to expand its marketing effort for its CarteSmarte System, however, at December 31, 1996, the Company did not have any significant contracts for the CarteSmart system.  Revenue from Netsmart's health information systems continued to represent the Netsmart's principal source of revenue in 1996, accounting for $6.5 million or 76% of revenue. However, as a result of the increase of revenue from SmartCard systems, principally from IBN, revenue from health information systems and services declined as a percentage of total revenue. Except for revenue from the IBN contract, the largest component of revenue in 1996 was data center (service bureau) revenue which increased to $2,207,000 in 1996 from $1,742,000 in 1995, reflecting an increase of 27%. The turnkey systems revenue decreased to $1,663,000 in 1996 from $1,777,000 in 1995, reflecting a decrease of 6%. Maintenance revenue increased to $1,226,000 in 1996 from $1,099,000 in 1995, reflecting a 11%. Revenue from third party hardware and software decreased to $1,114,000 in 1996 from $2,148,000 in 1995, a decrease of 48%. Sales of third party hardware and software are made only in connection with the sales of turnkey systems. License revenue increased to $329,000 in 1996 from $162,000 in 1995. License revenue is generated as part of a sale of a turnkey system pursuant to a contract or purchase order that includes development of a turnkey system and maintenance. Netsmart believes that the increase in 1996 installations should enable the Company to increase the maintenance revenue in future periods.  Revenue from contracts from government agencies represented 31% of revenue for 1996. Netsmart believes that such contracts will continue to represent an important part of its business, particularly its health information systems business. In 1996, contracts from government agencies accounted for approximately 40% of its revenue from health information systems.  Gross profit decreased to $1,332,000 in 1996 from $1,973,000 in 1995, a 32% decrease. The decrease in the gross profit was substantially the result of costs associated with the completion of the IBN contract. At December 31, 1996 the IBN contract was more than 80% complete.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.9 million in 1996, a decrease of 24% from the $2.5 million in 1995. The decline was substantially the result of a one time charge in 1995 of a write off deferred public offering costs in the amount of $460,000 as well as a reduction in executive compensation and a reduction in staff.  During 1996, Netsmart incurred non cash compensation charges of $3.5 million arising out of the issuance of warrants and options having exercise prices which were less than the market value of the Common Stock at the date of approval by the board of directors. During 1996, Netsmart issued 500,000 common shares to certain noteholders and 25,000 common shares to Netsmart 's asset based lender. As a result of such issuance, Netsmart incurred a financing cost charge to operations of approximately $1.7 million.  In 1996, Netsmart did not incur any research and development expenses, since the personnel who had been engaged in such activities were reassigned to work on the IBN contract and the development of SmartCard products. As s result, their salaries and related expenses were included in costs of revenue with respect to the work on the IBN contract and capitalized software development costs with respect to their work on the SmartCard product. As a result of such product development, Netsmart incurred $279,000 in capitalized software costs of which $28,000 has been amortized in 1996 and charged to cost of sales. In 1995, Netsmart incurred research and development expenses in the amount of $699,000.  In 1996 Netsmart recognized its 50% share of its loss in its joint venture corporation with respect to the purchase of SATC software. The amount of such loss was $264,000.  Interest expense was $473,000 in 1996, a decrease of $81,000, or 15% from the interest expense in 1995. The most significant component of the interest expense on an ongoing basis is the interest payable to Netsmart's asset-based lender, which it pays interest equal to the greater if 18% per annum or prime plus 8% plus a fee of 1% of the face amount of the invoice.  As a result of the foregoing factors, Netsmart incurred a net loss of $6.6 million compared with a net loss of $2.9 million in 1995.                                         58   The results of Netsmart's operations for the year ended December 31, 1995 are not comparable with the results of operations for 1994 since the acquisition of CSM was effective July 1, 1994, and the results of operations for 1994 include the CSM business only from such date.  Revenue for 1995 was $7.4 million, representing an increase of 152% from revenue for 1994 of $2.9 million. The increase reflected the inclusion of CSM's operation for only the last six months of the year. Revenue from health information systems and services accounted for $6.8 million, or 91.5% of total revenue for 1995 and more than 99% of pro forma combined revenue of Netsmart and CSM for 1994. CarteSmart Systems revenue accounted for the balance of the revenue for the periods. In 1994, Netsmart generated CarteSmart Systems revenue of $90,000 from the pilot project in San Diego County. In 1995, revenue from CarteSmart technology was $631,000.  The largest component of revenue for 1995 was $2.0 million from the sale of third party hardware and software, as compared with $519,000 for 1994. Such revenue represented 26.7% and 17.7% of revenue for 1995 and 1994, respectively. A significant portion of revenue in 1995 represented the sale of hardware ($842,000) and software and related services ($524,000) pursuant to a purchase order from the State of Colorado for its Department of Human Services. Revenue from services related to turnkey systems and data center revenue accounted for $1.8 million and $1.7 million, or 24.1% and 23.6% of revenue, respectively, for 1995, as compared with $664,000 and $884,000, or 22.7% and 30.2% of revenue, respectively, for 1994. Maintenance revenue was $1.1 million and $500,000 in 1995 and 1994, respectively, representing 14.9% and 17% of revenue, respectively. Netsmart believes that the increase in installations at December 31, 1995 from the prior year should enable Netsmart to increase the maintenance revenue in future periods. Revenue from CarteSmart Systems increased to $631,000 in 1995, representing 8.6% of revenue, from $90,000 in 1994, representing 3.1% of revenue. The CarteSmart System revenue reflected revenue from IBN ($481,000), Virginia Commenwealth University ($118,000) and the San Diego pilot program ($31,000) in 1995 and the San Diego Prom ($90,000) in 1994. The overall increase in revenue reflects the inclusion of CarteSmart Systems revenue combined with the revenue from the Colorado agreement.  Both the increase in revenue and the change in revenue mix reflected increased revenue resulting from an enhanced marketing effort following the June 1994 acquisition of CSM. During the second half of 1994, Netsmart received significant purchase orders from the State of Colorado for its Department of Human Services and the State of Oklahoma. The Colorado order covered the purchase of Netsmart's health information system, including software, consulting services and hardware, at a total purchase price of approximately $1.2 million. Of the purchase price, approximately $700,000 represented the purchase price of the software and consulting services, and the balance represents the cost of the hardware. In July 1994, Netsmart received a purchase order from a state agency of the State of Oklahoma for a health information system which includes the graphical interface. The order called for the installation of the system in ten hospitals for a purchase price of approximately $430,000. Netsmart is continuing to market its health information systems to entitlement programs. It believes that the inclusion of the graphical and smart card functions, which were implemented during the second half of 1994 and the first half of 1995, will assist it in marketing its products to entitlement programs. It also believes that the successful pilot project for the smart card interface in San Diego provides the Company with an important tool in marketing this function to both new and existing clients. Netsmart is commencing a marketing effort for its CarteSmart System directed at the financial services industry and educational institutions. However, in the industries to which Netsmart is marketing its products, there is typically a long selling cycle, as a result of which Netsmart must continue to support its marketing effort for a significant period before any revenue is realized.  Gross profit increased to $2.0 million in 1995 from $601,000 in 1994, an increase of 352%, which reflected an increase in the gross margin to 23.9% in 1995 from 13.3% in 1994. The increase in gross profit resulted from both the improved gross margin and the inclusion of twelve months of CSM operations in 1995 and six months of such operations in 1994. The improved margin reflects the significant increase in CarteSmart revenue, on which Netsmart realized a higher margin than on its health information systems and services. However, the amortization of capitalized software costs of $419,000 during 1995 is reflected as a cost of revenue, which offset the higher margin for the CarteSmart System. During 1995, Netsmart changed its CarteSmart System from a DOS-based system to a Windows-based system. The capitalized costs related to the DOS-based system. As a result, at December 31, 1995, Netsmart wrote off the unamortized software development costs, which increased cost of sales. In addition, Netsmart expensed the development of the Windows-based system, which was charged to research and development. The gross profit for 1995 benefited from the gross margin for maintenance services. During 1995, the gross profit from maintenance services increased to $356,000 from $52,000 in 1994, reflecting an increase in the gross margin from such services to 32.4% for 1995 from 10.4% for 1994. The increase in margin resulted from increased services performed on a time and materials basis as well as a reduction in staff as Netsmart was able to perform the same services with a smaller staff.                                         59   Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.5 million and $1.5 million for 1995 and 1994, respectively, representing a 66.0% increase. In 1994, selling, general and administrative expenses included approximately $236,000 of compensation expense arising out of the issuance of Consolidated common stock to former officers of CSM and the grant by SISC to such persons of options to purchase shares of the Netsmart's Common Stock which were owned by SISC. However, in 1995, selling, general and administrative expenses included a $200,000 increase in annualized expenses resulting from an increases in the marketing staff, a $100,000 increase in the level of compensation for Netsmart's and CSM's officers following the June 1994 acquisition of CSM, $150,000 in legal expenses, a portion of which related to the acquisition of CSM, and $313,000 of the amortization of customer lists resulting from the CSM acquisition. Commencing July 1, 1994, general and administrative expenses reflects the amortization of customer lists resulting from the CSM acquisition.  Research and development was $699,000 and $367,000 for 1995 and 1994, respectively, representing a 90.5% increase. The increase reflects research and development for smart card and related products and the graphical interface for Netsmart's health information systems.  During 1995, Netsmart incurred financing costs of $863,000, representing the write-off of deferred financing costs relating to a proposed initial public offering which had been scheduled for early 1995, but which had been canceled. No such expenses were incurred in 1994.  Interest Expense - The most significant component of the interest on an ongoing basis is the interest payable to Netsmart 's asset-based lender, on which it pays interest equal to the greater of 18% per annum or prime plus 8% plus a fee of 1% of the face amount of the invoice.  As a result of the foregoing factors, Netsmart sustained losses of $2.9 million for 1995, as compared with a loss of $1.8 million for 1994. If certain additional compensation expenses were incurred during the year, the pro forma loss would have been $3.5 million, or $.73 per share.  In addition, at December 31, 1995 and 1994, the estimated profit included in cost and estimated profit in excess of interim billings and interim billings in excess of cost and estimated profit decreased substantially from approximately $1.4 million to approximately $500,000. This decrease reflected a reduction in the number of contracts that have billing schedules which differ from revenue recognition. As a result of a reduced number of such contracts at December 31, 1995, the estimated profits from such contracts declined.  Telecommunications:  Revenue for the year ended December 31, 1996 was $5.6 million, reflecting an increase of 52.6% from $3.3 million revenue in the year ended December 31, 1995. ARC's business has two segments -- telephone services and data cable installation services. The increase in revenue in 1996 reflected a change in ARC's business resulting from the increase in local telephone service, and the introduction during 1996 of telephone debit card service and, to a lesser extent, long-distance telephone service. The following table sets forth the revenue and percentage of revenue during 1996 and 1995 from its services.                                                    Year ended December 31, 1996        Year ended December 31, 1995                                               -------------------------------        ----------------------------                                                             Revenue            Percent             Revenue         Percent  Telephone services                               $4,415,000            79.1%             $1,275,000        39.2%  Data cabling installation services               $1,167,000            20.9%             $1,978,000        60.8%   Cost of revenue for 1996 was $5.1 million, reflecting an increase of $2.5 million, or 97%, from the cost of revenue of $2.6 million in 1995. The increase in cost of revenue substantially exceeded the increase in revenue, resulting in a decrease in gross margin from 21.4% in 1995 to 9.1% in 1996. ARC's gross margin in 1996 reflects gross margin of 7.2% for telephone services and 16.3% for data cable installations services. The comparable gross margins in 1995 were 15.1% and 25.4%, respectively.                                         60   The ability of ARC to generate an adequate gross margin from telephone services is dependent upon the volume of service provided by ARC, which is in turn dependent upon both the prices at which ARC can obtain telephone service from the underlying carriers and the price at which ARC can sell the service to its customers. The cost of revenue for ARC's telephone service include the operational expenses associated with the operation of ARC's debit card platform in New York City which it uses for processing calls for users of its prepaid telephone debit cards and, to a lesser extent, calling card charges. The low profit margin for telephone services in 1996 reflected high costs incurred in connection with the introduction of ARC's telephone debit cards, including an insufficient call volume to cover the costs of the debit card platform, errors in pricing certain international calls and problems with telephone line security. The problems in line security reflected charges approximately $105,000 paid by ARC for telephone service which was either unauthorized or unaccounted for, which generated cost of revenue which did not generate revenue. In order for ARC to improve its gross margin for telephone services, ARC must generate sufficient telephone debit card revenue on a continuing basis to cover not only the cost of the service but the cost of the debit card platform. ARC believes that unless its monthly revenue from telephone debit cards is at least $300,000, it will not be able to generate a positive gross margin from telephone debit card operations.  ARC's profit margin on telephone services is subject to a variety of factors which affect both the cost of providing services and the prices at which such services can be sold. Reductions in local and domestic and international long-distance rates affect the rates that ARC can charge for calls through its service. Rate reductions by AT&T, MCI and Sprint and their announced plans to offer local telephone service, especially when directed at businesses and other major users of telephone service, would compel ARC to lower its rates in order to compete effectively, thereby reducing its margins. ARC's costs of service are affected by the cost of transmission and switching facilities and the cost of obtaining access to local telephone users.  The principal components of cost of revenue with respect to its data cable installation service is the cost of personnel. The decrease in data installation margins is due to competitive pricing pressures, which have driven down the margins from 1995 to 1996. ARC's cabling installation business remains under significant pricing pressures.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1996 were $1.4 million, an increase of 23% from $1.2 million in 1995. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses reflected start-up expenses which were incurred as ARC opened offices in Chicago and South Florida in November 1996. Additional overhead was incurred in the New York office to manage its telephone business. During 1996, ARC did not generate significant revenue from either of such offices.  ARC incurred an operating loss of $929,000 for 1996, representing a 96.0% increase from the operating loss of $474,000 in 1995. The 1996 operating loss reflects an operating loss of $934,000 from telephone service and operating income of $5,000 from data cable installation services. The 1995 operating loss reflects operating losses of $266,000 and $208,000 from telephone services and data cable installation services, respectively. The 1996 operating loss from telephone service reflected the loss profit margin combined with high selling, general and administrative expenses relating to this segment of its business. During 1996, ARC devoted a significantly greater portion of its resources to the telephone services segment and as a result, a greater proportion of costs were allocated to that segment in 1996 as compared to 1995.  Interest expense increased by $98,000, or 142%, from $69,000 in 1995 to $167,000 in 1996. This increase reflected increased borrowings principally to finance the purchase of capital equipment and interest expense on funds advanced to ARC by SISC. In September 1996, ARC entered into a term-loan agreement with a non-affiliated asset-based lender, pursuant to which ARC may borrow up to $350,000 to purchase equipment. The loan is due in August 2000. ARC pays interest on such loan at prime plus 12%, which rate shall not be less than 20.8%. ARC also has a revolving credit facility with another non-affiliated asset-based lender . Under such agreement, ARC finances payments to its telephone carriers through loans secured by selected accounts receivable. ARC pays such lender interest at an interest rate of 2% in excess of prime. ARC also pays a fee of .30% of the face amount of the invoices financed, regardless of the amount borrowed against the invoice. The effective average interest rate during 1996 was 10.25%. In addition, accrued interest to Trans Global and SISC was $107,000 in 1996 and $69,000 in 1995. During 1995, ARC had no borrowings from non-affiliated parties and, accordingly, the interest expense for 1995 was solely the interest to Trans Global and SISC. ARC pays its international carriers on a bi-monthly basis and bills its customers monthly, with the result that ARC must finance more of its telephone costs than would be necessary if it was billed and billed its customers on a monthly basis.  As a result of the foregoing factors, ARC sustained a net loss of $1.1 million in 1996 as compared with a loss of $543,000 in 1995.  In connection with the issuance of interim notes in February 1997, ARC issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock at $1.00 per share and 500,000 shares of Common Stock at $5.00 per share. As a result of the issuance of the warrants with an exercise price below the market value of the Common Stock, ARC anticipates that, for the first quarter of 1997, it will incur a non-cash charge in the amount of approximately $3.2 million.                                         61   Revenue for the year ended December 31, 1995 was $3.3 million, reflecting an increase of 43.4% from $2.3 million revenue in the year ended December 31, 1994. The increase in revenue reflected an increase in revenue from local telephone service of $1.3 million, offset by a decrease of $300,000 in revenue from data cable installation services. During 1994, ARC was principally engaged in data cable installation services.  Cost of revenue for 1995 was $2.6 million, reflecting an increase of $1.8 million, or 41.2%, from the cost of revenue of $1.8 million in 1994. The increase in cost of revenue was slightly less than the increase in revenue, resulting in an increase in gross margin from 20.1% in 1994 to 21.4% in 1995. The increase in gross margin reflected the addition of revenue from local telephone service.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for 1995 were $1.2 million, an increase of 108% from $600,000 in 1994. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses reflected an increase in personnel and other expenses resulting from the expansion of local telephone service in 1994.  During 1994, ARC incurred nominal interest.  Interest expense was $69,000 in 1995, reflecting borrowings from Trans Global and SISC.  As a result of the foregoing factors, ARC sustained a net loss of $543,000 as compared with a loss of $144,000 in 1994.  Three Dimensional Products and Services:  This segment is engaged in the business of developing and marketing products and services in the three dimensional imaging and digitizing technology which the segment categorizes in three primary market groups: 1) Surfacer imaging products, 2) Computer Aided Design ("CAD")/Computer Aided Manufacturing ("CAM") software products and services and 3) laser scanning products. Comparing 1996 to 1995, revenues and gross margins decreased $850,000 or 48% and $146,000 or 22%, respectively. The primary reason for such decreases is due to the closure of one of the companies operating in this segment which produced revenues and gross margins in 1995 of $453,000 and $69,000, respectively. Additionally, in July 1996, this segment significantly reduced its operations in Europe and sold certain assets resulting in a one time gain of approximately $450,000, which is included in other income. The decision to close such operations was based on the fact that such companies operations did not align with the planned future for this segment and was not producing margins at a level sufficient to cover its operating costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses from 1996 to 1995 decreased $1,363,000 of which $746,000 relates to the 1995 expense of the closed company. The remaining decrease is related to the reduction of the European operations. Included in 1996 expenses is a charge of $192,000 in noncash expense for the write-off of goodwill that could not be supported by the segment's current cash flows. The operations of 1994 resulted in revenues of $849,000, gross margins of $295,000 and selling general and administrative expense of $1,850,000 which is comparable to 1996 results with the same operating entities. On an overall basis, the net loss for 1996 was $1,472,000, a decrease of $813,000 from 1995 and a decrease of $319,000 from 1994. Management currently anticipates that revenues and operating profits will improve for this segment if the proper financing can be obtained which would allow this segment to acquire a European partner to market and expand its existing product lines. However, no assurances can be made that such financing will be obtained and the ultimate profitability of this segment is significantly dependent on the success of such acquisition.                                         62   Audio Products Manufacturing  This segment consists of WWR Technology, Inc., ("WWR"), which is engaged in the business of manufacturing and marketing a professional line of loudspeakers. WWR was acquired effective March 31, 1995. As such, the operations reported herein reflect only the results from the date of acquisition through December 31, 1996 and the prior periods are not comparable. During 1996, this segment's revenues, gross profit and loss from operations were $5,582,000, $470,000 and $752,000, respectively. During 1996, approximately, 79% of revenues were generated from domestic customers, approximately 15% of sales were from customers in the Far East and approximately 6% of sales were from other foreign market customers. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 1995 revenues, gross margins and losses from operations were $2,150,000, $202,000 and $492,000, respectively. From the date of acquisition through December 31, 1995, approximately, 75% of revenues were generated from domestic customers, approximately 12% of sales were from customers in the Far East and approximately 13% of sales were from other foreign market customers.  During the period from the acquisition through December 31, 1995, costs of sales included $200,000 and excluding such write-off, the gross margin percentage was 19% and during 1996 was 14%. Since the acquisition of this segment, the gross margins have been less than that required to operate profitably. A significant cause of the low margins relates to idle plant capacity, an outdated production machine and a lack of funds to purchase the parts required to build product. During the fourth quarter of 1996, WWR replaced its existing debt with financing obtained from an asset based lender, that has allowed the segment to purchase product for production but not at a level that will allow the segment to significantly increase production. The fourth quarter financing was from an asset based lender which bears interest at 12%, plus a fee on advances of 1%. As of December 31, 1996, WWR has received net advances of $216,000 from the lender. Management is attempting to obtain financing to purchase a new production machine which would produce products significantly faster and additionally, reduce the need to purchase assembly parts from an outside source since the new production machine would be able to produce such parts on a timely basis. No assurance can be given that such financing will be obtained.  Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,221,000 for 1996 and were $694,000 from the date of acquisition through December 31, 1995. This excess of expenses over gross profit is a reflection of the volume problem of this segment. In January management implemented a price increase of approximately 10% and management believes that this will not have a significant impact on sales volume due to high product quality and the name recognition of "KLIPSCH PROFESSIONAL" in the market place. Interest expense for 1996 was $150,000 and for the period from acquisition to December 31, 1995 was $67,000. The increase in annual interest expanse id due to the aforementioned asset based financing that was obtained in 1996.  Management believes that if this segment is able to find an appropriate financing package, it will be able to significantly increase its revenues and overall profitability during 1997. However, due to the uncertainties surrounding the ability of the segment to obtain adequate financing, management is unable to determine at this time whether the segment will ever be profitable.  Business Consulting Services:  During 1996, 1995 and 1994, revenues and gross margins of the business consulting operations were not significant which is consistent with management's decision to concentrate time and resources managing internal operations of the preexisting and newly acquired companies. Selling, general and administrative expenses were also not significant for 1996 and 1995 but amounted to $623,000 for 1994 which is a factor of the significant acquisition activity that occurred during 1994. During 1997, management anticipates that consulting revenues and related expenses will not be a significant portion of THE Company's operations.  Corporate and Other:  Selling, General and Administrative Expense  Corporate selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $3,336,000 when comparing 1996 to 1995 and remain level when comparing 1995 to 1994. In 1995 and 1994 selling, general and administrative expenses include noncash consulting fee expenses incurred upon the issuance of non employee directors and consultants stock options of $3,869,000 and $4,140,000, respectively, for 1995 and 1994. No such consulting fees were incurred at the holding company level during 1996. The remaining expenses, which consist primarily of executive and administrative salaries and benefits, accounting and legal and consulting fees, remained relatively level with the prior periods. During 1997, it is anticipated that corporate selling, general and administrative expense levels will be a factor of the activity of additional acquisitions and capitalization activities which cannot be quantified on a prospective basis.                                         63   Gain (Loss) from Security Sales:  During 1996, the Company realized a gain of $823,000 from sales of securities. During 1995, losses on investment activity were nominal. For 1994, the loss on sales of securities consisted primarily of the recognition of investments that were determined to have a permanent decline in market value and as such, the decline was recognized in that period. Security sales vary from period to period based on, among other things, market activity and cash needs, and management cannot estimate the amount of future security sales gains or losses, if any, that will be generated from such transactions.  Income Taxes  The Company's provision for income taxes were (4.6%), (1.5%) and (0.2%) of income before taxes for the years ended December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The Company will have a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $53,891. The net operating loss carryforward expires beginning in 1997 through 2011. Investment tax credit and job tax credit carryforwards of approximately $105 are available to reduce future income taxes. These credits expire beginning in various years through 1999. These credits have been reduced to reflect changes made by the "Tax Reform Act of 1986". See Note 12 To the Financial Statements.  Minority Interest in Loss of Subsidiaries  For 1996, 1995 and 1994, the minority interest in loss of subsidiaries was $3,098,000 and $3,724,000, and $132,000, respectively. Changes to the minority interest in the gain and loss of subsidiaries, other than those changes related to the inherent differences in the net income and loss of subsidiaries from period to period, resulted from the minority issuance of stock options and stock purchase warrants and the initial public offering in the medical information services segment, the issuance of minority owned stock in the contract engineering services segment and the sale of 10% of the equity position of the Company's investments in subsidiaries to the Company's CEO.  Impact of Inflation:  The Company is subject to normal inflationary trends and anticipates that any increased costs would be passed on to its customers.  Item 8.
