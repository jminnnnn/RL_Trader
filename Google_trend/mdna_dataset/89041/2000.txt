The following table calculates the working capital that the Company has available for use in its operations as of December 31, 1999 and 1998.  - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Calculation of Available Working Capital As of December 31,                                    1999             1998 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Current assets                                  $   7,401,000   $    6,214,000 Current liabilities                                   316,000        5,675,000 - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Working capital                                     7,085,000          539,000 Plus total net current liabilities of  discontinued segments                                     --        4,194,000 Less net current assets of discontinued  segments not available to the Company                     --         (926,000) - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Working capital available for the Company's  operations                                     $   7,085,000   $    3,807,000 - --------------------------------------------------------------------------------           During 1999, the Company's available working capital increased by $3.278 million of which approximately $2 million is the non-cash effect of the note receivable due from Arc Networks. As of December 1998, Arc Networks was a consolidated subsidiary and the $2 million note receivable balance was eliminated in consolidation under generally accepted accounting principles pursuant to Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 "Consolidated Financial Statements". As of December 31 1999, the Company has sold all of its equity investment in Arc Networks, and accordingly, the note receivable balance is not eliminated, resulting in an increase in current assets and therefore an increase in working capital.           During 1999, the Company used net cash of $3.307 million in operating activities and $255,000 in financing activities and generated net cash of $5.243 million from investing activities. The uses of cash in operating activities included $2.14 million related to 1999 operations, $1.115 million related to 1998 settlements and professional fees which were accrued as of December 31, 1998 and $42,000 related to operations of discontinued segments. Cash generated from investing activities included $12.549 million from the sale of marketable securities and $855,000 from the disposal of Arc Networks. Cash used in investing activities included $5.607 million for the purchase of marketable securities, $1.557 million in advances made under notes receivable and $950,000 for an investment in GAVELNET.COM. Cash used in financing activities included $129,000 for the purchase of treasury stock and $93,000 for payment of discontinued subsidiaries obligations.  Sources and Uses of Working Capital Subsequent to December 31, 1999           Subsequent to December 31, 1999, significant sources of working capital included the receipt of $690,000 of principal and interest on notes receivable and $397,000 from the sale of marketable securities, while significant uses of working capital includes $3.25 million in advances under new note receivable agreements with People Solutions, enTotal.com, FutureMed and JOR (see Part I., Item. 1 "Current Developments"). Contingent obligations of the Company as of December 31, 1999 includes two debt guarantees made on behalf of Arc Networks totaling $1.730 million. In the event that Arc Networks is unable to obtain or generate adequate working capital to make payments under its related debt obligations, the Company could be required to make payments on Arc Network's behalf.  Results of Operations  Revenue and Gross Profit           During the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company discontinued all prior-operating segments, and effective January 1, 1998 Netsmart no longer was a consolidated affiliate. As such, the Company's only operating revenue and gross profit was Netsmart's 1997 activity, wherein revenues approximated $7.882 million and gross profit approximated $1.727 million.                                         9   Operating Losses           Comparing 1999 and 1998, the Company's loss from operations decreased $3.151 million, or 57.49%, from $5.481 million for 1998 to $2.33 million for 1999.

During 1999 and 1998, the Company had no revenues or gross profits and as such, the operating losses for such periods consisted entirely of operating expense. The operating loss for 1997 was the net result of gross profits of $1.727 million less operating expense of $8.272 million of which $4.410 million related to Netsmart's selling, general and administrative expense. The following discusses the separate components of operating expense.  Professional Fees           Comparing 1999 and 1998, professional fees decreased $260,000, or 22.05%, from $1.179 million for 1998 to $919,000 for 1999. Comparing 1998 and 1997, professional fees increased $911,000, or 339.93%, from $268,000 for 1997 to $1.179 million for 1998. Professional fees during 1999 included legal fees of $774,000 and accounting and auditing fees of $145,000. The legal fees in 1999 included $306,000 related to the disposal of Arc Networks, Trans Global and Netsmart, $166,000 related to litigation settlements and the remaining $302,000 related to general legal matters, including proxy and change of control issues. Professional fees during 1998 included legal fees of $1.076 million and accounting and auditing fees of $103,000. The legal fees in 1998 included $390,000 related to change of control issues, $205,000 related to litigation settlements, $122,000 related to the disposal of IMI, and the remaining $359,000 related to general legal matters. Professional fees during 1997 included legal fees of $138,000 and accounting and auditing fees of $130,000.  Salaries, Payroll Taxes and Fringe Benefits           Comparing 1999 and 1998, salaries, payroll taxes and fringe benefits decreased $42,000, or 5.71%, from $735,000 for 1998 to $693,000 for 1999. Comparing 1998 and 1997, salaries, payroll taxes and fringe benefits decreased $605,000, or 45.15%, from $1.340 million for 1997 to $735,000 for 1998. Salaries, payroll taxes and fringe benefits for 1999 consisted of $311,000 for officer salaries, $159,000 for non-officer salaries, $56,000 for payroll taxes and fringe benefits and $167,000 for employees who were terminated during 1999.

Salaries, payroll taxes and fringe benefits for 1997 consisted of $49,000 for non-officer salaries, $5,000 for payroll taxes and fringe benefits and $1.286 million related to terminated employees.  Other General and Administrative Expense           Comparing 1999 and 1998, other general and administrative expense decreased $182,000, or 24.73%, from $736,000 for 1998 to $554,000 for 1999. Comparing 1998 and 1997, other general and administrative expense increased $36,000, or 5.14%, from $700,000 for 1997 to $736,000 for 1998. For 1998, other general and administrative expense includes a credit of approximately $176,000 for negotiated trade payable write-offs. Excluding these trade payable write-offs, actual general and administrative expenses for 1999 were approximately $358,000 less than those of 1998 and actual general and administrative expense for 1997 was $140,000 less than those of 1998. The most significant increase in 1998 other general and administrative expense was insurance costs, which were $245,000 in 1998 compared to $46,000 and $10,000 for 1999 and 1997, respectively. The increase in 1998 insurance costs resulted from the one time purchase of a professional liability coverage policy in connection with the disposal of the medical diagnostics segment.  Consulting Fees           Comparing 1999 and 1998, consulting fees decreased $251,000, or 76.29%, from $329,000 for 1998 to $78,000 for 1999. Comparing 1998 and 1997, consulting fees increased $201,000, or 157.03%, from $128,000 for 1997 to $329,000 for 1998. Consulting fees for 1999 included $60,000 paid to Seymour Richter pursuant to a consulting agreement he received upon his April 20, 1999 resignation as the Company's president and chief executive officer and $18,000 paid to a consultant in connection with the closing of the Company's New York offices. During 1998, consulting fees consisted of $200,000 paid to Lewis Schiller pursuant to a consulting agreement he received upon his April 2, 1998 resignation as the Company's president and chief executive officer, $113,000 paid to a consultant who was evaluating financing sources for potential acquisitions and $16,000 paid to other consultants. During 1997, $128,000 was paid to consultants who were primarily hired to seek equity and other financing sources for the Company's subsidiaries.                                         10   Termination Payments for Executive Contracts           Comparing 1999 and 1998, termination payments for executive contracts decreased $1.922 million, or 97.56%, from $1.970 million for 1998 to $48,000 for 1999. During 1997 the Company incurred no such costs. Termination payments for executive contracts for 1999 and 1998 relate to the termination of contracts with Mr. Schiller, a former CEO of the Company, Ms. Grazyna Wnuk (Ms. Wnuk), a former Secretary of the Company, and Mr. George W. Mahoney (Mr. Mahoney) the former CFO of the Company. The contract termination payments paid to Mr. Mahoney involve two separate employment agreements between the Company and Mr. Mahoney. During 1998, the Company paid Mr. Mahoney $350,000 related to a change of control provision included in Mr. Mahoney's contract, which was in effect at that time, and entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Mr. Mahoney. During 1999, the Company and Mr. Mahoney mutually terminated the amended and restated employment agreement and the Company paid Mr. Mahoney $48,000 in full satisfaction of any amounts owed to Mr. Mahoney. On March 30, 1998, the Company entered into a series of agreements with Mr. Schiller and Ms. Wnuk. Pursuant to the agreements, Mr. Schiller and Ms. Wnuk resigned as directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries. In consideration for payments of approximately $4 million to Mr. Schiller and Ms. Wnuk and the return to the Company by Mr. Schiller of 39,667 shares of the Company's common stock he then held, the Company purchased from Mr. Schiller and Ms. Wnuk all of their rights under their respective employment agreements with the Company and their stock interest in IMI. Approximately $1.6 million of the $4 million of such payments related to Mr. Schiller and Ms. Wnuk's stock interest in the IMI sale. The remainder of $2.4 million related to obligations of the Company, of which approximately $561,000 was accrued at December 31, 1997, for commissions and salaries payable to Mr. Schiller and Ms. Wnuk and $1.62 million related to contract termination expense for 1998.  Settlement Costs           Comparing 1999 and 1998, settlement costs decreased $359,000, or 90.43%, from $397,000 for 1998 to $38,000 for 1999. Comparing 1998 and 1997, settlement costs decreased $326,000, or 45.09%, from $723,000 for 1997 to $397,000 for 1998. During 1999, the Company incurred $38,000 of expense to settle claims relating to former subsidiaries. During 1998, the Company incurred $387,000 of expense to settle claims made by former employees of the Company and its subsidiaries and $10,000 to settle a claim relating to a disposed subsidiary. During 1997, the Company incurred $221,000 in costs to settle claims against the Company and former subsidiaries and $502,000 of costs related to the acquisition and subsequent divestiture of Lafayette Industries, Inc. ("Lafayette"). On December 20, 1996, the Company purchased Lafayette. Lafayette's Form 10-KSB for 1996 included a disclaimer of opinion by Lafayette's independent certified public accountants. This report disclosed that there was substantial doubt with respect to Lafayette's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, Lafayette's accountants reported that they were unable to obtain written representations from Lafayette's counsel regarding litigation relating, among other things, to financial guarantees. Because of material uncertainties on the part of the Company with respect to Lafayette's guarantees, pending litigation, the accuracy of representations and warranties made by Lafayette, the accuracy and completeness of Lafayette's financial statements with respect to material liabilities, Lafayette's financial condition and other matters, the Company's and Lafayette's respective boards of directors determined that, in order to avoid costly and time consuming litigation, Lafayette and the Company would enter into an agreement providing for, among other things, the reversal of the acquisition and the payment by the Company of approximately $502,000 of costs incurred by Lafayette during 1996.  Related Party Bad Debt Expense           The Company had no related party bad debt expense for 1999. Comparing 1998 and 1997, related party bad debt expense decreased $210,000, or 60.87%, from $345,000 for 1997 to $135,000 for 1998. Pursuant to a settlement agreement, negotiated by a shareholder representative, between the Company and Mr. Schiller, the Company forgave all amounts due from Televend, a company that was sold to Mr. Schiller, Universal International, Inc. ("Universal"), a company of which Ms. Wnuk is the president, and Fingermatrix, Inc., a Company of which Mr. Schiller was a board member. During 1998 the Company recognized bad debt expense of $86,000 related to Televend and $49,000 related to Universal. During 1997 the Company recognized bad debt expense of $250,000 related to Universal and $95,000 related to Fingermatrix, Inc.  Related Party Commissions           The Company had no related party commissions for 1999 or 1998. During 1997 the Company recognized $358,000 of expense for commissions earned by Mr. Schiller on the Company's investment activity pursuant to Schiller's employment agreement that was in effect prior to his resignation in April 1998.                                         11   Non Operating Income and Expense  Gain (Loss) from Marketable Securities           Comparing 1999 and 1998, net gain on marketable securities increased $2.683 million, or 2,374.34%, from $113,000 for 1998 to $2.796 million for 1999. Comparing 1998 and 1997, net gain or loss on marketable securities increased $481,000, or 130.71%, from a net loss of $368,000 for 1997 to a net gain of $113,000 for 1998. During 1999 the Company realized gains of $2.624 million from the sale of Netsmart common stock, $168,000 from the sale of US Treasury Bills and $4,000 from the sale of commercial paper. During 1998 the Company realized gains of 195,000 from the sale of US Treasury Bills which was partially offset by the recognition of an $82,000 loss for declines in common stock investments which were deemed to be permanent. During 1997 the Company realized a loss of $203,000 on the sale of Trans Global common stock to the president of Trans Global and $165,000 on the sale of Netsmart common stock to three executives of Netsmart.  Interest Income and Loan Fees, Related Party           During 1999, the Company earned $197,000 of interest income and loan fees on its note receivable to Arc Networks. Interest and loan fees earned on the Arc Network's note receivable related to 1998 were eliminated in consolidation since prior to 1999 Arc Networks was a consolidated subsidiary of the Company.  Other Income and Expense           Comparing 1999 and 1998, net other income increased $33,000, or 6.11%, from $54,000 for 1998 to $87,000 for 1999. Comparing 1998 and 1997, net other income or expense increased $219,000, or 132.72%, from net other expense of $165,000 for 1997 to net other income of $54,000 for 1998. During 1999, the Company earned $28,000 of interest income and loan fees on a note receivable to an unrelated party and $59,000 of interest income on money market funds. During 1998 the Company earned $56,000 from consulting fees and incurred net other expense of $2,000. During 1997 the Company recognized expense of $240,000 from the write-off of a joint venture investment, interest income of $114,000 on notes receivable and net other expense of $39,000. The 1997 net other expense of subsidiary of $595,000 pertains to the operations of Netsmart.  Minority Interest in Income or Loss of Subsidiaries           Changes in minority in income or loss of subsidiaries are a result of the inherent differences in the net income and loss of the related subsidiaries from period to period. In 1999 the minority interest relates only to the minority portion of Trans Global's income prior to the disposal of Trans Global in the first quarter of 1999. During 1998, the minority portion of Trans Global's income amounted to $375,000, which was partially offset by $196,000 representing the minority portion of Arc Network's loss. During 1997, the minority interest portions of subsidiaries with losses included $2.041 million related to Netsmart, $468,000 related to SpecTec, $449,000 related to Arc Networks and $120,000 related to IMI. Minority interest portions of subsidiaries with income during 1997 included $605,000 related to Trans Global and $30,000 related to 3D Tech.  Share of Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate           The share of income of unconsolidated affiliate represents the Company's 36% share of Netsmart's income, which approximated $113,000 for 1999 and $71,000 for 1998. During 1999 the Company sold all of its interest in Netsmart.  Income Tax Expense           The Company's income tax expense includes federal taxes of $17,000 for 1999 and includes state taxes of $8,000 and $20,000 for 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $46.875 million as of December 1999, which expire during the years from 2000 through 2018.  Income or Loss from Continuing Operations           As a result of the foregoing, the Company's income from continuing operations was $542,000, or $0.33 per share for 1999. The Company's loss from continuing operations for 1998 was $5.442 million, or $3.33 per share, and for 1997 was $5,230,000, or $3.33 per share. As more fully described in the preceding paragraphs, the decrease in losses from continuing operations is primarily the result of significant gains on marketable securities realized in the 1999 periods, the significant reduction in contract termination expense from the 1998 to 1999 periods and to a lesser extent, a reduction of operating expenses from the 1998 to 1999                                         12   periods. Due to the non-recurring nature of realized gains on marketable securities and contract termination expense, future reductions of operating losses cannot be assured.  Discontinued Operations           The Company's income (loss) from operations of discontinued segments and the gain or (loss) on disposal of segments are presented in the following table.
