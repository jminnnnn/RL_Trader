ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION          AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources  Restatements           The following discussion, as it relates to periods prior to 1998, has been restated from the prior years discussion to reflect the discontinuation of Trans Global (Contract Engineering Services segment) and Arc Networks (Telecommunications segment).  Working Capital Condition           During 1998 and 1997, the Company discontinued seven of its eight operating segments and effective January 1, 1998, the Company was required to change its accounting treatment for its investment in Netsmart from a consolidated subsidiary to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. As of the date of this report, the Company does not have a definitive plan for making future investments in subsidiaries. From December 1995 through December 1997, the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern has been in doubt. During that period the Company made attempts at raising capital, or assisting its subsidiaries in raising capital, at levels that would allow the subsidiaries to operate profitably. Such efforts were unsuccessful for a majority of its subsidiaries and the Company was unable to generate positive cash flow. In 1998 and 1997 the Company disposed of all of its operating entities including the Medical Diagnostics segment.           The April 2, 1998, disposal of the Medical Diagnostics segment generated approximately $15 million in net cash and disposed of approximately $13.4 million in intangible assets, $20 million in debt and capital lease obligations and $5 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses. At the closing of the sale, approximately $2.2 million of the net proceeds was used for termination payments under executive contracts, $2.5 million was used to pay existing obligations of the Company, $2 million was loaned to the Telecommunications segment and $1.6 million was used to extinguish the remaining obligations of the Medical Diagnostic segment. Subsequent to the closing of the sale through December 1998, approximately $137,000 was paid for litigation settlement costs, $1 million for professional fees primarily related to the negotiation of the settlements, $118,000 for the purchase of treasury shares and approximately $421,000 was used for the ongoing operations of the Company.           As of December 1998, the Company had cash of $179,000 and marketable securities approximating $5.1 million invested in US Treasury Bills. Excluding the net current assets and liabilities of discontinued segments, the Company has available working capital of approximately $3.1 million. As of the date of this report the Company does not have definitive plans for the use of its existing working capital, however, the Company believes that it has sufficient resources to enable it to operate for a period greater than one year from December 1998. The following table summarizes the working capital that the Company has available for use in its operations as of December 1998 and 1997.                                                                                                December 31,                                                                                        1998              1997                                                                                        ----              ----        Current assets                                                                  $   6,214,000     $    4,940,000   Current liabilities                                                                 5,675,000         23,678,000                                                                                       ---------         ----------     Working capital (deficiency)                                                        539,000        (18,738,000)   Plus total net current liabilities of discontinued segments                         4,194,000         17,402,000   Less:     Portion of total current liabilities of discontinued segments that the       Company may be obligated to pay                                                  (731,000)        (2,855,000)     Net current assets of discontinued segments not available to Consolidated          (926,000)         1,254,000                                                                                         -------          ---------       Working capital (deficiency) available for the Company's operations         $   3,076,000    ($    2,937,000)                                                                                       =========          =========            The Company's principal working capital consists of cash and investments in U.S. Treasury Bills, which in the aggregate approximated $5.3 million as of December 1998. As of December 1998, the Company had guaranteed $1.2 million of indebtedness that Arc Networks has outstanding to Trans Global and $550,000 of                                         11   indebtedness that Arc Networks has outstanding under a promissory note. Additionally, subsequent to December 1998, the Company advanced an additional $400,000 to Arc Networks.  Changes in Other Working Capital Assets and Liabilities           Significant changes in working capital assets and liabilities, other than cash and marketable securities and the components related to discontinued segments, were the result of the conversion of Netsmart from a consolidated affiliate to an equity method investment. The accounting for the conversion of Netsmart is such that Netsmart's assets and liabilities are included in the December 1997 balance sheet but not the December 1998 balance sheet. Netsmart's balances included in the December 1997 balance sheet and not the December 1998 balance sheet include working capital assets of $84,000 of prepaid and other current assets, $2.2 million of net receivables and $542,000 of excess of accumulated costs over billings. Working capital liabilities of Netsmart included in the December 1997 balance sheet and not the December 1998 balance sheet include $2.1 million of accounts payable and accrued expense, $1.1 million of interim billings in excess of costs and estimated profits, $955,000 of current debt obligations and $23,000 of current capitalized lease obligations.  Results of Operations           During 1998, the Company's consolidated net income approximated $4.1 million or $0.08 per common share. Included in net income for 1998 is a net gain on the disposal of segments approximating $6.8 million, an extraordinary gain on debt extinguishment approximating $5.7 million and net losses from operations of discontinued segments approximating $2.9 million. The Company's consolidated loss from operations for 1998 approximated $5.5 million consisting entirely of general and administrative expense. Comparatively, during 1997 and 1996, the Company's consolidated loss from operations approximated $6.6 million and $8.4 million, respectively; however, such losses included $2.9 million and $5.8 million respectively, from the operations of Netsmart and 1998's operations includes no such amounts related to Netsmart. The Company's consolidated net loss for 1997 and 1996 approximated $12.7 million or $0.27 per common share and $9.6 million or $0.23 per common share, respectively. The 1997 and 1996 net loss include an add back for the minority interest portion of the subsidiary's losses, which approximated $2.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively, and includes losses related to the operations and disposal of discontinued segments of $7.4 million and $4.6 million, respectively.           During 1998, the Company discontinued the Contract Engineering Services and Telecommunications segments, and during 1997 discontinued the Medical Diagnostics, Electro-Mechanical and Electro-Optical Products Manufacturing, Audio Products Manufacturing, Three Dimensional Products and Services and Business Consulting Services segments. Additionally, effective January 1, 1998, Netsmart, an affiliate which represented the Medical Information Services segment, is no longer a consolidated affiliate and instead is an equity method investment. As a result, the Company has no operating business segments as of December 1998. For 1997 and 1996, the operating activity includes Netsmart as well as Consolidated since during those periods, Netsmart was still a consolidated affiliate. During 1997 and 1996 all of the Company's consolidated revenues, direct costs and gross profit were generated by Netsmart. The following table presents the separate operating expense and other income and expense components of Consolidated and Netsmart.

Consolidated's General and Administrative Expense  Corporate Termination Payments for Executive Contracts           Expense related to termination payments for executive contracts approximated $2 million for 1998. No such expense was incurred for 1997 or 1996.           On March 30, 1998, the Company entered into a series of agreements with Lewis S. Schiller ("Schiller") and Grazyna B. Wnuk ("Wnuk"). Pursuant to the agreements, Schiller and Wnuk resigned as directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries. In consideration for payments of approximately $4 million to Schiller and Wnuk and the return to the Company by Schiller of 1,190,000 of Consolidated common stock he then held, the Company purchased from Schiller and Wnuk all of their rights under their respective employment agreements with the Company and their stock interest in IMI. $1.6 million of the $4 million of such payments relates to Schiller's and Wnuk's stock interest in the IMI sale. The remainder of $2.4 million relates to obligations of the Company, of which approximately $600,000 was accrued at December 1997, for commissions and salaries payable to Schiller and Wnuk and $1.8 million relates to contract termination expense for 1998. The $1.8 million of contract termination expense was reduced by $223,000 which represents the value of the 1,190,000 shares of Consolidated stock returned by Schiller to the Company, resulting in net contract termination expense related to Schiller and Wnuk of approximately $1.6 million.           On April 14, 1998, Mr. George W. Mahoney, the Company's Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), notified the Company that he was exercising his right under his employment agreement with the Company (the "Original Agreement") to terminate his employment on ninety days notice. At that time, Mr. Mahoney also advised the Company that, in his view, the agreement required the Company, as a consequence of the April 1998 change of control of the Company's management, to pay him a lump sum equal to his salary for the balance of the term of the agreement, which was approximately $2.4 million. On June 16, 1998, Mr. Mahoney and the Company executed an Amended and Restated Employment Agreement (the "Amended Agreement"), whereby Mr. Mahoney continues to serve the Company as its CFO for a term that commenced on June 1, 1998 and will expire on May 31, 1999. The material provisions of the Amended Agreement include the payment to Mr. Mahoney of an annual salary of $202,000, and the payment by the Company of $350,000 in settlement of his claims for change of control compensation under the Original Agreement. The $350,000 payment was made to Mr. Mahoney on June 19, 1998. The Company also delivered a general release to Mr. Mahoney simultaneously with the execution of the Amended Agreement. By its terms, the general release extinguishes any claims that the Company might have had against Mr. Mahoney, whether known or unknown, arising from or in connection with Mr. Mahoney's services by, or on behalf of, the Company as an officer, director or shareholder, or otherwise, prior to and including April 3, 1998.  Corporate Professional Fees           Professional fees, which include the expense of legal fees and accounting and auditing fees, approximated $1.2 million, $268,000 and $305,000 for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. During 1998, the Company incurred approximately $435,000 in legal fees related to the settlement of lawsuits against Consolidated (see above, Part I, Item 3., "Legal Proceedings"), preparation of loan documents for a line of credit provided to Arc Networks and other general matters. Legal fees incurred on behalf of discontinued subsidiaries during 1998 for such subsidiaries'                                         13   lawsuits (see above, Part I, Item 3., "Legal Proceedings") and general matters approximated $388,000. Legal fees related to settlement negotiations with Schiller, the former CEO of the Company, approximated $157,000. Additionally, during 1998, the Company paid approximately $50,000 to each of Edward D. Bright, Chairman of the Board, Treasurer, Secretary and a director of Consolidated, and Patterson Travis, a brokerage firm that represents certain shareholders of Consolidated for reimbursement of legal expenses incurred by the two related parties in connection with the Schiller termination. Auditing and accounting fees for 1998 approximated $104,000. During 1997, the Company incurred legal fees of $138,000 for general matters and accounting and auditing fees of $130,000. During 1996, the Company incurred legal fees of $65,000 for general matters and accounting and auditing fees of $240,000.  Corporate Salaries, Payroll Taxes and Fringe Benefits           Salaries, payroll taxes and fringe benefits approximated $735,000 for 1998 of which approximately $299,000 relates to five employees who were terminated during 1998. Salaries, payroll taxes and fringe benefits for the three current employees of the Company approximated $342,000 of which $232,000 was paid to officers, $68,000 was paid to a non officer employee, $20,000 was paid for payroll taxes and $22,000 was paid for fringe benefits. Additionally, during 1998, approximately $95,000 of salaries and payroll taxes of IMI was allocated to the Company. During 1997, salaries, payroll taxes and fringe benefits approximated $1.3 million of which $957,000 was paid to officers, $322,000 was paid to accounting and administrative personnel, $48,000 was paid for payroll taxes and $14,000 was paid for fringe benefits. During 1996, salaries, payroll taxes and fringe benefits approximated $874,000 of which $450,000 was paid to officers, $356,000 was paid to accounting and administrative personnel, $42,000 was paid for payroll taxes and $26,000 was paid for fringe benefits.  Corporate Settlement Costs           During 1998, settlement costs approximated $397,000 of which approximately $230,000 related to litigation settlement agreements (see above, Part I, Item 3., "Legal Proceedings") and $167,000 related to settlements with former employees. During 1997 settlement costs approximated $723,000 of which $221,000 relates to litigation settlement agreements (see above, Part I, Item 3., "Legal Proceedings") and $502,000 related to the Lafayette settlement agreement. On December 20, 1996, the Company purchased Lafayette Industries, Inc., ("Lafayette"). Lafayette's Form 10-KSB for 1996, included a disclaimer of opinion by Lafayette's independent certified public accountants. This report disclosed that there was substantial doubt with respect to Lafayette's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, Lafayette's accountants reported that they were unable to obtain written representations from Lafayette's counsel regarding litigation relating, among other things, to financial guarantees. Because of material uncertainties on the part of the Company with respect to Lafayette's guarantees, pending litigation, the accuracy of representations and warranties made by Lafayette, the accuracy and completeness of Lafayette's financial statements with respect to material liabilities, Lafayette's financial condition and other matters, the Company's and Lafayette's respective boards of directors determined that, in order to avoid costly and time consuming litigation, Lafayette and the Company would enter into an agreement providing for, among other things, the reversal of the acquisition and the payment by the Company of approximately $502,000 of costs incurred by Lafayette during 1996.  Corporate Consulting Fees           During 1998, consulting fees approximated $329,000 of which $200,000 was paid to Schiller pursuant to a consulting agreement entered into on April 2, 1998 as a part of the Schiller resignation, $113,000 was paid to a consultant for work performed to assist the Company in an acquisition for Trans Global which was not consummated and $16,000 was paid for other consulting services. During 1997 and 1996, consulting fees of approximately $128,000 and $474,000 were paid to consulting firms and individual consultants who performed work to assist the Company in attempting to obtain equity financing for its subsidiaries. During 1996, $45,000 of the $474,000 of consulting expense reflects the value of 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock issued to consultants.  Corporate Related Party Bad Debt Expense           During 1998 and 1997, related party bad debt expense approximated $135,000 and $345,000 from the write-off of loans due from Companies affiliated with Schiller and Wnuk, the Company's former CEO and Secretary. During 1998, the Company wrote-off a $49,000 receivable due from Universal International, Inc.                                         14   ("Universal"), a company in which Wnuk owned 31% of the stock and an $87,000 receivable due from Televend, subsidiary of SESH, which was sold by the Company to Schiller as of December 1997. During 1997, the Company wrote-off a $250,000 receivable due from Universal and a $95,000 receivable due from Fingermatrix, a company for which Schiller was a board member.  Corporate Related Party Commissions           During 1997 the Company accrued $358,000 for commissions earned by Schiller on the Company's investment activity pursuant to Schiller's employment agreement that was in effect prior to his resignation in April 1998.  Consolidated's Other Income and Expense  Gain (Loss) on Marketable Securities           During 1998, the Company realized gains on sales of US Treasury Bills of approximately $193,000 and recognized a loss of $80,000 for an estimated permanent decline in equity securities held by the Company, resulting in a net gain on marketable security activity of $113,000. During 1997, the Company realized losses of $368,000 on the sale of securities of which $203,000 related to the sale of Trans Global stock to the president of Trans Global and $165,000 related to the sale of Netsmart stock to executives of Netsmart. During 1996 the Company realized an $823,000 gain on the sale of securities primarily from the sale of Netsmart warrants held by the Company.  Corporate Other Income (Expense)           During 1998, other income approximated $62,000 of which $32,000 resulted from the agreement of certain subordinated debt holders to except less than the original principal balance of their subordinated notes, $15,000 was earned on dividend reinvestment of the Company's money market account and $15,000 was received for consulting services. During 1997, other net expense approximated $153,000 of which $240,000 of expense resulted from the write-off of a joint venture investment, $51,000 of income was from interest earned on receivables, $16,000 of income resulted from the sub-lease of an office and $20,000 of income resulted from the write-off of old outstanding trade payables. During 1996, other income approximated $368,000 of which $244,000 was interest income earned on receivables that were issued and repaid during 1996 and $124,000 reflects the recovery of receivables that were written-off prior to December 1996.  Corporate Interest Expense           Interest expense approximated $8,000, $12,000 and $98,000, respectively, for 1998, 1997 and 1996. The interest expense for 1998 and 1997 is related to the subordinated debt of the Company, and the interest expense for 1996 reflects interest and financing fees paid for a loan that was obtained and repaid in 1996.  Income Tax Provision           The Company's provision for income taxes was 0.4%, 0.0% and 0.6% of income (loss) before taxes for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company will have a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $15.3 million as of December 1998. The net operating loss carryforward expires beginning in 1999 through 2012.  Minority Interest in (Income) Loss of Subsidiaries           For 1998, 1997 and 1995, the minority interest in (income) loss of subsidiaries approximated ($179,000), $2.4 million and $3.1 million, respectively. Changes in the minority interest in the income and loss of subsidiaries are a result of the inherent differences in the net income and loss of subsidiaries from period to period.  Share of Income of Unconsolidated Affiliate  The share of income of unconsolidated affiliate represents the Company's 36% share of Netsmart's income, which approximated $71,000 for 1998.                                         15   Extraordinary Gain on Extinguishment of Debt           On August 12, 1998, IMI consummated a settlement with the holders of certain subordinated promissory notes which were issued by IMI in 1994 in connection with the acquisition of the Medical Diagnostics segment. The Company paid approximately $1.9 million in full settlement and satisfaction of the approximate $7.7 million outstanding balance of such notes, of which approximately $1.6 million was paid in cash and approximately $324,000 was applied in payment of certain promissory notes due to IMI by one of the holders of the subordinated promissory notes. In connection with the settlement, the Company issued 333,000 shares of its common stock, valued at $80,000, to the holders of the subordinated promissory notes in satisfaction of IMI's contractual obligations under the agreements relating to the 1994 acquisition of the Medical Diagnostics segment. The Company recognized an extraordinary gain on debt extinguishment of approximately $5.6 million for 1998, in connection with this settlement.  Future Operations of Consolidated           As of the date of this report the Company does not have any consolidated subsidiaries that are not classified as discontinued segments. As a result, the Company will have no revenues, direct costs or gross profit until such time, if ever, that other subsidiaries are acquired and currently the Company has no definitive plans for any acquisitions. The future operating losses of the Company will be comprised of its general and administrative expenses, which currently consist primarily of salaries and related taxes and fringe benefits, professional fees and other general and administrative costs. Currently the Company has three employees with annual base salaries aggregating approximately $389,000, excluding payroll taxes and fringe benefits. Professional fees will vary depending on the level of future litigation, acquisition and other activity. The current sources of income for the Company are those earned on the US Treasury Bill investments and the Company's money market account, which in the aggregate are expected to be significantly less than the Company's operating costs. As a result, it is estimated that the Company will incur operating losses until such time when and if acquisitions of new subsidiaries are made. During 1999 it is estimated that the anticipated disposal of Trans Global and Arc Networks and the sale of the Netsmart shares will result in gains that may offset the operating losses of the Company for 1999.   Netsmart:           For purposes herein, references to Netsmart relate to the operations of both Netsmart and CSM unless indicated otherwise. The following only discusses the operations of Netsmart for 1997 and 1996 since effective January 1, 1998, Netsmart was converted to an equity method investment and is no longer a consolidated subsidiary. During 1997 and 1996, Netsmart was engaged in developing, marketing and supporting computer software designed to enable health service as well as financial related organizations to provide a range of services in a network-computing environment.           Netsmart's revenue for 1997 was $7.9 million, a decrease of approximately $659,000, or 8%, from revenue of $8.5 million for 1996. This decrease was the net result of a decrease in revenues from one contract with IBN, Inc. (the "IBN Contract") of $1.8 million, which was partially offset by an increase in other revenue sources of approximately $1.1 million. During 1996, the IBN Contract generated $1.9 million of revenue, compared to $95,000 in 1997. The IBN Contract represented Netsmart's most significant customer for 1996, accounting for approximately 22% of revenue and during 1997, Netsmart completed all ongoing services related to the IBN contract. Revenue from Netsmart's health information systems continued to represent Netsmart's principal source of revenue in 1997, accounting for $7.6 million or 97% of revenue. The largest component of revenue in 1997 was data center (service bureau) revenue approximating $2.2 million for both 1997 and 1996. Turnkey systems revenue increased 24% to $2.1 million for 1997 from $1.7 million in 1996. Maintenance revenue increased 8% to $1.3 million for 1997 from $1.2 million in 1996. Revenue from third party hardware and software decreased 9% to $1 million for 1997 from $1.1 million in 1996. License revenue increased to $737,000 in 1997 from $329,000 in 1996, a 124% increase. License revenue is generated as part of a sale of a turnkey system pursuant to a contract or purchase order that includes development of a turnkey system and maintenance.           Gross profit increased to $1.7 million in 1997 from $1.6 million in 1996, a 7% increase. The increase in the gross profit was substantially the result of a reduction of costs associated with the IBN Contract as well as the increase in revenue from the health information systems mentioned above, particularly the increase in license revenue which is highly margined.                                         16            Selling, general and administrative expenses were $4.6 million in 1997, a decrease of 38% from the $7.5 million in 1996. During 1996, Netsmart incurred a non cash expense of $3.5 million arising out of the issuance by Netsmart of warrants and options having exercise prices which were less than market value and $1.7 million from the issuance of 500,000 common shares to certain note holders and 25,000 common shares to Netsmart's asset based lender. During 1997, Netsmart incurred a non cash expense of $300,000 from the issuance of 80,000 common shares for the purchase of certain assets, including the customer list, of a competitor. During 1997 Netsmart wrote down, to net realizable value, substantially all of the assets associated with its SmartCard division, consisting of accounts receivable, costs and estimated profits in excess of interim billings, computer equipment, capitalized software and its investment in a joint venture, resulting in a charge to income in the amount of $1.5 million. During 1997, Netsmart incurred research and development expenses in the amount of $201,000, which were related to Netsmart's health information systems products. In 1996, Netsmart incurred research and development expenses of $278,000, which were related to the IBN Contract and the development of SmartCard products.           Other expense of Netsmart for 1997 and 1996 approximated $287,000 and $264,000, respectively, and consisted primarily of Netsmart's share of its loss in a joint venture.           Interest expense was $308,000 in 1997, a decrease of $165,000, or 35% from the interest expense of $473,000 in 1996. This was the result of a decrease in average borrowings during 1997. The most significant component of interest expense on an ongoing basis is the interest payable to Netsmart's asset-based lender. Netsmart pays interest on such loans at a rate equal to prime plus 8-1/2% plus a fee of 5/8% of the face amount of the invoice.           As a result of the foregoing factors,  Netsmart incurred a net loss of $3.5 million in 1997 as compared with a net loss of $6.6 million in 1996.  Discontinued Operations           The operations of discontinued segments resulted in losses of $2.9 million, $7.1 million and $4.6 million for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The gain (loss) on disposal of segments approximated $6.8 million and ($336,000), respectively for 1998 and 1997. The following tables summarize the components of income and loss from discontinued segments and the gains and losses realized on the disposals.

During 1998, the revenues and net income of the Contract Engineering Services segment decreased significantly due to the                                         17   completion of several projects, delays in starting new projects with large customers in Asia and the segment's continued efforts to trim sales that generate lower margins. During the same period, the operating costs of the segment increased due primarily to investments in information technology marketing efforts. The Contract Engineering Services segment's loss for 1996 included the impact of a loss of one of its largest contracts in January of 1996 and the accrual of a $300,000 reserve in connection with a settlement with the Department of Labor.           The Telecommunications segment's 1998 loss included an accrual of $800,000 for an estimated loss to be incurred from December 1998 until the disposal of the segment is completed and the loss for 1996 included $540,000 for the write-off of impaired goodwill.           The Audio Products Manufacturing segment's 1997 loss includes the operating activity through May 20, 1997, the date of disposal and for 1996 includes a full year's activity.           The Three Dimensional Products and Services segment's 1997 loss included $250,000 for an estimated loss to be incurred from December 1997 until the complete disposal of the segment.           The Medical Diagnostics segment's loss for 1998 included the operating activity through April 2, 1998, the date of disposal. The Medical Diagnostics segment's 1997 loss included the write-off of deferred offering costs of approximately $750,000 from a terminated public offering, $408,000 for settlement payments paid to former limited partners of one of the Medical Diagnostics segment's imaging centers and increased legal and professional fees of approximately $1 million. The increased legal fees resulted principally from litigation that occurred during 1997. Additionally, the 1997 Medical Diagnostics segment's loss included $250,000 for an estimate of losses anticipated to be incurred from December 1997 until April 2, 1998.           The Electro-Mechanical and Electro-Optical Products Manufacturing segment includes Televend and FMX, which did not start operations until 1996. The operations of SpecTec, the holding company of two of the segment's operating entities, is included in the results of operations for all three years reported.           The Business Consulting Services segment's only significant activity was consulting fees charged to Netsmart, Trans Global and SES Holdings. Such consulting fees are eliminated in consolidation and the portions of such consulting fees charged to the other discontinued segments are included in the intercompany transaction line of the above table.  Consolidated Net Loss           As a result of the foregoing, the Company incurred net income (loss) of $4.1 million, ($12.7 million) and ($9.6 million) for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively, and basic and fully diluted net income (loss) per common share of $0.08, ($0.27) and ($0.23) for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.  Year 2000 Issues           Many existing computer programs use only two digits to identify a year in a date field. These programs were designed and developed without considering the impact of the upcoming change in the century. If not corrected, many computer applications could fail or create erroneous results by or at the year 2000. This issue is referred to as the "Year 2000 Issue". All of the computer applications used by the holding companies (i.e. Consolidated and SIS Capital Corp.) are year 2000 compliant. The Company's affiliates have a significant portion of computer software, particularly the software relating to payroll and other employee records, that is managed for the affiliates by an outside service company. Such service company has advised the affiliates that it will be year 2000 compliant. The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential cost to it in addressing the year 2000 Issue with respect to its other software and the potential consequences of an incomplete or untimely resolution of the Year 2000 Issue. Although the Company believes it will not incur significant expenses for its affiliates to become Year 2000 compliant, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur significant cost in addressing the Year 2000 Issue or that the failure to adequately address the Year 2000 Issue will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company.
