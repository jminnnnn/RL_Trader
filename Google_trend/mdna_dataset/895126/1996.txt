ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS         OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW       Chesapeake's revenue, net income, operating cash flow, and production reached record levels in 1996. Increased cash flow from operations, in combination with the issuance of $120 million of 9.125% Senior Notes and the sale of 3 million shares of common stock in April 1996, allowed the Company to fund its net capital expenditures of $344 million. The Company also repaid all amounts outstanding under its $125 million Revolving Credit Facility and currently has $75 million of available bank credit committed under this expanded credit facility.       During fiscal 1996, the Company participated in 148 gross wells (69.0 net), of which 111 were operated by the Company. The Company's proved reserves increased by 183 Bcfe to 425 Bcfe as a result of this drilling and the purchase of proved reserves from Amerada Hess Corporation compared to 60.2 Bcfe of production, resulting in reserve replacement in excess of 300% compared to production.       The Company's business strategy has continued to emphasize the acquisition of large prospective leasehold positions to provide a multi-year inventory of drilling locations. By June 1996, the Company had increased its acreage position to approximately 200,000 gross acres of developed leasehold and approximately 2 million gross acres of undeveloped leasehold. During 1996, the Company continued the expansion of its exploration focus in the Louisiana Austin Chalk Trend and began a significant acreage acquisition program in the Williston Basin. The Company also conducted or participated in 3-D seismic programs in the Lovington area, the Giddings Field, the Knox Field and in the Williston and Arkoma Basin areas to evaluate the Company's acreage inventory.       The following table sets forth certain operating data of the Company for the periods presented:                                                                     YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,                                                            --------------------------------                                                              1996        1995        1994                                                            --------     -------     -------              Net Production Data:       Oil (MBbl).........................................     1,413       1,139         537       Gas (MMcf).........................................    51,710      25,114       6,927       Gas equivalent (MMcfe).............................    60,190      31,947      10,152     Oil and Gas Sales ($ in 000's):       Oil................................................  $ 25,224     $19,784     $ 8,111       Gas................................................    85,625      37,199      14,293                                                            --------     -------     -------               Total oil and gas sales....................  $110,849     $56,983     $22,404                                                            ========     =======     =======     Average Sales Price:       Oil ($ per Bbl)....................................  $  17.85     $ 17.36     $ 15.09       Gas ($ per Mcf)....................................  $   1.66     $  1.48     $  2.06       Gas equivalent ($ per Mcfe)........................  $   1.84     $  1.78     $  2.21     Oil and Gas Costs ($ per Mcfe):       Production expenses and taxes......................  $    .14     $   .13     $   .36       General and administrative.........................  $    .08     $   .11     $   .31       Depreciation, depletion and amortization...........  $    .85     $   .80     $   .80     Net Wells Drilled:       Horizontal wells...................................      42.0        28.5        11.1       Vertical wells.....................................      27.0        23.0         7.9     Net Wells at End of Period...........................     186.2        91.2        57.9   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       General. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1996, the Company realized net income of $23.4 million, or $0.80 per common share, on total revenues of $149.4 million. This compares to net income of $11.7 million, or $0.42 per common share, on total revenues of $67.3 million in 1995, and net income of $3.9 million, or $0.16                                         20    22  per common share, on total revenues of $29.8 million in fiscal 1994. The significantly higher earnings in 1996 as compared to 1995 and 1994 were largely the result of higher production and prices per Mcfe, partially offset by higher oil and gas depreciation, depletion and amortization and higher interest costs.       Oil and Gas Sales. During fiscal 1996, oil and gas sales increased 94% to $110.8 million versus $57.0 million for fiscal 1995 and 395% from the fiscal 1994 amount of $22.4 million. The increase in oil and gas sales resulted primarily from strong growth in production volumes. For fiscal 1996, the Company produced 60.2 Bcfe, at a weighted average price of $1.84 per Mcfe, compared to 31.9 Bcfe produced in fiscal 1995 at a weighted average price of $1.78 per Mcfe, and 10.2 Bcfe produced in fiscal 1994 at a weighted average price of $2.21 per Mcfe. This represents production growth of 89% for fiscal 1996 compared to 1995 and 490% compared to 1994.       These increases in production volumes reflect the Company's successful exploration and development program. The following table shows the Company's production by major field area for fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995:                                                               FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,                                                 -------------------------------------------------                                                          1996                       1995                                                 ----------------------     ----------------------                                                 PRODUCTION                 PRODUCTION                                                  (MMCFE)       PERCENT      (MMCFE)       PERCENT                                                 ----------     -------     ----------     -------            Giddings     -- Navasota River................    28,360          47%        16,881          53%              -- Independence..................    11,601          19%         3,784          12%              -- Other Giddings................     7,205          12%         5,976          19% Oklahoma     -- Knox..........................     3,901           6%         1,255           4%              -- Golden Trend..................     2,758           5%         1,880           6%              -- Sholem Alechem................     2,010           3%           749           2% All Other Fields..............................     4,355           8%         1,422           4%                                                   ------         ----        ------         ----           Total Production....................    60,190         100%        31,947         100%                                                   ======         ====        ======         ====        The Company's gas production represented approximately 86% of the Company's total production volume on an equivalent basis in fiscal 1996. This is compared to 79% in fiscal 1995 and 68% in 1994. This is a result of the Company's drilling in deeper, more gas-prone areas of the Giddings and Knox Fields.       For fiscal 1996, the Company realized an average price per barrel of oil of $17.85, compared to $17.36 in fiscal 1995 and $15.09 in fiscal 1994. The Company markets its oil on monthly average equivalent spot price contracts and typically receives a premium to the price posted for West Texas intermediate crude oil. The Company realized $0.9 million less in oil revenues than it would have received from unhedged market prices in fiscal 1996.       Gas price realizations increased from fiscal 1995 to 1996 by approximately 12%, despite lower gas revenue realized by the Company during the fourth fiscal quarter of 1996 as a result of the hedging activity. As a result of hedging, the Company had gas revenues during that period that were approximately $5.1 million less than unhedged market prices. Although gas prices generally increased during 1996, the weighted average realization per Mcf in 1996 was still 19% less than 1994. The lower prices realized in 1995 were the result of lower natural gas prices, and the fact that an increased portion of the Company's gas production was from areas that contain leaner gas that is either not processed for liquids or contains less energy value (Btu's) per Mcf. The Company anticipates gas production in Louisiana will receive premium prices at least equivalent to Henry Hub indexes due to the high Btu content and favorable market location of the production.       Gas Marketing Sales. In December 1995, the Company entered into the gas marketing business by acquiring all of the outstanding stock of an Oklahoma City-based natural gas marketing company for total consideration of $725,000. This subsidiary provides natural gas marketing services including commodity price structuring, contract administration and nomination services for the Company, its partners and other natural gas producers in the geographical areas in which the Company is active.                                         21    23       As a result of this purchase, the Company realized $28.4 million in gas marketing sales for third parties in fiscal 1996, with corresponding costs of gas marketing sales of $27.5, resulting in a gross margin of $0.9 million. There were no gas marketing activities in 1995 or 1994.       Oil and Gas Service Operations. Revenues from oil and gas service operations were $6.3 million in fiscal 1996, down 28% from $8.8 million in fiscal 1995, and down 2% from $6.4 million in 1994. The related costs and expenses of these operations were $4.9 million, $7.7 million and $5.2 million for the three years ended June 30, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. The gross profit margin of 22% in fiscal 1996 was up from the 12% margin in fiscal 1995, and up slightly from the 19% gross margin in fiscal 1994. The gross profit margin derived from these operations is a function of drilling activities in the period, costs of materials and supplies and the mix of operations between lower margin trucking operations versus higher margin labor oriented service operations.       On June 30, 1996, Peak USA Energy Services, Ltd., a limited partnership ("Peak"), was formed by Peak Oilfield Services Company (a joint venture between Cook Inlet Region, Inc. and Nabors Industries, Inc.) and Chesapeake for the purpose of purchasing the Company's oilfield service assets and providing rig moving, transportation and related site construction services to the Company and the industry. The Company sold its service company assets to Peak for $6.4 million, and simultaneously invested $2.5 million in exchange for a 33.3% partnership interest in Peak. This transaction resulted in recognition of a $1.8 million pre-tax gain during the fourth fiscal quarter of 1996 reported in Interest and Other. A deferred gain from the sale of service company assets of $0.9 million was recorded as a reduction in the Company's investment in Peak and will be amortized to income over the estimated useful lives of the Peak assets. The Company's investment in Peak will be accounted for using the equity method.       Interest and Other. Interest and other income for fiscal 1996 was $3.8 million which compares to $1.5 million in 1995 and $1 million in 1994. During fiscal 1996, the Company realized $3.7 million of interest and other investment income, and a $1.8 million gain related to the sale of certain service company assets, offset by a $1.7 million loss due to natural gas basis changes in April 1996 as a result of the Company's hedging activities. During 1995 and 1994, the Company did not incur any such gains on sale of assets or basis losses.       Production Expenses and Taxes. Production expenses and taxes, which include lifting costs and production and excise taxes, increased to $8.3 million in fiscal 1996, as compared to $4.3 million in fiscal 1995, and $3.6 million in fiscal 1994. These increases on a year-to-year basis were primarily the result of increased production. On an Mcfe production unit basis, production expenses and taxes increased to $0.14 per Mcfe as compared to $0.13 per Mcfe in fiscal 1995 and $0.36 per Mcfe in 1994. Severance tax exemptions for production were available in fiscal 1996 and 1995, and certain of the exemptions in Giddings are applicable for production through 2001 for wells spud prior to September 1, 1996 and on a more limited basis for qualifying wells spud thereafter. The Company expects that operating costs in fiscal 1997 will increase based on the Company's expansion of drilling efforts into the Louisiana Trend and the Williston Basin, because both are oil prone areas which generally have higher operating costs than gas prone areas and because limited severance tax exemptions will be applicable in these areas as compared to existing exemptions in Giddings.       Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas properties for fiscal 1996 was $50.9 million, $25.5 million higher than fiscal 1995's expense of $25.4 million, and $42.8 million higher than fiscal 1994's expense of $8.1 million. The average DD&A rate per Mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, increased to $0.85 in fiscal 1996 compared to $0.80 in fiscal 1995 and 1994. The Company's DD&A rate in the future will be a function of the results of future acquisition, exploration, development and production results, but the Company's rate could trend upward in 1997 based on projected higher finding costs for the Louisiana Trend.       Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization ("D&A") of other assets increased to $3.2 million in fiscal 1996, compared to $1.8 million in fiscal 1995, and $1.9 million in 1994. This increase in fiscal 1996 was caused by an increase in D&A as a result of increased investments in depreciable buildings and equipment, and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of the                                         22    24  Senior Notes in May 1995 and in April 1996. The Company anticipates an increase in D&A in fiscal 1997 as a result of a full year of debt issuance cost amortization on the 9.125% Senior Notes issued in April 1996 and higher building depreciation expense on the Company's corporate offices, offset by a reduction in depreciation expense associated with the sale of the service company assets.       General and Administrative. General and administrative ("G&A") expenses, which are net of capitalized internal payroll and non-payroll expenses (see Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were $4.8 million in fiscal 1996, up 33% from $3.6 million in fiscal 1995, and up from $3.1 million in fiscal 1994. The increases in fiscal 1996 compared to 1995 and 1994 result primarily from increased personnel expenses required by the Company's growth. The Company capitalized $1.7 million of internal costs in fiscal 1996 directly related to the Company's oil and gas exploration and development efforts, as compared to $0.6 million in 1995 and $1.0 million in 1994. The Company anticipates that G&A costs for fiscal 1997 will increase by approximately 25% as a result of the Company's continued growth and increased budgets for exploration and development activities, increasing operations activities, and attendant personnel and overhead requirements.       Interest and Other. Interest and other expense increased to $13.7 million in fiscal 1996 as compared to $6.6 million in 1995 and $2.7 million in fiscal 1994. Interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1996 was approximately $4 million, reflecting the issuance of $120 million of 9.125% Senior Notes in April 1996. In addition to the interest expense reported, the Company capitalized $6.4 million of interest during fiscal 1996, as compared to $1.6 million capitalized in 1995 and $0.4 million in 1994. Interest expense will increase significantly in fiscal 1997 as compared to 1996 as a result of the 9.125% Senior Notes issued in April 1996.       Income Tax Expense. The Company recorded income tax expense of $12.9 million in fiscal 1996, as compared to $6.3 million in fiscal 1995, and $1.3 million in 1994. All of the income tax expense in 1996 was deferred due to a current year tax net operating loss resulting from the Company's active drilling program. A substantial portion of the Company's drilling costs are currently deductible for income tax purposes. The effective tax rate was approximately 35.5% in fiscal 1996 compared to a tax rate of 35% in 1995 and 24% in 1994. The Company anticipates an effective tax rate of between 36 and 36.5% for fiscal 1997 as a result of Louisiana state taxes and higher activity levels in Louisiana. Based upon the anticipated level of drilling activities in fiscal 1997, the Company anticipates that substantially all of its fiscal 1997 income tax expense will be deferred.       Hedging. Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which the Company pays the hedging partner and below which the Company is paid by the hedging partner, the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor" price to the Company to be paid by the counter-party to the extent the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, and basis protection swaps. Recognized gains and losses on hedge contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction. Results from hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas production.       As of June 30, 1996, the Company had NYMEX-based crude oil swap agreements for 1,000 Bbl per day for July 1, 1996 through August 31, 1996 at an average price of $17.85 per Bbl. The counter-party has the option exercisable monthly for an additional 1,000 Bbl per day for the period July 1, 1996 through December 31, 1996 to cause a swap if the price exceeds an average $17.74 per Bbl. The actual settlements for July and August resulted in a $0.5 million payment to the counter-party. The Company estimates, based on NYMEX prices as of August 30, 1996, that the effect of the September through December hedges would be a $0.4 million payment to the counter-party.       The Company has purchased Houston Ship Channel put options which guarantee the Company an average floor price of $2.21/Mmbtu for 20,000 Mmbtu per day for the period of November 1, 1996 through February 28, 1997. The average cost of these puts was $0.14 per Mmbtu.       As of June 30, 1996, the Company had NYMEX-based natural gas swaps and NYMEX/Houston Ship Channel Basis swaps for the months of July through October, 1996. These transactions resulted in payments to the Company's counter-party of approximately $2 million for the month of July 1996 and $1.5 million for                                         23    25  the month of August 1996. The Company estimates, based on NYMEX prices as of August 30, 1996, that the effect of the September and October hedges would be a $0.2 million payment to the counter-party.       The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments, as defined in SFAS No. 119 "Disclosure About Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments" and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company's objective is to hedge a portion of its exposure to price volatility from producing crude oil and natural gas. These arrangements may expose the Company to credit risk to its counter-parties and to basis risk.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  FINANCING ACTIVITIES       On April 9, 1996 the Company completed a public offering of 2,475,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $35.33 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $82.1 million. On April 12, 1996, the underwriters exercised an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 519,750 shares of Common Stock at a price of $35.33 per share, resulting in additional net proceeds to the Company of approximately $17.3 million.       On April 9, 1996 the Company also concluded the sale of $120 million of 9.125% Senior Notes due 2006 (the "9.125% Senior Notes"), which offering resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $116 million. The 9.125% Senior Notes were issued at 99.931% of par. Approximately $44 million of the proceeds of these offerings was used to retire all amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility. The Company may, at its option, redeem prior to April 15, 1999 up to $42 million principal amount of the 9.125% Senior Notes at 109.125% of the principal amount thereof from the proceeds of any equity offering. The 9.125% Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time at the redemption or make-whole prices set forth in the Indenture.       In fiscal 1995, cash flows from financing activities were $97.3 million, largely as the result of issuance of $90 million of 10.5% Senior Notes due 2002 (the "10.5% Senior Notes"). The 10.5% Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time on or after June 1, 1999. The Company may also redeem at its option at any time prior to June 1, 1998 up to $30 million of the 10.5% Senior Notes with the proceeds of an equity offering at 110% of the principal amount thereof.       In fiscal 1994, the Company received proceeds from long term borrowings of $48.8 million, primarily from the issuance of $47.5 million of 12% Senior Notes due 2001 (the "12% Senior Notes") and warrants to purchase 2,190,937 shares of the Company's Common Stock at an aggregate exercise price of $4,870. The 12% Senior Note Indenture provides for mandatory redemption of $11.9 million on each of March 1, 1998, 1999 and 2000. The 12% Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time on or after March 1, 1998.       All of the Company's subsidiaries except Chesapeake Gas Development Corporation ("CGDC") and Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. ("CEMI") have fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis all three issues of Senior Notes, and the securities of the guaranteeing subsidiaries have been pledged to secure obligations under the 12% Senior Notes. See Note 2 of Notes to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. The Senior Note Indentures contain certain covenants, including covenants limiting the Company and the guaranteeing subsidiaries with respect to asset sales, restricted payments, the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the issuance of preferred stock, liens, sale and leaseback transactions, lines of business, dividend and other payment restrictions affecting guaranteeing subsidiaries, mergers or consolidations, and transactions with affiliates. The Company is obligated to repurchase the Senior Notes in the event of a change of control, the sale of certain assets or failure to maintain a specified ratio of assets to debt.  FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY AND LIQUIDITY       The Company had working capital of approximately $0.3 million at June 30, 1996. Additionally, the Company has unused revolving credit facility commitments that have been increased to $75 million. The total                                         24    26  facility size has been set at $125 million. This facility provides for interest at the Union Bank reference rate (8.25% at June 30, 1996), or at the option of the Company the Eurodollar rate plus 1.375% to 1.875%, depending on the ratio of the amount outstanding to the borrowing base. Although the Senior Note Indentures contain various restrictions on additional indebtedness, based on asset values as of June 30, 1996 the Company estimates it could borrow up to $106 million within these restrictions.       The Company also maintains a limited recourse bank facility with an amount outstanding of $12.9 million as of June 30, 1996 secured by producing oil and gas properties owned by the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary CGDC. This facility provides for interest at the Union Bank reference rate (8.25% at June 30, 1996). The facility has not been guaranteed by the Company or any of its other subsidiaries and is recourse only to the assets of CGDC. CGDC used proceeds borrowed under this facility to acquire producing oil and gas properties from Chesapeake Exploration Limited Partnership. The terms of the facility prohibit the payment of dividends by CGDC.       Debt ratings for the Senior Notes are Ba3 by Moody's Investors Service and B+ by Standard & Poors Corporation. Both Moody's and S&P upgraded their ratings during the year. The Company's long-term debt represented 60% of total capital at June 30, 1996. The Company's goal is to achieve an equity to capital ratio of at least 50% and a further increase in its credit ratings during fiscal 1997.  OPERATING CASH FLOWS       Cash provided by operating activities was $121 million in fiscal 1996, as compared to $54.7 million in 1995, and $19.4 million in 1994. Operating cash flows for 1996 include enhanced earnings primarily as a result of increased oil and gas production. Other major factors affecting cash flows for 1996, 1995 and 1994 were increases in non-cash charges and cash flows provided by changes in the components of assets and liabilities. Cash provided by operating activities is expected to be the primary source for meeting forecasted cash requirements in 1997.  INVESTING CASH FLOWS       Significantly higher cash was used in fiscal 1996 for development, exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties as compared to fiscal 1995 and 1994. Approximately $336 million was expended by the Company in 1996 (net of proceeds from sale of leasehold and equipment, and from providing certain oilfield services), as compared to $106 million in 1995, an increase of $230 million, or approximately 216%. In fiscal 1994 the Company expended $27 million (net of proceeds from sale of leasehold, equipment and other) for development and exploration activities. Net cash proceeds received by the Company for sales of oil and gas equipment, leasehold and other services decreased to approximately $11 million in fiscal 1996 as compared to $15 million in 1995. In fiscal 1996, other property and equipment additions were $8.8 million primarily as a result of the purchase of additional office buildings in Oklahoma City.       The Company's capital spending is largely discretionary. The Company has established a fiscal 1997 capital expenditure budget of approximately $300 million, of which $80 million is budgeted to fund drilling and completion requirements for the development of a portion of its proved undeveloped reserves during fiscal 1997. The Company expects to spend approximately $155 million for drilling and completion of non-proved reserves, $10 million for seismic programs, $42 million for acreage acquisition and $13 million for other corporate purposes. Absent a significant increase in the Company's drilling schedule, the Company's internally generated cash flow, existing cash resources and credit facilities should be sufficient to fund its operating activities, budgeted capital expenditures, and its debt service obligations in fiscal 1997. However, the Company may seek additional capital in fiscal 1997 to expand its exploration and development activities or reduce outstanding long-term debt. The discretionary nature of nearly all of the Company's capital spending permits the Company to make adjustments to its budget based upon factors such as oil and gas pricing, exploration and development drilling results, and the continued availability of internally generated or external capital resources.                                         25    27  FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS       The information contained in this Form 10-K includes certain forward-looking statements.
