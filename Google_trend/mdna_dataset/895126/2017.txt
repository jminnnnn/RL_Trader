Business Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “Chesapeake”, the “Company”, “us”, “we” and “our” in this report are to Chesapeake Energy Corporation together with its subsidiaries. Our principal executive offices are located at 6100 North Western Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73118, and our main telephone number at that location is (405) 848-8000. Definitions of oil and gas industry terms appearing in this report can be found under  Glossary of Oil and Gas Terms  beginning on page 18. Our Business  We own interests in approximately 22,700 oil and natural gas wells and produced an average of approximately 575 mboe per day in the 2016 fourth quarter, net to our interest. We have a large and geographically diverse resource base of onshore U.S. unconventional natural gas and liquids assets. We have leading positions in the liquids-rich resource plays of the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, the Utica Shale in Ohio, the Anadarko Basin in northwestern Oklahoma and the stacked pay in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. Our natural gas resource plays are the Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana and East Texas and the Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania. We also own an oil and natural gas marketing business. The Company's estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016, were  1.708 bboe ,  an increase  of  204 mmboe  or  14% , from  1.504 bboe  as of December 31, 2015. The increase in estimated proved reserves included  70 mmboe  of downward revisions resulting primarily from lower average oil and natural gas prices offset by 580 mmboe of extensions and discoveries and  113 mmboe  of upward revisions resulting from changes to previous estimates as further discussed below in  Oil,   Natural Gas and NGL Reserves  and in  Supplemental Disclosures About Oil, Natural Gas and NGL Producing Activities  included in Item 9A,  Controls and Procedures . We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the near future. In July 2015, our Board of Directors determined to eliminate quarterly cash dividends on our common stock. Accordingly, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain any earnings for the future operation and development of our business, including exploration, development and acquisition activities. Any future dividend payments will require approval by the Board of Directors. In addition, dividends may be restricted by the terms of our debt agreements. Additionally, our Board of Directors may determine to suspend dividend payments on our preferred stock in the future. If we fail to pay dividends on our preferred stock with respect to six or more quarterly periods (whether or not consecutive), the holders of our preferred stock, voting as a single class, will be entitled at the next regular or special meeting of shareholders to elect two additional directors of the Company. As of December 31, 2016, we had previously failed to pay dividends on our outstanding preferred stock with respect to four quarterly periods. Certain anti-takeover provisions may affect your rights as a shareholder. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to set the terms of and issue preferred stock without shareholder approval. Our Board of Directors could use the preferred stock as a means to delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a shareholder might consider to be in our best interest. In addition, our revolving credit facility and term loan facility contain terms that may restrict our ability to enter into change of control transactions, including requirements to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility and to offer to purchase our term loan on a change in control. These provisions, along with specified provisions of the Oklahoma General Corporation Act and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, may discourage or impede transactions involving actual or potential changes in our control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our common stock. ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments Not applicable. ITEM 2. Properties Information regarding our properties is included in Item 1 and in the Supplementary Information included in ITEM 3.  Legal Proceedings Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings  The Company is involved in a number of litigation and regulatory proceedings (including those described below). Many of these proceedings are in early stages, and many of them seek or may seek damages and penalties, the amount of which is currently indeterminate. See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for information regarding our estimation and provision for potential losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings. 2016 Shareholder Litigation . On April 19, 2016, a shareholder lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and current and former directors and officers of the Company alleging, among other things, violation of and conspiracy to violate the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, breach of fiduciary duties, waste of corporate assets, gross mismanagement and violations of Sections 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act related to actions allegedly taken by such persons since 2008. The lawsuit sought to assert derivative and direct claims, certification as a class action, damages, attorneys’ fees and other costs. The District Court dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims on August 30, 2016. Regulatory and Related Proceedings.  The Company has received, from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and certain state governmental agencies and authorities, subpoenas and demands for documents, information and testimony in connection with investigations into possible violations of federal and state antitrust laws relating to our purchase and lease of oil and natural gas rights in various states. The Company also has received DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state subpoenas seeking information on the Company’s royalty payment practices. Chesapeake has engaged in discussions with the DOJ, U.S. Postal Service and state agency representatives and continues to respond to such subpoenas and demands. In addition, the Company received a DOJ subpoena and a voluntary document request from the SEC seeking information on our accounting methodology for the acquisition and classification of oil and natural gas properties and related matters. Chesapeake has engaged in discussions with the DOJ and SEC about these matters. On October 4, 2016, a securities class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against the Company and certain current directors and officers of the Company alleging, among other things, violations of federal securities laws for purported misstatements in the Company’s SEC filings and other public disclosures regarding the Company’s accounting for the acquisition and classification of oil and natural gas properties. The lawsuit seeks certification as a class action, damages, attorneys’ fees and other costs. Redemption of 2019 Notes.  See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in ITEM 6.   Selected Financial Data The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data of Chesapeake as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The data are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements, revised to reflect the reclassification discussed below. Beginning in the 2016 first quarter, we have reclassified our presentation of debt issuance costs related to term debt to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the associated debt liability. The table below should be read in conjunction with  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and our consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing in items: (i) settlements and accruals for settlements of undesignated derivatives related to current period production revenues, (ii) prior period settlements for option premiums and for early-terminated derivatives originally scheduled to settle against current period production revenues, and (iii) gains (losses) related to de-designated cash flow hedges originally designated to settle against current period production revenues. Unrealized gains (losses) include the change in fair value of open derivatives scheduled to settle against future period production revenues (including current period settlements for option premiums and early terminated derivatives) offset by amounts reclassified as realized gains (losses) during the period. (c) Includes revenue and operating costs. See  Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets  under  Results of Operations  for details of the depreciation and amortization associated with our marketing, gathering and compression segment. (d) For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded unrealized losses of  $297 million  and unrealized gains of  $296 million , respectively, on the fair value of our supply contract derivative. Additionally, in 2016, we sold the long-term natural gas supply contract to a third party for cash proceeds of  $146 million . See Note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for discussion related to this instrument. (e) Excludes restructuring and other termination costs. (f) Includes the effects of realized (gains) losses from interest rate derivatives, excludes the effects of unrealized (gains) losses from interest rate derivatives and is shown net of amounts capitalized.  (g) Realized (gains) losses include interest rate derivative settlements related to current period interest and the effect of (gains) losses on early-terminated trades. Settlements of early-terminated trades are reflected in realized (gains) losses over the original life of the hedged Item 8 of this report for further discussion of divestitures of oil and natural gas assets, investments and other assets, respectively.     Years Ended December 31,     2016   2015   2014     ($ in millions) Cash provided by (used in) operating activities   $ (204 )   $ 1,234   $ 4,634 Proceeds from issuance of term loan   1,476   —   — Proceeds from long-term debt, net   2,210   —   2,966 Proceeds from oilfield services long-term debt, net   —   —   888 Divestitures of proved and unproved properties   1,406   189   5,813 Sales of other property and equipment   131   89   1,003 Proceeds from sales of investments   —   —   239 Other   —   52   37 Total sources of cash and cash equivalents   $ 5,019   $ 1,564   $ 15,580 Cash used in operating activities was  $204 million  in  2016  compared to cash provided by operating activities of  $1.234 billion  in  2015  and  $4.634 billion  in 2014. The decrease is primarily the result of lower realized prices for the oil and natural gas we sold in addition to lower volumes of oil, natural gas and NGL sold, partially offset by decreases in certain of our operating expenses. Changes in cash flow from operations are largely due to the same factors that affect our net income, excluding various non-cash items such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, impairments, gains or losses on sales of fixed assets, deferred income taxes and mark-to-market changes in our derivative instruments. See further discussion below under  Results of Operations . The following table reflects the proceeds received from issuances of debt in 2016, 2015 and 2014. See Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion.      Years Ended December 31,     2016   2015   2014     Principal Amount  of Debt  Issued   Net  Proceeds   Principal Amount  of Debt  Issued   Net  Proceeds   Principal Amount  of Debt  Issued   Net  Proceeds     ($ in millions) Convertible senior notes   $ 1,250   $ 1,235   $ —   $ —   $ —   $ — Senior notes (a)   1,000   975   —   —   3,500   3,460 Term loans (a)   1,500   1,476   —   —   400   394 Total   $ 3,750   $ 3,686   $ —   $ —   $ 3,900   $ 3,854 ___________________________________________ (a) Our 2015 debt exchange of certain outstanding unsecured senior notes and contingent notes for Second Lien Notes did not result in any additional debt issued or proceeds received. The 2014 amounts include debt issued in connection with the spin-off of our oilfield services business. All deferred charges and debt balances related to the spin-off were removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2014. See Note 13 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for further discussion of the spin-off. Under our revolving credit facilities, we borrowed and repaid  $5.146 billion  in 2016, we had no borrowings or repayments in 2015 and we borrowed  $7.406 billion  and repaid  $7.788 billion  in 2014. Uses of Funds The following table presents the uses of our cash and cash equivalents for  2016 ,  2015  and 2014:       Years Ended December 31,     2016   2015   2014     ($ in millions) Oil and Natural Gas Expenditures:             Drilling and completion costs (a)   $ 1,276   $ 3,083   $ 4,495 Acquisitions of proved and unproved properties   571   135   793 Interest capitalized on unproved leasehold   236   410   604 Total oil and natural gas expenditures   2,083   3,628   5,892               Other Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents:             Cash paid to repurchase debt   2,734   508   3,362 Cash paid for title defects   69   —   — Cash paid to repurchase noncontrolling interest of CHK C-T (b)   —   143   — Cash paid to purchase leased rigs and compressors   —   —   499 Cash paid to repurchase CHK Utica preferred shares (b)   —   —   1,254 Cash paid on financing derivatives (c)   —   —   53 Payments on credit facility borrowings, net   —   —   382 Additions to other property and equipment   37   143   227 Dividends paid   —   289   405 Distributions to noncontrolling interest owners   10   85   173 Additions to investments   —   1   — Other   29   50   62 Total other uses of cash and cash equivalents   2,879   1,219   6,417 Total uses of cash and cash equivalents   $ 4,962   $ 4,847   $ 12,309 ___________________________________________ (a) Net of  $51 million  and  $679 million  in drilling and completion carries received from our joint venture partners during 2015 and 2014, respectively. (b) See Note 8 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report and certain other sales of collateral since the date of the most recent amendment, our borrowing base was reduced to  $3.8 billion  in October 2016. See Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for discussion related to these instruments. (g) As of  December 31, 2016 , current maturities of long-term debt, net includes our 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due January 2017, 6.5% Senior Notes due 2017 and our 2037 Notes. As discussed in footnote (b) above and in Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, the holders of our 2037 Notes could exercise their individual demand repurchase rights on  May 15, 2017 , which would require us to repurchase all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes. As of  December 31, 2016 , there was  $2 million  of discount associated with the equity component of the 2037 Notes. For further discussion and details regarding our senior notes and convertible senior notes, see Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report. Credit Risk Derivative instruments that enable us to manage our exposure to oil, natural gas and NGL prices, as well as to foreign currency volatility, expose us to credit risk from our counterparties. To mitigate this risk, we enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are rated investment grade and deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers, and we attempt to limit our exposure to non-performance by any single counterparty. As of  December 31, 2016 , our oil, natural gas, NGL and cross currency derivative instruments were spread among  12  counterparties. Additionally, the counterparties under our commodity hedging arrangements are required to secure their obligations in excess of defined thresholds. Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil, natural gas and NGL ( $840 million  as of  December 31, 2016 ) and exploration and production companies that own interests in properties we operate ( $156 million  as of  December 31, 2016 ). This industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties that are judged to have sub-standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. During  2016 ,  2015  and 2014, we recognized $10 million, $4 million and $2 million, respectively, of bad debt expense related to potentially uncollectible receivables. Additionally, during 2015, we recorded $22 million of impairment of a note receivable related to a previous asset sale as a result of the increased credit risk associated with declining commodity prices. Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements From time to time, we enter into arrangements and transactions that can give rise to contractual obligations and off-balance sheet commitments. As of  December 31, 2016 , these arrangements and transactions included (i) operating lease agreements, (ii) volumetric production payments (VPPs) (to purchase production and pay related production expenses and taxes in the future), (iii) open purchase commitments, (iv) open delivery commitments, (v) open drilling commitments, (vi) undrawn letters of credit, (vii) open gathering and transportation commitments, and (viii) various other commitments we enter into in the ordinary course of business which could result in a future cash obligation. See Notes 4 and 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a description of our operating lease obligations. (c) See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a description of gathering, processing and transportation agreements, drilling contracts and pressure pumping contracts. (d) See Note 6 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a description of unrecognized tax benefits. (e)   This table does not include derivative liabilities or the estimated discounted liability for future dismantlement, abandonment and restoration costs of oil and natural gas properties. See Notes 11 and 20, respectively, of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for more information on our derivatives and asset retirement obligations. This table also does not include our costs to produce reserves attributable to non-expense-bearing royalty and other interests in our properties, including VPPs, which are discussed below. As the operator of the properties from which VPP volumes have been sold, we bear the cost of producing the reserves attributable to these interests, which we include as a component of production expenses and production taxes in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods these costs are incurred. As with all non-expense-bearing royalty interests, volumes conveyed in a VPP transaction are excluded from our estimated proved reserves; however, the estimated production expenses and taxes associated with VPP volumes expected to be delivered in future periods are included as a reduction of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves for purposes of determining our full cost ceiling test for impairment purposes and in determining our standardized measure. The amount of VPP-related production expenses and taxes, based on cost levels as of December 31, 2016, pursuant to SEC reporting requirements, was estimated to be approximately $19 million for the next twelve months and $76 million over the remaining life on an undiscounted basis, or approximately $18 million and $67 million, respectively, on a discounted basis using an annual discount rate of 10%. Our commitment to bear the costs on any future production of VPP volumes is not reflected as a liability on our balance sheet. The costs that will apply in the future will depend on the actual production volumes as well as the production costs and taxes in effect during the periods in which production actually occurs, which could differ materially from our current and historical costs, and production may not occur at the times or in the quantities projected, or at all. We have committed to purchase natural gas and liquids produced that are associated with our VPP transactions. Production purchased under these arrangements is based on market prices at the time of production, and the purchased natural gas and liquids are resold at market prices. See Notes 4 and 12 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  contains a description of each of these instruments and gains and losses on oil, natural gas and NGL derivatives during 2016, 2015 and 2014. Although derivatives often fail to achieve 100% effectiveness for accounting purposes, we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives. Our commodity derivative activities allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged production. We closely monitor the fair value of our derivative contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or minimize a loss. Commodity markets are volatile and Chesapeake's derivative activities are dynamic. Mark-to-market positions under commodity derivative contracts fluctuate with commodity prices. As described under  Hedging Arrangements  in Note 11 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, the counterparties’ and our obligation under certain of the bilateral hedging agreements must be secured by cash or letters of credit to the extent that any mark-to-market amounts owed to us or by us exceed defined thresholds. In 2016, certain of our counterparties that are also lenders under our revolving credit facility entered into derivative contracts to be secured by the same collateral that secures the revolving credit facility. This will allow us to reduce any letters of credit posted as security with those counterparties.  The estimated fair values of our oil, natural gas and NGL derivative contracts as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are provided below. See Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  for additional information concerning the fair value of our oil and natural gas derivative instruments.      December 31,     2016   2015     ($ in millions) Derivative assets (liabilities):         Oil fixed-price swaps   $ (140 )   $ 144 Oil call options   (1 )   (7 ) Natural gas fixed-price swaps   (349 )   229 Natural gas collars   (9 )   — Natural gas call options   —   (99 ) Natural gas basis protection swaps   (5 )   — NGL fixed-price swaps   —   — Estimated fair value   $ (504 )   $ 267 Changes in the fair value of oil and natural gas derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged commodities, and locked-in gains and losses of settled designated derivative contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and are transferred to earnings in the month of related production. As of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, accumulated other comprehensive income included unrealized losses, net of related tax effects, totaling  $97 million , $113 million and $136 million, respectively, associated with commodity derivative contracts. Based upon the market prices at December 31, 2016, we expect to transfer approximately  $22 million  of net loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income to net income (loss) during the next 12 months. A detailed explanation of accounting for oil, natural gas and NGL derivatives appears under  Application of Critical Accounting Policies – Derivatives  elsewhere in this Item 7. Foreign Currency Derivatives On December 6, 2006, we issued €600 million of 6.25% Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017. Concurrent with the issuance of the euro-denominated senior notes, we entered into cross currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes. In May 2011, we purchased and subsequently retired €256 million in aggregate principal amount of these senior notes following a tender offer, and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount. In December 2015, we exchanged and subsequently retired €42 million in aggregate principal amount of these senior notes in the private exchange described above, and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount. During 2016 , in connection with our tender offers, we retired  €56 million  in aggregate principal amount of our  6.25%  Euro-denominated Senior Notes due 2017, and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount at a cost of  $13 million . A detailed explanation of accounting for foreign currency derivatives appears under  Application of Critical Accounting Policies – Derivatives  elsewhere in this Item 8 of this report for further discussion of royalty claims. The 2015 amount includes $25 million related to the April 2015 resolution of litigation we were defending against the state of Michigan and  $339 million  related to litigation involving the early redemption of our 2019 notes. See Note 4 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item. (b) Includes changes in the fair value of open interest rate derivatives offset by amounts reclassified to realized (gains) losses during the period. The 2016 and 2015 decreases in capitalized interest resulted from lower average balances of unproved oil and natural gas properties, the primary asset on which interest is capitalized. The 2016 decrease in interest expense on senior notes is due to the decrease in the average outstanding principal amount of senior notes. The 2016 increase in the amortization of premium associated with troubled debt restructuring is due to a full year of amortization on our second lien notes. See Note 3 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our debt refinancing. Interest expense, excluding unrealized gains or losses on interest rate derivatives and net of amounts capitalized, was  $1.18 per boe  in 2016 compared to  $1.30 per boe  in 2015 and $0.63 per boe in 2014. Losses on Investments.   Losses  on investments were  $8 million ,  $96 million  and $75 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, the losses were primarily related to our equity investment in Sundrop Fuels, Inc. (Sundrop).  Losses  on investments in 2015 and 2014 were primarily related to our equity investments in FTS International, Inc. (FTS) and Sundrop. See Note 14 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our investments. Impairment of Investments . In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized impairments of investments of  $119 million ,  $53 million  and  $5 million , respectively. The 2016 amount consisted of an other-than-temporary impairment of our Sundrop investment. The 2015 amount consisted of an other-than-temporary impairment of our FTS investment due to the extended decrease in the oil and natural gas pricing environment. The 2014 amount related to an other miscellaneous investment. See Note 14 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of income tax expense (benefit). Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.  Chesapeake recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of  $2 million ,  $50 million  and $139 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 2016 amount was attributable to the Chesapeake Granite Wash Trust (the Trust). The 2015 amount was primarily related to dividends paid on preferred stock of our CHK C-T subsidiary. The decrease from 2015 to 2016 is due to the repurchase of all of the preferred shares of CHK C-T from third-party shareholders in August 2015. The 2014 amount included income related to the Trust as well as dividends paid on preferred stock of our CHK C-T and CHK Utica subsidiaries. The decrease from 2014 to 2015 is primarily due to the repurchase of all of the outstanding preferred shares of CHK Utica and CHK C-T from third-party preferred shareholders in July 2014 and August 2015, respectively. See Notes 8 and 15 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item is recognized in earnings as oil, natural gas and NGL sales. Any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in oil, natural gas and NGL sales. For interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in fair value, as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized currently in earnings as interest expense. Differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument, if any, represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense. Hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time. Changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings. See  Derivative Activities  above and Item 8 of this report. Disclosures About Effects of Transactions with Related Parties Our equity method investees are considered related parties.
