ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS  OVERVIEW       Chesapeake's revenue, operating cash flow (exclusive of changes in working capital) and production reached record levels in fiscal 1997. However, significant expenditures for acreage acquisition and drilling costs followed by unfavorable exploration and production results, together with increases in drilling and equipment costs and declines in oil and gas prices as of June 30, 1997, resulted in downward revisions in estimates of the Company's proved oil and gas reserves and the present value of the estimated future net revenues from these reserves. Such excess caused the Company to record a $236 million asset writedown during the fourth quarter of the year and caused the Company to report a net loss of $183 million for the year.       Chesapeake's strategy during fiscal 1997, and particularly in the third and fourth quarters of the year, was to identify the potential of the various areas of the Louisiana Trend by exploratory drilling. In several large areas outside of the Masters Creek portion of the Louisiana Trend, this exploration program was unsuccessful. In these areas significant leasehold and drilling costs were added to the evaluated oil and gas property pool while insignificant quantities of oil and gas reserves were added to the Company's proved reserve base.       During fiscal 1997, the Company participated in 171 gross (107 net) wells, of which 129 wells were operated by the Company. A summary of the Company's drilling activities and capital expenditures by primary operating area is as follows ($ in thousands):                                                                 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES                                      GROSS     NET     ---------------------------------                                      WELLS    WELLS    DRILLING    LEASEHOLD     TOTAL                                      -----    -----    --------    ---------    --------            Louisiana Trend....................    50      28.7    $141,581    $ 81,287     $222,868 Oklahoma...........................    51      31.8      67,689       4,556       72,245 Texas..............................    51      31.7      64,514      41,112      105,626 Other..............................    19      14.8      51,237      13,391       64,628           Total....................   171     107.0    $325,021    $140,346     $465,367        The Company's proved reserves decreased 5% to an estimated 403 Bcfe at June 30, 1997, down 22 Bcfe from 425 Bcfe of estimated proved reserves at June 30, 1996 (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and "Results of Operations -- Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties"). Due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the Company, there can be no assurance that the Company's estimated proved reserves will not decrease in the future.       The Company's business strategy in fiscal 1997 continued to emphasize the acquisition of large prospective leasehold positions which potentially provide a multi-year inventory of drilling locations. As of June 30, 1997, the Company had approximately 277,000 gross acres of developed leasehold and 2.7 million gross acres of undeveloped leasehold. The fiscal 1997 drilling program, particularly in Louisiana, consisted of more exploratory drilling than in previous years. The Company's strategy for fiscal 1998 is to reduce its capital expenditure program to approximately $250-$275 million, concentrate its Louisiana Trend drilling activities in Masters Creek, utilize more 3-D seismic prior to conducting drilling operations, reduce the acquisition of additional unproven leasehold, and selectively acquire proved reserves. This strategy will likely have the effect of reducing the Company's anticipated production growth rate from exploration and development drilling to between 10% and 15% per year.       To assist the Company in reducing exploratory risks and increasing economic returns the Company has increased its use of 3-D seismic. The Company has conducted, participated in, or is actively pursuing more than 25 3-D seismic programs to more fully evaluate the Company's acreage inventory.                                         20    21       The following table sets forth certain operating data of the Company for the periods presented:                                                                       YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,                                                               -----------------------------                                                                 1997       1996      1995                                                               --------   --------   -------        NET PRODUCTION DATA:   Oil (MBbl)................................................     2,770      1,413     1,139   Gas (MMcf)................................................    62,005     51,710    25,114   Gas equivalent (MMcfe)....................................    78,625     60,190    31,947 OIL AND GAS SALES ($ in 000's):   Oil.......................................................  $ 57,974   $ 25,224   $19,784   Gas.......................................................   134,946     85,625    37,199                                                               --------   --------   -------           Total oil and gas sales...........................  $192,920   $110,849   $56,983                                                               ========   ========   ======= AVERAGE SALES PRICE:   Oil ($ per Bbl)...........................................  $  20.93   $  17.85   $ 17.36   Gas ($ per Mcf)...........................................  $   2.18   $   1.66   $  1.48   Gas equivalent ($ per Mcfe)...............................  $   2.45   $   1.84   $  1.78 OIL AND GAS COSTS ($ per Mcfe):   Production expenses and taxes.............................  $    .19   $    .14   $   .13   General and administrative................................  $    .11   $    .08   $   .11   Depreciation, depletion and amortization..................  $   1.31   $    .85   $   .80 NET WELLS DRILLED:   Horizontal wells..........................................      75.7       42.0      28.5   Vertical wells............................................      31.3       27.0      23.0 NET WELLS AT END OF PERIOD..................................     270.1      187.0      96.4        The Company completed an offering of 8,972,000 shares of common stock in December 1996 resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $288.1 million. Additionally, the Company issued $300 million in Senior Notes in March 1997. The Company used the net proceeds from these offerings, along with cash flow from operations, to fund its net capital expenditures of $524 million, repay all amounts outstanding under its commercial bank credit facilities, and retire $47.5 million of Senior Notes.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS       General. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, the Company realized a net loss of $183.4 million, or a loss of $2.79 per common share, on total revenues of $280.3 million. This compares to net income of $23.4 million, or $0.40 per common share, on total revenues of $149.4 million in 1996, and net income of $11.7 million, or $0.21 per common share, on total revenues of $67.3 million in fiscal 1995. The loss in fiscal 1997 as compared to significantly higher earnings in fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995 was largely the result of a $236 million asset writedown recorded in the fourth quarter under the full cost method of accounting. (See "Results of Operations -- Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties").       Oil and Gas Sales. During fiscal 1997, oil and gas sales increased 74% to $192.9 million versus $110.8 million for fiscal 1996 and 238% from the fiscal 1995 amount of $57 million. The increase in oil and gas sales resulted primarily from strong growth in production volumes and significantly higher average oil and gas prices. For fiscal 1997, the Company produced 78.6 Bcfe, at a weighted average price of $2.45 per Mcfe, compared to 60.2 Bcfe produced in fiscal 1996 at a weighted average price of $1.84 per Mcfe, and 31.9 Bcfe produced in fiscal 1995 at a weighted average price of $1.78 per Mcfe. This represents production growth of 31% for fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996 and 146% compared to fiscal 1995.                                         21    22       The following table shows the Company's production by major field area for fiscal 1997 and fiscal 1996:                                                          FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,                                                 ----------------------------------------                                                        1997                  1996                                                 ------------------    ------------------                                                     PRODUCTION            PRODUCTION                                                 ------------------    ------------------                                                 (MMCFE)    PERCENT    (MMCFE)    PERCENT                                                 -------    -------    -------    -------          Texas........................................   47,398        61%     49,347        82% Oklahoma.....................................   17,370        22      10,420        17 Louisiana Trend..............................   12,785        16          69        -- All Other Fields.............................    1,072         1         354         1                                                 ------       ---      ------       --- Total Production.............................   78,625       100%     60,190       100%                                                 ======       ===      ======       ===        The Company's gas production represented approximately 79% of the Company's total production volume on an equivalent basis in fiscal 1997. This compares to 86% in fiscal 1996 and 79% in fiscal 1995. This decrease in gas production as a percentage of total production in fiscal 1997 was the result of drilling in the Louisiana Trend, which tends to produce more oil than gas.       For fiscal 1997, the Company realized an average price per barrel of oil of $20.93, compared to $17.85 in fiscal 1996 and $17.36 in fiscal 1995. The Company markets its oil on monthly average equivalent spot price contracts and typically receives a premium to the price posted for West Texas Intermediate crude oil.       Gas price realizations increased from fiscal 1996 to 1997 from $1.66 per Mcf to $2.18 per Mcf, or 31%, generally as the result of market conditions. Gas prices in fiscal 1995 averaged $1.48 per Mcf. The Company's gas price realizations in fiscal 1997 were also higher due to the increase in Louisiana Trend gas production, which generally receives premium prices at least equivalent to Henry Hub indexes due to the high Btu content and favorable market location of the production.       The Company's hedging activities resulted in decreases in oil and gas revenues of $7.4 million, $5.9 million, and none in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.       Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. In December 1995, the Company entered into the oil and gas marketing business by establishing a subsidiary to provide primarily natural gas marketing services including commodity price structuring, contract administration and nomination services for the Company, its partners and other oil and natural gas producers in the geographical areas in which the Company is active. The Company realized $76.2 million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in fiscal 1997, with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of $75.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of $1.1 million. This compares to sales of $28.4 million, expenses of $27.5 million, and a margin of $0.9 million in fiscal 1996. There were no comparable marketing activities in fiscal 1995.       Oil and Gas Service Operations. On June 30, 1996, Peak USA Energy Services, Ltd., a limited partnership ("Peak"), was formed by Peak Oilfield Services Company (a joint venture between Cook Inlet Region, Inc. and Nabors Industries, Inc.) and Chesapeake for the purpose of purchasing the Company's oilfield service assets and providing rig moving, transportation and related site construction services to the Company and others in the industry. The Company sold its service company assets to Peak for $6.4 million, and simultaneously invested $2.5 million in exchange for a 33.3% partnership interest in Peak. This transaction resulted in recognition of a $1.8 million pre-tax gain during the fourth fiscal quarter of 1996 (reported in Interest and other revenues). A deferred gain from the sale of service company assets of $0.9 million was recorded as a reduction in the Company's investment in Peak and is being amortized to income over the estimated useful lives of the Peak assets. The Company's investment in Peak is accounted for using the equity method, and resulted in $0.5 million of income being included in Interest and other revenues in fiscal 1997.       Revenues from oil and gas service operations were $6.3 million in fiscal 1996, down 28% from $8.8 million in fiscal 1995. The related costs and expenses of these operations were $4.9 million and $7.7 million for the two years ended June 30, 1996 and 1995 respectively. The gross profit margin of 22% in fiscal 1996 was up from the 12% margin in fiscal 1995. The gross profit margin derived from these operations is                                         22    23  a function of drilling activities in the period, costs of materials and supplies and the mix of operations between lower margin trucking operations versus higher margin labor oriented service operations.       Interest and Other. Interest and other revenues for fiscal 1997 were $11.2 million which compares to $3.8 million in fiscal 1996 and $1.5 million in fiscal 1995. During fiscal 1997, the Company realized $8.7 million in interest, $1.6 million of other investment income, $0.5 million from its investment in Peak, and $0.4 million in other income. During fiscal 1996, the Company realized $3.7 million of interest and other investment income, and a $1.8 million gain related to the sale of certain service company assets, offset by a $1.7 million loss due to natural gas basis changes in April 1996 as a result of the Company's hedging activities. During 1995, the Company did not incur any such gains on sale of assets or basis losses.       Production Expenses and Taxes. Production expenses and taxes, which include lifting costs and production and excise taxes, increased to $15.1 million in fiscal 1997, as compared to $8.3 million in fiscal 1996 and $4.3 million in fiscal 1995. These increases on a year-to-year basis were primarily the result of increased production. On an Mcfe production unit basis, production expenses and taxes increased to $0.19 per Mcfe as compared to $0.14 per Mcfe in fiscal 1996 and $0.13 per Mcfe in fiscal 1995. During fiscal 1996 and 1995, a high proportion of the Company's production was from the Giddings Field, much of which qualified for Texas severance tax exemptions. The Company expects that operating costs per Mcfe will continue to increase in fiscal 1998 based on the Company's expected production mix and drilling activities in oil prone areas which generally have higher operating costs than gas prone areas and because a higher percentage of the Company's production will not qualify for severance tax exemptions as compared to the past.       Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. The Company utilizes the full cost method to account for its investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs of acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves (including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenditures, certain capitalized internal costs, dry hole costs and tangible and intangible development costs) are capitalized as incurred. These oil and gas property costs along with the estimated future capital expenditures to develop proved undeveloped reserves are depleted and charged to operations using the unit-of-production method based on the ratio of current production to proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by the Company's independent engineering consultants and Company engineers. Costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the amortization computation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property or whether impairment has occurred. To the extent that capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes, exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and gas properties, such excess costs are charged to operations.       Prior to January 1997, the Company completed operations on one exploratory well in each of three separate areas outside Masters Creek in the Louisiana Trend. Between April 1997 and July 1997, the Company completed operations on ten Company operated exploratory wells located outside Masters Creek in the Louisiana Trend that resulted in the addition of only 0.5 Bcfe of proved reserves. Cumulative well costs on these non-Masters Creek properties were approximately $43 million as of June 30, 1997. Of the 10 wells, one was completed on April 15, 1997, one on May 3, 1997 and eight after June 1, 1997. Based upon this information and similar data which had become available from outside operated properties in these non-Masters Creek areas of the Louisiana Trend in late June 1997, management determined that a significant portion of its leasehold in the Louisiana Trend outside of Masters Creek was impaired. During the quarters ended March 31, 1997 and June 30, 1997 the Company transferred $7.6 million and $86.3 million, respectively, of non-Masters Creek Louisiana Trend leasehold costs to the amortization base of the full cost pool.       Oil and gas prices declined from $20.90 per Bbl and $2.41 per Mcf at June 30, 1996 to $18.38 per Bbl and $2.12 per Mcf at June 30, 1997. Drilling and equipment costs escalated rapidly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 due primarily to higher day-rates for drilling rigs, thus increasing the estimated future capital expenditures to be incurred to develop the Company's proved undeveloped reserves. The oil and gas price declines and the increased costs to drill and equip wells caused the Company to eliminate 35 gross proved undeveloped locations in the Knox Field which contained an estimated 45 net Bcfe of proved undeveloped                                         23    24  reserves. Similar factors combined with unfavorable drilling and production results eliminated approximately 93 Bcfe of proved reserves in the Giddings, and Louisiana Trend areas.       In the Independence area of the Giddings Field of Texas, a single well completed in late March 1997 which the Company had estimated to contain 15.7 Bcfe of Company reserves at March 31, 1997, was significantly and adversely affected by another operator's offset well which damaged the reservoir and reduced the Company's estimated ultimate recovery to 8.0 Bcfe of reserves.       In late June 1997, management reviewed its March 31, 1997 internal estimates of proved reserves and related estimated discounted future net revenues from its proved reserves, and giving effect to fourth quarter 1997 drilling and production results, oil and gas prices, higher drilling and completion costs, and additional leasehold acquisition costs and delay rentals incurred in areas subsequently determined to have less reserve potential than had previously been estimated. After considering all of these factors, management estimated that at June 30, 1997 it would have capitalized costs of oil and gas properties which would exceed its full cost ceiling by approximately $150 million to $200 million and on June 27, 1997, issued a press release which included this estimate. Subsequently, based on the Company's final year-end estimates of its proved reserves and related estimated future net revenues, which took into account additional drilling and production results, management determined that as of June 30, 1997, its capitalized costs exceeded its full cost ceiling by approximately $236 million.       No such writedown was experienced by the Company in fiscal 1996 or fiscal 1995.       Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas properties for fiscal 1997 was $103.3 million, $52.4 million higher than fiscal 1996's expense of $50.9 million, and $77.9 million higher than fiscal 1995's expense of $25.4 million. The expense in fiscal 1997 excluded the effects of the asset writedown. The average DD&A rate per Mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, increased to $1.31 in fiscal 1997 compared to $0.85 in fiscal 1996 and $0.80 in fiscal 1995. The Company's DD&A rate in the future will be a function of the results of future acquisition, exploration, development and production results, but the Company's rate is expected to trend upward in fiscal 1998 based on projected higher finding costs for the Louisiana Trend and higher drilling, completing, and equipping expenses throughout the oil and gas industry.       Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization ("D&A") of other assets increased to $3.8 million in fiscal 1997, compared to $3.2 million in fiscal 1996, and $1.8 million in fiscal 1995. This increase in fiscal 1997 was caused by an increase in D&A as a result of increased investments in depreciable buildings and equipment, and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of Senior Notes in May 1995, April 1996 and March 1997. The Company anticipates an increase in D&A in fiscal 1998 as a result of a full year of debt issuance cost amortization on the Senior Notes issued in March 1997 and higher building depreciation expense on the Company's corporate offices.       General and Administrative. General and administrative ("G&A") expenses, which are net of capitalized internal payroll and non-payroll expenses (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were $8.8 million in fiscal 1997, up 83% from $4.8 million in fiscal 1996, and up from $3.6 million in fiscal 1995. The increases in fiscal 1997 as compared to fiscal 1996 and 1995 result primarily from increased personnel expenses required by the Company's growth and industry wage inflation. The Company capitalized $3.9 million of internal costs in fiscal 1997 directly related to the Company's oil and gas exploration and development efforts, as compared to $1.7 million in 1996 and $0.6 million in 1995. The Company anticipates that G&A costs for fiscal 1998 will continue to increase as the result of wage inflation in the oil and gas industry and legal fees associated with the UPRC and shareholder litigation.       Interest and Other. Interest and other expense increased to $18.6 million in fiscal 1997 as compared to $13.7 million in 1996 and $6.6 million in fiscal 1995. Interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 was $8.7 million, reflecting the issuance of the 7.875% Senior Notes and the 8.5% Senior Notes in March 1997. In addition to the interest expense reported, the Company capitalized $12.9 million of interest during fiscal 1997, as compared to $6.4 million capitalized in fiscal 1996 and $1.6 million in fiscal 1995. Interest expense will                                         24    25  increase significantly in fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997 as a result of the $300 million Senior Notes issued in March 1997 and reduced levels of capitalized interest expected in fiscal 1998.       Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3.6 million for fiscal 1997, before consideration of the $3.8 million tax benefit associated with the extraordinary loss from the early extinguishment of debt, as compared to income tax expense of $12.9 million in 1996 and $6.3 million in 1995. All of the income tax expense in 1996 and 1995 was deferred due to tax net operating losses and carryovers resulting from the Company's drilling program.       The Company's loss before income taxes and extraordinary item of $180.3 million created a tax benefit for financial reporting purposes of $67.7 million. However, due to limitations on the recognition of deferred tax assets, the total tax benefit was reduced to $3.6 million.       At June 30, 1997 the Company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $300 million for regular federal income taxes which will expire in future years beginning in 2007. Management believes that it cannot be demonstrated at this time that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets, comprised primarily of the net operating loss carryforward, will be realizable in future years, and therefore a valuation allowance of $64.1 million has been recorded in fiscal 1997. A deferred tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock options of approximately $4.8 million was allocated directly to additional paid-in capital in 1997, compared to $7.9 million in 1996 and $1.2 million in fiscal 1995.       The Company does not expect to record any net income tax expense in fiscal 1998 based on information available at this time.       Hedging. Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include (1) swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which the Company pays the counterparty and below which the Company is paid by the counterparty, (2) the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor" price below which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, (3) the sale of index-related calls that provide for a "ceiling" price above which the Company pays the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling, and (4) basis protection swaps. Results from hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas production. entered into hedging transactions unrelated to the Company's oil and gas production or physical purchase or sale commitments.       As of June 30, 1997, the Company had the following oil swap arrangements for periods after June 1997:                                                                                NYMEX-INDEX                                                                             STRIKE PRICE                           MONTH                            VOLUME (BBLS)     (PER BBL)                           -----                            -------------    ------------      July 1997................................................      31,000          $ 18.60 August 1997..............................................      31,000          $ 18.43 September 1997...........................................      30,000          $ 18.30 October 1997.............................................      31,000          $ 18.19 November 1997............................................      30,000          $ 18.13 December 1997............................................      31,000          $ 18.08 January through June 1998................................     724,000          $ 19.82        The Company entered into oil swap arrangements to cancel the effect of the swaps for the months of August through December at an average price of $21.07 per Bbl.                                         25    26       As of June 30, 1997, the Company had the following gas swap arrangements for periods after June 1997:                                                                         HOUSTON SHIP CHANNEL                                                                       INDEX STRIKE PRICE                       MONTH                        VOLUME (MMBTU)         (PER BBL)                       -----                        --------------    --------------------      July 1997........................................    1,240,000              $2.313 August 1997......................................    1,240,000              $2.301 September 1997...................................    1,200,000              $2.285 October 1997.....................................    1,240,000              $2.300        The Company had entered into gas swap arrangements to cancel the effect of the swaps for the months of July through October at an average price of $2.133 per MMBtu.       The Company has entered into a curve lock for 4.9 Bcf of gas which allows the Company the option to hedge April 1999 through November 1999 gas based upon a negative $0.285 differential to December 1998 gas any time between the strike date and December 1998.       Gains or losses on the crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are recognized as price adjustments in the month of related production. The Company estimates that had all of the crude oil and natural gas swap agreements in effect for production periods beginning July 1, 1997 terminated on June 30, 1997, based on the closing prices for NYMEX futures contracts as of that date, the Company would have paid the counterparty approximately $185,000, which would have represented the "fair value" at that date. These agreements were not terminated.       Periodically, the Company's oil and gas marketing subsidiary CEMI enters into various hedging transactions designed to hedge against physical purchase commitments made by CEMI. Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded as adjustments to Oil and Gas Marketing Sales in the consolidated statements of operations and are not considered by management to be material.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities (inclusive of changes in components of working capital) decreased to $84.1 million in fiscal 1997, as compared to $121.0 million in fiscal 1996 and $54.7 million in fiscal 1995. The primary reason for the decrease from fiscal 1996 to 1997 was significant changes in the components of current assets and liabilities, specifically $102.8 million of short-term investments at June 30, 1997. Cash provided by operating activities is expected to be a significant source for meeting forecasted cash requirements for fiscal 1998.       Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Significantly higher cash was used in fiscal 1997 for development, exploration and acquisition of oil and gas properties as compared to fiscal 1996 and 1995. Approximately $524 million was expended by the Company in fiscal 1997 (net of proceeds from sale of leasehold, equipment and other), as compared to $344 million in fiscal 1996, an increase of $180 million, or approximately 52%. In fiscal 1995 the Company expended $113 million (net of proceeds from sale of leasehold, equipment and other). Net cash proceeds received by the Company for sales of oil and gas equipment, leasehold and other decreased to approximately $3.1 million in fiscal 1997 as compared to $6.2 million in fiscal 1996 and $12.0 million in fiscal 1995. In fiscal 1997, other property and equipment additions were $34 million primarily as a result of its $16.8 million investment in the Louisiana Chalk Gathering System and Masters Creek Gas Plant as well as the purchase of additional office buildings, improvements and related equipment in Oklahoma City.       Cash Flows from Financing Activities. On December 2, 1996, the Company completed a public offering of 8,972,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $33.63 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $288.1 million. Approximately $55.0 million of the proceeds was used to defease the Company's $47.5 million Senior Notes due 2001, and $11.2 million of the proceeds was used to retire all amounts outstanding under the Company's commercial bank credit facilities.                                         26    27       On March 17, 1997, the Company concluded the sale of $150 million of 7.875% Senior Notes due 2004 (the "7.875% Senior Notes"), and $150 million of 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 (the "8.5% Senior Notes"), which offering resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $292.6 million. The 7.875% Senior Notes were issued at 99.92% of par and the 8.5% Senior Notes were issued at 99.414% of par. The 7.875% Senior Notes and the 8.5% Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time at the redemption or make-whole prices set forth in the respective Indentures. In April 1997 the Company terminated its commercial bank facilities.       In fiscal 1996, cash flows from financing activities were $219.5 million, largely as the result of the issuance of 5,989,500 shares of Common Stock (net proceeds to the Company of approximately $99.4 million) and $120 million of 9.125% Senior Notes due 2006 (the "9.125% Senior Notes"). The Company may, at its option, redeem prior to April 15, 1999 up to $42 million principal amount of the 9.125% Senior Notes at 109.125% of the principal amount thereof from equity offering proceeds. The 9.125% Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time at the redemption or make-whole prices set forth in the Indenture.       Financial Flexibility and Liquidity. The Company had working capital of approximately $151.3 million at June 30, 1997. During fiscal 1997, the Company invested in a number of oil and gas related businesses and projects. The most significant of these was the Company's initial investment made in Bayard, consisting of an $18 million subordinated note and $7 million of common stock. In August 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with Bayard to invest up to an additional $9 million and convert certain options, warrants and note amounts that will facilitate a potential initial public offering by Bayard. On August 27, 1997 Bayard filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of its common stock. Chesapeake, subsequent to the completion of the transaction noted above, will own 4,194,000 shares of Bayard common stock (30.4% of the common stock outstanding) and anticipates selling substantially all of its ownership in Bayard in the IPO (assuming the over-allotment option is exercised) and receiving repayment of the subordinated note. If successful, assuming the sale of all of the Company's Bayard stock, and based on the initial filing price of Bayard at $15 per share, the Company would receive total proceeds of approximately $74 million (net of offering costs) and realize a pre-tax gain of approximately $40 million. No assurance can be given, however, that Bayard will successfully complete the initial public offering of its common stock, at what price, or that the net proceeds or pre-tax gain discussed above will be realized by the Company.       The Company also made investments in Louisiana Trend gas gathering and processing facilities which it may sell during fiscal 1998. These investments include a 50% interest in the Louisiana Austin Chalk Gathering System, and a 15.5% interest in the Masters Creek Gas Plant. If the Company decides to sell these investments, the Company expects that the proceeds should exceed the Company's cost basis of $16.8 million as of June 30, 1997.       The Company currently maintains no commercial bank credit facilities because of its substantial working capital position, anticipated proceeds from the sale of the investments described above, and expected cash flows from operations as compared to the fiscal 1998 capital expenditure budget. Although the Senior Note Indentures contain various restrictions on additional indebtedness, based on asset values as of June 30, 1997, the Company estimates it could borrow up to approximately $100 million of commercial bank debt within these restrictions.       Debt ratings for the Senior Notes are Ba3 by Moody's Investors Service and BB- by Standard & Poors Corporation as of September 30, 1997. The Company's long-term debt represented approximately 64% of total capital at June 30, 1997. There are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the Senior Notes until June 2002. The Company's goal is to achieve an equity to capital ratio of at least 50% and to increase its credit ratings, ultimately achieving an investment grade debt rating.
