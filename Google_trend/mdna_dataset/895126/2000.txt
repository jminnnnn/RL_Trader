In 1999, the Company had net income of $33.3 million, or $0.16 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $354.9 million. This compares to a net loss of $933.9 million, or a loss of $9.97 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $377.9 million during the year ended December 31, 1998 ("1998"), and a net loss of $233.4 million, or a loss of $3.30 per diluted common share, on total revenues of $302.8 million during the year ended December 31, 1997 ("1997"). The loss in 1998 was caused primarily by an $826.0 million oil and gas property writedown recorded under the full-cost method of accounting and a $55.0 million writedown of other assets. The loss in 1997 was caused primarily by a $346 million oil and gas property writedown. See "Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties" and "Impairment of Other Assets".      Oil and Gas Sales. During 1999, oil and gas sales increased to $280.4 million versus $256.9 million in 1998 and $198.4 million in 1997. In 1999, the Company produced 133.5 Bcfe at a weighted average price of $2.10 per Mcfe, compared to 130.3 Bcfe produced in 1998 at a weighted average price of $1.97 per Mcfe, and 80.3 Bcfe produced in 1997 at a weighted average price of $2.47 per Mcfe.      The following table shows the Company's production by region for 1999, 1998 and 1997:                                                      FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,                                  -----------------------------------------------------------------                                         1999                   1998                    1997                                  -------------------    -------------------    -------------------                                   MMCFE     PERCENT      MMCFE     PERCENT      MMCFE     PERCENT                                  --------   --------    --------   --------    --------   --------              Mid-Continent ................     69,946         52%     61,930         48%     17,685         22% Gulf Coast ...................     44,822         34      52,793         40      60,662         76 Canada .......................     11,737          9       7,746          6          --         -- All other areas ..............      6,987          5       7,808          6       1,955          2                                  --------   --------    --------   --------    --------   --------       Total production .......    133,492        100%    130,277        100%     80,302        100%                                  ========   ========    ========   ========    ========   ========       Natural gas production represented approximately 81% of the Company's total production volume on an equivalent basis in 1999, compared to 72% in 1998 and 74% in 1997.                                         -23-    24      For 1999, the Company realized an average price per barrel of oil of $16.01, compared to $12.70 in 1998 and $19.39 in 1997. Gas price realizations fluctuated from an average of $1.92 per Mcf in 1998 and $2.20 in 1997 to $1.97 per Mcf in 1999. The Company's hedging activities resulted in a decrease in oil and gas revenues of $1.7 million in 1999, an increase in oil and gas revenues of $11.3 million in 1998, and a decrease in oil and gas revenues of $4.6 million in 1997.      Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. The Company realized $74.5 million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in 1999, with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of $71.5 million, for a net margin of $3.0 million. This compares to sales of $121.1 million and $104.4 million, expenses of $119.0 million and $103.8 million, and a margin of $2.1 million and $0.6 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively.      Production Expenses and Taxes. Production expenses and taxes, which include lifting costs, production taxes and ad valorem taxes, were $59.6 million in 1999, compared to $59.5 million and $19.3 million in 1998 and 1997, respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses and taxes were $0.45 per Mcfe in 1999 and 1998, and $0.24 per Mcfe in 1997. The Company expects that lease operating expenses per Mcfe will generally remain at current levels throughout 2000, although production taxes will increase as a result of increased oil and gas prices.      Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. The Company utilizes the full-cost method to account for its investment in oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs of acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves (including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs, geological and geophysical expenditures, certain capitalized internal costs, dry hole costs and tangible and intangible development costs) are capitalized as incurred. These oil and gas property costs, along with the estimated future capital expenditures to develop proved undeveloped reserves, are depleted and charged to operations using the unit-of-production method based on the ratio of current production to proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by the Company's independent engineering consultants and Company engineers. Costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the amortization computation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property or whether impairment has occurred. The excess of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation, depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes, over the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and gas properties is charged to operations.      The Company incurred an impairment of oil and gas properties charge of $826 million in 1998. No such charge was incurred in 1999. The 1998 writedown was caused by a combination of several factors, including the acquisitions completed by the Company during 1998, which were accounted for using the purchase method, and the significant decreases in oil and gas prices throughout 1998. Oil and gas prices used to value the Company's proved reserves decreased from $17.62 per Bbl of oil and $2.29 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 1997, to $10.48 per Bbl of oil and $1.68 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 1998. Higher drilling and completion costs and the evaluation of certain leasehold, seismic and other exploration-related costs that were previously unevaluated were the remaining factors which contributed to the writedown in 1998.      The Company incurred an impairment of oil and gas properties charge of $346 million during 1997. The writedown in 1997 was caused by several factors, including declining oil and gas prices during the year, escalating drilling and completion costs, and poor drilling results primarily in Louisiana.      Impairment of Other Assets. The Company incurred a $55 million impairment charge during 1998. Of this amount, $30 million related to the Company's investment in preferred stock of Gothic Energy Corporation, and the remainder was related to certain of the Company's gas processing and transportation assets located in Louisiana. No such charge was recorded in 1999 or 1997.      Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas properties was $95.0 million, $146.6 million and $127.4 million during 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The average DD&A rate per Mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented, was $0.71 ($0.73 in U.S. and $0.52 in Canada), $1.13                                         -24-    25  ($1.17 in U.S. and $0.43 in Canada) and $1.59 (U.S. only) in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Company expects the 2000 DD&A rate to be between $0.75 and $0.80 per Mcfe.      Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization ("D&A") of other assets was $7.8 million in 1999, compared to $8.1 million in 1998 and $4.4 million in 1997. The increase in 1998 compared to 1997 was caused by increased investments in depreciable buildings and equipment and increased amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of senior notes in April 1998.      General and Administrative. General and administrative ("G&A") expenses, which are net of capitalized internal payroll and non-payroll expenses (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were $13.5 million in 1999, $19.9 million in 1998 and $10.9 million in 1997. The decrease in 1999 compared to 1998 was due primarily to various actions taken to lower corporate overhead, including staff reductions and office closings which occurred in late 1998 and early 1999. The increase in 1998 compared to 1997 is due primarily to increased personnel expenses required by the Company's growth and industry wage inflation. The Company capitalized $2.7 million, $5.3 million and $5.3 million of internal costs in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, directly related to the Company's oil and gas exploration and development efforts. The Company anticipates that G&A costs for 2000 per Mcfe will remain at approximately the same level as 1999.      Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income for 1999 was $8.6 million compared to $3.9 million in 1998, and $87.7 million in 1997. The increase from 1998 to 1999 was due primarily to gains on sales of various non-core assets during 1999. During 1997, the Company realized a gain on the sale of its Bayard common stock of $73.8 million, the most significant component of interest and other income.      Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $81.1 million in 1999, compared to $68.2 million in 1998 and $29.8 million in 1997. The increase in 1999 is due primarily to a full year of interest on the Company's $500 million senior notes. The increase in 1998 compared to 1997 was due primarily to the issuance of $500 million of senior notes in April 1998. In addition to the interest expense reported, the Company capitalized $3.5 million of interest during 1999, compared to $6.5 million capitalized in 1998, and $10.4 million capitalized in 1997. The Company anticipates that capitalized interest for 2000 will be between $3 million and $4 million.      Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. The Company recorded income taxes of $1.8 million in 1999 compared to $0 in 1998 and an income tax benefit of $17.9 million in 1997. The income tax expense recorded in 1999 is related entirely to the Company's Canadian operations.      At December 31, 1999, the Company had a U.S. net operating loss carryforward of approximately $613 million for regular federal income taxes which will expire in future years beginning in 2007. Management believes that it cannot be demonstrated at this time that it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets, comprised primarily of the net operating loss carryforwards generated for U.S. purposes, will be realizable in future years, and therefore a valuation allowance of $442 million has been recorded. The Company does not expect to record any net income tax expense related to its U.S. operations in 2000 based on information available at this time.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Years Ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997      Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities (inclusive of changes in working capital) was $145.0 million in 1999, compared to $94.6 million in 1998 and $181.3 million in 1997. The increase of $50.4 million from 1998 to 1999 was due primarily to increased oil and gas revenues. The decrease of $86.7 million from 1997 to 1998 was due primarily to reduced operating income resulting from significant decreases in average oil and gas prices between periods, as well as significant increases in G&A expenses and interest expense.                                         -25-    26      Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities decreased to $159.8 million in 1999, compared to $548.1 million in 1998 and $476.2 million in 1997. During 1999, the Company invested $153.3 million for exploration and development drilling, $49.9 million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties, and received $45.6 million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties. During 1998, $279.9 million was used to acquire certain oil and gas properties and companies with oil and gas reserves. However, the increase in cash used to acquire oil and gas properties was partially offset by reduced expenditures during 1998 for exploratory and developmental drilling. During 1998 and 1997, the Company invested $259.7 million and $471.0 million, respectively, for exploratory and developmental drilling. Also during 1998, the Company sold its 19.9% stake in Pan East Petroleum Corp. to Poco Petroleums, Ltd. for approximately $21.2 million. During 1997 the Company received net proceeds from the sale of its investment in Bayard common stock of approximately $90.4 million.      Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities decreased to $19.0 million in 1999, compared to $363.8 million in 1998, and $278.0 million in 1997. During 1999, the Company made additional borrowings under its commercial bank credit facility of $116.5 million, and had payments under this facility of $98.0 million. During 1998, the Company retired $85 million of debt assumed at the completion of the DLB Oil & Gas, Inc. acquisition, $120 million of debt assumed at the completion of the Hugoton Energy Corporation acquisition, $90 million of senior notes, and $170 million of borrowings made under its commercial bank credit facilities. Also during 1998, the Company issued $500 million in senior notes and $230 million in preferred stock. During 1997, the Company issued $300 million of senior notes.  Financial Flexibility and Liquidity      The Company had working capital of $9.4 million at December 31, 1999 and a cash balance of $38.7 million. The Company has a $50 million revolving bank credit facility which matures in January 2001, with an initial committed borrowing base of $50 million. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had borrowed $43.5 million under this facility. Borrowings under the facility are secured by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at a variable rate, which was 9.75% per annum as of December 31, 1999.      At December 31, 1999, the Company's senior notes represented $919.2 million of its $964.1 million of long-term debt. Debt ratings for the senior notes are B3 by Moody's Investors Service and B by Standard & Poor's Corporation as of March 22, 2000. There are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the senior notes until March 2004, when $150 million is due.      The senior note indentures restrict the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. As of December 31, 1999, the Company estimates that secured commercial bank indebtedness of $147 million could have been incurred within these restrictions. The indenture restrictions do not apply to borrowings incurred by CEMI, an unrestricted subsidiary.      The senior note indentures also limit the Company's ability to make restricted payments (as defined), including the payment of preferred stock dividends, unless certain tests are met. From December 31, 1998 through December 31, 1999, the Company was unable to meet the requirements to incur additional unsecured indebtedness, and consequently was not able to pay cash dividends on its 7% cumulative convertible preferred stock. The Company had accumulated dividends in arrears of $19.3 million related to its preferred stock as of February 29, 2000. Subsequent payments will be subject to the same restrictions and are dependent upon variables that are beyond the Company's ability to predict. This restriction does not affect the Company's ability to borrow under or expand its secured commercial bank facility. If the Company fails to pay dividends for six quarterly periods, the holders of preferred stock will be entitled to elect two new directors to the Board. Based on current projections of cash flow and fixed charges, the Company does not expect to be able to pay a dividend on the preferred stock on May 1, 2000, which would be the sixth consecutive dividend payment date on which dividends have not been paid.      In January and February 2000, the Company engaged in five separate transactions with two institutional investors in which the Company exchanged a total of 8.8 million shares of common stock (both newly issued and treasury shares) for 625,000 shares of its issued and outstanding preferred stock with a liquidation value of $31.3                                         -26-    27  million plus dividends in arrears of $2.9 million. All preferred shares acquired in these transactions were cancelled and retired and will have the status of authorized but unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock.      The Company believes it has adequate resources, including cash on hand, budgeted cash flow from operations and proceeds from miscellaneous asset sales, to fund its capital expenditure budget for exploration and development activities during 2000, which are currently estimated to be approximately $130-$140 million. However, low oil and gas prices or unfavorable drilling results could cause the Company to reduce its drilling program, which is largely discretionary.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS      On June 15, 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("FAS 133"). FAS 133 establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing standards. FAS 133 (as amended by FAS 137) is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000.      FAS 133 standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives (gains and losses) depends on (i) whether the derivative is designated and qualifies as a hedge, and (ii) the type of hedging relationship that exists. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet the hedge accounting criteria in FAS 133 are required to be reported in earnings. In addition, all hedging relationships must be designated, reassessed and documented pursuant to the provisions of FAS 133. The Company has not yet determined the impact that adoption of FAS 133 will have on the financial statements. However, the Company believes that all of its derivative instruments will be designated as hedges in accordance with the relevant accounting criteria, and therefore the impact of the adoption of FAS 133 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS      This Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, statements regarding oil and gas reserve estimates, planned capital expenditures, expected oil and gas production, the Company's financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, expected future expenses, and realization of deferred tax assets, are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expected by the Company, including, without limitation, factors discussed under Risk Factors in Item 1 of this Form 10-K, are substantial indebtedness, impairment of asset value, need to replace reserves, substantial capital requirements, ability to supplement capital resources with asset sales, fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas, uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves, projecting future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures, competition, operating risks, restrictions imposed by lenders, liquidity and capital requirements, the effects of governmental and environmental regulation, pending litigation, and adverse changes in the market for the Company's oil and gas production. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly the result of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof, including, without limitation, changes in the Company's business strategy or planned capital expenditures, or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.                                         -27-    28  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  COMMODITY PRICE RISK      The Company's results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for oil and natural gas production.  HEDGING ACTIVITIES      Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include:      (i)    swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which            the Company pays the counterparty and below which the Company is paid            by the counterparty,      (ii)   the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor" price            below which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by which the            price of the commodity is below the contracted floor,      (iii)  the sale of index-related calls that provide for a "ceiling" price            above which the Company pays the counterparty the amount by which the            price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling, and      (iv)   basis protection swaps, which are arrangements that guarantee the            price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point or            points.      Results from commodity hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas production. The Company only enters into commodity hedging transactions related to the Company's oil and gas production volumes or CEMI's physical purchase or sale commitments. Gains or losses on crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production.      As of December 31, 1999, the Company had the following open natural gas swap arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the Company's domestic gas production for periods after December 1999:                                                             NYMEX-INDEX                                             VOLUME       STRIKE PRICE MONTHS                                      (MMBTU)      (PER MMBTU) - ------                                   ------------    -----------      April 2000...........................       600,000        $ 2.50 May 2000.............................       620,000          2.50 June 2000............................       600,000          2.50 July 2000............................       620,000          2.50 August 2000..........................       620,000          2.50 September 2000.......................       600,000          2.50 October 2000.........................       620,000          2.50       If the swap arrangements listed above had been settled on December 31, 1999, the Company would have incurred a gain of $0.5 million.      As of December 31, 1999, the Company had no open oil swap arrangements.      The Company has also closed transactions designed to hedge a portion of the Company's domestic oil and natural gas production. The net unrecognized losses resulting from these transactions, $3.9 million as of December 31, 1999, will be recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production. These hedging gains and losses are set forth below ($ in thousands):                                                HEDGING GAINS (LOSSES)                                       ----------------------------------- MONTH                                    GAS          OIL         TOTAL - -----                                 ---------    ---------    ---------        January 2000 ......................   $      --    $    (995)   $    (995) February 2000 .....................          --       (1,061)      (1,061) March 2000 ........................         689         (851)        (162) April 2000 ........................          71         (647)        (576) May 2000 ..........................          73         (668)        (595) June 2000 .........................          71         (647)        (576) July 2000 .........................          73         (231)        (158) August 2000 .......................          73           --           73 September 2000 ....................          71           --           71 October 2000 ......................          73           --           73                                       ---------    ---------    ---------                                       $   1,194    $  (5,100)   $  (3,906)                                       =========    =========    =========                                           -28-    29  Subsequent to December 31, 1999, the Company entered into the following natural gas swap arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the Company's domestic gas production for periods after December 1999:                                                                                            NYMEX - INDEX                                                                             VOLUME       STRIKE PRICE MONTHS                                                                      (MMBTU)       (PER MMBTU) - ------                                                                   ------------   ---------------      April 2000........................................................         8,900,000         $2.593 May 2000..........................................................         3,410,000          2.737 June 2000.........................................................         3,300,000          2.737 July 2000.........................................................         3,410,000          2.741 August 2000.......................................................         3,410,000          2.741 September 2000....................................................         2,100,000          2.696 October 2000......................................................         2,170,000          2.696       Subsequent to December 31, 1999, the Company entered into the following crude oil swap arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the Company's domestic crude oil production for periods after December 1999:                                                                                 MONTHLY         NYMEX-INDEX                                                                               VOLUME         STRIKE PRICE MONTHS                                                                        (BBLS)          (PER BBL) - ------                                                                      ---------       ------------      March 2000...............................................................     183,000          $27.512 April 2000...............................................................      89,000           27.251       In addition to commodity hedging transactions related to the Company's oil and gas production, CEMI periodically enters into various hedging transactions designed to hedge against physical purchase and sale commitments made by CEMI. Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas marketing sales in the consolidated statements of operations and are not considered by management to be material.  INTEREST RATE RISK      The Company also utilizes hedging strategies to manage fixed-interest rate exposure. Through the use of a swap arrangement, the Company believes it can benefit from stable or falling interest rates and reduce its current interest expense. During 1999, the Company's interest rate swap resulted in a $2.0 million reduction of interest expense. The terms of the swap agreement are as follows:         Months                      Notional Amount        Fixed Rate    Floating Rate      ------                      ---------------        ----------    -------------             May 1998 - April 2001           $230,000,000            7%       Average of three-month Swiss Franc LIBOR,                                                                       Deutsche Mark and Australian Dollar                                                                       plus 300 basis points       May 2001 - April 2008           $230,000,000            7%       U.S. three-month LIBOR plus 300 basis points   If the floating rate is less than the fixed rate, the counterparty will pay the Company accordingly. If the floating rate exceeds the fixed rate, the Company will pay the counterparty.
