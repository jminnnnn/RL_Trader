ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         NAME="dk1459_argosy_gaming_company_manageme__arg04368">      ARGOSY GAMING COMPANY   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         NAME="dk1459_overview">       Overview             We, through our subsidiaries or joint ventures, own and operate the Alton Belle Casino, in Alton, Illinois; the Argosy Casino in Riverside, Missouri; the Argosy Casino in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the Belle of Sioux City Casino in Sioux City, Iowa; and the Argosy Casino and Hotel in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.         The results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2000 reflect increases in both revenues and operating income at all of our casino properties. This improvement is primarily attributable to the successful execution of our operating strategy, which has been developed with the goal to position us as the premier riverboat casino operator. This strategy includes capitalizing on management's significant experience and expertise in gaming industry operations, continued emphasis on database marketing techniques, and prudently investing in gaming and gaming-related assets for its properties. In addition, 1999 and 2000 revenues were favorably impacted by regulatory changes in three of our markets; dockside gaming in Alton, beginning June 26, 1999, the July 1, 1999 elimination of video poker at many non-casino sites in Baton Rouge, and the advent of open boarding in Kansas City on November 15, 1999. In addition, the results of our Baton Rouge casino were favorably impacted by an elimination of an additional head tax of $2.50 per passenger which ceased on July 29, 1999 when we began construction of a $23 million, 300 room convention hotel at its Baton Rouge property. The hotel opened February 5, 2001.        During 1999, we recorded an extraordinary loss of $24.9 million (net of a $13.5 million tax benefit) related to the early extinguishment of debt. Also, during 1999, we recognized a $10.0 million tax benefit representing prior federal income tax net operating losses.    19        NAME="dk1459_argosy_gaming_company_manageme__arg04864">      ARGOSY GAMING COMPANY   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL   CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (In Thousands)                  Years Ended December 31,             2000     1999     1998       Casino Revenues                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  112,077     $  84,664     $  67,798       Argosy CasinoRiverside        97,049        84,892        71,955       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        70,943        53,262        46,828       Belle of Sioux City Casino        34,801        28,013        22,572       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        344,013        308,316        264,352                              Total     $  658,883     $  559,147     $  473,505                           Net Revenues                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  115,732     $  88,079     $  72,064       Argosy CasinoRiverside        101,791        89,813        76,960       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        72,995        55,110        49,054       Belle of Sioux City Casino        35,814        28,889        23,526       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        367,743        332,235        284,721       Other        769        428        343                              Total     $  694,844     $  594,554     $  506,668                           Income (loss) from Operations(1)                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  32,155     $  23,115     $  13,850       Argosy CasinoRiverside        17,803        12,564        5,369       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        11,947        1,129        (3,381  )    Belle of Sioux City Casino        6,708        4,570        1,919       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        111,991        103,295        87,907       Jazz Enterprises, Inc.(5)        (5,103  )     (5,118  )     (6,312  )    Corporate        (15,516  )     (15,113  )     (9,990  )       Other        (1,629  )     (1,417  )     (1,551  )                           Total(2)     $  158,356     $  123,025     $  87,811                           EBITDA(1)(3)                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  38,016     $  27,388     $  17,835       Argosy CasinoRiverside        23,368        18,252        11,293       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        16,384        6,348        1,891       Belle of Sioux City Casino        8,277        5,838        3,016       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        133,039        123,083        105,674       Lawrenceburg financial advisory fee(4)        (6,652  )     (6,154  )     (5,200  )    Jazz Enterprises, Inc.(5)        (2,385  )     (2,417  )     (3,633  )    Corporate        (15,142  )     (15,082  )     (9,436  )    Other        (455  )     (173  )     (193  )                           Total(2)     $  194,450     $  157,083     $  121,247                             20          (1) Income from operations and EBITDA are presented before consideration of any management fees paid to us, before the Lawrenceburg 42.5% minority interest and before the Sioux City 30% minority interest for the period prior to our July 2000 acquisition of this minority interest.

(3) "EBITDA" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is presented before any management fees paid to Argosy.

EBITDA is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming industry and for companies with a significant amount of depreciation and amortization. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have other significant uses of cash flows, including debt service and capital expenditures, which are not reflected in EBITDA. (4) The Lawrenceburg partnership pays a financial advisory fee equal to 5.0% of its EBITDA to a minority partner.

The western properties (Alton, Riverside, Sioux City and Baton Rouge) reported an aggregate 25.6% increase in casino revenues from $250.8 million to $314.9 million. In particular, Alton casino revenues increased from $84.7 million to $112.1 million. Riverside casino revenues increased from $84.9 million to $97.0 million. Sioux City casino revenues increased from $28.0 million to $34.8 million, and Baton Rouge casino revenues increased from $53.3 million to $70.9 million. Lawrenceburg casino revenues increased $35.7 million, or 11.6% to $344.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $308.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. We experienced increases in both passengers and the average win per passenger for the year ended December 31, 2000 versus the year ended December 31, 1999. Additionally, the increase in revenues was partially attributable to favorable regulatory changes in Illinois, Missouri and Louisiana, as well as expanded capacity at Alton.        Casino expenses increased 14.8% to $287.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $250.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $23.1 million in gaming taxes as a result of the overall increase in casino revenues.         SIZE=2> Admissions Admissions revenues (net of complimentary admissions) were $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, and $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Although the number of admissions increased in Lawrenceburg 1.0% in 2000 over 1999, net admission revenue decreased as more customers were given complimentary admissions.         SIZE=2> Food, Beverage, and Other Food, beverage and other revenues increased from $58.0 million to $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to the overall increase in casino passengers for the year ended December 31, 2000. Food, beverage and other revenues, as a percent of casino revenues, has remained relatively steady at 10.0% in 2000 and 10.4% in 1999. Food, beverage and other net profit improved $3.0 million to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Increases in revenues and net profit came primarily from Alton and Lawrenceburg. Alton increased food and beverage revenues as it reopened one of its restaurants, which was closed during the entire year ended December 31, 1999. Lawrenceburg's increases were primarily due to a slight increase in admissions.        During 2000, the Lawrenceburg Hotel generated $4.0 million in net revenues and $1.5 million of operating profit. The hotel occupancy percentage was 87.0% and the average daily room rate, including promotional allowances, was $88. In 1999, the Lawrenceburg Hotel generated $4.2 million in net revenues and $1.9 million of operating profit. The hotel occupancy percentage was 83.2% and the average daily room rate, including promotional allowances, was $84 during the months the hotel was open. The decrease in hotel net revenues and operating profit reflects an increase in complimentary rooms to our customers.         SIZE=2> Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 15.6% from $117.5 in 1999 to $135.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due primarily to an increase at Lawrenceburg of $2.6 million related to expanded marketing and $5.2 million in additional development payments to the city due to the increased gaming revenues. Marketing expenses increased $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, remaining relatively flat as a percent of casino revenues at approximately 7.0%.         SIZE=2> Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased from $27.9 million in 1999 to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 due primarily to increased vessel operating costs.         SIZE=2> Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased slightly to $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $34.1 million in 1999.    22               Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased $12.3 million to $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in interest expense is attributable to the repayments on the credit facility in 2000, the refinancing completed during 1999 and the use of escrowed funds in June 2000 to redeem the untendered Mortgage Notes, both of which reduced our debt levels and a decrease of interest to a minority partner of $2.2 million.         SIZE=2> Minority Interests Our minority interest expense increased by $5.5 million to $40.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to improved operating results at Lawrenceburg.          SIZE=2> Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to income tax expense of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Prior to 2000, our effective tax rate was impacted favorably due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. For the year ended December 31, 1999, income tax expense was offset by the reversal of a $10.0 million valuation allowance related to prior federal income tax net operating losses.         SIZE=2> Net Income Before Extraordinary Item Net income before extraordinary items was $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to net income before extraordinary items of $36.4 million in 1999 due primarily to the factors discussed above.         SIZE=2> Extraordinary Loss We recorded an extraordinary loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 related to completion of the final phase of the 1999 refinancing. This extraordinary loss is net of a $0.8 million tax benefit. For the year ended December 31, 1999, we recorded an extraordinary loss of $24.9 million, net of a $13.5 million tax benefit, related to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing.         SIZE=2> Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders Net income attributable to common stockholders was $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000 compared to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, due primarily to the factors discussed above.    NAME="dk1459_year_ended_december_31,_1999_c__yea01893">      Year ended December 31, 1999 compared to year ended December 31, 1998              Casino Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999, increased by 18.1% to $559.1 million from $473.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, due in part to a $44.0 million increase in casino revenues at the Lawrenceburg casino, which generated total casino revenues of $308.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Our other properties reported an aggregate 19.9% increase in casino revenues from $209.2 to $250.8 million. This improvement is primarily attributable to the regulatory changes in Illinois, Louisiana and Missouri and to the continued implementation of our operating and marketing strategies. Specifically, Alton casino revenues increased from $67.8 to $84.7 million due in part to dockside gaming effective June 1999; Riverside casino revenues increased from $72.0 to $84.9 million; Sioux City casino revenues increased from $22.6 to $28.0 million and Baton Rouge casino revenues increased from $46.8 to $53.2 million.        Casino expenses increased 13.0% to $250.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $221.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $17.9 million in gaming taxes as a result of the overall increase in casino revenues. Baton Rouge casino expense is net of a $1.6 million decrease in admission taxes due to the elimination of an additional head tax, which commenced when construction began on the Baton Rouge hotel in July 1999.         SIZE=2> Admissions Admissions revenues (net of complimentary admissions) were $7.2 million for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998.         SIZE=2> Food, Beverage, and Other Food, beverage and other revenues increased from $51.1 million to $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase is attributable to the restaurants and the hotel at the Lawrenceburg property being open for the entire year in 1999. Food, beverage and other net profit improved $6.0 million to $16.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Alton,    23          Riverside and Baton Rouge each reported relatively the same food and beverage revenues but decreases in food and beverage expenses. Alton's decrease was due to the closing of one of its restaurants during the entire year ended December 31, 1999 in conjunction with a major renovation. Riverside's and Baton Rouge's decreases were primarily due to the decreased use of food and beverage as promotional items.        The Lawrenceburg hotel contributed $4.2 million in net revenues and $1.9 million of operating profit. The hotel occupancy percentage was 83.2% and the average daily room rate, including promotional allowances, was $84. In 1998, the hotel occupancy percentage was 73.5% and the average daily room rate, including promotional allowances, was $79 during the months the hotel was open.         SIZE=2> Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21.7% to $117.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, due primarily to an increase at Lawrenceburg of $3.9 million related to expanded marketing and $4.5 million in additional development payments to the city due to the increased gaming revenues. Corporate expenses increased due to expenses of $1.8 million related to a severance and settlement arrangement and $3.1 million related to incentive compensation. Marketing expenses increased $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 but remained relatively flat, at approximately 7%, as a percentage of casino revenues.         SIZE=2> Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased from $26.6 million in 1998 to $27.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.         SIZE=2> Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased slightly to $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, from $33.4 million in 1998.         SIZE=2> Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased $8.2 million to $45.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the refinancing completed during 1999 and a decrease of interest to a minority partner of $3.0 million. This decrease, however, was offset by a decrease in capitalized interest of $1.0 million.         SIZE=2> Minority Interests Our minority interest expense increased by $8.8 million to $35.0 million for the year ending December 31, 1999. This increase is primarily attributable to improved income at our Indiana Partnership.         SIZE=2> Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to income tax expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Our effective tax rate has been impacted favorably in 1999 and 1998 due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. Income tax expense was offset by the reversal of a $10.0 million valuation allowance related to prior federal income tax net operating losses that are expected to be utilized in 2000.         SIZE=2> Net Income Before Extraordinary Item Net income before extraordinary items increased to $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $6.6 million in 1998 due primarily to the factors discussed above.         SIZE=2> Extraordinary Loss We recorded an extraordinary loss of $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 related to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with a refinancing. This extraordinary loss is net of a $13.5 million tax benefit.          SIZE=2> Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders Net income attributable to common stockholders was $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 1998, due primarily to the factors discussed above.    24         NAME="dk1459_liquidity_and_capital_resources">      Liquidity and Capital Resources             During 2000, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $158.2 million compared to $126.7 million for 1999. This increase is attributable to the improved operations at each of our five casino locations.        During 2000, we used cash flows for investing activities of $44.0 million versus $37.1 million for 1999. Capital expenditures in 2000 consisted of $13.6 million in maintenance capital, primarily related to slot machine replacements and $19.6 million for expansion projects, including construction of a 300 room hotel in Baton Rouge. During 2000, $9.2 million in cash flows were used to purchase the minority interest in the Sioux City partnership.        During 2000, we used $101.5 million in cash flows for financing activities compared to $132.3 million in cash flows for the same period in 1999. During 2000, $56.4 million in cash flows were used to make repayments on the line of credit. Cash flows in both 2000 and 1999 were used to repay loans related to our Lawrenceburg casino, partner equity distributions related to the Lawrenceburg partnership and for payments on installment contracts and other long term debt. In 1999, we received proceeds of $200 million from the issuance of subordinated notes and $161.8 million from a bank credit facility. During 1999, we also repaid long-term debt of $327.7 million, placed $25.2 million in funds in an escrow to retire the First Mortgage Notes, repaid $58.0 million on the credit facility, used $30.6 million to pay premiums to retire existing debt in connection with our refinancing and used $8.7 million to pay fees in connection with the refinancing.        At December 31, 2000, we had approximately $59.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, including approximately $38.8 million held at the Indiana Partnership. During June 2000, we redeemed the remaining $22.2 million of First Mortgage Notes that were not tendered in the June 1999 refinancing. At December 31, 2000, we had outstanding $200 million of Senior Subordinated Notes, which were issued in June 1999 and are due in June 2009 and $47.4 million on a senior secured revolving credit facility. As of February 13, 2001 availability under the credit facility was approximately $146 million.        We have made a significant investment in property and equipment and plan to make significant additional investments at our existing properties. In 2001, we expect maintenance capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of new gaming product and facility enhancements to be approximately $19.1 million and final expenditures related to the Baton Rouge hotel to be approximately $7.3 million.        Both of our partners in the Indiana partnership have exercised their put rights under the terms of the Lawrenceburg partnership agreement. In December 2000, we reached an agreement with Conseco to purchase its 29% limited partner interest for $260 million, including the repayment of Conseco's preferred equity interest and outstanding partner loans and to settle all pending litigation between us and Conseco. In January 2001, we reached an agreement with Centaur to purchase its 13.5% limited partnership interest for $105 million. We anticipate closing the purchase of the Lawrenceburg casino limited partner interests in one or two separate transactions in the first quarter of 2001 subject to, and promptly following, receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals.        We have also agreed to provide up to $40 million as part of our agreement to develop and operate a proposed casino in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The proposed casino would be owned by the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. Of this $40 million commitment, we have advanced $1 million during 2001 and will advance up to an additional $4 million upon the tribe receiving approval from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs to place the proposed casino property in federal trust. We also have committed to provide a $30 million subordinated note concurrent with, and conditioned upon, the tribe's institutional debt offering that is anticipated to finance the project. In addition, we will provide a $5 million completion guarantee on the construction of the proposed facility. This project and our funding commitment are subject to numerous regulatory approvals.         To provide funding for our purchase of Conseco's and Centaur's limited partnership interests and our Kenosha casino development commitment, we are in the process of amending and restating our    25          existing credit facility to, among other things, increase borrowing availability to $400 million. We believe that cash on hand, operating cash flows, available capacity under our amended and restated credit facility and the net proceeds from our recent $150 million Senior Subordinated Notes offering, will be sufficient to fund the purchase of Conseco's and Centaur's limited partnership interests, our commitment to develop the Kenosha casino and our current operating, capital expenditure and debt service obligations.    NAME="dk1459_market_risk_#151;interest_rate_sensitivity">      Market RiskInterest Rate Sensitivity             The market risk inherent in our financial instruments is the potential loss in fair value arising from adverse changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes as the majority of our indebtedness is financed at fixed rates.         The following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations.             2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     Thereafter     Total     Fair  Value  12/31/00          (dollars in thousands)      Fixed Rate Debt     $  670     $  743     $  825     $  916     $  1,016     $  201,661     $  205,831     $  216,831    Average Interest Rate        10.5  %     10.5  %     10.5  %     10.5  %     10.8  %                             Variable Rate Debt         23,105                           47,400                           70,505         70,505    Average Interest Rate        12.5  %                     8.6  %                                      NAME="dk1459_cautionary_statements_for_purp__cau04838">      Cautionary Statements for Purposes of the "Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995              This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
