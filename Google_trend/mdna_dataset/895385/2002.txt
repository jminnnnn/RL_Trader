ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS         NAME="dg1769_argosy_gaming_company_manageme__arg04368">      ARGOSY GAMING COMPANY   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS   OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS          Overview             We own and operate the Alton Belle Casino in Alton, Illinois; the Argosy Casino in Riverside, Missouri; the Argosy Casino in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the Belle of Sioux City Casino in Sioux City, Iowa; the Argosy Casino and Hotel in Lawrenceburg, Indiana; and the Empress Casino Joliet in Joliet, Illinois.            We acquired the minority interests in our Lawrenceburg, Indiana Casino and Hotel during the first quarter of 2001. Following the acquisition of these minority interests, we now own 100% of all our operations and are no longer required to record minority interest expense. On July 31, 2001, we acquired the Empress Casino Joliet. The results of our operations include the results of Empress Casino Joliet for the five months ended December 31, 2001.    13      NAME="page_dk1769_1_14">       NAME="dk1769_argosy_gaming_company_manageme__arg04864">      ARGOSY GAMING COMPANY   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL   CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   (In Thousands)                  Years Ended December 31,             2001     2000     1999       Casino Revenues                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  121,862     $  112,077     $  84,664       Argosy CasinoRiverside        98,735        97,049        84,892       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        77,164        70,943        53,262       Belle of Sioux City Casino        37,100        34,801        28,013       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        346,432        344,013        308,316       Empress Casino Joliet(1)        102,112                                              Total     $  783,405     $  658,883     $  559,147                           Net Revenues(2)                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  116,869     $  107,490     $  82,039       Argosy CasinoRiverside        94,680        92,889        80,239       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        77,619        66,857        51,638       Belle of Sioux City Casino        36,421        33,710        27,321       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        354,237        348,918        317,986       Empress Casino Joliet(1)        104,507                       Other        417        769        428                              Total(2)     $  784,750     $  650,633     $  559,651                           Income (loss) from Operations(3)                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  34,968     $  32,155     $  23,115       Argosy CasinoRiverside        20,575        17,803        12,564       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        10,280        11,947        1,129       Belle of Sioux City Casino        8,043        6,708        4,570       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        116,649        111,991        103,295       Empress Casino Joliet(1)        26,416                       Jazz Enterprises, Inc.(4)        (4,496  )     (5,103  )     (5,118  )    Corporate(5)        (27,814  )     (22,316  )     (15,113  )       Other        (1,448  )     (1,629  )     (1,417  )                           Total     $  183,173     $  151,556     $  123,025                           EBITDA(3)(6)                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  40,944     $  38,016     $  27,388       Argosy CasinoRiverside        24,671        23,368        18,252       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        16,295        16,384        6,348       Belle of Sioux City Casino        9,626        8,277        5,838       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        132,200        133,039        123,083       Empress Casino Joliet(1)        30,378                       Lawrenceburg financial advisory fee(7)        (927  )     (6,652  )     (6,154  )    Jazz Enterprises, Inc.(4)        (1,946  )     (2,385  )     (2,417  )    Corporate(5)        (20,697  )     (21,942  )     (15,082  )    Other        (55  )     (455  )     (173  )                           Total     $  230,489     $  187,650     $  157,083                               (1) Amounts reflect five months of operations since our purchase of the Empress Casino Joliet on July 31, 2001. In accordance with FASB Statement 142, Accounting for Goodwill and Intangible Assets, no amortization expense has been recorded on the goodwill portion of the purchase price.   14         (2) New accounting guidance, effective beginning with the first quarter 2001, requires that the cost of the cash-back component of our "Argosy Preferred Card" customer loyalty program, including promotional coupons, be treated as a reduction of revenues. These costs had previously been treated as casino and selling, general and administrative expenses. The new guidance impacts only the classification of these costs on our income statement. It does not impact operating profit or EBITDA. The prior years' results have been reclassified to reflect the impact of implementing this new guidance. (3) Income from operations and EBITDA exclude (i) consideration of any management fee paid to us and the 42.5% minority interest in our Lawrenceburg casino for periods prior to our first quarter 2001 acquisitions of these minority interests and (ii) the 30% minority interest in our Sioux City casino for the period prior to our July 2000 acquisition of this interest. (4) Jazz Enterprises, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates the Catfish Town real estate development adjacent to our Baton Rouge casino. (5) The year ended December 31, 2001, includes a $1.9 million pretax charge related to the abandonment of a proposed casino in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The year ended December 31, 2000, includes a $6.8 million pretax charge related to the write-down of the Alton landing facility. (6) "EBITDA" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is presented before any management fees paid to Argosy. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, or net income (as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) as an indicator of our operating performance, or as an alternative to cash flows generated by operating, investing and financing activities (as an indicator of cash flow or a measure of liquidity). EBITDA is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming industry and for companies with a significant amount of depreciation and amortization. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have other significant uses of cash flows, including debt service and capital expenditures, which are not reflected in EBITDA. (7) The Lawrenceburg partnership paid a financial advisory fee equal to 5.0% of its EBITDA to a minority partner prior to our acquisition of this minority interest in February 2001.    Year ended December 31, 2001, compared to year ended December 31, 2000              Casino Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased $124.5 million, or 18.9%, to $783.4 million from $658.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Alton, Riverside, Sioux City and Baton Rouge reported an aggregate 6.4% increase in casino revenues from $314.9 million to $334.9 million. Lawrenceburg casino revenues increased $2.4 million, or 0.7%, to $346.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $344.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Empress Casino Joliet, acquired July 31, 2001, recorded $102.1 million in casino revenue for the five months since acquisition through December 31, 2001. Each of our casinos reported increases in average win per passenger for the year ended December 31, 2001, versus the year ended December 31, 2000.            Casino expenses increased 24.0% to $337.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $272.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Joliet incurred $53.7 million in casino expenses during the five months of operations since our acquisition. The remaining increase is due to increased gaming taxes totaling $7.5 million and increases in other casino expenses, primarily payroll related, of $4.2 million to support the overall increased revenues.             SIZE=2> Admissions Admissions revenues (net of complimentary admissions) were $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, and $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This reduction is due to an increase in complimentary admissions given to customers as part of Lawrenceburg's marketing program in response to increased competition.    15                   SIZE=2> Food, Beverage and Other Food, beverage and other revenues increased from $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Joliet contributed $9.5 million of this increase in food, beverage and other revenue. Food, beverage and other net profit improved $0.9 million to $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Joliet contributed $1.5 million of this net profit, offset by small reductions in net profit at other properties.             SIZE=2> Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.7% from $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $118.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Joliet had $8.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining increase is due to increased costs associated with the overall increase in revenues at all of our other properties.             SIZE=2> Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $6.1 million to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Joliet accounted for $4.2 million of the increase with the remaining portion of the increase due to the write-off of the proposed Kenosha casino development.             SIZE=2> Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $11.2 million to $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $36.1 million in 2000. This increase is primarily due to the $6.6 million in incremental goodwill amortization related to the Lawrenceburg acquisition during the first quarter of 2001 and depreciation and intangible amortization expense of $4.0 million resulting from the Joliet acquisition on July 31, 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January 1, 2002, we will no longer amortize our goodwill. All goodwill will be subject to impairment testing at least annually. Based on our preliminary evaluation, we expect amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2001, would have decreased by approximately $7.8 million had SFAS No. 142 been effective for 2001 for goodwill acquired prior to July 1, 2001.             SIZE=2> Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $33.4 million to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to additional borrowings in connection with the Lawrenceburg and Joliet acquisitions.             SIZE=2> Minority Interests Our minority interest expense decreased by $36.4 million to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease is attributable to our Lawrenceburg casino minority interest acquisitions during the first quarter of 2001. As the sole owner, we no longer incur minority interest expense.             SIZE=2> Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to income tax expense of $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due to increased pretax earnings, net of minority interest expense.             SIZE=2> Extraordinary Loss We recorded an extraordinary loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, related to completion of the final phase of the 1999 refinancing. This extraordinary loss is net of a $0.8 million tax benefit .            SIZE=2> Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders Net income attributable to common stockholders was $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due primarily to the factors discussed above.    Year ended December 31, 2000, compared to year ended December 31, 1999              Casino Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000, increased $99.7 million, or 17.8%, to $658.9 million from $559.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The western properties (Alton, Riverside, Sioux City and Baton Rouge) reported an aggregate 25.6% increase in casino revenues from $250.8 million to $314.9 million. In particular, Alton casino revenues increased    16           from $84.7 million to $112.1 million. Riverside casino revenues increased from $84.9 million to $97.0 million. Sioux City casino revenues increased from $28.0 million to $34.8 million, and Baton Rouge casino revenues increased from $53.3 million to $70.9 million. Lawrenceburg casino revenues increased $35.7 million, or 11.6%, to $344.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $308.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. We experienced increases in both passengers and the average win per passenger for the year ended December 31, 2000, versus the year ended December 31, 1999. Additionally, the increase in revenues was partially attributable to favorable regulatory changes in Illinois, Missouri and Louisiana, as well as expanded capacity at Alton.            Casino expenses increased 14.4% to $272.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $237.8 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. This increase is primarily due to an increase of $23.1 million in gaming taxes as a result of the overall increase in casino revenues.              SIZE=2> Admissions Admissions revenues (net of complimentary admissions) were $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, and $7.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Although the number of admissions increased in Lawrenceburg by 1.0% in 2000 over 1999, net admission revenue decreased as more customers were given complimentary admissions.             SIZE=2> Food, Beverage and Other Food, beverage and other revenues increased from $58.0 million to $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to the overall increase in casino passengers for the year ended December 31, 2000. Food, beverage and other revenues, as a percent of casino revenues, has remained relatively steady at 10.0% in 2000 and 10.4% in 1999. Food, beverage and other net profit improved $3.0 million to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Increases in revenues and net profit came primarily from Alton and Lawrenceburg. Alton increased food and beverage revenues as it reopened one of its restaurants, which was closed during the entire year ended December 31, 1999. Lawrenceburg's increases were primarily due to a slight increase in admissions.             SIZE=2> Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 12.4% from $95.4 million in 1999 to $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due primarily to an increase at Lawrenceburg of $2.6 million related to expanded marketing and $5.2 million in additional development payments to the city due to the increased gaming revenues with the remaining increase in marketing expenses.             SIZE=2> Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased from $27.9 million in 1999 to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due primarily to increased vessel operating costs.              SIZE=2> Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased slightly to $36.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, from $34.1 million in 1999.             SIZE=2> Write-Down of Assets Held for Sale In 2000, $6.8 million related to the Alton landing facility was written down.             SIZE=2> Interest Expense Net interest expense decreased $12.3 million to $33.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The decrease in interest expense is attributable to the repayments on the credit facility in 2000, the refinancing completed during 1999 and the use of escrowed funds in June 2000 to redeem the untendered Mortgage Notes, both of which reduced our debt levels and a decrease of interest to a minority partner of $2.2 million.             SIZE=2> Minority Interests Our minority interest expense increased by $5.5 million to $40.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to improved operating results at Lawrenceburg.             SIZE=2> Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to income tax expense of $5.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. Prior to 2000, our effective tax rate was impacted favorably due to the utilization of net operating    17           loss carryforwards. For the year ended December 31, 1999, income tax expense was offset by the reversal of a $10.0 million valuation allowance related to prior federal income tax net operating losses.             SIZE=2> Income Before Extraordinary Item Income before extraordinary items was $46.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to net income before extraordinary items of $36.4 million in 1999 due primarily to the factors discussed above.             SIZE=2> Extraordinary Loss We recorded an extraordinary loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, related to completion of the final phase of the 1999 refinancing. This extraordinary loss is net of a $0.8 million tax benefit. For the year ended December 31, 1999, we recorded an extraordinary loss of $24.9 million, net of a $13.5 million tax benefit, related to the early extinguishment of debt in conjunction with the refinancing.              SIZE=2> Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders Net income attributable to common stockholders was $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, compared to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999, due primarily to the factors discussed above.    Liquidity and Capital Resources             During 2001, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $138.5 million compared to $157.8 million for 2000. This decrease is attributable to increased interest expense resulting from the acquisitions of our Lawrenceburg minority interests, the acquisition of the Empress Casino Joliet, the utilization of tax net operating losses during 2000 and changes in working capital.            During 2001, we used cash flows for investing activities of $848.3 million versus $44.0 million for 2000. During 2001, $366.7 million and $451.6 million in cash flows were used for the purchase of the minority interests in Lawrenceburg and the acquisition of the Empress Casino Joliet, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2001 consisted of $22.4 million in maintenance capital, primarily related to slot machine replacements, and $7.8 million for expansion projects, including completing the construction of a 300-room hotel in Baton Rouge.            During 2001, we were provided with $707.6 million in cash flows from financing activities compared to using $101.5 million in cash flows for the same period in 2000. During 2001, we received proceeds of $748.8 million through the issuance of senior subordinated notes and borrowings under our credit facility. We used these funds for the purchase of the Lawrenceburg minority interests and our acquisition of the Empress Casino Joliet. Also during 2001, we spent $20.6 million in financing fees related to the Lawrenceburg and Empress Casino Joliet acquisitions. Cash flows in 2001 and 2000 were used for payment of long-term debt, repayment of partner loans and distributions related to the Lawrenceburg partnership.             At December 31, 2001, we had approximately $57.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2001, we had outstanding $558.3 million of senior subordinated notes, which are due in June 2009 and September 2011 and $435.8 million outstanding on our senior secured credit facility. As of February 20, 2002, availability under the credit facility was approximately $249.7 million. We have no off balance sheet debt.            We have made a significant investment in property and equipment and plan to make significant additional investments at our existing properties. In 2002, we expect to begin construction on two major projects at our Riverside and Joliet properties. Over the next two years, we expect to spend approximately $160 million to $180 million on these projects with approximately $40 million to $50 million to be spent in 2002. In addition, we expect maintenance capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of new gaming product and facility enhancements to be approximately $30 million in 2002.    18                  Consistent with gaming industry practice, we conduct our operations with a net working capital deficit. Unlike traditional industrial companies, a gaming company's balance sheet has limited accounts receivable and inventories. In addition, casinos generate significant cash on a daily basis. We generally apply our daily cash flows to pay down indebtedness under our revolving credit facility and pay our current liabilities pursuant to their normal cycles. Given the significant daily cash flows generated by our operations and the financial flexibility provided by our credit facility, the existence of a working capital deficit has no impact on our ability to operate our business or meet our obligations as they become due. We believe that cash on hand, operating cash flows, and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating, capital expenditure and debt service obligations for the next 12 months.    Critical Accounting Policies             Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have summarized our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Of our accounting policies, we believe the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.             SIZE=2> Goodwill We have approximately $727 million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at December 31, 2001, related to acquisitions. We regularly evaluate our acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators. Additionally, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on January 1, 2002, that requires us to perform impairment testing at least annually. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on, among other things, the regulatory and market status and operational performance of each of our acquired businesses. Future events could significantly impact our judgments and any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.             SIZE=2> Property and Equipment Our operations are capital intensive and we have made significant capital investments in each of our properties. At December 31, 2001, we have approximately $443 million of net property and equipment recorded on our balance sheet. We depreciate our assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimate of the useful lives is based on the nature of the asset as well as our current operating strategy. Future events, such as property expansions, new competition and new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.             SIZE=2> Insurance Accruals Our insurance for workers' compensation and general patron liability has significant deductible levels on an individual claim basis. We accrue a liability for known workers' compensation and general patron liability based upon claims reserves established by the third party administrator processing our claims. Additionally, we accrue an amount for incurred but not reported claims based on our historical experience and other factors. Our employee health insurance benefit accrual is based on our historical claims experience rate including an estimated lag factor. These accruals involve complex estimates and could be significantly affected should current claims vary from historical levels. Our insurance accruals are reviewed by management for adequacy at the end of each reporting period.    Market RiskInterest Rate Sensitivity             The market risk inherent in our financial instruments is the potential loss in fair value arising from adverse changes in interest rates.    19                  The following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations.             2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     Thereafter     Total     Fair  Value  12/31/01          (dollars in thousands)      Fixed Rate Debt     $  1,557     $  1,719     $  1,898     $  1,664     $  1,382     $  555,107     $  563,327     $  599,996    Average Interest Rate        10.6  %     10.6  %     10.6  %     10.7  %     10.7  %     10.1  %                    Variable Rate Debt     $   2,750     $   2,750     $   2,750     $   2,750     $   164,950     $   259,875     $   435,825     $   437,535    Average Interest Rate        4.8  %     4.8  %     4.8  %     4.8  %     4.7  %     4.8  %                              We use interest rate swap agreements from separate financial institutions to manage our interest rate risk associated with our term loan as required under the credit facility. We have entered into three interest rate swaps that have fixed the interest rate as of October 31, 2001, for $200 million of our variable rate term loan under our credit facility. The three separate swap agreements carry original notional amounts of $100 million, $50 million and $50 million. For each swap agreement, we agree to receive a floating rate of interest on the notional principal amount based upon a three month LIBOR rate (plus a 2.75% spread) in exchange for fixed rates ranging from 6.19% to 6.27%. All three swap agreements mature on September 30, 2004. Two of the three swap agreements have reductions in the notional amounts proportionally with the quarterly payments on the term loan beginning December 31, 2001. The total notional amounts are $199.8 million at December 31, 2001. As a result of all three swap agreements, we have, in effect, converted 45.8% of our variable rate debt under our credit facility to fixed rate debt at December 31, 2001.            At December 31, 2001, the fair value of our swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet in other assets ($3.1 million pretax) and the related change in fair value of these agreements is deferred in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ($1.8 million net of taxes of $1.3 million).
