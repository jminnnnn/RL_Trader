PART I  ITEM 1. BUSINESS  GENERAL      Argosy Gaming Company (the "Company") is a leading multi-jurisdictional developer, owner and operator of riverboat casinos and related entertainment facilities in the midwestern and southern United States. The Company, through its subsidiaries, owns and operates riverboat casinos in Alton, Illinois, Riverside, Missouri, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Lawrenceburg, Indiana and Sioux City, Iowa.      The Company's business strategy emphasizes the phased development of attractive gaming and related entertainment facilities in gaming jurisdictions that the Company believes possess favorable long-term demographic and competitive characteristics. As part of this strategy, the Company endeavors to be an early entrant in emerging gaming markets, to establish a customer base and to develop its gaming properties in stages. The Company's casinos were the first gaming facilities to open in each of the St. Louis, Kansas City and Baton Rouge markets. By employing a phased development strategy, the Company believes it can reduce its initial capital investment and adapt the nature and scope of subsequent developments based on a continuing assessment of the size and competitive outlook of each of the Company's gaming markets. The Company intends to utilize management's proven ability to successfully open riverboat casino properties in new markets by continuing to pursue opportunities to develop or acquire (either independently or through joint ventures) riverboat, dockside and/or land-based gaming operations.      The Company's operating strategy is to develop a loyal customer base by offering a variety of gaming and non-gaming entertainment amenities at attractive facilities that emphasize high standards of service and customer satisfaction. In each of its gaming markets, the Company establishes marketing programs that identify, target and attract local patrons typically residing within a 100-mile radius of its gaming facilities. The Company's marketing programs are designed to increase customer awareness, patronage and loyalty, as well as to encourage repeat business. The Company focuses and evaluates its marketing efforts through player tracking systems, slot clubs and preferred player clubs and utilizes mass advertising, direct mail and special promotions to attract customers within each of its gaming markets.      Unless the context otherwise requires, "Company" and "Argosy" shall mean Argosy Gaming Company and its subsidiaries. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 219 Piasa Street, Alton, Illinois 62002. Its telephone number is (618) 474-7500.  CURRENT OPERATIONS      ALTON BELLE CASINO, ALTON, ILLINOIS      The Company commenced operations in Alton, Illinois in September 1991 as the first gaming facility to open in the St. Louis market and in the State of Illinois. The Alton Belle Casino provides casino style gaming on the Mississippi River at Alton, Illinois, approximately 20 miles northeast of downtown St. Louis.      The Alton Belle Casino features 22,800 square feet of gaming space with approximately 650 slot machines and 39 table games for a total of approximately 950 gaming positions. The Alton Belle Casino can board up to approximately 1,500 passengers including a typical crew and casino staff. The Alton Belle Casino also currently includes a 37,000-square foot, three-level floating entertainment pavilion that features sports and entertainment lounges, a 120-seat buffet, a 90-seat fine dining restaurant, conference facilities and a food court. Additionally, the Company is the only gaming operator in the St. Louis market that offers its customers off-track betting facilities. Parking is available at an adjacent city-owned surface parking facility and at two sites in the city of Alton, to and from which the Company provides valet parking as well as free shuttle service.                                         1      ARGOSY CASINO, RIVERSIDE, MISSOURI      The Argosy Casino began operations in Riverside, Missouri on June 22, 1994 as the first gaming facility to open in the Kansas City market. The Argosy Casino's riverboat is styled as a turn-of-the-century paddle wheel steamboat and features approximately 35,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 950 slot machines and 60 table games for a total of approximately 1,435 gaming positions.      The Company has constructed a land-based landing and entertainment pavilion, which opened on January 15, 1996 at a cost of approximately $45 million. The 85,000-square foot, land-based entertainment pavilion features a Mediterranean theme and includes over 14,000 square feet of banquet and conference facilities, a 78-seat specialty restaurant, a sports and entertainment lounge and a 350-seat buffet restaurant. The facility also features 624-space parking garage and a 1,262-space surface parking area located adjacent to the new pavilion.      The Company leases a portion of its site from the City of Riverside, Missouri, pursuant to a five-year land lease agreement with a minimum aggregate rent of $5 million for the entire five-year lease period, payable in advance. In addition to minimum rent, during the initial five-year lease term, percentage rent will be payable in an amount equal to 3% of adjusted gross receipts over $100 million annually. The Company will have the option to extend the lease agreement for three successive five-year terms. In all extension periods, there will be no minimum rent, and percentage rent will be payable as follow: (i) 3% on the first $50 million of adjusted gross receipts; (ii) 4% on adjusted gross receipts between $50 million and $100 million; and (iii) 5% on adjusted gross receipts in excess of $100 million.      BELLE OF BATON ROUGE, BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA      The Belle of Baton Rouge began operations in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in September, 1994 as the first riverboat gaming facility in the Baton Rouge market. The Belle of Baton Rouge is a three-level, ante-bellum themed riverboat casino that contains 28,000 square feet of gaming space with approximately 775 slot machines and 43 table games, for a total of 1,125 gaming positions. The riverboat casino is complemented by the Company's adjacent, land-based entertainment development known as Catfish Town. The first phase of Catfish Town opened during 1995 and features a 250-seat entertainment lounge and sports bar, a 50-seat premium steakhouse, a 250-seat buffet/coffee shop and conference facilities. The second phase of Catfish Town, an approximately 50,000-square foot entertainment facility, opened in April 1996. This phase of the development features a climate-controlled, five-story glass atrium that hosts a variety of entertainment functions, including banquets, parties, festivals, concerts and live entertainment events. The third phase of the Catfish Town project will feature the build-out of approximately 150,000 square feet of leasable retail space adjacent to the atrium which is expected to feature a variety of entertainment-related tenants, including specialty restaurants and specialty retail stores, entertainment venues, nightclubs and a microbrewery. A 733-space parking garage and a leased 271-space surface parking lot are located adjacent to Catfish Town.      The Company has entered into a letter of intent with Southern Hospitality Corporation ("SHC") for the ownership and construction of a 300-room hotel at Catfish Town. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company will have a 49% interest and SHC will have a 51% interest in a joint venture which will own, construct and operate the convention hotel. The Company will contribute the required land, building improvements, and the use of certain atrium areas in return for its equity interest. The Company is not, however, required to contribute any cash to fund the entity. SHC has agreed to contribute up to $7.0 million in equity. The agreement is subject to numerous conditions precedent including, but not limited to, SHC obtaining separate non-recourse project financing.      LAWRENCEBURG CASINO, LAWRENCEBURG, INDIANA      In June 1995, Indiana Gaming Company, L.P., a joint-venture subsidiary of the Company ("Indiana Partnership"), was awarded the right to develop and operate a riverboat casino and entertainment complex                                         2  in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, which is located approximately 15 miles west of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Company is the sole general partner of, and holds a 57.5% general partnership interest in, the Indiana Partnership. Conseco Entertainment L.L.C. ("Conseco"), an indirect subsidiary of Conseco, Inc., holds a 29% limited partnership interest and certain other investors, including H. Steven Norton, Chief Operating Officer of the Company, who brought the opportunity to the Company concurrent with his initial employment, hold the remaining 13.5% limited partnership interest in the Indiana Partnership.      On December 10, 1996 the Indiana Partnership commenced operations at a temporary site with a leased vessel with approximately 20,500 square feet of gaming space. The vessel, which has a capacity of 1,600 passengers, features approximately 870 slot machines and 52 table games for a total of approximately 1,275 gaming positions. In addition, the Partnership leases, from the Company, an approximately 24,000 square foot floating entertainment and support facility which features ticketing and holding areas, a food court, two bars and a gift kiosk. Parking for the temporary facility is provided at a 1,400 space satellite lot. The Indiana Partnership provides free shuttle service from the parking lot to the temporary site.      The Indiana Partnership operates pursuant to a partnership agreement entered into among the partners as of April 11, 1994, as amended and restated as of February 21, 1996. Under the provisions of this agreement, the Company manages the development, construction and operation of the Lawrenceburg Casino project and receives a management fee of 7.5% of EBITDA (as defined in the partnership agreement). Conseco receives a financial advisory fee of 5% of EBITDA.      The Indiana Partnership is building what it believes to be one of the largest riverboat casinos in the United States, featuring approximately 74,300 square feet of gaming space on three levels. The permanent riverboat casino is expected to initially have approximately 2,800 gaming positions and accommodate approximately 4,400 passengers and crew members. In addition to the new riverboat casino, it is anticipated that the permanent facility will include a 300-room hotel, a 1,750-space parking garage, 2,000 additional surface parking spaces and a 120,000-square foot land-based entertainment pavilion and support facility featuring specialty restaurants, meeting and banquet rooms and an entertainment lounge. The Company estimates that the total cost to open the temporary facility and to construct the proposed permanent riverboat casino, land-based facilities and 300-room hotel will be approximately $225 million. Funding for the permanent casino is being provided by the Company and Conseco, 57.5% of which will be funded by the Company and 42.5% of which will be funded by Conseco. Any project costs in excess of $225 million must be funded solely by the Company.      Under Indiana gaming laws the Indiana Partnership's permanent facility must be completed by December 10, 1997 as the Indiana Partnership may only operate at its temporary site for one year. The Company anticipates that the permanent vessel will be completed in the third quarter of 1997; however, numerous factors could result in the failure of the permanent land based facility to be fully completed by December 10, 1997, such as: construction delays, flooding along the Ohio River which has already occurred and which may reoccur this spring, failure to maintain permits previously issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the discovery of historically significant artifacts which would cause a stoppage or slowdown in the construction or a work stoppage or strike at the site. The Company is unable to determine the consequences resulting from the failure to fully complete the permanent facility by December 10, 1997 due to the absence of specifity in Indiana gaming law as to what is required and the fact that there is no precedent for such event. The failure to fully complete the permanent facility by December 10, 1997 could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company.      BELLE OF SIOUX CITY, SIOUX CITY, IOWA      The Company became the manager of the Belle of Sioux City on October 4, 1994 and on December 1, 1994 began operating the Belle of Sioux City through a partnership in which the Company is a 70% general partner and Sioux City Riverboat Corp., Inc. is a 30% limited partner. The Company receives a                                         3  management fee of 4.5% of the facility's adjusted gross gaming revenues (as defined in the management agreement).      The Company has leased to the partnership a 27,000-square foot, three-level historic themed riverboat casino with room for 1,400 passengers and crew. The Belle of Sioux City features approximately 12,500 square feet of gaming space with approximately 400 slot machines and 28 table games, for a total of approximately 620 gaming positions. The casino facility is complemented by an adjacent barge facility, which features buffet dining, a bar and a gift shop, and 274 surface parking spaces.  POTENTIAL FUTURE PROJECTS      OSCEOLA, IOWA      In December 1996 the Company filed an application to develop a riverboat casino in Osceola, Iowa ("Osceola Project"). The proposed casino operation is subject to numerous conditions including approval and licensing by the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission ("IRGC"). The Company currently estimates that the cost of developing the Osceola Project would range from $60-$70 million if the Osceola project is approved by the IRGC and the Company decides to pursue the development of the project.  COMPETITION      The Company's Alton Casino faces competition from four other riverboat casino facilities currently operating in the St. Louis area and expects a significant increase in the level of competition in the future. The most recent casino complex to open includes two independently owned facilities, each of which operate two dockside vessels. This casino complex, which increased gaming capacity in St. Louis by approximately 50%, opened in March of 1997. The Company's Riverside Casino faces competition from four casino companies in the Kansas City area that offer dockside gaming, two of which offer two gaming vessels each. The Company's Baton Rouge Casino faces competition from one casino located in downtown Baton Rouge, a nearby native American casino and multiple casinos throughout Louisiana. Currently, the Company faces competition in Sioux City, Iowa, from two land-based Native American casinos, slot machines at a pari-mutual race track in Council Bluffs, Iowa and from two riverboat casinos in the Council Bluffs, Iowa/Omaha, Nebraska market, which opened in January 1996. The Indiana Partnership faces competition from one other riverboat casino in the Cincinnati market, which opened in October 1996. There could be further unanticipated competition in any market which the Company operates as a result of legislative changes or other events. The Company expects each market in which it participates, both current and prospective, to be highly competitive.  EMPLOYEES      As of December 31, 1996, the Company had approximately 3,460 full-time employees. Approximately 1,260 employees are represented by the Seafarers International Union of North America. The collective bargaining agreement with that union expires in June, 2001. Twelve employees are represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. The Company has not experienced any work stoppages and believes its relations with its employees are generally satisfactory.  LAWRENCEBURG CASINO PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT      GENERAL      On June 30, 1995, the Indiana Partnership, received a preliminary certificate of suitability from the Indiana Gaming Commission to develop and operate the Lawrenceburg Casino project. The Company is the sole general partner of, and holds a 57.5% general partnership interest in, Indiana Partnership. Conseco holds a 29% limited partnership interest and certain other investors, including H. Steven Norton,                                         4  Chief Operating Officer of the Company, who brought the opportunity to the Company concurrent with his initial employment, hold the remaining 13.5% limited partnership interests in the Indiana Partnership.      The Indiana Partnership operates pursuant to a partnership agreement entered into among the partners as of April 11, 1994, as amended and restated as of February 21, 1996. The Indiana Gaming Company manages the partnership pursuant to a management agreement and as general partner, subject only to certain actions or major decisions requiring the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners. Under the provisions of the partnership agreement and the management agreement, the Company will manage the development, construction and operation of the Lawrenceburg Casino project and will receive a management fee of 7.5% of EBITDA (as defined in the partnership agreement) and Conseco will receive a financial advisory fee of 5% of EBITDA. The Company estimates the total cost to open the temporary gaming facility and to construct the proposed permanent riverboat casino, land-based facilities and 300-room hotel will be approximately $225 million.      PROJECT FUNDING      It is currently anticipated that the budgeted $225 million total project cost will be funded as follows: (i) $52.5 million by capital contributions by the partners of which $16.75 million constitutes common equity and $35.75 million constitutes preferred equity. The Company has contributed 57.5% of the common equity, in the amount of approximately $9.6 million, and has contributed 57.5% of the preferred equity, in the amount of approximately $20.6 million. The remainder of the common and preferred equity has been contributed by Conseco. The remainder of the cost of the Lawrenceburg Casino is expected to be funded by third party financing and capital loans from the Company and Conseco. Any capital loans are to be funded 57.5% by the Company and 42.5% by Conseco, pursuant to agreements under which Conseco will fund both its and such other limited partners' share of such capital loans. Conseco is obligated to fund 42.5% of any capital loans until project costs exceed the $225 million total project cost. At December 31, 1996 approximately $56,529 of capital loans have been made to the Indiana Partnership by the Company and Conseco.      For project costs in excess of $210 million, the Company and Conseco will make capital loans of up to $15 million in the aggregate, 57.5% of which will be funded by the Company and 42.5% by of which will be funded Conseco; provided that Conseco will receive an interest rate 700 basis points higher than the Company on the last $10 million contributed. Any project costs over $225 million will be funded solely by the Company without a return or compensation.      PARTNER DISTRIBUTIONS      The Lawrenceburg Casino partnership agreement sets forth the manner in which cash flow of the Indiana Partnership will be distributed. Pursuant to the agreement, principal on capital loans will be repaid on an eight-year amortizing schedule and cash flow (after repayment of principal of, and interest on, capital loans) will be distributed by the general partner not less frequently than quarterly: (i) first, to the partners pro rata for tax payments in an amount equal to their taxable net income for such period; (ii) second, to the partners as a prepayment of principal on capital loans to be applied in the inverse order of maturity, up to 75% of the remaining cash flow; (iii) third, in payment of a preferred return of 14% on any preferred equity contributed by the partners; (iv) fourth, as a return of the preferred equity contributed by the partners; (v) fifth, as a return of common equity contributed by the partners; and (vi) sixth, to the partners in accordance with their respective percentage interests. The partnership agreement provides that the net cash proceeds from a sale or refinancing are distributed by the general partner in the same order as cash flow except that the proceeds will be used to repay 100% of outstanding capital loans by the partners.                                         5      GENERAL PARTNER REMOVAL      The Lawrenceburg Casino partnership agreement provides that the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, The Indiana Gaming Company, can be removed as general partner of the partnership by the limited partners under certain limited circumstances, including: (i) a material breach (after notice and expiration of applicable cure periods) of certain material provisions of the partnership agreement dealing with such things as distributions to partners or the failure to obtain the required consent of the limited partners for certain major decisions; (ii) conviction of embezzlement or fraud; (iii) certain bankruptcy events; (iv) reduction in the Indiana Gaming Company's partnership interest to less than 40% due to sales or dilution for failure to pay required capital; (v) a final unappealable judgment against The Indiana Gaming Company in excess of $25 million which is uninsured and remains unsatisfied, unreleased or unstayed for 180 days; (vi) certain acts constituting "gross mismanagement"; (vii) failure of The Indiana Gaming Company to fund project costs in excess of $215 million (after expiration of applicable notice and cure periods); and (viii) foreclosure by Trustee under the Notes on The Indiana Gaming Company's pledge of its partnership interest the Indiana Partnership. Upon removal as general partner, the general partnership interest of The Indiana Gaming Company becomes a "special limited partner" interest with rights to partner distributions but only limited voting rights on partnership matters. Also, if the reason for the removal is an event described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (v), (vi) or (viii) above the limited partners may acquire all, but not less than all, of The Indiana Gaming Company's interest for the fair market value thereof determined by an appraisal process.      LIMITED PARTNERS' SALE RIGHTS      The Lawrenceburg Casino partnership agreement provides that: (i) after the third anniversary date of commencement of operations at the Lawrenceburg Casino, each limited partner has the right to sell its interest to the other partners (pro rata in accordance with their respective percentage interests) or (ii) after a deadlock by the parties with respect to significant items in any annual operating budget of the partnership for budget year 1999 and thereafter, any partner has a right to sell its interest to the other partners (the limited partner pursuant to clause (i) and the partner desiring to sell pursuant to clause (ii) is hereinafter referred to as a "Selling Partner" and the non-selling partners are hereinafter referred to as the "Non-Selling Partners"). The partnership agreement provides that after the Selling Partner gives notice of its intent to sell the Selling Partner and Non-Selling Partners shall have 60 days to attempt in good faith to agree to a purchase price. If within such period of time no such agreement is reached, then the Selling Partner's interest shall be appraised pursuant to an appraisal process to determine the fair market value thereof. After the fair market value of the Selling Partner's interest is determined by the appraisal process, the Non-Selling Partners have 60 days to reject such sale at that price, and if the Non-Selling Partners decline to purchase the interest of the Selling Partner at the appraisal price then the general partner is to solicit bids and sell all of the assets of the partnership within twelve months to the highest bidder and the partnership will be dissolved within a 12-month period. No assurances can be given that The Indiana Gaming Company, if it is a Non-Selling Partner, will have or will be able to obtain sufficient funds to acquire any Selling Partner's interest in the circumstances provided for above and therefore the assets of the partnership would have to be sold to the highest bidder as provided above. In addition, the partnership agreement provides all partners with a right of first refusal on transfers of partnership interests. A foreclosure by the Trustee on the Company's pledge of its partnership interest shall be deemed a transfer giving rise to the right of first refusal.  REGULATORY MATTERS      ILLINOIS      In February 1990, the State of Illinois pursuant to the Riverboat Gambling Act (the "Riverboat Act") legalized riverboat gaming. The Riverboat Act authorizes riverboat gaming upon any navigable stream within or forming a boundary of the State of Illinois other than Lake Michigan. The Riverboat Act does                                         6  not, however, authorize riverboat gaming or the docking of a riverboat conducting gaming within a county having a population in excess of 3,000,000. The Riverboat Act grants the Illinois Gaming Board specific powers and duties, and all other powers which are necessary and proper to effectuate the Riverboat Act. The Illinois Gaming Board's jurisdiction extends to every person, association, corporation, partnership and trust involved in riverboat gaming operations in the State of Illinois.      The Riverboat Act authorized a five member Illinois Gaming Board to issue up to ten owner's licenses statewide. Each owner's license permits the operation of up to two boats as a part of a single riverboat gaming operation with a combined maximum of 1,200 gaming positions (as defined by the Illinois Gaming Board). No person, firm or corporation may be licensed as the owner of more than one riverboat gaming operation in Illinois, although a licensed owner may hold up to 10% of a second riverboat gaming operation in Illinois. In addition to the ten owner's licenses which may be authorized under the Riverboat Act, the Illinois Gaming Board may issue special event licenses allowing persons who are not otherwise licensed to conduct riverboat gaming and to conduct such gaming on a specified date or series of dates. Riverboat gaming under such a license may take place on a riverboat not normally used for riverboat gaming.      An owner's license is issued for an initial period of three years (with a fee of $25,000 for the first year and $5,000 for each of the following two years) and must be renewed annually thereafter (with a fee of $5,000 for each year). The Company's Illinois gaming license is subject to renewal in October, 1997. An owner's license is eligible for renewal upon payment of the applicable fee and a determination by the Illinois Gaming Board that the licensee continues to meet all of the requirements of the Riverboat Act. The Illinois Gaming Board also requires that officers, directors and employees of a gaming operation be licensed. Licenses issued by the Illinois Gaming Board may not be transferred to another person or entity. All licensees must maintain their suitability for licensure and have a continuing duty to disclose any material changes in information provided to the Illinois Gaming Board.      Pursuant to its rule making authority under the Illinois Riverboat Act, the Illinois Gaming Board has adopted certain regulations that provide that any beneficial owner of the legal or beneficial interests of a gaming company may be required, and in the case of a beneficial owner of 5% or more of the legal or beneficial interests (a "5% Holder") is required, to furnish a detailed personal disclosure form to the Illinois Gaming Board. The Illinois Gaming Board uses the personal disclosure form as the basis for its investigation to determine such holder's suitability as a stockholder of the company. In the case of a 5% Holder, the Illinois Gaming Board conducts such an investigation. The Illinois Gaming Board's decisions as to suitability are based on the same criteria used for a finding of preliminary suitability for licensure including character, reputation, experience and financial integrity of such holder. If the Illinois Gaming Board determines that a holder is not suitable, the holder is entitled to request a hearing; however, if no hearing is requested after such determination or such finding is upheld after a hearing, the holder is required to divest his shares of common stock of the company. After a holder is required to divest and until divestiture, the licensee is unable to distribute profits to such stockholder. The Illinois Gaming Board has adopted a regulation that provides that a licensee can only make distributions to shareholders to the extent such distributions would not impair the financial viability of the licensee. Factors which would be considered by the Illinois Gaming Board include working capital requirements, debt service requirements, requirements for repairs and maintenance and capital expenditure requirements. Illinois Gaming Board approval is required for certain changes, including, among other things, to the type of entity, debt and equity offerings by a company, issuances of debt, riverboat capacity or significant design changes, changes in the number of gaming positions and pro forma budgets and financial statements.      Minimum and maximum wagers on games are set by the licensee. Wagering may not be conducted with money or negotiable currency. No person under the age of 21 is permitted to wager in Illinois, and wagers may only be taken from a person present on a licensed riverboat. With respect to electronic gaming devices, the payout percentage may not be less than 80% nor more than 100%.                                         7      Under the Riverboat Act, vessels must have the capacity to hold a minimum of 500 persons if operating on the Mississippi River or the Illinois River south of Marshall County, and a minimum of 400 persons on any other waterway. In addition, all riverboats must be accessible to disabled persons, must be either a replica of a 19th century Illinois riverboat or be a casino cruise ship design and must comply with applicable federal and state laws, including but not limited to U.S. Coast Guard regulations.      Gaming may only be conducted on a gaming excursion, which is limited to a maximum period of four hours. A gaming excursion is deemed to have started upon the commencement of gaming. For the purpose of orderly ingress of passengers to a riverboat, gaming is deemed to commence when the first passenger boards a riverboat for an excursion and may continue while other passengers are boarding for a period not to exceed thirty minutes, at which time the gangplank or its equivalent must be pulled up and further boarding is not permitted. For the purpose of orderly egress of passengers from a riverboat at the end of an excursion, gaming may continue for a period not to exceed thirty minutes after the gangplank or its equivalent is lowered. During this thirty minute period of egress, new passengers may not board a riverboat. These periods of time do not extend the four-hour maximum. Special event extended cruises may be authorized by the Illinois Gaming Board.      Although the Riverboat Act provides that no gambling may be conducted while a riverboat is docked, an Illinois Gaming Board rule currently permits dockside gaming during the 30-minute time periods prior to and following a cruise. Furthermore, if the captain of the riverboat reasonably determines that for reasons of safety, although seaworthy, the riverboat should not leave the dock or should return immediately thereto due to inclement weather, mechanical or structural problems, or river icing, then a gaming excursion may commence or continue while the gang plank or its equipment is raised and remains raised, and ingress is prohibited until completion of the excursion, in which case the riverboat is not considered docked. If such a situation occurs, the holder of the owner's license must promptly file a report with the administrator of the Illinois Gaming Board detailing the basis for its decision not to cruise. Recent pronouncements by the Illinois Gaming Board indicate that the explanations for failure to cruise pursuant to the rule will be scrutinized and that any abuse of the rule will result in disciplinary actions, which may include, among other things, any of the following: cancellation of future cruises, penalties, fines, suspension and/or revocation of a license.      The Riverboat Act imposes a 20% wagering tax on adjusted gross receipts from gambling games. The tax imposed is to be paid by the licensed owner to the Illinois Gaming Board on the day after the day when the wagers were made. A number of bills have been recently introduced in the Illinois legislature proposing various changes in the way riverboat gaming operations are taxed. Some of these bills seek to replace the current flat tax on gaming receipts with a graduated gaming tax that would impose a maximum tax on Illinois casinos far in excess of the current 20% wagering tax on adjusted gaming receipts. The Governor of Illinois has publicly supported such a graduated gaming tax and has proposed a state budget which is in part predicated on additional revenues being generated from an increase in gaming taxes. Other proposed bills seek to add a supplemental tax, or raise the flat tax rate on gaming receipts by 5-10%. Another proposed bill would allow a land based casino in southern Illinois. The proposed bills are still pending and no assurance can be given that one or a combination of these bills will not become law or that similar legislation will not be introduced in the future. The Riverboat Act also requires that licensees pay a $2.00 admission tax for each person admitted to a gaming cruise. In addition, all use, occupancy and excise taxes that apply to food and beverages and all taxes imposed on the sale or use of tangible property apply to sales aboard riverboats. The Company also pays $.20 admission tax to the City of Alton for each person admitted to the Alton Belle Casino.      The Illinois Gaming Board is authorized to conduct investigations into the conduct of gaming as it may deem necessary and proper and into alleged violations of the Riverboat Act. Employees and agents of the Illinois Gaming Board have access to and may inspect any facilities relating to riverboat gaming operations at all times.                                         8      A holder of any license is subject to the imposition of fines, suspension or revocation of such license, or other action for any act or failure to act by himself or his agents or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the State of Illinois, or that would discredit or tend to discredit the Illinois gaming industry or the State of Illinois. Any riverboat operation not conducted in compliance with the Riverboat Act may constitute an illegal gaming place and consequently may be subject to criminal penalties, which penalties include possible seizure, confiscation and destruction of illegal gaming devices and seizure and sale of riverboats and dock facilities to pay any unsatisfied judgment that may be recovered and any unsatisfied fine that may be levied. The Illinois Gaming Board may revoke or suspend licenses, as the Board may see fit and in compliance with applicable laws of Illinois regarding administrative procedures and may suspend an owner's license, without notice or hearing, upon a determination that the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by continuing a riverboat's operation. The suspension may remain in effect until the Illinois Gaming Board determines that the cause for suspension has been abated and it may revoke the owner's license upon a determination that the owner has not made satisfactory progress toward abating the hazard.      The Illinois Gaming Board may waive any licensing requirement or procedure provided by rule if it determines that such waiver is in the best interests of the public and the gaming industry.  INDIANA      In June 1993, the Indiana legislature adopted legislation permitting riverboat gambling in counties contiguous to Lake Michigan, the Ohio River and Patoka Lake. The legislation granted authority to supervise gaming activities to the seven-member Indiana Gaming Commission (the "Indiana Gaming Commission"). The Indiana Gaming Commission is empowered to administer, regulate and enforce the system of riverboat gaming established under Indiana's Riverboat Gambling Act (the "Riverboat Gambling Act") and has jurisdiction and supervision over all riverboat gaming operations in Indiana, as well as all persons on riverboats where gaming operations are conducted. The Indiana Gaming Commission has broad powers to regulate riverboat gaming operations and to approve the form of ownership and financial structure of not only riverboat owner licensees, but also their entity qualifiers, and intermediary and holding companies. Indiana is a new gaming jurisdiction and the emerging regulatory framework is not yet complete. The Indiana Gaming Commission has adopted certain final rules and has published others in proposed or draft form which are proceeding through the review and final adoption process. The Indiana Gaming Commission also has indicated its intent to publish additional proposed rules in the future. The Indiana Gaming Commission has broad rule making power and it is impossible to predict what effect, if any, the rules might have on the operations of the Lawrenceburg Casino. The following description reflects both adopted and proposed rules. Further, the Indiana General Assembly has the power to promulgate new laws and implement amendments to the Riverboat Gambling Act, which can materially affect the operation or economic viability of the gaming industry in Indiana.      No one may operate a riverboat gaming operation in Indiana without holding a riverboat owner's license. The Indiana Gaming Commission has implemented strict regulations with respect to the suitability of riverboat license owners, their key personnel, and employees. The Indiana Gaming Commission utilizes a "class based" licensing structure that subjects all individuals associated with a riverboat licensee or a riverboat license applicant to varying degrees of background investigations.      Under current Indiana law a maximum of 11 owner's licenses may be in effect at any time with an aggregate of five licenses to be issued to owners whose home port is a county which is contiguous to Lake Michigan, an aggregate of five licenses to be issued to owners whose home port is a county which is contiguous to the Ohio River and one license to be issued to an owner whose home port is a county contiguous to Lake Patoka. For counties contiguous to the Ohio River, the Indiana Gaming Commission may not issue a license unless an ordinance has been passed permitting the docking of a riverboat by the specified local entity and the voters of the county have approved riverboat gambling in the county.                                         9      A license holder is required to pay an initial license fee of $25,000, (which covers the first 5 years of operation), a renewal fee of $5,000 per year thereafter and post a bond to guaranty performance of the licensee's obligations under the legislation. Gaming will be permitted only on riverboats which (i) have a valid certificate of inspection from the U.S. Coast Guard for the carrying of at least 500 passengers, (ii) are at least 150 feet in length, and (iii) for riverboats operating on the Ohio River, replicate historic Indiana steamboat passenger vessels of the 19th century. No person or entity may simultaneously own an interest in more than two riverboat owner's licenses. A person or entity may simultaneously own up to 100% in one riverboat owner's license and no more than 10% in a second riverboat owner's license. A riverboat owner's licensee must possess a level of skill, experience, or knowledge necessary to conduct a riverboat gaming operation that will have a positive economic impact on the host site, as well as the entire State of Indiana. Additional representative, but not exclusive, qualification criteria with respect to the holder of a riverboat owner's license include character, reputation, financial integrity, the facilities or proposed facilities for the conduct of riverboat gaming including related non-gaming projects such as hotel development, and the good faith affirmative action plan to recruit, train and upgrade minorities and women in all employment classifications. The Indiana Gaming Commission shall require persons holding owner's licenses to adopt policies concerning the preferential hiring of residents of the city in which the riverboat docks for riverboat jobs. The Indiana Gaming Commission has broad discretion in regard to the issuance, renewal, revocation and suspension of licenses and approvals, and the Indiana Gaming Commission is empowered to regulate a wide variety of gaming and non-gaming related activities, including the licensing of suppliers to, and employees at, riverboat gaming operations, and effectively to approve the form of ownership and financial structure of not only riverboat owner and supplier licensees, but also their subsidiaries and affiliates. A riverboat owner's licensee or any other person may not lease, hypothecate, borrow money against or loan money against a riverboat owner's license. An ownership interest in a riverboat owner's license may only be transferred in accordance with the regulations promulgated under the Riverboat Gambling Act. An applicant for the approval of the transfer of a riverboat owner's license must comply with application procedures prescribed by the Indiana Gaming Commission and present evidence that it meets or possesses the standards, qualifications, and other criteria under Indiana gaming laws, and pay an investigative fee in the amount of $50,000 with the application. If the Indiana Gaming Commission denies the application to transfer an ownership interest, it shall issue notice of denial to the applicant. Unless specifically stated to the contrary, a notice of denial of an application for transfer shall not constitute a finding that the applicant is not suitable for licensure. A person who is served with notice of denial under this rule may request an administrative hearing.      "Certificates of Suitability" are issued following selection by the Indiana Gaming Commission. The "Certificate of Suitability" is valid for 180 days unless extended by the Indiana Gaming Commission. During this period the prospective riverboat licensee must among other things: obtain a permit to develop the riverboat gaming operation from the United States Army Corps of Engineers; obtain a valid certificate of inspection from the United States Coast Guard for the vessel on which the riverboat gaming operation will be conducted; apply for and receive the appropriate permits or certificates from the Indiana Alcoholic Beverage Commission, fire marshall, and other appropriate local, state and federal agencies which issue permits including, but not limited to, health permits, building permits and zoning permits; closing the financing necessary to complete the development of the gaming operation; post a bond in compliance with the applicable law; obtain the insurance deemed necessary by the Indiana Gaming Commission; receive licensure for electronic gaming devices and other gaming equipment under applicable law; submit an emergency response plan in compliance with applicable laws; and take any other action that the Indiana Gaming Commission deems necessary for compliance under Indiana gaming laws. Further, the Indiana Gaming Commission may place restrictions, conditions or requirements on the permanent riverboat owner's license. An owner's initial license expires five years after the effective date of the license, and unless the owner's license is terminated, expires or is revoked, the owner's license may be renewed annually by the Indiana Gaming Commission upon satisfaction of certain conditions contained in the Riverboat Gambling Act.                                         10      Pursuant to rules promulgated by the Indiana Gaming Commission, any person (other than an institutional investor) who individually, or in association with others, acquires directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded corporation that is a riverboat licensee or 5% or more of the beneficial interest in a riverboat licensee, directly or indirectly, through any class of the voting securities of any holding or intermediary company of a riverboat licensee shall apply to the Indiana Gaming Commission for finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring the securities. Each institutional investor who, individually or in association with others, acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded corporation that is a riverboat licensee or 5% or more of the beneficial interest in a riverboat licensee through any class of the voting securities of any holding or intermediary company of a riverboat licensee shall notify the Indiana Gaming Commission within 10 days after the institutional investor acquires the securities and shall provide additional information and may be subject to a finding of suitability as required by the Indiana Gaming Commission.      An institutional investor who would otherwise be subject to a suitability finding shall, within 45 days, after acquiring the interests submit information to the Indiana Gaming Commission including the following: a description of the institutional investor's business and a statement as to why the institutional investor satisfies the definitional requirements of an institutional investor under Indiana gaming rule requirements; a certification made under oath that the voting securities were acquired and are held for investment purposes only and were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor; the name, address, telephone number, social security number or federal tax identification number of each person who has the power to direct or control the institutional investor's exercise of its voting rights as a holder of voting securities of the riverboat licensee; the name of each person who beneficially owns 5% or more of the institutional investor's voting securities or equivalent; a list of the institutional investor's affiliates; a list of all securities of the riverboat licensee that are or were beneficially owned by the institutional investor or its affiliates within the preceding one year; a disclosure of all criminal and regulatory sanctions imposed during the preceding ten years; a copy of any filing made under 16 U.S.C. 18(a); and any other additional information the Indiana Gaming Commission may request to insure compliance with Indiana gaming laws.      Each institutional investor who, individually or in association with others, acquires, directly or indirectly, the beneficial ownership of 15% or more of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded corporation that owns a riverboat owner's license or 15% or more of the beneficial interest in a riverboat licensee directly or indirectly through any class of voting securities of any holding company or intermediary company of a riverboat licensee shall apply to the Indiana Gaming Commission for a finding of suitability within 45 days after acquiring the securities.      An institutional investor means any of the following: a retirement fund administered by a public agency for the exclusive benefit of federal, state or local public employees; an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940; a collective investment trust organized by banks under Part 9 of the Rules of the Comptroller of the Currency; a closed end investment trust; a chartered or licensed life insurance company or property and casualty insurance company; a banking, chartered or licensed lending institution; an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940; and any other entity the Indiana Gaming Commission determines constitutes an institutional investor. The Indiana Gaming Commission may in the future promulgate regulations with respect to the qualification of other financial backers, mortgagees, bond holders, holders of indentures or other financial contributors.      The Riverboat Gambling Act imposes a tax on admissions to gaming excursions at a rate of $3.00 for each person admitted to the gaming excursion. This admission tax is imposed upon the license owner conducting the gaming excursion on a per-person basis without regard to the actual fee paid by the person using the ticket, with the exception that no tax shall be paid by admittees who are actual and necessary officials, employees of the licensee or other persons actually working on the riverboat. A tax is imposed on the adjusted gross receipts received from gaming games under the Riverboat Gambling Act at a rate of                                         11  twenty percent (20%) of the amount of the adjusted gross receipts. Adjusted gross receipts is defined as the total of all cash and property (including checks received by a licensee), whether collected or not, received by a licensee from gaming operations less the total of all cash paid out as winnings to patrons including a provision for uncollectible gaming receivables as is further set forth in the Riverboat Gambling Act. The Indiana Gaming Commission may, from time to time, impose other fees and assessments on riverboat owner licensees. In addition, all use, excise and retail taxes apply to sales aboard riverboats.      In general, riverboat excursions are limited to a duration of at least two and no more than four hours, and no gaming may be conducted while the riverboat is docked, with the exception of (i) the 30 minutes during passenger embarkation and disembarkation and (ii) when weather, water or traffic prevent the riverboat from cruising. Minimum and maximum wagers on games are set by the licensee, and wagering may not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. No person under the age of 21 is permitted to be present on a riverboat, and wagers may only be taken from a person present on a licensed riverboat.      No riverboat licensee or riverboat license applicant may enter into or perform any contract or transaction in which it transfers or receives consideration which is not commercially reasonable or which does not reflect the fair market value of the goods or services rendered or received as determined at the time the contract is executed. Any contract entered into by a riverboat licensee or riverboat license applicant that exceeds the total dollar amount of $50,000 shall be a written contract. A riverboat license applicant means an applicant for a riverboat owner's license that has been issued a certificate of suitability.      Pursuant to Indiana Gaming Commission rules, riverboat licensees and riverboat license applicants must submit an internal control procedure regarding purchasing transactions which must contain provisions regarding ethical standards, compliance with state and federal laws, and prohibitions on the acceptance of gifts and gratuities by purchasing and contracting personnel from suppliers of goods or services. The rules also require any riverboat licensee or applicant to submit any contract, transaction or series of transactions greater than $500,000 in any 12-month period to the Indiana Gaming Commission within 10 days of execution, and to submit a summary of all contracts or transactions greater than $50,000 in any 12-month period on a quarterly basis. The rules provide that contracts submitted to the Indiana Gaming Commission are not submitted for approval, but grant the Indiana Gaming Commission authority to cancel or terminate any contract not in compliance with Indiana law and Indiana Gaming Commission rules.      Indiana gaming laws provide that the opportunity for full minority and women's business enterprise participation in the riverboat industry in Indiana is essential to social and economic parity for minority and women business persons. The Indiana Gaming Commission has the power to review compliance with the goals of participation by minority and women business persons and impose appropriate conditions on licensees to insure that goals for such business enterprises are met.      Under the Riverboat Gambling Act, a riverboat licensee or a riverboat license applicant shall designate certain minimum percentages of the value of its contracts for goods and services to be expended with minority business enterprises and womens' business enterprises such that 10% of the dollar value of the riverboat licensee's or the riverboat license applicant's contracts be expended with minority enterprises and 5% of the dollar value of the riverboat licensee's or the riverboat license applicant's contracts be expended with women's business enterprises. Expenditures with minority and women business enterprises are not mutually exclusive. Licensees are required to report the dollar value and percentage of contracts awarded to minority business enterprises and women's business enterprises annually. If the Indiana Gaming Commission determines that a licensee has not met these requirements, it may suspend, limit or revoke the owner's license or fine or impose appropriate conditions on the licensee.      All licensees subject to the jurisdiction of the Indiana Gaming Commission have a continuing duty to maintain suitability for licensure. The Indiana Gaming Commission may initiate an investigation or disciplinary action or both against a licensee about whom the commission has reason to believe is not                                         12  maintaining suitability for licensure, is not complying with licensure conditions, and/or is not complying with Indiana gaming laws or regulations. The Indiana Gaming Commission may suspend, revoke, restrict or place conditions on the license of a licensee; require the removal of a licensee or an employee of a licensee; impose a civil penalty or take any other action deemed necessary by the Indiana Gaming Commission to insure compliance with Indiana gaming laws.      The rapid expansion of gaming in Indiana has prompted some legislators to call for a moratorium on the legalization of new forms of gaming. Some legislators support a five year moratorium, while others propose waiting until a national survey on gaming has been completed. One bill, proposing a moratorium on the legalization of new forms of gaming or the expansion of the scope of existing gaming laws until the earlier of five years or the completion of the national survey, passed the Indiana Senate in February of 1997 and is currently being considered by the Indiana House of Representatives. There are other legislative measures which are being considered, including but not limited to, an increase in the admissions tax.  IOWA      In 1989, the State of Iowa legalized riverboat gaming on the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers and certain other waterways located in Iowa. The Excursion Gambling Act grants the Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission (the "Iowa Commission") jurisdiction over all gambling operations.      The legislation authorized the granting of licenses to conduct riverboat gaming to not-for-profit corporations which, in turn, are permitted to enter into operating agreements with persons who are licensed by the Iowa Commission to operate riverboat casinos. The number of licenses which may be granted is not limited by statute or regulation.      Gaming is permitted only on riverboats which recreate, as nearly as practicable, Iowa's riverboat history and have a capacity for at least 250 persons with tickets. In addition the licensee must utilize Iowa resources, goods and services in the operation of the riverboat. An excursion gambling boat must operate at least one excursion each day for 100 days during the excursion season, (from April 1 through October 31). Excursions consist of a minimum two hours during the excursion season. While an excursion gambling boat is docked, passengers may embark or disembark at any time during its business hours. If during the excursion season it is determined that it would be unsafe to complete any portion of an excursion, or if mechanical problems prevent the completion of any portion of an excursion, the boat may be allowed to remain dockside.      A gaming license will be issued for not more than three years and is subject to annual renewals thereafter. The Iowa Commission has broad discretion with regard to such renewals. The annual license fee to operate an excursion gambling boat shall be based on the passenger carrying capacity, including crew, for which the excursion gambling boat is registered. The annual fee shall be five dollars per person capacity. Licenses issued by the Iowa Commission may not be transferred to another person or entity. The Company must submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Iowa Commission.      Iowa statute stipulates that a referendum must be held in 2002 to reaffirm gaming in each county that has gaming and further stipulates that similar referenda be held every eight years thereafter. Minimum and maximum wagers on games are set by the licensee. Wagering may only be conducted with chips, wagering debit cards or coins. Wagers may only be made by persons 21 years of age and older. A licensee shall not accept a credit card to purchase coins, tokens or other forms of credit to be wagered on gambling games.      The legislation imposes a graduated tax based on adjusted gross receipts at a rate of 5% on the first $1 million, 10% on the next $2 million and 20% on any amount over $3 million. The tax is to be paid by the licensee within 10 days after the close of business of the day when the wagers were made. The legislation also permits the Iowa Commission to impose an admission fee for each person embarking on an excursion                                         13  vessel, and the city or county in which gaming is conducted is permitted to impose an admission fee of not greater than 50 cents.      Pursuant to its rule making authority, the Iowa Commission requires officers, directors and certain key employees of the Company to be licensed by the Iowa Commission. In addition, anyone having a material relationship or involvement with the Company may be required to be found suitable or to be licensed, in which case those persons would be required to pay the costs and fees of the Iowa Commission. The Iowa Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in position by such officers or key employees and the power to require the Company to suspend or dismiss officers, directors or other key employees or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate applications or whom the Iowa Commission finds unsuitable to act in such capacities. Any contract in excess of $50,000 must be submitted to and approved by the Iowa Commission.      The Iowa Commission may also require any individual who has a material relationship with the Company to be investigated and licensed or found suitable. Any person who acquires 5% or more of the Company's equity securities must be approved by the Iowa Commission prior to such acquisition. The applicant stockholder is required to pay all costs of such investigation.      In November 1996, two referenda seeking to allow riverboat gaming in Dallas County, near DesMoines, and Muscatine County, on the Mississippi River, were defeated. Following the vote, Iowa Governor Terry Branstad proposed that the Iowa legislature impose a five-year moratorium on the expansion of gaming.  LOUISIANA      In July 1991, the Louisiana legislature adopted legislation permitting certain types of gaming activity on certain rivers and waterways in Louisiana. The legislation granted authority to supervise riverboat gaming activities to the Louisiana Riverboat Gaming Commission and the Riverboat Gaming Enforcement Division of the Louisiana State Police (the "Louisiana Enforcement Division"). The Louisiana Riverboat Gaming Commission was authorized to hear and determine all appeals relative to the granting, suspension, revocation, condition or renewal of all licenses, permits and applications. In addition, the Louisiana Riverboat Gaming Commission was to establish rules providing for and determining, among other things, authorized routes, duration of excursions and the stops a riverboat may make, minimum levels of insurance, construction of riverboats, periodic inspections and procedures for negotiable instrument transactions involving patrons. The Louisiana Enforcement Division was authorized, among other things, to investigate applicants and issue licenses, investigate violations of the statute, conduct continuing reviews of gaming activities and exercise other broad oversight powers.      In an April 1996 special session of the Louisiana legislature, Louisiana lawmakers passed a measure which established the Louisiana Gaming Control Board and provides that such board shall be the successor to all prior authorities, and the sole and exclusive authority, with regard to the regulation and supervision of gaming operations and activities in Louisiana except for the regulation of horse racing and offtrack betting and the conducting of charitable gaming operations. Effective May 1, 1996, the powers, duties, functions, and responsibilities of the Louisiana Riverboat Gaming Commission and the Louisiana Enforcement Division, including those with respect to riverboat gaming, are transferred to the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. The Department of Public Safety and Corrections, Office of State Police, retains certain enforcement powers and responsibilities relative to investigations, audits, and cruising procedures.      The transfer of a license or permit or an interest in a license or permit is prohibited. The sale, purchase, assignment, transfer, pledge or other hypothecation, lease, disposition or acquisition (a "Transfer") by any person of securities which represents 5% or more of the total outstanding shares issued by a corporation that holds a license is subject to Louisiana Gaming Control Board disapproval. A security issued by a corporation that holds a license must disclose these restrictions. Prior Louisiana Gaming Control Board approval is required for the Transfer of any ownership interest of 5% or more in any                                         14  licensee or for the Transfer of any "economic interest" of 5% or more in any licensee or Affiliated Gaming Person. No such prior approval is required for the transfer of any ownership interest of 5% or more in any corporate licensee. An "economic interest" is defined for purposes of a Transfer as any interest whereby a person receives or is entitled to receive, by agreement or otherwise, a profit, gain, thing of value, loss, credit, security interest, ownership interest or other benefit.      A licensee must notify the Louisiana Gaming Control Board in writing within five (5) days of the completion of the following transactions:  1.  Withdrawal of capital in excess of five percent (5%) of the licensee's net     gaming proceeds for the preceding twelve month period;  2.  The granting of a loan or any other extension of credit in excess of five     percent (5%) of the licensee's net gaming proceeds for the preceding twelve     month period;  3.  Any advance or other distribution of any type of asset in excess of five     percent (5%) of the licensee's net gaming proceeds for the preceding twelve     month period;      No prior approval of any such withdrawal, loan, advance or distribution is required, but such transaction is ineffective if subsequently disapproved by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board. In addition, the Louisiana Gaming Control Board may issue an emergency order for not more than 10 days prohibiting payment of profits, income or accruals by, or investments in, a licensee.      Riverboat gaming licensees and their Affiliated Gaming Persons are required to notify the Louisiana Gaming Control Board within 30 days after any such person applies for, receives or accepts a loan, or makes use of any cash, property, credit, loan or line of credit, or guarantees, or grants other form of security for a loan (a "Loan") unless such transaction involves publicly registered debt and securities (in which event such person shall file the registration statement and other materials with the Louisiana Gaming Control Board), unless more stringent conditions are imposed by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board, or the amount of the Loan is below certain specified thresholds. The Louisiana Gaming Control Board is required to investigate the reported Loan, and to either approve or disapprove the transaction. If disapproved, the Loan must be rescinded by the Licensee or Affiliated Gaming Person.      Fees for conducting gaming activities on a riverboat include (i) $50,000 per riverboat for the first year of operation and $100,000 per year per riverboat thereafter; (ii) a state franchise fee of 15% of net gaming proceeds; (iii) a state license fee of 3.5% of net gaming proceeds; and (iv) a local fee of up to $2.50 per passenger.      In April 1996, the Louisiana legislature approved legislation mandating local option elections to determine whether to prohibit or continue to permit three individual types of gaming in Louisiana on a parish-by-parish basis. The referendum was brought before the Louisiana voters at the time of the November 1996 presidential election. Voters elected to permit riverboat gaming in all parishes where it is presently conducted and to allow land-based casino gaming in Orleans Parish. Voters in 31 parishes elected to permit video draw poker devices, but in 33 parishes, including East Baton Rouge Parish, voters elected to prohibit the devices. Current operators of video poker devices in East Baton Rouge Parish (and the other parishes where voters elected to prohibit video poker) will be allowed to operate only until the end of their current license plus two extensions. Typically video poker licenses have a maximum one year duration.  MISSOURI      Gaming was originally authorized in the State of Missouri on November 3, 1992, although no governmental action was taken to enforce or implement the original law. On April 29, 1993, Missouri enacted the Missouri Gaming Law which replaced the original law and established the Missouri Gaming Commission, which is responsible for the licensing and regulation of riverboat gaming in Missouri. The                                         15  number of licenses which may be granted is not limited by statute or regulation. The Missouri Gaming Law grants specific powers and duties to the Missouri Gaming Commission to supervise riverboat gaming and implement the Missouri Gaming Law and take any other action as may be reasonable or appropriate to enforce the Missouri Gaming Law. The Missouri Gaming Commission has discretion to approve permanently moored ("dockside") riverboat casinos if it finds that the best interest of Missouri and the safety of the public indicate the need for continuous docking of an excursion gambling boat.      Under the Missouri Gaming Law, the ownership and operation of riverboat gaming facilities in Missouri are subject to extensive state and local regulation. If a company is granted a gaming license in Missouri, such company, any subsidiaries it may form and its officers, directors, significant shareholders and employees will be subject to regulations. The initial license and first subsequent license renewal of an excursion gambling boat operator shall be for a period of one year. Thereafter, license renewal periods shall be two years. However, the Missouri Gaming Commission may reopen license hearings at any time. In addition to the owners license and operators license for the riverboat, every individual participating in gaming operations in any capacity is required to have an occupational license from the Missouri Gaming Commission. Applicants and licensees are responsible to keep the application and any requested materials current at all times, and this responsibility shall continue throughout any period of licensure granted by the Missouri Gaming Commission. In addition, Missouri has extensive licensing disclosure requirements.      The Missouri Gaming Commission may revoke or suspend gaming licenses and impose other penalties for violation of the Missouri Gaming Law and the rules and regulations which may be promulgated thereunder. Penalties include, but are not limited to, forfeiture of all gaming equipment used in the conduct of unauthorized gambling games and fines of up to three times a licensee's highest daily gross receipts derived from wagering on the gambling games, whether authorized or unauthorized, conducted during the preceding twelve months. In addition, the Missouri Gaming Commission requires 60 days notice of, and may disapprove or require delay pending further investigation of, transactions in excess of the greater of $500,000 or 30% of licensee's net worth, up to $1,000,000, which transactions involve or relate to the gaming licensee.      The Missouri Gaming Law imposes operational requirements on riverboat operators, including a charge of two dollars per gaming customer per excursion that licensees must pay to the Missouri Gaming Commission, a minimum payout requirement of 80% for slot machines, a 20% tax on adjusted gross receipts, prohibitions against providing credit to gaming customers (except for the use of credit cards and cashing checks) and a requirement that each licensee reimburse the Missouri Gaming Commission for all costs of any Missouri Gaming Commission staff necessary to protect the public on the licensee's riverboat. Licensees must also submit to the Commission on a quarterly basis an audit of compliance and of the financial transactions and condition of the licensee's total operations for the calendar quarter and pay the associated auditing fees. The Missouri Gaming Law provides for a loss limit of $500 per person per excursion. Although the Missouri Gaming Law provides no limit on the amount of riverboat space that may be used for gaming, the Missouri Gaming Commission is empowered to impose such space limitations through the adoption of rules and regulations. Additionally, United States Coast Guard safety regulations could affect the amount of riverboat space that may be devoted to gaming. The Missouri Gaming Law also includes requirements as to the form of riverboats, which must resemble Missouri's riverboat history to the extent practicable and include certain non-gaming amenities.      The licensee may receive wagers only from a person present on a licensed excursion gambling boat. Wagering shall not be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. A person under 21 years of age shall not make a wager on an excursion gambling boat and shall not be allowed in the area of the excursion boat where gambling is being conducted.      With respect to the availability of dockside gaming, which may be more profitable than cruise gaming, the Missouri Gaming Commission is empowered to determine on a site by site basis where such gaming is in the best interest of Missouri and the safety of the public and shall be permitted.                                         16      Pursuant to its rule making authority, the Missouri Gaming Commission has adopted certain regulations which provide, among other things, that: (i) riverboat excursions are limited to a duration of four hours, and gaming may be conducted at any time during the excursion; (ii) no gaming licensee or occupational licensee may pledge, hypothecate or transfer in any way any license, or any interest in a license, issued by the Missouri Gaming Commission; (iii) without first notifying the Missouri Gaming Commission at least 60 days prior to such consummation of any of the following transactions (and during such period the Missouri Gaming Commission may disapprove the transaction or require the transaction to be delayed pending further investigation) (a) a gaming licensee or a holding company affiliated with a gaming licensee may not make a public issuance of debt, (b) a publicly held gaming licensee or a publicly held holding company may not make any issuance of an ownership interest equaling 5% or greater of the gaming licensee or holding company or (c) a person or entity may not pledge or hypothecate an ownership interest in a gaming licensee that is not a publicly held company or a holding company that is not a publicly held company provided that no such ownership interest may be transferred voluntarily or involuntarily pursuant to any pledge without separate notice to the Missouri Gaming Commission as required by the regulations; (iv) not later than 7 days after the consummation of any transfer of ownership interest in a publicly held gaming licensee, if such transfer would result in an entity or group of entities acting in concert owning, directly or indirectly, a total amount of ownership interest equaling 5% or greater of the ownership interest in the gaming licensee, the transferee must report such consummation to the Missouri Gaming Commission; (v) no withdrawals of capital, loans, advances or distribution of any type of assets in excess of 5% of accumulated earnings of a licensee to anyone with an ownership interest in the licensee may occur without prior Missouri Gaming Commission approval; and (vi) the Missouri Gaming Commission may take action against a licensee or other person who has been disciplined in another jurisdiction for gaming related activity.      The Missouri Gaming Commission is authorized to enter the premises of excursion gambling boats, facilities, or other places of business of a licensee in Missouri to determine compliance with the Missouri Gaming Law and to investigate alleged violations of the Missouri Gaming Law or Missouri Gaming Commission rules, orders or final decisions. A holder of any license shall be subject to imposition of penalties, suspension or revocation of such license, or other action for any act or failure to act by himself or his agents or employees that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and general welfare of the people of the state of Missouri, or that would discredit the Missouri gaming industry or the state of Missouri. The Missouri Gaming Commission may waive any licensing requirement or procedure for any type of license if it determines that the waiver is in the best interests of the public. In addition, a supplier's license is required of persons who sell or lease gambling equipment, gambling supplies or both to any licensee. A licensee licensed to conduct gambling games shall acquire all gambling games or implements of gambling from a licensed supplier.      On August 29, 1996, certain residents of St. Louis County (the "St. Louis Plaintiffs") filed a lawsuit in Cole County, Missouri seeking declaratory and injunctive relief generally against the Missouri Gaming Commission and specifically against the granting of licenses by the Missouri Gaming Commission to Harrah's Maryland Heights Corp. ("Harrah's") and Players Maryland Heights, LP ("Players") with respect to their casino development in Maryland Heights, Missouri. The suit alleged that (i) the Missouri legislature lacks the constitutional authority to authorize the Missouri Gaming Commission to license casinos except on excursion gambling boats and floating facilities "upon" the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, (ii) the Missouri Gaming Commission has wrongly construed a statute to permit it to grant gaming licenses to excursion gambling boats or floating facilities placed within artificial spaces and (iii) the Missouri Gaming Commission is not authorized to regulate gaming operations conducted upon floating facilities. The St. Louis Plaintiffs asserted that the enclosed basin being constructed by Harrah's and Players, on which they would float their casino barge facilities and which is not contiguous to the Missouri River, exceeds a Missouri constitutional limitation authorizing gaming only "upon" the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers. The St. Louis Plaintiffs also sought to declare unconstitutional those portions of Missouri law and actions of the Missouri Gaming Commission that permit casino gaming in artificially                                         17  constructed basins. Finally, the St. Louis Plaintiffs asserted that although the Missouri constitution grants the Missouri legislature the authority to authorize casino gaming on excursion gambling boats and floating facilities, when the Missouri legislature enacted its gaming law, it only authorized gaming on excursion gambling boats. Therefore, because the Harrah's/Players facility is within an enclosed basin that prevents excursions upon the Missouri River and will be conducted upon barge facilities that lack an engine or other means of propulsion, the Missouri Gaming Commission lacks the statutory authority to license the project. In December 1996, the Missouri court dismissed the St. Louis Plaintiffs' claim. The St. Louis Plaintiffs' appeal is currently pending in the Missouri Supreme Court.      Although the St. Louis Plaintiffs' action relates specifically to the Harrah's/Players Maryland Heights casino project, if their claim is successful, it could have a material adverse effect on other Missouri casino operators, particularly those that conduct operations on floating barges from artificially constructed basins. The Company, however, conducts its gaming operations at the Argosy Casino in Riverside on a docked, excursion riverboat from a constructed harbor that is open to the Missouri River. The Company believes that, if necessary, it could modify its operations in Riverside so as to be in compliance with even the strictest construction of the St. Louis Plaintiffs' interpretation of Missouri gaming law. The Company is unable at this time to determine what effect, if any, this action would have on its business, results of operations, competitive position in the Kansas City and St. Louis markets or the merits of the St. Louis Plaintiffs' action.  LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS IN CERTAIN ADJACENT JURISDICTIONS      KANSAS.  Casino gaming is currently illegal in Kansas as a constitutionally prohibited form of lottery. In order to amend the Kansas constitution, two-thirds of the members of each house of the Kansas legislature and a majority of Kansas voters would have to approve a proposed amendment. Resolutions seeking to amend the Kansas constitution to authorize limited forms of gaming have been proposed. Although Kansas Governor Graves has stated that he is in favor of the legalization of slot machines at racing locations, in 1996 the legislature rejected attempts to legalize slot machines. Bills which would allow specified racetracks, including the Woodlands Racetrack in Kansas City, to install instant bingo dispensers that resemble slot machines are currently pending in the Kansas legislature.      The State of Kansas has approved Class III Indian compacts with four separate tribes authorizing the tribes to conduct table and keno games, but not slot machines, on their respective reservation lands. The reservations on which these tribes propose to offer gaming in Kansas are located from approximately 120 to 150 miles from downtown Kansas City.      KENTUCKY.  Casino gaming is illegal in Kentucky as a constitutionally prohibited form of lottery. In order to amend the Kentucky constitution, three-fifths of the members of each house of the Kentucky legislature and a majority of Kentucky voters would have to approve a proposed amendment. Several Kentucky racetracks have publicly lobbied for the right to conduct casino games.      OHIO.  Casino gaming is illegal in Ohio as a constitutionally prohibited form of lottery. In order to amend the Ohio constitution, three-fifths of the members of each house of the Ohio legislature and a majority of Ohio voters would have to approve the proposed amendment.      A voter petition drive placed a casino gaming referendum on the November 1996 ballot. The referendum would have legalized gaming and required the Ohio legislature to pass laws to facilitate the development and maintenance of an industry competitive with gaming in other areas of the country. This referendum was rejected by Ohio voters and casino gaming remains illegal in Ohio.      NEBRASKA.  A number of efforts to expand gaming in Nebraska failed during 1996. After an effort to present a statewide referendum on legalizing casino gaming failed in the Nebraska legislature, three separate voter petition drives also failed.                                         18  FEDERAL AND NON-GAMING REGULATIONS      The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain federal, state and local safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances that apply to businesses generally, such as the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Occupational Safety and Health Act, Resource Conservation Recovery Act and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. The Company has not made, and does not anticipate making, material expenditures with respect to such environmental laws and regulations. However, the coverage and attendant compliance costs associated with such laws, regulations and ordinances may result in additional costs to the Company. For example, in 1990 the U.S. Congress enacted the Oil Pollution Act to consolidate and reconcile mechanisms under various oil spill response laws. The Department of Transportation has proposed regulations requiring owners and operators of certain vessels to establish through the U.S. Coast Guard evidence of financial responsibility in the amount of $5.5 million for clean-up of oil pollution. This requirement would be satisfied by either proof of adequate insurance (including self-insurance) or the posting of a surety bond or guaranty.      All vessels operated by the Company must comply with U.S. Coast Guard requirements as to safety and must hold a Certificate of Seaworthiness. These requirements set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all personnel involved with the operation of the vessel. Loss of the Certificate of Seaworthiness of a vessel would preclude its use as a riverboat. Every five years, vessels must be dry docked for an inspection of the outside of the hull resulting in a loss of service for a period of time. The Belle of Sioux City riverboat was removed from service on April 13, 1996 for such a hull inspection. The riverboat arrived at an approved dry docking facility on April 16, 1996, passed its inspection and returned to service on May 9, 1996. No interruption in gaming operations occurred in Sioux City as a result of the hull inspection process, as the Company temporarily transferred gaming operations to the original Alton Belle prior to removing the Belle of Sioux City from service.      All shipboard employees of the Company employed on U.S. Coast Guard regulated vessels, including those who have nothing to do with the actual operation of the vessel, such as dealers, waiters and security personnel, may be subject to the Jones Act which, among other things, exempts these employees from state limits on workers' compensation awards.      The Company is subject to the provisions of the Americans With Disabilities Act but does not anticipate incurring significant expenses to bring its facilities or procedures into compliance with such Act.      The Bank Secrecy Act (the "BSA"), enacted by Congress in 1985, requires banks, other financial institutions and casinos to monitor receipts and disbursements of currency in excess of $10,000 and report them to the United States Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury"). In management's opinion, the BSA may have resulted in a reduction in the volume of play by high level wagerers. The Treasury has proposed tentative amendments to the BSA which would apply solely to casinos and their reporting of currency transactions. The most significant proposed change in the BSA is a reduction in the threshold at which customer identification data must be obtained and documented by the casino, from $10,000 to $3,000 (which may include the aggregation of smaller denomination transactions). Additionally, the amendments would substantially increase the record-keeping requirements imposed upon casinos relating to customer data, currency and non-currency transactions. Management believes the proposed amendments, if enacted in their current form, could result in a further reduction in the volume of play by upper-and middle-level wagerers while adding operating costs associated with the more extensive record-keeping requirements. However, the effect on the Company's operations is not expected to be material.      The permanent riverboat casino site in Lawrenceburg, Indiana is located in potential wetlands or other protected areas. Although the Company does not believe that the existence of wetlands or other protected areas will prohibit or have a significant adverse impact on the Company's ability to develop any of its current sites, there can be no assurance that such a claim or other claims relating to such matters may not arise in the future, which may have a material adverse effect on the costs of opening a casino at such sites or result in a material delay in opening a gaming facility at such sites.                                         19  ITEM 2. PROPERTIES      The following is a list of the Company's principal properties as of December 31, 1996. Substantially all of the properties of the Company are subject to the lien of the Company's senior lenders under its $235 million First Mortgage Note Indenture dated June 5, 1996.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS      The Company is from time to time a party to legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company does not believe that the results of such legal proceedings, even if the outcome were unfavorable to the Company, would have a material adverse impact on either its financial condition or results of operations.  MARION COUNTY, INDIANA GRAND JURY DOCUMENT SUBPOENA      On or after March 15, 1996, the Company, its partners in the Lawrenceburg casino project and certain other individuals and entities were served with document request subpoenas issued by the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney of Marion County, Indiana in connection with a grand jury investigation entitled: STATE OF INDIANA V. ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION-OFFICIAL MISCONDUCT. Indiana law requires that at the time a target of an investigation is determined, that entity or person must be so advised by the Office of the Prosecuting Attorney. On March 23, 1996 the Company was advised by the Marion County prosecutor that no target subpoenas had been issued by the grand jury in its investigation as of that date. However, there can be no assurance that targets will not be identified as further information and documents are obtained and considered by the grand jury. Due to the confidential nature of grand jury proceedings, the Company is not aware of the specific subject matter or matters of the investigation. The Company believes it has fully complied with its subpoena, and has been informed by its partners that they have done the same.      The subpoenas requested information regarding the current or prior ownership interest in the Company and the partners of the Indiana Partnership by the individuals or entities described below. The subpoenas also requested that the Company and its partners produce a broad category of documents including documents regarding employment and other agreements, gifts, payments and correspondence between the Company and any of its partners on the one hand and several business entities and individuals, including an Indiana state legislator, certain Indiana lobbyists, and certain Lawrenceburg, Indiana city officials and businessmen on the other hand. The Company has learned that this legislator has served as an employee of a subsidiary of Conseco, Inc., the parent company of the 29% limited partner in the Indiana Partnership since September 1995. Additionally, the Company has learned that such state legislator has served since September 1993 as a consultant to a major Indiana engineering firm that is engaged in many state and local government funded construction projects. That engineering firm also serves as lead engineer for the Lawrenceburg casino project. On May 24, 1996, the Indiana House Legislative Ethics Committee voted to reprimand, but take no further action against, this legislator for failing to properly report the foregoing employment and consulting arrangements on his 1993, 1994 and 1995 statements of economic interests. On June 27, 1996, the legislator announced his resignation as chairman of the Indiana House Ways and Means Committee.      The Company believes that neither it nor any entity controlled by or person employed by the Company has engaged, and has been informed by representatives of its partners that they have not engaged, in any unlawful conduct in the pursuit by or granting to the Indiana Partnership of the Lawrenceburg gaming license. Because the grand jury proceedings were unlikely to be concluded quickly, on March 25, 1996, a former U.S. Attorney and his law firm were retained to conduct, as special independent counsel (the "special independent counsel"), an internal investigation into the activities and actions of the Company and the entities controlled by any person employed by the Company with respect to (i) the hiring by Conseco, Inc. and the Indiana engineering firm of the state legislator, (ii) the endorsement of the Indiana Partnership by the City of Lawrenceburg and the financial affairs of certain Lawrenceburg officials with respect to such endorsement and the awarding of the certificate of suitability by the Indiana Gaming Commission, and (iii) their lobbying efforts in furtherance of the Indiana legislature's enactment of legislation authorizing gaming and limiting gaming licenses to one per county. A special committee of independent directors of the Company was appointed to supervise and coordinate the special independent counsel's investigation. The special independent counsel did not investigate Conseco, Inc. The Company was advised that Conseco, Inc. also retained independent counsel and such                                         21  counsel conducted its own internal investigation of matters that may be the subject of the grand jury proceedings and such investigation found no wrongdoing by Conseco, Inc. or any person or entity it controls, or is controlled by.      From March 25 to April 15, 1996, the special independent counsel conducted its investigation and issued an interim report in which it concluded that it found no evidence that the Company or any entity controlled by or person employed by the Company had any involvement in, or knowledge of, the relationship between the state legislator and Conseco, Inc. or the Indiana engineering firm, or attempted to improperly influence any City of Lawrenceburg official, state legislator or Indiana Gaming Commission member or staff member in connection with the endorsement of the partnership by the City of Lawrenceburg and the awarding of the certificate of suitability to the Indiana Partnership with regard to lobbying, including the lobbying with respect to one gaming license per county legislation. The special independent counsel found no evidence that the Company or any entity controlled by or person employed by the Company attempted to unduly influence any legislator in any way. However, no investigation was made of any lobbyist's records, activities or expenditures, nor were any outside lobbyists interviewed. The special independent counsel also audited the Company's compliance with the lobbying disclosure statute in Indiana and found only technical errors in the Company's lobbying disclosure statements. No evidence was found that these technical errors were intentional or designed to hide any lobbying activity. In conducting its investigation, the special independent counsel, among other things, reviewed numerous boxes of documents produced by the executive and Lawrenceburg offices of the Company and extensively interviewed the nine Company officers and employees most closely related to the Lawrenceburg Casino project, as well as the principal of R.J. Investments, Inc., a 4% limited partner of the Indiana Partnership.      No assurance can be given, however, that the nature and scope of the investigation conducted by the special independent counsel for the Company and Conseco, was sufficient to uncover conduct that might be considered unlawful. In the event that the Company, any entity controlled by the Company, any person employed by the Company, the Indiana Partnership or any of its partners is found by the Marion County prosecutor to have engaged in unlawful conduct, there is no assurance what effect such action would have on the Indiana Partnership's gaming license.      In the event that a partner is determined by the Indiana Gaming Commission to be unsuitable for ownership of a gaming license, the terms of the Indiana Partnership's partnership agreement provide that the Indiana Partnership shall redeem 100% of such unsuitable partner's interest for an amount equal to 90% of the "appraised value" of that partner's interest, determined in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. The purchase price is payable in five annual installments, only from available cash flow or sale or financing proceeds of the partnership, and bears interest at "prime." If such event were to occur with respect to Conseco prior to the completion of the Lawrenceburg casino project, the Company would have to fund any remaining construction costs of the Lawrenceburg Casino project which were to have been funded by Conseco. No assurance can be given that the Company would be able to obtain funds sufficient for this purpose. Also, there can be no assurance that the Indiana Gaming Commission would not take other actions such as suspending, revoking or failing to renew the Indiana Partnership's gaming license. There can be no assurance that the grand jury investigation will not lead to events having a material adverse effect on the Company.  DISPUTE WITH FORMER SHAREHOLDERS OF JAZZ ENTERPRISES, INC.      On March 15, 1996, a judgment for approximately $2.2 million plus continuing interest, attorney's fees and court costs was rendered against Jazz in the cause of action entitled MARTHA MYATT BOWLUS ET. AL. V. JAZZ ENTERPRISES, INC. filed in the Nineteenth Judicial District Court, Parish of East Baton Rouge, State of Louisiana ("Bowlus Lawsuit"). The plaintiffs sued Jazz to recover amounts due under a promissory note issued by Jazz and secured by a mortgage on certain property owned by Jazz located several miles south of Catfish Town. The delay for filing for a new trial in the Bowlus Lawsuit has elapsed and under Louisiana law a suspensive appeal from a judgment must be filed within 30 days thereafter and any such appeal                                         22  requires the posting of an appeal bond in an amount at least equal to the amount of the judgment. The judgment rendered in the Bowlus Lawsuit has been recorded in the mortgage records of East Baton Rouge Parish, and therefore the judgment now constitutes a judicial mortgage on Jazz's immovable property located in East Baton Rouge Parish.      Pursuant to the definitive acquisition documents, any and all amounts due by Jazz under the Bowlus Lawsuit are the obligations of the Former Jazz Shareholders. Prior to March 31, 1996, the Company requested, in writing, that the Former Jazz Shareholders satisfy the obligations and satisfy the judgment. Thereafter, Jazz was advised that the Former Jazz Shareholders hoped to settle the Bowlus Lawsuit prior to the expiration of the suspensive appeal delay and if not so settled, they intended to suspensively appeal the judgment. Since the former Jazz Shareholders were unable to post an adequate suspensive appeal bond to suspend the effect of the adverse judgment against Jazz, the Company paid the amount due under the judgment by funding and paying $2,292,033.81 ("Bowlus Settlement") to the plaintiffs on Monday, July 8, 1996 in full satisfaction of the judgment rendered in the Bowlus Lawsuit. By letter dated July 25, 1996, the Company advised the Former Jazz Shareholders that it had paid the judgment rendered in Bowlus Lawsuit by payment of the Bowlus Settlement to the plaintiffs and demanded that the Former Jazz Shareholders repay to the Company the Bowlus Settlement plus accumulated interest and all attorneys' fees incurred by the Company in settling the Bowlus Lawsuit. Due to the Former Jazz Shareholders' failure to repay Argosy for the Bowlus Settlement, the Company withheld scheduled payments of $337,500 each to the former Jazz Shareholders representing the March 31, 1996, the June 30, 1996, September 30, 1996 and December 31, 1996 quarterly installments of the deferred purchase price. Pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company intends to withhold all future payments to the former Jazz Shareholders as an offset against the Bowlus Settlement plus accumulated interest and all attorneys' fees incurred by the Company in settling the Bowlus Lawsuit. The Bowlus Lawsuit is still pending on appeal, and the Bowlus plaintiffs are seeking to have the lower court's award for attorneys' fees increased, and Jazz (through the Former Jazz Shareholders) is seeking to have the judgment (which Argosy paid) reversed or reduced. The Company believes that withholding such payment, as well as withholding future payments, until the Former Jazz Shareholders satisfy the Bowlus Lawsuit is within the Company's rights as provided for in the definitive acquisition documents.      In response to the Company's withholding of the March 31, 1996 payment, Mr. Steve Urie et al. has filed an action in District Court of East Baton Rouge seeking payment of the withheld amount and has threatened, among other things, to file a class action on behalf of the shareholders of the Company against the Company and its directors and officers for mismanagement. The Company believes such threatened claims are without merit and would vigorously pursue the defense of any lawsuit filed by the Former Jazz Shareholders. This suit seeking recovery of withheld quarterly installments has since been voluntarily dismissed, without prejudice, by Mr. Urie et. al.  CHALLENGE TO LICENSE FOR LAWRENCEBURG CASINO BY UNSUCCESSFUL APPLICANT      On November 29, 1996, Schilling Casino Corporation d/b/a Empire Casino & Resort ("Empire"), an unsuccessful competing applicant for the riverboat owner's license in Lawrenceburg, Indiana that was awarded to the Indiana Partnership by the Indiana Gaming Commission (the "Commission"), filed with the Commission a purported "Request for Hearing" (the "Request") on the denial of Empire's application for the Lawrenceburg license. Empire's Request, which has been referred to an Administrative Law Judge (the "ALJ"), did not seek a stay of the award of the license to the Indiana Partnership or of the Indiana Partnership's commencement of regular gaming operations from its temporary gaming facility at Lawrenceburg, which commenced December 13, 1996. The Company and the Indiana Partnership were granted leave to intervene in the administrative proceedings on the Empire Request.      The grounds asserted in the Empire Request include claims that (i) the application process followed by the Commission did not afford Empire due process and violated Indiana laws; (ii) the Indiana Partnership failed to comply with conditions in the certificate and failed to open the temporary gaming                                         23  facility in a timely fashion, (iii) the Indiana Partnership made misrepresentations to the Commission during the licensing hearings; (iv) the Commission could not lawfully have extended the certificate beyond June 30, 1996 (one year after the date of its initial award) without reconsidering all other applications; and (v) the endorsement of the Indiana Partnership by the City of Lawrenceburg was without legal authority and was given improper weight by the Commission.      The Company and the Indiana Partnership have filed with the ALJ a motion for summary judgment and to dismiss Empire's Request; the Commission has filed with the ALJ a motion for partial summary judgement, on Empire's Request; and Empire has filed with the ALJ its "discovery plan" describing discovery it wishes to pursue in the matter, as to which the Company and the Indiana Partnership have filed a motion for protective order. Responsive and reply briefing by the parties has been completed, and the ALJ has set a hearing for April 30, 1997 on the pending motions and the Empire discovery plan.      The Company and the Indiana Partnership believe the Request is without merit, and are contesting and intend to continue to contest the Request vigorously. The Commission is also opposing the Empire Request. No assurance can be given, however, as to (i) the ultimate recommendation the ALJ will make to the Commission on the Request; (ii) the ultimate action the Commission will take in response to that recommendation; or (iii) that Empire will not continue to take steps to seek revocation of the license awarded to the Indiana Partnership, including seeking judicial review of any ultimate administrative ruling by the Commission denying the Empire Request.  CAPITOL HOUSE PRESERVATION COMPANY, L.L.C. VS. JAZZ ENTERPRISES, INC., ET AL.      In July 1995, Capitol House Preservation Company, L.L.C. ("Capitol House") filed a cause of action in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Louisiana against Jazz, the former shareholders of Jazz ("Former Jazz Shareholders"), Catfish Queen Partnership (the "Partnership"), Argosy of Louisiana, Inc. ("Argosy Louisiana") and the Company alleging that Jazz and Argosy obtained the gaming license for Baton Rouge based upon false and fraudulent pretenses and declarations and financial misrepresentations. The complaint alleges tortious conduct as well as violations of RICO and seeks damages of $130,900.00 plus court costs and attorneys' fees. The plaintiff was an applicant for a gaming license in Baton Rouge whose application was denied by the Louisiana Enforcement Division. The Company believes the allegations of the plaintiff are without merit and in tends to vigorously defend such cause of action.      On June 7, 1995, the Company consummated its purchase of all of the outstanding capital stock of Jazz from the Former Jazz Shareholders. The Company intends to seek indemnification from the Former Jazz Shareholders for any liability the Company, Argosy Louisiana or Jazz suffers as a result of such cause of action. As part of the consideration payable by the Company to the Former Jazz Shareholders for the acquisition of Jazz, the Company agreed at the time of such acquisition to annual deferred purchase price payments of $1,350,000 for each of the first ten years after closing and $500,000 for each of the next ten years. Payments are to be made quarterly by the Company. The definitive acquisition documents provide the Company with off-set rights against such deferred purchase price payments for indemnification claims of the Company against the Former Jazz Shareholders and for liabilities that the Former Jazz Shareholders contractually agreed to retain. There can be no assurance that the Former Jazz Shareholders will have assets sufficient to satisfy any claim in excess of the Company's off-set rights.      The defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss, or alternatively to abstain and stay the action, pending resolution of certain Louisiana state court claims filed by Capitol House. The trial court decided in favor of the defendants and dismissed the suit without prejudice to the rights of plaintiff to revive the suit after the conclusion of the pending state court matters. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal to the U.S.Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. While the appeal was pending, several of the Louisiana state court claims were resolved. On March 11, 1997, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the trial court's dismissal and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. The case is now back in the district court                                         24  and will proceed. The defendants intend to go forward with the previously filed motion to dismiss. No date has yet been set for hearing on the motion.  H. STEVEN NORTON V. JOHN T. CONNORS, ET AL.      In September, 1993, H. Steven Norton, who was then and is now the President of the Company, filed a cause of action against John T. Connors, a significant shareholder of the Company and a former officer of J. Connors Group Inc., a predecessor entity of the Company ("JCG"), seeking $50 million in damages. Mr. Norton alleged that Mr. Connors failed to fulfill his promise made in the summer of 1991 to establish a partnership with Mr. Norton in which each would have an equal 50% interest in JCG, which had a 25% partnership interest in the Company's predecessor entity that owned the Alton Belle casino. As a result of the reorganization effected immediately prior to its initial public offering, the Company succeeded to all the rights, properties and assets, and assumed all the liabilities, of all of its predecessor entities, including JCG. Subsequent to filing the lawsuit, Mr. Connors advised the Company that his dealings with Mr. Norton, which are the subject of the litigation, were in his capacity as an officer of JCG, and that the Company should assume the defense and reimburse Mr. Connors for the approximately $130,000 spent to date on legal fees, and that any liability resulting from the litigation was assumed by the Company as a result of the Company's reorganization. The Company responded to Mr. Connors that it believed that his actions and dealings with Mr. Norton were solely in his individual capacity as a shareholder of JCG, and the Company declined to assume the defense or reimburse him for previously incurred legal fees, and the Company denied that it has any liability with respect to such matter. If, however, JCG were to have been found liable to Mr. Norton as a result of the actions of Mr. Connors, then the Company could under certain circumstances be liable to Mr. Norton for any damages awarded against JCG.      In April 1995, Mssrs. Norton and Connors agreed to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice. However, on May 22, 1996, Mr. Norton refiled the suit against Mr. Connors and is again seeking $50 million in damages. The Company believes that Mr. Connors will again seek to cause the Company to indemnify and reimburse him from liability thereunder. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the lawsuit will not lead to events having a material adverse effect on the Company.  GAMING INDUSTRY CLASS ACTIONS      The Company was named, along with two gaming equipment suppliers, 41 of the country's largest gaming operators and four gaming distributors (the "Gaming Industry Defendants") in three class action lawsuits which were filed in Las Vegas, Nevada. The suits alleged that the Gaming Industry Defendants violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act ("RICO") by engaging in a course of fraudulent and misleading conduct intended to induce people to play their gaming machines based upon a false belief concerning how those gaming machines actually operate, as well as the extent to which there is actually an opportunity to win on any given play. The suits sought unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. On January 14, 1997, the Court consolidated all three actions under the case name WILLIAM H. POULOS, ETC. VS. CAESARS WORLD, INC., ET AL. The Gaming Industry Defendants are in the process of filing numerous motions to challenge the sufficiency of the plaintiffs' consolidated amended complaint. The Company is unable to determine what effect, if any, the suit would have on its business or operations.                                         25  ITEM 4.
