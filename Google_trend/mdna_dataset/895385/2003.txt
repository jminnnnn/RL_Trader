Cautionary Statements for Purposes of the "Safe Harbor" Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995               This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this document, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate" and "expect" and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that any forward-looking statements, including those regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company or its management, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements as a result of various factors including, but not limited to, (i) construction delays related to the Company's expansion projects' (ii) competitive and general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates, (iii) the effect of future legislation or regulatory changes on the Company's operations, including but not limited to gaming tax increases, issuances of additional gaming licenses and the approval of cashless slots, and (iv) other risks detailed from time to time in the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

Overview             We own and operate the Alton Belle Casino in Alton, Illinois; the Empress Casino Joliet in Joliet, Illinois; the Argosy Casino in Riverside, Missouri; the Argosy Casino in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; the Argosy Casino in Sioux City, Iowa; and the Argosy Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.             In 2002, many factors affected our casinos' operations. Effective August 1, 2002, our Lawrenceburg casino commenced dockside gaming. This has had a positive impact on casino revenues in the last half of 2002. During the second quarter 2002, Illinois and Indiana enacted legislation increasing gaming tax rates. Also, in late 2001 and 2002, three competitors made significant renovations, which, coupled with the increased gaming tax rates, have negatively impacted our Alton and Joliet, Illinois casino operations. In addition, dockside gaming in Indiana has negatively impacted our Joliet, Illinois casino operations.            During the first quarter 2001, we acquired the minority interests in our Argosy Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Following the acquisition of these minority interests, we now own 100% of all our operations and are no longer required to record minority interest expense. On July 31, 2001, we acquired the Empress Casino Joliet in Joliet, Illinois. The results of our operations for 2001 include the results of Empress Casino Joliet for the five months ended December 31, 2001.    15                  Years Ended December 31,             2002     2001     2000             (In Thousands)         Casino Revenues                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  118,914     $  121,862     $  112,077       Argosy CasinoRiverside        98,374        98,735        97,049       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge        77,239        77,164        70,943       Argosy CasinoSioux City        38,863        37,100        34,801       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        373,714        346,432        344,013       Empress Casino Joliet(1)        237,620        102,112                                      Total     $  944,724     $  783,405     $  658,883                           Net Revenues                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  114,162     $  116,869     $  107,490       Argosy CasinoRiverside        94,754        94,680        92,889       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge(3)        79,122        78,044        67,267       Argosy CasinoSioux City        37,734        36,421        33,710       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        380,116        354,237        348,918       Empress Casino Joliet(1)        230,935        99,126               Other        (10  )     (8  )     359                              Total     $  936,813     $  779,369     $  650,633                           Income (loss) from Operations(2)                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  27,890     $  34,968     $  32,155       Argosy CasinoRiverside        20,093        20,575        17,803       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge(3)        7,168        5,784        6,844       Argosy CasinoSioux City        7,706        8,043        6,708       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        116,874        116,649        111,991       Empress Casino Joliet(1)        53,828        26,416               Corporate(4)        (21,819  )     (27,814  )     (22,316  )    Other        (1,636  )     (1,448  )     (1,629  )                           Total     $  210,104     $  183,173     $  151,556                           EBITDA (2)(5)                                  Alton Belle Casino     $  34,436     $  40,944     $  38,016       Argosy CasinoRiverside        24,465        24,671        23,368       Argosy CasinoBaton Rouge(3)        15,256        14,349        13,999       Argosy CasinoSioux City        9,828        9,626        8,277       Argosy CasinoLawrenceburg        130,027        132,200        133,039       Empress Casino Joliet(1)        63,745        30,378               Lawrenceburg financial advisory fee(6)                (927  )     (6,652  )    Corporate(4)        (20,303  )     (20,697  )     (21,942  )    Other        67        (55  )     (455  )                           Total     $  257,521     $  230,489     $  187,650                               (1) Amounts for 2001 reflect five months of operations after our purchase of the Empress Casino Joliet on July 31, 2001. (2) Income from operations and EBITDA exclude (i) consideration of any management fee paid to us and the 42.5% minority interest in our Lawrenceburg casino for periods prior to our first quarter   16          2001 acquisitions of these minority interests and (ii) the 30% minority interest in our Sioux City casino for the period prior to our July 2000 acquisition of this interest.      (3) Includes operations of Jazz Enterprises, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary that owns and operates the Catfish Town real estate development adjacent to our Baton Rouge casino. (4) The year ended December 31, 2001, includes a $1.9 million pretax charge related to the abandonment of a proposed casino in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The year ended December 31, 2000, includes a $6.8 million pretax charge related to the write-down of the Alton landing facility. (5) "EBITDA" is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is presented before any management fees paid to Argosy. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, such as income from operations, net income, or cash flows generated by operating, investing and financing activities. EBITDA is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure because management believes that it is a widely used measure of operating performance in the gaming industry and for companies with a significant amount of depreciation and amortization. EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We have other significant uses of cash flows, including debt service and capital expenditures, which are not reflected in EBITDA. A reconciliation from EBITDA to Income from operations is as follows:              Years Ended December 31,             2002     2001     2000       EBITDA     $  257,521     $  230,489     $  187,650       Depreciation and amortization        (47,417  )     (47,316  )     (36,094  )                         Income from operations     $   210,104     $   183,173     $   151,556                              (6) The Lawrenceburg partnership paid a financial advisory fee equal to 5.0% of its EBITDA to a minority partner prior to our acquisition of this minority interest in February 2001.   17       NAME="page_dk1898_1_18">        Year ended December 31, 2002, compared to year ended December 31, 2001              Casino Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2002, increased $161.3 million, or 20.6%, to $944.7 million from $783.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Lawrenceburg casino revenues increased $27.3 million, or 7.9%, to $373.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $346.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Lawrenceburg commenced dockside gaming on August 1, 2002. The Empress Casino Joliet recorded $237.6 million of casino revenue for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $102.1 million in casino revenue for the five months since acquisition (July 31, 2001) through December 31, 2001. The competitive impact of dockside gaming in Indiana and facility renovations by two nearby casinos have resulted in a decrease in Joliet's casino revenues of $8.9 million, from the $102.1 million for the five months ended December 31, 2001, to $93.2 million for the five months ended December 31, 2002. Alton, Riverside, Sioux City and Baton Rouge 2002 casino revenues remained relatively constant, decreasing from $334.9 million to $333.4 million. Increased competitive pressures due to an expanded facility by a competitor in August 2002 affected our Alton casino.            Casino expenses increased $100.0 million to $432.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $332.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Joliet incurred $124.4 million in casino expenses for the year ended December 31, 2002, and $48.3 million for the five months of operations from our acquisition through December 31, 2001, a $76.1 million increase. Joliet's casino expenses for the five months ended December 31, 2002, were $47.6 million, a $0.7 million decrease compared to the five months of operations from our purchase through December 31, 2001. The remaining increase is due primarily to increased gaming taxes of $23.7 million at our Lawrenceburg casino corresponding to an increase in revenue with dockside gaming and an increase in gaming tax rates. Based on 2002 casino revenues, our casino expense would have been approximately $33 million lower in 2002 without the changes in gaming tax rates.             SIZE=2> Admissions Admissions revenues (net of complimentary admissions) decreased to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This reduction is due primarily to a reduction in the admissions price during 2002 at Lawrenceburg.              SIZE=2> Food, Beverage and Other Food, beverage and other revenues increased from $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $97.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Joliet contributed $11.9 million of this increase in food, beverage and other revenue. Food, beverage and other net profit improved $4.9 million to $25.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Of the increase, Joliet and Baton Rouge (including hotel operations) contributed $3.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, of this net profit.             SIZE=2> Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $14.9 million from $118.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, to $133.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, due primarily to a $7.5 million increase in Joliet's expenses to $15.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $8.2 million for the five months ended December 31, 2001. The remaining increase is due primarily to an increase of $4.1 million in city development fees in Lawrenceburg due to the increase in revenues related to the commencement of dockside gaming effective August 1, 2002.             SIZE=2> Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $4.6 million to $40.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Joliet incurred $10.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 and $4.2 million for the five months ended December 31, 2001. Other operating expenses in 2001 include a charge of $1.9 million relating to the abandonment of the proposed Kenosha casino development.             SIZE=2> Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $0.1 million to $47.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $47.3 million in 2001. Joliet's expense    18           increased $5.9 million from $4.0 million for the five months ended December 31, 2001 to $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Depreciation expense also increased due to accelerated depreciation of $0.6 million on planned asset retirements and $0.5 million on our new data warehouse placed in service during the third quarter 2002. These increases are offset by no longer amortizing goodwill in 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January 1, 2002. If SFAS 142 had been in effect January 1, 2001, pre-tax goodwill amortization of $7.8 million would not have been recorded for the year ended December 31, 2001. All goodwill is subject to impairment testing at least annually. Based on our evaluations performed during 2002, we have no impairment to record.              SIZE=2> Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $14.4 million to $81.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, from $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to additional borrowings in connection with the Lawrenceburg and Joliet acquisitions.             SIZE=2> Minority Interests We had no minority interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease is attributable to our Lawrenceburg casino minority interest acquisitions during the first quarter of 2001. As the sole owner, we no longer incur minority interest expense.             SIZE=2> Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $57.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to income tax expense of $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, due to increased pretax earnings and an increase in our effective corporate income tax rate due to an increase in Indiana tax rates.             SIZE=2> Net Income Net income was $71.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared to $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, due primarily to the factors discussed above. If SFAS 142 had been in effect January 1, 2001, our net income would have increased by $4.6 million to $70.7 million and our diluted net income per share would have increased by $0.16 to $2.41 for the year ended December 31, 2001.    Year ended December 31, 2001, compared to year ended December 31, 2000              Casino Casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, increased $124.5 million, or 18.9% to $783.4 million from $658.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Alton, Riverside, Sioux City and Baton Rouge reported an aggregate 6.4% increase in casino revenues from $314.9 million to $334.9 million. Lawrenceburg casino revenues increased $2.4 million, or 0.7% to $346.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $344.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Empress Casino Joliet, acquired July 31, 2001, recorded $102.1 million in casino revenue for the five months since acquisition through December 31, 2001. Each of our casinos reported increases in average win per passenger for the year ended December 31, 2001, versus the year ended December 31, 2000.            Casino expenses increased 22.1% to $332.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $272.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Joliet incurred $48.3 million in casino expenses during the five months of operations since our acquisition. The remaining increase is due to increased gaming taxes totaling $7.5 million and increases in other casino expenses, primarily payroll related, of $4.2 million to support the overall increased revenues.             SIZE=2> Admissions Admissions revenues (net of complimentary admissions) were $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. This reduction is due to an increase in complimentary admissions given to customers as part of Lawrenceburg's marketing program in response to increased competition.    19                   SIZE=2> Food, Beverage and Other Food, beverage and other revenues increased from $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Joliet contributed $9.5 million of this increase in food, beverage and other revenue. Food, beverage and other net profit improved $0.9 million to $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Joliet contributed $1.5 million of this net profit, offset by small reductions in net profit at other properties.             SIZE=2> Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.7% from $107.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, to $118.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Joliet had $8.2 million in selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining increase is due to increased costs associated with the overall increase in revenues at all of our other properties.             SIZE=2> Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses increased by $6.1 million to $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $30.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. Joliet accounted for $4.2 million of the increase with the remaining portion of the increase due to the write-off of the proposed Kenosha casino development.             SIZE=2> Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization increased $11.2 million to $47.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, from $36.1 million in 2000. This increase is primarily due to the $6.6 million in incremental goodwill amortization related to the Lawrenceburg acquisition during the first quarter of 2001 and depreciation and intangible amortization expense of $4.0 million resulting from the Joliet acquisition on July 31, 2001. In accordance with SFAS No. 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January 1, 2002, we will no longer amortize our goodwill. All goodwill will be subject to impairment testing at least annually. Pre-tax goodwill amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2001 would have decreased by $7.8 million had SFAS No. 142 been effective for 2001 for goodwill acquired prior to July 1, 2001.             SIZE=2> Interest Expense Net interest expense increased $33.4 million to $66.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This increase is primarily attributable to additional borrowings in connection with the Lawrenceburg and Joliet acquisitions.             SIZE=2> Minority Interests Our minority interest expense decreased by $36.4 million to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease is attributable to our Lawrenceburg casino minority interest acquisitions during the first quarter of 2001. As the sole owner, we no longer incur minority interest expense.             SIZE=2> Income Tax Expense We recorded income tax expense of $46.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to income tax expense of $31.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due to increased pretax earnings, net of minority interest expense.             SIZE=2> Extraordinary Loss We recorded an extraordinary loss of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, related to completion of the final phase of the 1999 refinancing. This extraordinary loss is net of a $0.8 million tax benefit.             SIZE=2> Net Income Attributable to Common Stockholders Net income attributable to common stockholders was $66.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, compared to $45.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, due primarily to the factors discussed above.     Liquidity and Capital Resources             During 2002, we generated cash flows from operating activities of $165.6 million compared to $138.5 million for 2001. This increase is attributable to our increase in operating income of $26.9 million, an increase in our cash flow from working capital of $10.4 million throughout our properties, offset by an increase in interest expense of $13.7 million.    20                  During 2002, we used cash flows for investing activities of $56.3 million versus $848.3 million for 2001. During 2002, our investing activities included $56.7 million for purchases of property and equipment, a $26.5 million increase over our property and equipment purchases in 2001. This increase is due primarily to construction and expansion projects at our Joliet, Sioux City and Riverside facilities, plus renovation at our Baton Rouge casino. Capital expenditures in 2002 consisted of $23.1 million in maintenance capital and $33.6 million in project capital, primarily for the expansion projects mentioned above. 2001 includes $366.7 million and $451.6 million used for the purchase of the minority interests in Lawrenceburg and the acquisition of the Empress Casino Joliet, respectively.             During 2002, we used $106.8 million in financing activities compared to providing $707.6 million in cash flows from financing activities in 2001. During 2002, we paid down $103.9 million on our revolving Credit Facility. During 2001, we received proceeds of $748.8 million through the issuance of Subordinated Notes and borrowings under our Credit Facility. We used these funds for the purchase of the Lawrenceburg minority interests and our acquisition of the Empress Casino Joliet. Also during 2001, we spent $20.6 million in financing fees related to the Lawrenceburg and Empress Casino Joliet acquisitions.            At December 31, 2002, we had approximately $59.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. At December 31, 2002, we had outstanding $329.2 million on our Senior Secured Credit Facility ($58.3 million on our revolving Credit Facility and $270.9 million on our Term Loan) and $557.5 million of Subordinated Notes (due in June 2009 and September 2011), including $7.5 million of unamortized premium. As of December 31, 2002, we had outstanding letters of credit of $7.5 million. As of February 20, 2003, availability under the Credit Facility was approximately $183.8 million. We have no off balance sheet debt.            The Subordinated Notes and Credit Facility contain certain restrictions on the payment of dividends on our common stock and the occurrence of additional indebtedness, as well as other typical debt covenants. In addition, the Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios as follows: (1) Total Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio of a maximum of 4.25 to 1.0; (2) Senior Leverage Ratio of a maximum of 2.50 to 1.0; (3) Fixed Charge Ratio of a minimum of 1.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2002, we are in compliance with these ratios.            We have made a significant investment in property and equipment and plan to make significant additional investments at our existing properties. In 2002, we have begun construction on major projects at our Riverside, Joliet and Sioux City properties. We have spent approximately $10.1 million, $19.4 million and $3.8 million, respectively, in 2002 on these renovations. In 2003, we expect to spend approximately $115 million to complete these projects. In addition, we expect maintenance capital expenditures primarily related to the purchase of new cashless gaming product and facility enhancements to be approximately $40 million in 2003.             Consistent with gaming industry practice, we conduct our operations with a net working capital deficit. Unlike traditional industrial companies, a gaming company's balance sheet has limited accounts receivable and inventories. In addition, casinos generate significant cash on a daily basis. We generally apply our daily cash flows to pay down indebtedness under our revolving Credit Facility and pay our current liabilities pursuant to their normal cycles. Given the significant daily cash flows generated by our operations and the financial flexibility provided by our Credit Facility, the existence of a working capital deficit has no impact on our ability to operate our business or meet our obligations as they become due. We believe that cash on hand, operating cash flows and funds available under our Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating, capital expenditure and debt service obligations for the next 12 months.    21                  Contractual obligations, as of December 31, 2002, mature as follows:             One year  and less     1 - 3 years     4 - 5 years     After 5 years     Total    Debt     $  4,469     $  9,062     $  194,578     $  682,675     $  890,784    Operating leases        1,993        1,176        491        16,124        19,784                                Total     $  6,462     $  10,238     $  195,069     $  698,799     $  910,568                                Critical Accounting Estimates             Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which requires our management to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We have summarized our significant accounting policies in Note 1 to our notes to consolidated financial statements. Of our accounting policies, we believe the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.              SIZE=2> Goodwill We have approximately $727 million of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet at December 31, 2002, related to acquisitions. We regularly evaluate our acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators. Additionally, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," on January 1, 2002, that require us to perform impairment testing at least annually. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on, among other things, the regulatory and market status and operational performance of each of our acquired businesses. If these estimates or related assumptions change in the future, impairment charges would be recorded that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.              SIZE=2> Property and Equipment Our operations are capital intensive and we have made significant capital investments in each of our properties. At December 31, 2002, we have approximately $455.9 million of net property and equipment recorded on our balance sheet. We depreciate our assets on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimates of the useful lives are based on the nature of the asset as well as our current operating strategy. Future events, such as property expansions, new competition and new regulations, could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets. In assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property and equipment, we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. If these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.             SIZE=2> Insurance Accruals Our insurance policies for employee health, workers' compensation and general patron liability have significant deductible levels on an individual claim basis. We accrue a liability for known workers' compensation and general patron liability based upon claims reserves established by the third party administrator processing our claims. Additionally, we accrue an amount for incurred but not reported claims based on our historical experience and other factors. Our employee health insurance benefit accrual is based on our historical claims experience rate including an estimated lag factor. These accruals involve complex estimates and could be significantly affected should current claims vary from historical levels. Management reviews our insurance accruals for adequacy at the end of each reporting period.             SIZE=2> Effective Gaming Tax Rates We record gaming taxes based upon effective gaming tax rates for each of our casinos. These effective rates are based upon statutory gaming tax rates and estimates of annual casino revenues. Increases or decreases in our actual or estimated casino revenues or changes in statutory gaming tax rates could require changes to our effective gaming tax rates. Management reviews our effective gaming tax rates at the end of each reporting period.    22          Market RiskInterest Rate Sensitivity             The market risk inherent in our financial instruments is the potential loss in fair value arising from adverse changes in interest rates. The following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates and estimated fair value of our debt obligations.             2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     Thereafter     Total     Fair Value  12/31/02          (dollars in thousands)      Fixed rate debt maturities     $  1,719     $  1,898     $  1,664     $  1,382     $  1,521     $  553,425     $  561,609     $  601,092    Average interest rate        10.6  %     10.6  %     10.7  %     10.7  %     10.7  %     10.1  %                    Variable rate debt maturities     $   2,750     $   2,750     $   2,750     $   61,050     $   130,625     $   129,250     $   329,175     $   330,529    Average interest rate        4.6  %     4.6  %     4.6  %     4.3  %     4.6  %     4.6  %                              We use interest rate swap agreements from separate financial institutions to manage our interest rate risk associated with our Term Loan as required under the Credit Facility. We have entered into three interest rate swaps that have fixed the interest rate as of October 31, 2001, for a combined original notional amount of $200 million of our variable rate Term Loan under our Credit Facility. The three separate swap agreements carry original notional amounts of $100 million, $50 million and $50 million. For each swap agreement, we agree to receive a floating rate of interest on the notional principal amount based upon a three month LIBOR rate (plus a 2.75% spread) in exchange for fixed rates ranging from 6.19% to 6.27%. All three swap agreements mature on September 30, 2004. Two of the three swap agreements have reductions in the notional amounts proportionally with the quarterly payments on the Term Loan beginning December 31, 2001. The total notional amounts are $198.8 million at December 31, 2002. As a result of all three swap agreements, we have, in effect, converted 73.4% of our Term Loan variable rate debt under our Credit Facility to fixed rate debt at December 31, 2002.            At December 31, 2002, the fair value of our swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet in other liabilities ($6.0 million pretax) and the related change in fair value of these agreements is included in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income ($3.6 million, net of taxes of $2.4 million).
