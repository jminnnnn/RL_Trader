Consolidated Results: 2016 Compared with 2015                We reported net revenues of $34,631 million in 2016, compared with $35,155 million in 2015. For2016, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,979 million, or $2.92 per diluted common share, compared with $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, in 2015.               Results for 2016 included net discrete tax benefits of $68 million or $0.04 per diluted common share,primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters. Results for 2015 included netdiscrete tax benefits of $564 million or $0.29 per diluted common share, primarily associated with the repatriation of  non-U.S.  earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated, and positive revenuesdue to the impact of debt valuation adjustment (DVA) of $618 million or $0.20 per diluted common share.

Results for 2015 and 2014 are not restated pursuant to that guidance.                Net revenues were $34,631 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,979 million, or $2.92 perdiluted common share, in 2016 compared with net revenues of $34,537 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $5,728 million, or $2.70 per diluted common share, excluding DVA in 2015. Excluding the net discrete tax benefits, net incomeapplicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,911 million, or $2.88 per diluted common share, in 2016 compared with net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $5,164 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, excluding both DVA and the net discrete taxbenefits in 2015. (see Selected Non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Non-GAAP) Financial Information herein).   Consolidated Results: 2015 Compared with 2014                We reported net revenues of $35,155 million in 2015, compared with $34,275 million in 2014. In 2015,net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $6,127 million, or $2.90 per diluted common share, compared with $3,467 million, or $1.60 per diluted common share in 2014.               Results for 2015 included net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, or $0.29 per diluted common share,primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated, and positive revenues due to the impact of DVA of $618 million, or $0.20 per diluted common share. Results for 2014 included net discrete taxbenefits of $2,226 million, or $1.13 per diluted common share, due to the release of a deferred tax liability associated with a legal entity restructuring, remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status ofa multi-year tax examination, and the repatriation of non-U.S. earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. For a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncomeTax Matters herein. Results for 2014 also included positive revenues associated with DVA of $651 million, or $0.21 per diluted common share. Results for 2014 also included litigation costs related to residential mortgage-backed securities andcredit crisis matters of $3,083 million, or a loss of $1.47 per diluted common share, 2014 compensation actions ofapproxi-            mately $1,137 million (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein), or a loss of $0.39 per diluted common share, anda funding valuation adjustment (FVA) implementation charge of $468 million, or a loss of $0.17 per diluted common share.                Excluding DVA, net revenues were $34,537 million and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,728million, or $2.70 per diluted common share, in 2015 compared with net revenues of $33,624 million, and net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $3,049 million, or $1.39 per diluted common share, in 2014. Excluding both DVA and the net discrete taxbenefits, net income applicable to Morgan Stanley was $5,164 million, or $2.41 per diluted common share, in 2015 compared with net income applicable to Morgan Stanley of $823 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, in 2014 (see SelectedNon-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (Non-GAAP) Financial Information herein). For a further discussion of the net discrete tax benefits, see Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome TaxMatters herein.    Business Segment Net Revenues: 2016 Compared with 2015               Institutional Securities net revenues of $17,459 million in 2016 decreased 3% compared with$17,953 million in 2015, primarily as a result of lower Investment banking and sales and trading revenues, partially offset by higher Other revenues.                Wealth Management net revenues of $15,350 million in 2016 increased 2% from $15,100 million in 2015,primarily as a result of growth in Net interest income, partially offset by lower Commissions and fees and Investment banking revenues.                Investment Management net revenues of $2,112 million in 2016 decreased 9% from $2,315 million in2015, primarily reflecting weaker investment performance compared with 2015. This was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with Asia private equity that did not  re-occur  in 2016.Asset management fees in 2016 were relatively unchanged from 2015.    Business Segment Net Revenues: 2015 Compared with 2014               Institutional Securities net revenues of $17,953 million in 2015 increased 6% compared with$16,871 million in 2014, primarily as a result of higher sales and trading net revenues, partially offset by lower Other revenues and lower revenues in Investment banking.               Wealth Management net revenues of $15,100 million in 2015 increased 1% from $14,888 million in 2014,primarily as a result of higher Net interest income and asset management revenues, partially offset by lower transactional revenues.               December 2016 Form 10-K     34              Managements Discussion and Analysis                      Investment Management net revenues of $2,315 million in 2015 decreased 15% from $2,712 million in2014, primarily reflecting the reversal of previously accrued carried interest, reduction in revenues attributable to  non-controlling  interests and markdowns on principal investments.   Consolidated  Non-Interest  Expenses: 2016 Compared with 2015               Compensation and benefits expenses of $15,878 million in 2016 decreased 1% from $16,016 million in2015, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severance costs, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.               Non-compensation  expenses were $9,905 million in 2016 comparedwith $10,644 million in 2015, representing a 7% decrease, primarily due to lower litigation costs and expense management.   Consolidated  Non-Interest  Expenses: 2015 Compared with 2014               Compensation and benefits expenses of $16,016 million in 2015 decreased 10% from $17,824 million in2014, primarily as a result of the 2014 compensation actions, and a decrease in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, related carried interest, and the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see alsoSupplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).                Non-compensation  expenses were $10,644 million in 2015 comparedwith $12,860 million in 2014, representing a 17% decrease, primarily due to lower litigation costs in the Institutional Securities business segment associated with residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis-related matters.   Return on Average Common Equity                For 2016, the return on average common equity and the return on average common equity, excluding DVA was 8.0%,or 7.9% excluding DVA and the net discrete tax benefits. For 2015, the return on average common equity was 8.5%, or 7.8% excluding DVA, and 7.0% excluding DVA and the net discrete tax benefits.

Pre-tax  profit margin is a  non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be a useful measure to us, investors and analysts to assess operating performance and represents income from continuing operations before income taxes as a percentage of net revenues.     2.    Average common equity and return on average common equity are  non-GAAP financial measures we consider to be useful measures to us, investors and analysts to assess capital adequacy and to allow better comparability of  period-to-period operating performance. Average common equity for each business segment is determined using our Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy measure (see Liquidity and Capital ResourcesRegulatory RequirementsAttributionof Average Common Equity according to the Required Capital Framework herein). Each business segments return on average common equity equals net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less an allocation of preferred dividends as a percentageof average common equity for that segment. Consolidated return on average common equity equals consolidated net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average common equity.     3.    In 2016, in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update  Recognition and Measurementof Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , unrealized DVA gains (losses) are recorded within OCI in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. For 2015 and 2014, DVA gains (losses) were recorded within Trading revenues in theconsolidated income statements.

For a discussion of tangible common equity, see Liquidity and CapitalResourcesTangible Equity herein.     2.    Return on average common equity equals consolidated net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends asa percentage of average common equity. Effective January 1, 2016, as a result of the adoption of a provision of the accounting update related to DVA, we have redefined the calculations of the return on average common equity excluding DVA, andexcluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits to adjust for DVA only in the denominator. Prior to January 1, 2016, for the return on average common equity measures, where DVA is excluded, both the numerator and denominator were adjusted toexclude the impact of DVA. When excluding the net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and denominator are adjusted to exclude that item in all periods.     3.    The impact of DVA on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $(183) million, $(637)million and $(1,108) million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The impact of the net discrete tax benefits on average common equity and average tangible common equity was approximately $(40) million, $434 million and $713 millionin 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.     4.    Return on average tangible common equity equals net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as apercentage of average tangible common equity. Effective January 1, 2016, as a result of the adoption of a provision of the accounting update related to DVA, we have redefined the calculations of return on average tangible common equityexcluding DVA, and excluding DVA and net discrete tax benefits to adjust for DVA only in the denominator. Prior to January 1, 2016, for the return on average tangible common equity measures, where DVA is excluded, both the numerator and thedenominator were adjusted to exclude the impact of DVA. When excluding the net discrete tax benefits, both the numerator and denominator are adjusted to exclude that item in all periods. The impact of DVA was insignificant in 2016 and 0.8% and 0.9%in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The impact of the net discrete tax benefits was 0.1%, 0.9% and 3.9% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.     5.

We plan to progress toward achieving our Return on Equity Target through the following key elements of ourstrategy:               Revenue and profitability growth:                 Wealth Management  pre-tax  margin improvement to approximately 23% to25% through net interest income growth via continued high-quality lending, expense efficiency and business growth;                   Continued strength in Investment Banking and Equity Sales and Trading results;                  Stable performance in Fixed Income Sales and Trading and Investment Management;               Expense efficiency:                 Successful completion of Project Streamline, our expense savings program launched in 2016 to reduce expensesby $1 billion by 2017 (not including any outsized litigation expense or penalties) assuming a flat revenue environment, resulting in an expense efficiency target ratio of 74%;               Sufficient capital:                  Increasing capital returns to shareholders, subject to regulatory approval.   Our Return on Equity Target and the related strategies and goals are forward-looking statements that may be materially affected by manyfactors, including, among other things: macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and regulatory developments; industry trading and investment banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate environment; legal expenses and theability to reduce expenses in general; capital levels; and discrete tax items. Given the uncertainties surrounding these and other factors, there are significant risks that our Return on Equity Target and the related strategies and goals maynot be realized. Actual results may differ from our goals and targets, and the differences may be material and adverse. Accordingly, we caution that undue reliance should not be placed on any of these forward-looking statements. SeeForward-Looking Statements immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A for additional information regarding these forward-lookingstatements.  Return on average common equity and  pre-tax  margin are  non-GAAP  financial measures that we consider to be a useful measure to us, investors and analysts to assess operating performance. See Selected  Non-Generally  AcceptedAccounting Principles  (Non-GAAP)  Financial Information herein. Our expense efficiency ratio represents total  non-interest  expenses as a percentage ofnet revenues. For 2016, our expense efficiency ratio was 74.5%, which was calculated as  non-interest  expenses of $25,783 million divided by net revenues of $34,631 million.   Business Segments   Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating expenses are directly attributable to our business segments. Certain revenues andexpenses have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues,  non-interest  expenses or other relevant measures.   As a result of treating certain intersegment transactions as transactions with external parties, we include an Intersegment Eliminationscategory to reconcile the business segment results to our consolidated results.    Net Revenues   Investment Banking.     Investment banking revenues are composed of fees from advisory services and revenues fromthe underwriting of securities offerings and syndication of loans, net of syndication expenses.   Trading.     Trading revenues include revenues from customers purchases and sales of financialinstruments in which we act as a market maker, as well as gains and losses on our related positions and other positions carried at fair value. Trading revenues include the realized gains and losses from sales of cash instruments and derivativesettlements, unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changes of our positions related to market-making activities, and gains and losses related to investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans and otherpositions carried at fair value. In many markets, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale transactions will include any spreads between bids and offers. Certain fees received on loans carried at fair value anddividends from equity securities are also recorded in Trading revenues since they relate to positions carried at fair value.    As a marketmaker, we stand ready to buy, sell or otherwise transact with customers under a variety of market conditions and to provide firm or indicative prices in response to customer requests. Our liquidity obligations can be explicit in some cases, and inothers, customers expect us to be willing to transact with them. In order to most effectively fulfill our                   37     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             market-making function, we engage in activities across all of our trading businesses that include, but are not limited to:        (i)    taking positions in anticipation of, and in response to, customer demand to buy or sell anddepending onthe liquidity of the relevant market and the size of the positionto hold those positions for a period of time;         (ii)    managing and assuming basis risk (risk associated with imperfect hedging) between customized customer risksand the standardized products available in the market to hedge those risks;         (iii)    building, maintaining and rebalancing inventory, through trades with other market participants, and engagingin accumulation activities to accommodate anticipated customer demand;         (iv)    trading in the market to remain current on pricing and trends; and        (v)    engaging in other activities to provide efficiency and liquidity for markets.   Although not included in Trading revenues, Interest income and expense are also impacted by market-making activities, as debt securities heldby us earn interest and securities are loaned, borrowed, sold with agreement to repurchase and purchased with agreement to resell.    Weoften invest in investments or other financial instruments to economically hedge our obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. Changes in the value of such investments are recorded in either Trading revenues or Investments revenues.Expenses associated with the related deferred compensation plans are recorded in Compensation and benefits. Generally, changes in compensation expense resulting from changes in fair value of the referenced investment will be offset by changes infair value of the investments made by us.    Investments.     Our investments generally are held for long-termappreciation, or as discussed above, for hedging purposes and generally are subject to significant sales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments may involve significant judgment and may fluctuate significantly over time in lightof business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions. In some cases, such investments are required or are a necessary part of offering other products.   The revenues recorded are the result of realized gains and losses from sales and unrealized gains and losses from ongoing fair value changesof our holdings, as well as from investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation and  co-investment  plans.  Typically, there are no fee revenues from these investments. The sales restrictions on theinvestments relate primarily to redemption and withdrawal restrictions on investments in certain Investment Management funds, which include investments made in connection with certain employee deferred compensation plans (see Note 3 to theconsolidated financial statements in Item 8). Restrictions on interests in exchanges and clearinghouses generally include a requirement to hold those interests for the period of time where we are clearing trades on that exchange or clearinghouse.Additionally, there are certain sponsored Investment Management funds consolidated by us primarily related to holders of noncontrolling interests.   Commissions and Fees.     Commission and fee revenues primarily arise from agency transactions in listed and  over-the-counter  (OTC) equity securities, services related to sales and trading activities, and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.Commissions received for purchasing and selling listed equity securities and options are recorded separately in Commissions and fees. Other cash and derivative instruments typically do not have fees associated with them, and fees for any relatedservices are recorded in Commissions and fees.    Asset Management, Distribution and AdministrationFees.     Asset management, distribution and administration fees include fees associated with the management and supervision of assets, account services and administration, performance-based fees relating to certainfunds, separately managed accounts, shareholder servicing and the distribution of certain open-ended mutual funds.    Asset management,distribution and administration fees in the Wealth Management business segment also include revenues from individual and institutional investors electing a  fee-based  pricing arrangement and fees for InvestmentManagement. Mutual fund distribution fees in the Wealth Management business segment are based on either the average daily fund net asset balances or average daily aggregate net fund sales and are affected by changes in the overall level and mix ofassets under management or supervision.    Asset management fees in the Investment Management business segment arise from investmentmanagement services we provide to investment vehicles pursuant to various contractual arrangements. We receive fees primarily based upon mutual fund daily average net assets or based on monthly or quarterly invested equity for other vehicles.Performance-based fees in the Investment Management business segment are earned on certain products as a percentage of appreciation earned by those products and, in certain cases, are based upon the achievement of performance criteria. These feesare normally earned annually and are recognized on a monthly or quarterly basis.                December 2016 Form 10-K     38              Managements Discussion and Analysis             Net Interest.     Interest income and Interest expense are afunction of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities, including Trading assets and Trading liabilities; Investment securities, which include available-for-sale (AFS) securities and held-to-maturity (HTM) securities;Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell; Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase; Loans; Deposits; Other short-term borrowings; Long-term borrowings; trading strategies; customer activity in the prime brokeragebusiness; and the prevailing level, term structure and volatility of interest rates.    Other.     Otherrevenues include revenues from equity method investments, realized gains and losses on AFS securities, gains and losses on loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.   Net Revenues by Segment   Institutional Securities.     Net revenues are composed of Investment banking revenues, Sales and trading netrevenues, Investments and Other revenues.    For information about the composition of Investment banking revenues, see NetRevenues herein.       Sales and trading net revenues are composed of Trading revenues; Commissions and fees; Assetmanagement, distribution and administration fees; and Net interest. In assessing the profitability of our sales and trading activities, we view these net revenues in the aggregate. In addition, decisions relating to trading are based on an overallreview of aggregate revenues and costs associated with each transaction or series of transactions. This review includes, among other things, an assessment of the potential gain or loss associated with a transaction, including any associatedcommissions and fees, dividends, the interest income or expense associated with financing or hedging our positions and other related expenses.   Sales and trading revenues are broken down into major business lines as follows: equity, fixed income and other. See Sales and TradingActivitiesEquity and Fixed Income for a description of the activities within equity and fixed income. Other sales and trading revenues include impacts from certain central treasury functions, such as liquidity costs and gains (losses) oneconomic hedges related to long-term borrowings, as well as certain activities associated with corporate lending activities.    Forinformation about revenue from Investments, see Net Revenues herein.    Other revenues include revenues from equity methodinvestments, gains and losses on loans held for sale, provision for loan losses, and other miscellaneous revenues.    WealthManagement.     Net revenues are composed of Transactional, Asset management, Net interest and Other revenues.  Transactional revenues include Investment banking, Trading, and Commissions and fees. Investmentbanking revenues include revenues from the distribution of equity and fixed income securities, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings,  closed-end  funds and unit trusts. Trading revenuesinclude revenues from customers purchases and sales of financial instruments, in which we act as principal, and gains and losses associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans. Revenues from Commissions and fees primarily arisefrom agency transactions in listed and OTC equity securities and sales of mutual funds, futures, insurance products and options.   Assetmanagement revenues include Asset management, distribution and administration fees, and referral fees related to the bank deposit program.   Net interest income includes interest related to the bank deposit program, interest on AFS securities and HTM securities, interest on lendingactivities and other net interest. Interest income and Interest expense are a function of the level and mix of total assets and liabilities. Net interest is driven by securities-based lending, mortgage lending, margin loans, securities borrowed andsecurities loaned transactions, and bank deposit program activity.    Other revenues include revenues from realized gains and losses on AFSsecurities, provision for loan losses, referral fees and other miscellaneous revenues.    InvestmentManagement.     Investments revenue is primarily earned on investments in certain  closed-end  funds that generally are held for long-term appreciation and generally subject tosales restrictions. Estimates of the fair value of the investments involve significant judgment and may fluctuate materially over time in light of business, market, economic and financial conditions generally or in relation to specific transactions.   For information about the composition of Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees, see Net Revenuesherein.       Compensation Expense   Compensation and benefits expense includes accruals for base salaries and fixed allowances, formulaic programs, discretionary incentivecompensation, amortization of deferred cash and equity awards, changes in fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments, carried interest, severance costs, and other items such as health and welfare benefits. The factors that drivecompensation for our employees vary from quarter to quarter, from segment to segment and within a segment. For certain revenue-producing employees in the Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, compensation is largely paid                   39     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             on the basis of formulaic payouts that link employee compensation to revenues. Compensation for certain employees, including revenue-producing employees in the Institutional Securities businesssegment, may also include incentive compensation that is determined following the assessment of the Firm, business unit and individual performance. Compensation for our remaining employees is largely fixed in nature (e.g., base salary, benefits,etc.).    Compensation expense for deferred cash-based compensation plans is calculated based on the notional value of the award granted,adjusted for upward and downward changes in fair value of the referenced investment, and is recognized ratably over the prescribed vesting period for the award. However, there may be a timing difference between the immediate revenue recognition ofgains and losses on our investments and the deferred recognition of the related compensation expense over the vesting period.    Income Taxes   The income tax provision for our business segments is generally determined based on the revenues, expenses and activitiesdirectly attributable to each business segment. Certain items have been allocated to each business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net revenues or other relevantmeasures.                December 2016 Form 10-K     40              Managements Discussion and Analysis             Institutional Securities   Income Statement Information                                              % Change      $ in millions     2016        2015        2014        2016        2015        Revenues                                   Investment banking     $      4,476        $      5,008        $      5,203           (11)%           (4)%        Trading        9,387           9,400           8,445                      11%        Investments        147           274           240           (46)%           14%        Commissions and fees        2,456           2,616           2,610           (6)%                   Asset management, distribution and administration fees        293           281           281           4%                   Other        535           221           684           142%           (68)%        Total  non-interest revenues        17,294           17,800           17,463           (3)%           2%        Interest income        4,005           3,190           3,389           26%           (6)%        Interest expense        3,840           3,037           3,981           26%           (24)%        Net interest        165           153           (592  )         8%           N/M        Net revenues        17,459           17,953           16,871           (3)%           6%        Compensation and benefits        6,275           6,467           7,786           (3)%           (17)%        Non-compensation expenses        6,061           6,815           9,143           (11)%           (25)%        Total  non-interest expenses        12,336           13,282           16,929           (7)%           (22)%        Income (loss) from continuing operations before incometaxes        5,123           4,671           (58  )         10%           N/M        Provision for (benefit from) income taxes        1,318           825           (90  )         60%           N/M        Income from continuing operations        3,805           3,846           32           (1)%           N/M        Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of incometaxes        (1  )         (17  )         (19  )         94%           11%        Net income        3,804           3,829           13           (1)%           N/M        Net income applicable to noncontrolling interests        155           133           109           17%           22%        Net income (loss) applicable to Morgan Stanley     $  3,649        $  3,696        $  (96  )         (1)%           N/M       N/MNot Meaningful   Investment Banking    Investment Banking Revenues                                             % Change      $ in millions     2016        2015        2014        2016        2015        Advisory revenues     $      2,220        $      1,967        $      1,634           13%           20%        Underwriting revenues:                                   Equity underwriting revenues        887           1,398           1,613           (37)%           (13)%        Fixed income underwriting revenues        1,369           1,643           1,956           (17)%           (16)%        Total underwriting revenues        2,256           3,041           3,569           (26)%           (15)%        Total investment banking revenues     $  4,476        $  5,008        $  5,203           (11)%           (4)%        Investment Banking Volumes                       $ in billions      2016 1         2015 1         2014 1        Completed mergers and acquisitions 2      $  1,006         $  662         $  625        Equity and equity-related offerings 3         45            67            72        Fixed incomeofferings 4         239            256            265            1.

Equity and equity-related offerings and fixed income offerings are based on full credit for single book managers and equal credit for joint book managers. Transaction volumes may not be indicative ofnet revenues in a given period. In addition, transaction volumes for prior periods may vary from amounts previously reported due to the subsequent withdrawal or change in the value of a transaction.     2.    Amounts include transactions of $100 million or more.     3.    Amounts include Rule 144A issuances and registered public offerings of common stock and convertible securities andrights offerings.     4.    Amounts include  non-convertible  preferred stock, mortgage-backed andasset-backed securities, and taxable municipal debt. Amounts include publicly registered and Rule 144A issues. Amounts exclude leveraged loans and  self-led  issuances.   2016 Compared with 2015    Investmentbanking revenues of $4,476 million in 2016 decreased 11% from 2015 due to lower underwriting revenues, partially offset by an increase in advisory revenues in 2016.                Advisory revenues increased reflecting the higher dollar volume of completed merger, acquisition andrestructuring transactions (M&A) activity (see Investment Banking Volumes table). As the number of completed transactions decreased in 2016 versus 2015, the 2016 revenue increase was at a lower rate than the percentage increasein dollar volume.                Equity underwriting revenues decreased as a result of lower equity-related offerings in 2016 (see InvestmentBanking Volumes table). Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased in 2016, primarily due to lower bond and loan fees.    2015Compared with 2014    Investment banking revenues of $5,008 million in 2015 decreased 4% from 2014 due to lower underwritingrevenues, partially offset by higher advisory revenues.                Advisory revenues increased led primarily by M&A fee realization in the Americas.               Equity underwriting revenues decreased on reduced volumes driven by lower initial public offerings (seeInvestment Banking Volumes table). Fixed income underwriting revenues decreased primarily driven by lower  non-investment  grade bond and loan fees.                   41     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             Sales and Trading Net Revenues   By Income Statement Line Item                       $ in millions      2016         2015         2014        Trading      $  9,387         $  9,400         $  8,445        Commissions and fees         2,456            2,616            2,610        Asset management, distribution and administration fees         293            281            281        Net interest         165            153            (592  )      Total sales and trading net revenues      $      12,301         $      12,450         $      10,744       By Business                                                                % Change      $ in millions     2016        2015        2014        2016        2015        EquityU.S. GAAP     $  8,037        $  8,288        $  7,135           (3  )%         16  %      Impact ofDVA 1                   (163  )         (232  )         100  %         30  %      Impact ofFVA 2                              2                      (100  )%     Equitynon-GAAP     $  8,037        $  8,125        $  6,905           (1  )%         18  %      Fixed incomeU.S. GAAP 3     $  5,117        $  4,758        $  4,214           8  %         13  %      Impact ofDVA 1                   (455  )         (419  )         100  %         (9  )%      Impact ofFVA 2                              466                      (100  )%      Fixed incomenon-GAAP     $  5,117        $  4,303        $  4,261           19  %         1  %      OtherU.S. GAAP        (853  )         (596  )         (605  )         (43  )%         1  %      TotalU.S. GAAP     $  12,301        $  12,450        $  10,744           (1  )%         16  %      TotalImpact of DVA 1                   (618  )         (651  )         100  %         5  %      TotalImpact of FVA 2                              468                      (100  )%     Totalnon-GAAP     $  12,301        $  11,832        $  10,561           4  %         12  %          1.

Effective in 2016, the Institutional Securities Fixed Income and Commodities business has been renamed theFixed Income business.    Sales and trading net revenues, including equity and fixed income sales and tradingnet revenues that exclude the impact of DVA in 2015, or exclude the impact of DVA and the initial implementation of FVA in 2014, are  non-GAAP  financial measures that we consider useful for us, investors andanalysts to allow further comparability of  period-to-period  operating performance.   Sales and Trading Activities  Equity and Fixed Income    Following is a description of the sales and trading activities within our equities and fixed income businesses as well as  how their results impact the income statement line items, followed by a presentation and explanation of results.   EquitiesFinancing.     We provide financing and prime brokerage services to our clients active in the equitymarkets through a variety of products including margin lending, securities lending and swaps. Results from this business are largely driven by the difference between financing income earned and financing costs incurred, which are reflected in Netinterest for securities and equity lending products and in Trading revenues for derivative products.    EquitiesExecutionservices.     We make markets for our clients in equity-related securities and derivative products, including providing liquidity and hedging products. A significant portion of the results for this business is generated bycommissions and fees from executing and clearing client transactions on major stock and derivative exchanges as well as from OTC transactions. Market-making also generates gains and losses on inventory, which are reflected in Trading revenues.   Fixed income Within fixed income we make markets in order to facilitate client activity as part of the following products andservices.                Global macro products.     We make markets for our clients in interest rate, foreignexchange and emerging market products, including exchange-traded and OTC securities, loans and derivative instruments. The results of this market-making activity are primarily driven by gains and losses from buying and selling positions to standready for and satisfy client demand and are recorded in Trading revenues.                Credit products.     We make markets in credit-sensitive products, such as corporatebonds and mortgage securities and other securitized products, and related derivative instruments. The value of positions in this business are sensitive to changes in credit spreads and interest rates, which result in gains and losses reflected inTrading revenues. Due to the amount and type of the interest-bearing securities and loans making up this business, a significant portion of the results is also reflected in Net interest revenues.               Commodities products.     We make markets in various commodity products relatedprimarily to electricity, natural gas, oil, and precious metals, with the results primarily reflected in Trading revenues.               December 2016 Form 10-K     42              Managements Discussion and Analysis             Sales and Trading Net RevenuesEquity and Fixed Income                                 2016      $ in millions      Trading         Fees 1         Net Interest 2        Total        Financing      $  3,668         $  347         $  (283  )      $    3,732        Execution services         2,231            2,241            (167  )         4,305        Total Equity      $  5,899         $  2,588         $  (450  )      $  8,037              Total Fixed Income      $  4,115         $  162         $  840        $  5,117                                     2015      $ in millions      Trading         Fees 1         Net Interest 2        Total        Financing      $  3,300         $  322         $  126        $    3,748        Execution services         2,210            2,437            (270  )         4,377        Impact ofDVA 3         163                                   163        Total Equity      $  5,673         $  2,759         $  (144  )      $  8,288              Fixed Income      $  3,333         $  139         $  831        $  4,303        Impact ofDVA 3         455                                   455        Total Fixed Income      $  3,788         $  139         $  831        $  4,758                                     2014      $ in millions      Trading        Fees 1         Net Interest 2        Total        Financing      $  2,843        $  283         $  23        $    3,149        Execution services         1,623           2,473            (340  )         3,756        Impact ofDVA 3         232                                  232        Impact of FVA         (2  )                                (2  )      Total Equity      $  4,696        $  2,756         $  (317  )      $  7,135              Fixed Income      $  3,824        $  136         $  301        $  4,261        Impact ofDVA 3         419                                  419        Impact of FVA         (466  )                                (466  )      Total Fixed Income      $  3,777        $  136         $  301        $  4,214            1.    Includes Commissions and fees and Asset management, distribution and administration fees.     2.    Funding costs are allocated to the businesses based on funding usage and are included in Net interest in the previoustables. Such allocations were estimated for prior periods to conform to the current presentation.     3.    In 2016, in accordance with the early adoption of a provision of the accounting update  Recognition and Measurementof Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , unrealized DVA gains (losses) are recorded within OCI in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. In 2015 and 2014, the DVA gains (losses) were recorded within Trading revenues in theconsolidated income statements. See Notes 2 and 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.   As discussed in Net Revenues by Segment herein, we manage each of the sales and trading businesses based on its aggregate netrevenues, which are comprised of the consolidated income statement line items quantified in the previous table. Trading revenues are affected by a variety of market dynamics, including volumes,  bid-offer spreads, and inventory prices, as well as impacts from hedging activity, which are interrelated. We provide qualitative commentary in the discussion of results that follow on the key drivers of period  over period variances, as the quantitative impact of the various market dynamics typically cannot be disaggregated.   For additional information on total Trading revenues, see the table Trading Revenues by Product Type in Note 4 to the consolidatedfinancial statements in Item 8.    2016 Compared with 2015   Equity    Excluding the$163 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, equity sales and trading net revenues of $8,037 million in 2016 were lower than 2015, reflecting lower results in both financing and execution services revenues.               Financing revenues were in line with the results from 2015 as Net interest revenues declined from higher netinterest costs, reflecting the business increased portion of global liquidity reserve requirements, offset by increased client activity in equity swaps reflected in Trading.               Execution services decreased 2% from 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in fee revenues of$196 million due to reduced client activity.    Fixed Income   Excluding the $455 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, fixed income net revenues of $5,117 million in 2016 were 19%higher than 2015, primarily due to improved results in credit products.                Credit products Trading revenues were the primary driver for the overall increase in fixed income Tradingrevenues of $782 million, reflecting an improved credit market environment that resulted in gains on inventory in 2016 compared with losses in 2015.                Overall results from other fixed income businesses were relatively unchanged. There was a net increase inTrading revenues from global macro products, reflecting gains on inventory in interest rate products, offset by declines in commodities activities, primarily due to the absence of revenues from the global oil merchanting business, which was sold onNovember 1, 2015. For more information on the sale of the global oil merchanting business, see Investments, Other Revenues,  Non-interest  Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and OtherItems2015 Compared with 2014Dispositions herein.    Other               Other sales and trading net losses of $853 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflectinglosses in 2016 associated with corporate loan hedging activity.                    43     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             2015 Compared with 2014   Equity    Equity sales and tradingnet revenues, excluding the impact of DVA and the implementation of FVA, increased reflecting higher results in financing and execution services revenues.                Financing revenues increased 19% from 2014 with an increase in client balances and derivative activityreflected in the $457 million increase in Trading revenues primarily from equity swaps and a $103 million increase in Net interest revenues for securities.               Execution services increased 17% from 2014, primarily due to the $587 million increase in Tradingrevenues from client activity in derivatives and reduced inventory losses compared with the prior year.    Fixed Income   Excluding the $455 million positive impact of DVA on 2015 results, and the $419 million positive impact of DVA and the$466 million negative impact from the implementation of FVA on 2014 results, fixed income net revenues of $4,303 million in 2015 were 1% higher than 2014 due to improved results in global macro and commodities products, offset by lowerresults in credit products.                Global macro products results increased from 2014, primarily due to an increase in Trading revenues due toimproved results in interest rate products as a result of inventory gains and improved performance in foreign exchange products                Credit products decreased, primarily driven by a decrease in Trading revenues from lower results in credit andsecuritized products from a widening credit spread environment, which led to inventory losses. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in Net interest revenues, driven primarily by a change in the product mix in the securitized productsgroup assets.                Commodities products net revenues increased, primarily reflecting higher revenues from the global oilmerchanting business, which was sold on November 1, 2015. The increase was partially offset by credit-driven losses and the absence of revenues from TransMontaigne Inc., which was sold on July 1, 2014 (see Investments, OtherRevenues,  Non-interest  Expenses, Income Tax Items, Dispositions and Other Items2015 Compared with 2014Dispositions herein).  Investments, Other Revenues,  Non-interest  Expenses, Income TaxItems, Dispositions and Other Items    2016 Compared with 2015   Investments                Net investment gains of $147 million in 2016 decreased from 2015 as a result of lower gains on realestate and business-related investments and losses on investments associated with our compensation plans compared with gains in 2015.   Other                Other revenues of $535 million in 2016 increased from 2015, primarily reflecting  mark-to-market  gains on loans held for sale in 2016 compared with  mark-to-market  losses in2015, partially offset by lower results related to our 40% stake in Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd. (MUMSS) (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information).   Non-interest  Expenses   Non-interest  expenses of $12,336 million in 2016 decreased from 2015, primarily reflecting a 3%reduction in Compensation and benefits expenses and an 11% reduction in  Non-compensation  expenses in 2016.                Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in salaries, severancecosts, discretionary incentive compensation and employer taxes, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments.               Non-compensation  expenses decreased in 2016, primarily due to lowerlitigation costs and Professional services expense. In 2015,  Non-compensation  expenses included increases to reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap (CDS) antitrust litigation matterand legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters.    2015 Compared with 2014   Investments                Net investment gains of $274 million in 2015 increased 14% from 2014 driven by gains on business-relatedinvestments.    Other                Other revenues of $221 million in 2015 decreased 68% from 2014 due to the absence of gains realized oncertain assets sold in 2014 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8) and markdowns and provisions on loans held for sale and held for investment.               December 2016 Form 10-K     44              Managements Discussion and Analysis             Non-interest  Expenses   Non-interest  expenses of $13,282 million in 2015 decreased 22% from 2014 driven by a 25%reduction in  Non-compensation  expenses and a 17% reduction in Compensation and benefits expenses.                Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease inthe fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary IncentiveCompensation herein).                Non-compensation  expenses decreased, primarily due to lower litigationcosts.    Income Tax Items   In 2016, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $83 million. These net discrete taxbenefits were primarily related to the remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters.   In 2015, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $564 million. These net discrete taxbenefits were primarily associated with the repatriation of  non-U.S.  earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization in the UnitedKingdom (U.K.).    In 2014, we recognized in Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of$839 million. This included net discrete tax benefits of $612 million principally associated with remeasurement of reserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination and$237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of  non-U.S.  earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated. In addition, our Provision for (benefit from) income taxes was impacted byapproximately $900 million of tax provision as a result of  non-deductible  expenses related to litigation and regulatory matters.  Dispositions   On November 1, 2015, we completed the sale of our global oil merchanting unit of the commodities division to Castleton CommoditiesInternational LLC. The loss on sale of approximately $71 million was recognized in Other revenues.    On July 1, 2014, wecompleted the sale of our ownership stake in TransMontaigne Inc., a U.S.-based oil storage, marketing and transportation company, as well as related physical inventory and the assumption of our obligations under certain terminal storage contracts,to NGL Energy Partners LP. The gain on sale of $112 million was recognized in Other revenues.    On March 27, 2014, we completedthe sale of Canterm Canadian Terminals Inc., a public storage terminal operator for refined products with two distribution terminals in Canada. The gain on sale was approximately $45 million and was recognized in Other revenues.   Other Items    Japanese Securities Joint Venture   We hold a 40% voting interest and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG) holds a 60% voting interest in MUMSS.   To the extent that losses incurred by MUMSS result in a requirement to restore its capital level, MUFG is solely responsible forproviding this additional capital to a minimum level, whereas we are not obligated to contribute additional capital to MUMSS.

This decrease was partially offset by increased fees due to the Fixed Income Integration.   Asset Management    Assetmanagement, distribution and administration fees of $8,454 million in 2016 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund fees. Revenues from  fee-based  accounts wererelatively flat with decreased client fee rates, partially offset by positive flows. See  Fee-Based  Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type herein for more details.   Net Interest    Net interest of$3,529 million in 2016 increased 19% from the prior year, primarily due to higher loan balances and investment portfolio yields.    Other   Other revenues of $277 million in 2016 increased 9% from the prior year due to the combination of higher referral fees in2016 and a decrease in provision for loan losses in 2016.    Non-interest  Expenses  Non-interest  expenses of $11,913 million in 2016 increased 1% from the prior year.               Compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2016, primarily due to an increase in the fair value ofdeferred compensation plan referenced investments.           Non-compensation expenses increased in 2016, primarily as a result of a $70 million provision related tocertain brokerage service reporting activities. See Other Items herein.    2015 Compared with 2014   Net Revenues    Transactional Revenues   Transactional revenues of $3,335 million in 2015 decreased 14% from the prior year due to lower revenues in each of Trading, Investmentbanking, and Commissions and fees.                Investment banking revenues decreased, primarily due to lower revenues from the distribution of underwrittenofferings.                Trading revenues decreased, primarily due to losses related to investments associated with certain employeedeferred compensation plans and lower revenues from fixed income products.                Commissions and fees decreased, primarily due to lower revenues from equity, mutual fund and annuity products,partially offset by higher revenues from alternative asset classes.    Asset Management   Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $8,536 million in 2015 increased 2% from the prior year, primarily due tohigher  fee-based  revenues that resulted from positive flows and higher average market values over 2015 as compared with the average market values during 2014. The increase in fee-based  revenues was partially offset by lower referral fees from the bank deposit program, reflecting the completion of the transfer of deposits from Citigroup Inc. (Citi) to us in connectionwith the former retail securities joint venture between the Firm and Citi. See  Fee-Based  Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type herein for more details.   Net Interest    Net interest of$2,956 million in 2015 increased 26% from the prior year, primarily due to higher balances in the bank deposit program and growth in loans and lending commitments.   Other    Other revenues of$255 million in 2015 decreased 20% from the prior year, primarily due to a $40 million gain on sale of a retail property space in the prior year and an increase in the provision for loan losses in 2015.                   47     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             Non-interest  Expenses  Non-interest  expenses of $11,768 million in 2015 decreased 1% from the prior year, primarily dueto lower Compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher  Non-compensation  expenses.                Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease inthe fair value of deferred compensation plan referenced investments and a decrease in the level of discretionary incentive compensation in 2015 (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary IncentiveCompensation herein).                Non-compensation  expenses increased, primarily due to an increase inProfessional services, resulting from increased consulting and legal fees, partially offset by a provision related to a rescission offer in the prior year. Other expenses in 2014 included $50 million related to a rescission offer to WealthManagement clients who may not have received a prospectus for certain securities transactions, for which delivery of a prospectus was required.   Income Tax Items    In 2014, we recognizedin Provision for (benefit from) income taxes net discrete tax benefits of $1,390 million due  to the release of a deferred tax liability as a result of an internal restructuring to simplify our legal entity organization. For a further discussion of these net discrete tax benefits, seeSupplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresIncome Tax Matters herein.    Other Items   The Firm has identified operational issues that resulted in the reporting of incorrect cost basis tax information to the Internal RevenueService (IRS) and retail brokerage clients for tax years 2011 through 2016. Most of our clients are not impacted by these issues. However, these issues have affected a significant number of client accounts. In the case of clients forwhom the Firm has determined that there have been tax underpayments to the IRS as a result of these issues, the Firm is in advanced discussions with the IRS to resolve client tax underpayments to the IRS caused by these issues at no expense to ourclients. In the case of clients for whom the Firm has determined that there have been tax overpayments to the IRS as a result of these issues, the Firm plans to notify them and to offer to pay them an amount equivalent to their overpayment to theIRS. The $70 million provision referred to above is based on currently available information and analyses, and our review of these issues is continuing.       Fee-Based  Client Assets Activity and Average Fee Rate by Account Type   Wealth Management earns fees based on a contractual percentage of  fee-based  client assets related tocertain account types that we offer. These fees, which we record in the Asset management, distribution and administration fees line on its income statement, are earned based on the client assets in the specific account types in which the clientparticipates and are generally not driven by asset class. For most account types, fees are billed in the first month of each quarter based on the related client assets as of the end of the prior quarter. Across the account types, fees will varybased on both the distinct services provided within each account type and on the level of household assets under supervision in Wealth Management.                                   $ in billions, fee rate in bps      At December 31, 2015         Inflows         Outflows         Market Impact         At December 31, 2016         Average for the Year Ended December 31, 2016                              Fee Rate        Separately managed accounts 1      $  283         $  33         $  (97  )       $  3         $  222            27        Unified managed accounts         105            107            (17  )          9            204            105        Mutual fund advisory         25            2            (6  )                      21            121        Representative as advisor         115            31            (26  )          5            125            88        Representative as portfolio manager         252            63            (41  )          11            285            101        Subtotal      $  780         $  236         $  (187  )       $  28         $  857            74        Cash management         15            14            (9  )                      20            6        Total  fee-based  clientassets      $  795         $  250         $  (196  )       $  28         $  877            72                 December 2016 Form 10-K     48              Managements Discussion and Analysis                                        $ in billions, fee rate in bps      At December 31, 2014         Inflows         Outflows         Market Impact         At December 31, 2015         Average for the Year Ended December 31, 2015                              Fee Rate        Separately managed accounts 1      $  285         $  42         $  (32  )       $  (12  )       $  283            34        Unified managed accounts         93            29            (14  )          (3  )          105            113        Mutual fund advisory         31            3            (6  )          (3  )          25            121        Representative as advisor         119            29            (25  )          (8  )          115            89        Representative as portfolio manager         241            58            (38  )          (9  )          252            104        Subtotal      $  769         $  161         $  (115  )       $  (35  )       $  780            76        Cash management         16            9            (10  )                      15            6        Total  fee-based  clientassets      $  785         $  170         $  (125  )       $  (35  )       $  795            74                                      $ in billions, fee rate in bps      At December 31, 2013         Inflows         Outflows         Market Impact         At December 31, 2014         Average for the Year Ended December 31, 2014                              Fee Rate        Separately managed accounts 1      $  260         $  41         $  (31  )       $  15         $  285            35        Unified managed accounts         78            24            (11  )          2            93            116        Mutual fund advisory         34            5            (8  )                      31            121        Representative as advisor         111            30            (23  )          1            119            90        Representative as portfolio manager         201            60            (28  )          8            241            106        Subtotal      $  684         $  160         $  (101  )       $  26         $  769            77        Cash management         13            12            (9  )                      16            6        Total  fee-based  clientassets      $  697         $  172         $  (110  )       $  26         $  785            75       bpsBasis points     1.

This was partially offset by carried interest losses in 2015 associated with Asia private equity that did not  re-occur  in 2016.   Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees                Asset management, distribution and administration fees of $2,063 million in 2016 were relativelyunchanged from the prior year, as increases in management fees resulting from higher assets under management or supervision (AUM) and average fee rates in certain products were offset by lower performance fees (see AUM and AverageFee Rate by Asset Class herein).    Non-interest  Expenses  Non-interest  expenses of $1,825 million in 2016 were relatively unchanged from the prior year,primarily due to higher   Non-compensation  expenses offset by lower Compensation and benefits expenses.                Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to a decrease in salaries.               Non-compensation  expenses increased, primarily due to higher brokerageclearing and exchange fees, partially offset by lower litigation costs and expense management.    2015 Compared with 2014   Net Revenues    Investments               Investments gains of $249 million in 2015 decreased 58% from the prior year reflecting the reversal ofpreviously accrued carried interest associated with Asia private equity and additional net markdowns on principal investments.   Asset Management, Distribution and Administration Fees                Asset management, distribution and administration fees were unchanged from the prior year as the impact ofpositive net flows was offset by a shift in the asset class mix from equity and fixed income products to liquidity products (see AUM and Average Fee Rate by Asset Class herein).   Other                Other revenues of $32 million in 2015 decreased 70% from the prior year due to lower revenues associatedwith our minority investment in certain third-party investment managers.    Non-interest Expenses    Non-interest  expenses of $1,823 million in 2015 decreased 11% from the prioryear, primarily due to lower Compensation and benefit expenses, partially offset by higher  Non-compensation  expenses.                Compensation and benefits expenses decreased, primarily due to the 2014 compensation actions, a decrease indeferred compensation associated with carried interest and a decrease in the level of incentive compensation in 2015 (see also Supplemental Financial Information and DisclosuresDiscretionary Incentive Compensation herein).               Non-compensation  expenses increased, primarily due to higher brokerageclearing and exchange fees, and professional services resulting from higher consulting and legal fees and information processing and communications expenses.               December 2016 Form 10-K     50              Managements Discussion and Analysis            Assets Under Management or Supervision   Effective in 2016, the presentation of AUM for Investment Management has been revised to better align asset classes with its presentorganizational structure.

Legal expenses incurred in 2015 were primarily related to increasesin reserves for the settlement of a credit default swap antitrust litigation matter and for legacy residential mortgage-backed securities matters. The legal expenses incurred in 2014 were principally due to reserve additions and settlementsrelated to legacy residential mortgage-backed securities and credit crisis related matters, including our $2,600 million agreement with the United States Department of Justice, Civil Division, which was reached on February 25, 2015 andfinalized on February 10, 2016 (see ContingenciesLegal in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).

Income Tax Matters    Effective Tax Rate                              2016        2015        2014        From continuing operations         30.8  %         25.9  %         (2.5  )%                   December 2016 Form 10-K     52              Managements Discussion and Analysis             2016   Included in the effective tax rate for 2016 were net discrete tax benefits of $68 million, primarily related to the remeasurement ofreserves and related interest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination, partially offset by adjustments for other tax matters. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate fromcontinuing operations for 2016 would have been 31.6%, which is generally reflective of the geographic mix of earnings.    2015   Included in the effective tax rate for 2015 were net discrete tax benefits of $564 million, primarily associated with the repatriation of non-U.S.  earnings at a cost lower than originally estimated due to an internal restructuring to simplify the legal entity organization in the U.K. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective taxrate from continuing operations for 2015 would have been 32.5%.    2014   Included in the effective tax rate for 2014 were net discrete tax benefits of $2,226 million. These net discrete tax benefits consistedof: $1,380 million primarily due to the release of a deferred tax liability, previously established as part of the acquisition of Smith Barney in 2009 through a charge to Additional  paid-in  capital, as aresult of the legal entity restructuring that included a change in tax status of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Holdings LLC from a partnership to a corporation; $609 million principally associated with the remeasurement of reserves and relatedinterest due to new information regarding the status of a multi-year tax authority examination; and $237 million primarily associated with the repatriation of  non-U.S.  earnings at a cost lower thanoriginally estimated. Excluding these net discrete tax benefits, the effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2014 would have been 59.5%, which is primarily attributable to approximately $900 million of tax provision from  non-deductible  expenses for litigation and regulatory matters.    Discretionary Incentive Compensation   On December 1, 2014, the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee (CMDS Committee) of our Board ofDirectors (the Board) approved an approach for awards of discretionary incentive compensation for the 2014 performance year that were granted in 2015, which reduced the average deferral of such awards to an approximate baseline of 50%.Additionally, the CMDS Committee approved the acceleration of vesting for certain outstanding deferred cash-based incentive compensation awards. The deferred cash-based incentive compensation  awards subject to accelerated vesting will be distributed on their regularly scheduled future distribution dates and will continue to be subject to cancellation and clawback provisions. Thefollowing table presents the increase in Compensation and benefits expense for the Firm and each of the business segments as a result of these actions in 2014 (2014 compensation actions).   2014 Compensation and Benefits Expense                           $ in millions       Institutional  Securities          Wealth  Management          Investment  Management        Total        2014 compensation and benefits expense before fourth quarter actions 1     $  6,882        $  8,737        $  1,068        $  16,687        Fourth quarter actions:                             Change in 2014 level of deferrals 2        610           66           80           756        Acceleration of prior-year cash-based  deferred awards 3        294           22           65           381        Fourth quarter actions total     $  904        $  88        $  145        $  1,137        2014 compensation and benefits expense     $  7,786        $  8,825        $  1,213        $      17,824            1.

Accounting Development Updates   The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued the following accounting updates that apply to us.   We consider the applicability and impact of all accounting updates. Accounting updates not listed below were assessed and determined to beeither not applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.    The following accountingupdate was adopted on January 1, 2017.                Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .    This accounting updatesimplifies the accounting for employee share-based payments, including the recognition of forfeitures, the classification of income tax consequences, and the classification within the cash flow statements. This guidance became effective for us as ofJanuary 1, 2017, and the transition impact was not significant. With this update, the income tax consequences for these payments are required to be recognized in Provision for income taxes in the consolidated income statements instead of additionalpaid-in capital. The impact of the income tax consequences may be either a benefit or a provision, and will primarily occur in the   first quarter of each year as share-based awards to   employees are                   53     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis                       converted to Morgan Stanley shares. The impact of recognizing excess tax benefits upon conversion of awards in January 2017 was an approximate $110 million benefit to the Provision for incometaxes.    The following accounting updates are currently being evaluated to determine the potential impact of adoption:               Revenue from Contracts with Customers.     This accounting update aims to clarifythe principles of revenue recognition, to develop a common revenue recognition standard across all industries for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards, and to provide enhanced disclosures for users of the financial statements.The core principle of this guidance is that an entity should recognize revenues to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange forthose goods or services. We will adopt the guidance on January 1, 2018 and are currently evaluating the method of adoption.   We expect this accounting update to potentially change the timing and presentation of certain revenues, as well as the timingand presentation of certain related costs, for Investment banking fees and Asset management, distribution and administration fees. Outside of Investment Management performance fees in the form of carried interest, discussed further in the followingparagraph, these changes are not expected to be significant.    Regarding the recognition of performance fees from fundmanagement activities in the form of carried interest that are subject to reversal, there are alternative views in the industry which include consideration as to whether these arrangements are in the scope of the new revenue guidance or arefinancial instruments under the scope of equity method of accounting. If we follow the equity method of accounting principles, the current recognition of such fees would remain essentially unchanged. If the fees are deemed in the scope of thenew revenue guidance, we would defer recognition until such fees are no longer subject to reversal, which would cause a significant delay in the recognition of these fees as revenue. We are currently assessing the alternative accounting approachesand continue to closely monitor developments in this still-evolving area.    We will continue to assess the impact of thenew rule as we progress through the implementation of the new standard; therefore, additional impacts may be identified prior to adoption.                Financial InstrumentsCredit Losses.     This accounting update impacts theimpairment model for certain financial assets measured at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and HTM securities. The amendments in this            update will accelerate the recognition of credit losses by replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology that requires anestimate of expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial asset. Additionally, although the CECL methodology will not apply to AFS debt securities, the update will require establishment of an allowance to reflect impairment of thesesecurities, thereby eliminating the concept of a permanent write-down. This update is effective as of January 1, 2020.                Leases.     This accounting update requires lessees to recognize on the balancesheet all leases with terms exceeding one year, which results in the recognition of a right of use asset and corresponding lease liability, including for those leases that we currently classify as operating leases. The right of use asset and leaseliability will initially be measured using the present value of the remaining rental payments. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor is largely unchanged. This update is effective as of January 1, 2019.               Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets.     This accountingupdate clarifies the guidance on how to account for the derecognition of nonfinancial assets and in substance nonfinancial assets and also provides guidance on the accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. This update is effective as ofJanuary 1, 2018.    Critical Accounting Policies   Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions (see Note1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). We believe that of our significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8), the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.   Fair Value    Financial Instruments Measured atFair Value    A significant number of our financial instruments are carried at fair value. We make estimates regarding valuation ofassets and liabilities measured at fair value in preparing the consolidated financial statements. These assets and liabilities include, but are not limited to:                Trading assets and Trading liabilities;               Investment SecuritiesAFS securities;               Certain Securities purchased under agreements to resell;               Certain Deposits, primarily structured certificates of deposits;               December 2016 Form 10-K     54              Managements Discussion and Analysis                      Certain Short-term borrowings, primarily structured notes;               Certain Securities sold under agreements to repurchase;               Certain Other secured financings; and               Certain Long-term borrowings, primarily structured notes.   Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ( i.e. , the exit price) in anorderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.    In determining fair value, we use various valuation approaches.A hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable prices and inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable prices and inputs by requiring that the relevant observable inputs be used when available. Thehierarchy is broken down into three levels, wherein Level 1 represents quoted prices in active markets, Level 2 represents valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable,and Level 3 consists of valuation techniques that incorporate significant unobservable inputs and, therefore, require the greatest use of judgment. In periods of market disruption, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for manyinstruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be recategorized from Level 1 to Level 2 or from Level 2 to Level 3. In addition, a downturn in market conditions could lead to declines in the valuation of manyinstruments. For further information on the valuation process, fair value definition, Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 and related valuation techniques, and quantitative information about and sensitivity of significant unobservable inputsused in Level 3 fair value measurements, see Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.    Where appropriate,valuation adjustments are made to account for various factors such as liquidity risk  (bid-ask  adjustments), credit quality, model uncertainty and concentration risk in order to arrive at fair value. For afurther discussion of valuation adjustments that we apply, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.    Assets and LiabilitiesMeasured at Fair Value on a  Non-recurring  Basis    At December 31, 2016 andDecember 31, 2015, certain of our assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a  non-recurring  basis, primarily relating to loans, other investments, premises, equipment and software costs,intangible assets, other assets and other liabilities, and accrued expenses. We incur losses or gains for any adjustments of these assets to fair value. A downturn in market conditions could result in impairment charges in future periods.  For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring  basis, fair value is determined by using various valuation approaches. The same hierarchy as described above, which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservableinputs by generally requiring that the observable inputs be used when available, is used in measuring fair value for these items.    SeeNote 3 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information on assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a  non-recurring  basis.   Fair Value Control Processes    Weemploy control processes designed to validate the fair value of our financial instruments, including those derived from pricing models. These control processes are designed to ensure that the values used for financial reporting are based onobservable inputs wherever possible. In the event that observable inputs are not available, the control processes are designed to ensure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions arereasonable.    See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding our valuation policies,processes and procedures.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets   Goodwill   We test goodwill forimpairment on an annual basis on July 1 and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. We test for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of or one level below its business segments.Goodwill no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition once it has been assigned to a reporting unit. As such, all the activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organically developed, are available to support the value ofthe goodwill. For both the annual and interim tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value ofa reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.    If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine it is morelikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then performing the  two-step  impairment test is not required. However, if we conclude otherwise, then we arerequired to perform the first step of the  two-step  impairment test. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its respective carrying value. If theestimated fair value exceeds the carrying value,                    55     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, however, further analysis is required to determine the amount of theimpairment.    The estimated fair value of the reporting units is derived based on valuation techniques we believe market participants woulduse for each of the reporting units. The estimated fair value is generally determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology or methodologies that incorporate price-to-book  and  price-to-earnings  multiples of certain comparable companies. At eachannual goodwill impairment testing date, each of our reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.   Intangible Assets    Amortizableintangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life and are reviewed for impairment on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of the intangible asset exceeds its fairvalue. An impairment loss will be recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the expectedundiscounted cash flows.    For both goodwill and intangible assets, to the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishesthe new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses is not permitted. For amortizable intangible assets, the new cost basis is amortized over the remaining useful life of that asset. Adverse market or economic events couldresult in impairment charges in future periods.    See Notes 2, 3 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additionalinformation about goodwill and intangible assets.    Legal and Regulatory Contingencies   In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations,class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities as a global diversified financial services institution.   Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims forindeterminate amounts of damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or in financial distress.   We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by  governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding our business and involving, among other matters, sales and trading activities, wealth and investment management services, financial products orofferings sponsored, underwritten or sold by us, and accounting and operational matters, certain of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.   Accruals for litigation and regulatory proceedings are generally determined on a  case-by-case  basis. Where available information indicates that it is probable a liability had been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount ofthat loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss.   For certain legal proceedings and investigations, we can estimate possible losses, additional losses, ranges of loss or ranges of additionalloss in excess of amounts accrued. For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, we cannot reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings and investigations where the factual record is being developed or contested or whereplaintiffs or government entities seek substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or additional range of loss can bereasonably estimated for a proceeding or investigation, including through potentially lengthy discovery and determination of important factual matters, determination of issues related to class certification and the calculation of damages or otherrelief, and addressing novel or unsettled legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in question.    Significant judgmentis required in deciding when and if to make these accruals, and the actual cost of a legal claim or regulatory fine/penalty may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals.   See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on legal proceedings.   Income Taxes    We are subject to theincome and indirect tax laws of the U.S., its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer andthe relevant governmental taxing authorities. We must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws when determining the provision for income taxes and the expense for indirect taxes and must also makeestimates about when certain items affect taxable income in the various                December 2016 Form 10-K     56              Managements Discussion and Analysis             tax jurisdictions. Disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit. We periodically evaluate the likelihood of assessments in eachtaxing jurisdiction resulting from current and subsequent years examinations, and unrecognized tax benefits related to potential losses that may arise from tax audits are established in accordance with the guidance on accounting forunrecognized tax benefits. Once established, unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change.   Our provision for income taxes is composed of current and deferred taxes. Current income taxes approximate taxes to be paid or refunded forthe current period. Our deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the applicable enacted tax rates and laws that will bein effect when such differences are expected to reverse. Our deferred tax balances also include deferred assets related to tax attribute carryforwards, such as net operating losses and tax credits that will be realized through reduction of futuretax liabilities and, in some cases, are subject to expiration if not utilized within certain periods. We perform regular reviews to ascertain whether deferred tax assets are realizable. These reviews include managements  estimates and assumptions regarding future taxable income and incorporate various tax planning strategies, including strategies that may be available to tax attribute carryforwards before theyexpire. Once the deferred tax asset balances have been determined, we may record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset balances to reflect the amount of these balances (net of valuation allowance) that we estimate it is more likelythan not to realize at a future date. Both current and deferred income taxes could reflect adjustments related to our unrecognized tax benefits.   Significant judgment is required in estimating the consolidated provision for (benefit from) income taxes, current and deferred tax balances(including valuation allowance, if any), accrued interest or penalties and uncertain tax positions. Revisions in estimates and/or the actual costs of a tax assessment may ultimately be materially different from the recorded accruals and unrecognizedtax benefits, if any.    See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our significantassumptions, judgments and interpretations associated with the accounting for income taxes and Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information on our tax examinations.                   57     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             Liquidity and Capital Resources   Senior management establishes liquidity and capital policies. Through various risk and control committees, senior management reviews businessperformance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency sensitivity of our asset and liability position. The Treasury Department, Firm RiskCommittee, Asset and Liability Management Committee, and other committees and control groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the impact that our business activities have on our consolidated balance sheets, liquidity and capitalstructure. Liquidity and capital matters are reported regularly to the Board and the Boards Risk Committee.    The Balance Sheet   We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process includesquarterly planning, business-specific thresholds, monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance metrics and new business impact assessments.   We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated, business segment and business unit levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization andreview variances resulting from business activity or market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current performance versus established thresholds and assess the need to  re-allocate  our balance sheetbased on business unit needs. We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size and capital usage.

Cash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks and interest bearing deposits with banks.    2.    Other assets primarily includes Cash deposited with clearing organizations or segregated under federal and otherregulations or requirements; Other investments; Premises, equipment and software costs; Goodwill; Intangible assets and deferred tax assets.   A substantial portion of total assets consists of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from sales andtrading activities in the Institutional Securities business segment. Total assets increased to $815 billion at December 31, 2016 from $787 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in Trading assets withinInstitutional Securities, including increases in highly liquid U.S. government and agency securities and corporate equities. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in Securities borrowed driven by a decrease in Tradingliabilities. Cash and cash equivalent balances resulting from bank deposits continued to be redeployed into Investment securities and lending activity primarily within the Wealth Management business segment.  Securities Repurchase Agreements and Securities Lending   Securities borrowed or securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or securities sold under agreements to repurchaseare treated as collateralized financings (see Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).    Collateralized Financing Transactions                  $ in millions      At December 31, 2016         At December 31, 2015        Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securitiesborrowed      $  227,191         $  230,073        Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securitiesloaned      $  70,472         $  56,050                     December 2016 Form 10-K     58              Managements Discussion and Analysis                                  Daily Average Balance  Three Months Ended      $ in millions      December 31, 2016         December 31, 2015        Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securitiesborrowed      $  224,355         $  250,605        Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securitiesloaned      $  68,908         $  62,373       At December 31, 2016, differences between period end balances and average balances during the threemonths ended December 31, 2016 in the previous table were not significant. Securities purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed and Securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Securities loaned at December 31,2015 were lower than the average balances during 2015. The balances moved in line with client financing activity and with general movements in Trading assets and liabilities. Additionally, included within securities financing transactions were$14 billion and $11 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, related to fully collateralized  securities-for-securities lending transactions represented in Trading assets.    Customer Securities Financing   The customer receivable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes customer margin loans, collateralized bycustomer-owned securities, which are segregated in accordance with regulatory requirements. The customer payable portion of the securities financing transactions primarily includes payables to our prime brokerage customers. Our risk exposure onthese transactions is mitigated by collateral maintenance policies that limit our credit exposure to customers and liquidity reserves held against this risk exposure.   Liquidity Risk Management Framework    Theprimary goal of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework is to ensure that we have access to adequate funding across a wide range of market conditions and time horizons. The framework is designed to enable us to fulfill our financial obligations andsupport the execution of our business strategies.    The following principles guide our Liquidity Risk Management Framework:               Sufficient liquid assets should be maintained to cover maturing liabilities and other planned and contingentoutflows;                Maturity profile of assets and liabilities should be aligned, with limited reliance on short-term funding;               Source, counterparty, currency, region and term of funding should be diversified; and           Liquidity Stress Tests should anticipate, and account for, periods of limited access to funding.   The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity StressTests and the Global Liquidity Reserve (as defined below), which support our target liquidity profile.    Required Liquidity Framework   Our Required Liquidity Framework reflects the amount of liquidity we must hold in both normal and stressed environments to ensure that ourfinancial condition and overall soundness are not adversely affected by an inability (or perceived inability) to meet our financial obligations in a timely manner. The Required Liquidity Framework considers the most constraining liquidityrequirement to satisfy all regulatory and internal limits at a consolidated and legal entity level.    Liquidity Stress Tests   We use Liquidity Stress Tests to model external and intercompany liquidity flows across multiple scenarios and a range of time horizons. Thesescenarios contain various combinations of idiosyncratic and systemic stress events of different severity and duration. The methodology, implementation, production and analysis of our Liquidity Stress Tests are important components of the RequiredLiquidity Framework.    The scenarios or assumptions used by us in our Liquidity Stress Tests include, but are not limited to, thefollowing:                No government support;               No access to equity and unsecured debt markets;               Repayment of all unsecured debt maturing within the stress horizon;               Higher haircuts for and significantly lower availability of secured funding;               Additional collateral that would be required by trading counterparties, certain exchanges and clearingorganizations related to credit rating downgrades;                Additional collateral that would be required due to collateral substitutions, collateral disputes and uncalledcollateral;                Discretionary unsecured debt buybacks;               Drawdowns on lending commitments provided to third parties;                   59     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis                      Client cash withdrawals and reduction in customer short positions that fund long positions;               Limited access to the foreign exchange swap markets; and               Maturity  roll-off  of outstanding letters of credit with no furtherissuance.    Liquidity Stress Tests are produced for the Parent Company and major operating subsidiaries, as well as atmajor currency levels, to capture specific cash requirements and cash availability across the Firm, including a limited number of asset sales in a stressed environment. The Liquidity Stress Tests assume that subsidiaries will use their own liquidityfirst to fund their obligations before drawing liquidity from the Parent Company and that the Parent Company will support its subsidiaries and will not have access to subsidiaries liquidity reserves. In addition to the assumptions underpinningthe Liquidity Stress Tests, we take into consideration settlement risk related to intraday settlement and clearing of securities and financing activities.   At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we maintained sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent fundingobligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.    Global Liquidity Reserve   We maintain sufficient liquidity reserves to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity targets sized by the Required LiquidityFramework and Liquidity Stress Tests. The size of the Global Liquidity Reserve is actively managed by us considering the following components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size and composition; funding needs in a stressedenvironment, inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and collateral requirements. In addition, our Global Liquidity Reserve includes a discretionary surplus based onrisk tolerance and is subject to change dependent on market and Firm-specific events.

We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to the LCR requirements issued by U.S. banking regulators (U.S. LCR), which arebased on the Basel Committees LCR, including a requirement to calculate each entitys U.S. LCR on each business day. As of January 1, 2017, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum of 100% of the fully  phased-in  U.S. LCR. In addition, effective April 1, 2017, we will be required to disclose certain quantitative and qualitative information related to our U.S. LCR calculation after each calendar quarter. We andour U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are compliant with the minimum required U.S. LCR based on current interpretations.    Net Stable Funding Ratio  The objective of the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is to reduce funding risk over a one-year  horizon by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with sufficiently stable sources of funding in order to mitigate the risk of future funding stress.                   December 2016 Form 10-K     60              Managements Discussion and Analysis             The Basel Committee finalized the NSFR framework in 2014. In May 2016, the U.S. bankingregulators issued a proposal to implement the NSFR in the U.S. The proposal would require a covered company to maintain an amount of available stable funding, which is measured with reference to sources of funding, including deposit and debtliabilities, that is no less than the amount of its required stable funding, which is measured by applying standardized weightings to its assets, derivatives exposures and certain other items.   If adopted as proposed, the requirements would apply to us and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries beginning January 1, 2018. We continue toevaluate the potential impact of the proposal, which is subject to further rulemaking procedures following the closing of the public comment period. Our preliminary estimates, based on the current proposal, indicate that actions will be necessary tomeet the requirement, which we expect to accomplish by the effective date of the final rule. Our preliminary estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results based on the final rule to differ materially from estimates.For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.    Funding Management   We manage our funding in a manner that reduces the risk of disruption to our operations. We pursue a strategy of diversification ofsecured and unsecured funding sources (by product, investor and region) and attempt to ensure that the tenor of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed.   We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources. These sources may include our equity capital, long-term borrowings,securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), securities lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have active financing programs for both standard and structured products targeting globalinvestors and currencies.    Secured Financing   A substantial portion of our total assets consist of liquid marketable securities and short-term receivables arising principally from salesand trading activities in the Institutional Securities business. The liquid nature of these assets provides us with flexibility in managing the composition and size of our balance sheet. Our goal is to achieve an optimal mix of durable secured andunsecured financing. Secured financing investors principally focus on the quality of the eligible collateral posted. Accordingly, we actively manage the secured financing book based on the quality of the assets being funded.  We utilize shorter-term secured financing only for highly liquid assets and have establishedlonger tenor limits for less liquid asset classes, for which funding may be at risk in the event of a market disruption. We define highly liquid assets as government-issued or government-guaranteed securities with a high degree of fundability andless liquid assets as those that do not meet these criteria. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average maturity of our secured financing of less liquid assets was greater than 120 days. To further minimize therefinancing risk of secured financing for less liquid assets, we have established concentration limits to diversify our investor base and reduce the amount of monthly maturities for secured financing of less liquid assets. Furthermore, we obtainterm secured funding liabilities in excess of less liquid inventory as an additional risk mitigant to replace maturing trades in the event that secured financing markets, or our ability to access them, become limited. As a component of the LiquidityRisk Management Framework, we hold a portion of our Global Liquidity Reserve against the potential disruption to our secured financing capabilities.   We also maintain a pool of liquid and easily fundable securities, which provide a valuable future source of liquidity. With the implementationof liquidity standards, we have also incorporated high-quality liquid asset classifications that are consistent with the U.S. LCR definitions into our encumbrance reporting, which further substantiates the demonstrated liquidity characteristics ofthe unencumbered asset pool and our ability to readily identify new funding sources for such assets.    Unsecured Financing   We view long-term debt and deposits as stable sources of funding. Unencumbered securities and non-security  assets are financed with a combination of long-term and short-term debt and deposits. Our unsecured financings include structured borrowings, whose payments and redemption values are based on theperformance of certain underlying assets, including equity, credit, foreign exchange, interest rates and commodities. When appropriate, we may use derivative products to conduct asset and liability management and to make adjustments to our interestrate and structured borrowings risk profile (see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).    Deposits   Available funding sources to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries include demand deposit accounts, money market deposit accounts, time deposits,repurchase agreements, federal funds purchased and Federal Home Loan Bank advances. The vast majority of deposits in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are                   61     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             sourced from our retail brokerage accounts and are considered to have stable,  low-cost  funding characteristics. At December 31, 2016 andDecember 31, 2015, deposits were $155,863 million and $156,034 million, respectively (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8).   Short-Term Borrowings    Our unsecuredshort-term borrowings may primarily consist of structured notes, bank loans and bank notes with original maturities of 12 months or less. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had approximately $941 million and$2,173 million, respectively, in short-term borrowings.    Long-Term Borrowings   We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the unsecured markets. Inaddition, the issuance of long-term borrowings allows us to reduce reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Long-term borrowings are generally managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating refinancing risk, and to maximizeinvestor diversification through sales to global institutional and retail clients across regions, currencies and product types. Availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending on market conditions, the volume of certain trading andlending activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.    We may engage in various transactions in the creditmarkets (including, for example, debt retirements) that we believe are in our investors best interests.

This amount includes the issuances of senior debt; $7.0 billion on January 20, 2017 and $3.0 billion on February 17, 2017.   Trust Preferred Securities   During 2016, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust III, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust IV, Morgan Stanley Capital Trust V and Morgan Stanley CapitalTrust VIII redeemed all of their issued and outstanding Capital Securities pursuant to the  optional redemption provisions provided in the respective governing documents. In the aggregate, $2.8 billion was redeemed. We concurrently redeemed the related underlying juniorsubordinated debentures.    For further information on long-term borrowings, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.   Credit Ratings    We rely on externalsources to finance a significant portion of our  day-to-day  operations. The cost and availability of financing generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among otherthings. In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longer-term counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as OTC derivative transactions, including creditderivatives and interest rate swaps. Rating agencies consider company-specific factors; other industry factors such as regulatory or legislative changes and the macroeconomic environment, among other things.   Our credit ratings do not include any uplift from perceived government support from any rating agency given the significant progress of theU.S. financial reform legislation and regulations. Meanwhile, some rating agencies have stated that they currently incorporate various degrees of credit rating uplift from  non-governmental  third-party sourcesof potential support.

The rating outlook was changed to Stable from Positive Watch.   In connection with certain OTC trading agreements and certain other agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain financingvehicles associated with the Institutional Securities business segment, we may be required to provide               December 2016 Form 10-K     62              Managements Discussion and Analysis             additional collateral or immediately settle any outstanding liability balances with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to certain exchanges and clearing organizations in theevent of a future credit rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset or net liability position.   The additionalcollateral or termination payments that may be called in the event of a future credit rating downgrade vary by contract and   can be based on ratings by either or both of Moodys Investors Service, Inc. (Moodys) andStandard & Poors Global Ratings (S&P). The following table shows the future potential collateral amounts and termination payments that could be called or required by counterparties or exchanges and clearingorganizations in the event of  one-notch  or  two-notch  downgrade scenarios, from the lowest of Moodys or S&P ratings, based on the relevant contractual downgradetriggers.

The liquidity impact of additional collateral requirements isincluded in our Liquidity Stress Tests.    Capital Management   We view capital as an important source of financial strength and actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon, among otherthings, business opportunities, risks, capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and, therefore, in the future may expand or contract our capital base toaddress the changing needs of our businesses. We attempt to maintain total capital, on a consolidated basis, at least equal to the sum of our operating subsidiaries required equity.  Common Stock   We repurchased approximately $3,500 million of our outstanding common stock as part of our share repurchase program during 2016 and$2,125 million during 2015 (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). Pursuant to the share repurchase program, we consider, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as stock-based compensation andbenefit plan requirements. Share repurchases under our program will be exercised from time to time at prices we deem appropriate subject to various factors, including our capital position and market conditions. The share repurchases may be effectedthrough open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through Rule  10b5-1  plans, and may be suspended at any time. Share repurchases by us are subject to regulatory approval (seeMarket for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in Part II, Item 5).   The Board determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. On January 17, 2017, we announced that the Boarddeclared a quarterly dividend per common share of $0.20. The dividend was paid on February 15, 2017 to common shareholders of record on January 31, 2017.   Preferred Stock    On December 15,2016, we announced that the Board declared quarterly dividends for preferred stock shareholders of record on December 30, 2016 that were paid on January 17, 2017.   Series K Preferred Stock.  In January 2017, we issued 40,000,000 Depositary Shares, for an aggregate price of $1,000 million.Each Depositary Share represents a 1/1,000th interest in a share of  Fixed-to-Floating  Rate  Non-Cumulative  Preferred Stock, SeriesK, $0.01 par value (Series K Preferred Stock). The Series K Preferred Stock is redeemable at our option, (i) in whole or in part, from time to time, on any dividend payment date on or after April 15, 2027 or (ii) in wholebut not in part at any time within 90 days following a regulatory capital treatment event (as described in the terms of that series), in each case at a redemption price of $25,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per Depositary Share), plus any declaredand unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without accumulation of any undeclared dividends. The Series K Preferred Stock also has a preference over our common stock upon liquidation. The Series K Preferred Stock offering(net of related issuance costs) resulted in proceeds of approximately $969 million.                    63     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis            Preferred Stock Dividends                 Series      Preferred Stock Description      Quarterly Dividend per Share           A          Floating Rate  Non-Cumulative  Preferred Stock (represented by depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stockand each having a dividend of $0.25556)      $  255.56           C          10%  Non-Cumulative   Non-Voting  Perpetual Preferred Stock         25.00           E          Fixed-to-Floating  Rate  Non-Cumulative  Preferred Stock (represented bydepositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.44531)         445.31           F          Fixed-to-Floating  Rate  Non-Cumulative  Preferred Stock (represented bydepositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.42969)         429.69           G          6.625%  Non-Cumulative  Preferred Stock (represented by depositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock andeach having a dividend of $0.41406)         414.06           H          Fixed-to-Floating  Rate  Non-Cumulative  Preferred Stock (represented bydepositary shares, each representing a 1/25th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $27.25000) 1         681.25           I          Fixed-to-Floating  Rate  Non-Cumulative  Preferred Stock (represented bydepositary shares, each representing a 1/1,000th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $0.39844)         398.44           J          Fixed-to-Floating  Rate  Non-Cumulative  Preferred Stock (represented bydepositary shares, each representing a 1/25th interest in a share of preferred stock and each having a dividend of $27.75000) 2         693.75            1.

Regulatory Requirements   Regulatory Capital Framework    Weare a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act), and are subject to the regulation and oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FederalReserve). The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for us, including well-capitalized standards, and evaluates our compliance with such capital requirements. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)establishes similar capital requirements and standards for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. The regulatory capital requirements are largely based on the Basel III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and also implement certain provisionsof the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act).    The Basel Committee has recentlypublished revisions to certain standards in its capital framework, including with respect to counterparty credit risk exposures in derivatives transactions, market risk, interest rate risk in the banking book, and securitization capital standards,although these revisions have not yet been adopted by the U.S. banking agencies. In addition, the Basel Committee is actively considering other potential revisions to other capital standards that would substantially change the framework. The impacton us of any revisions to the Basel Committees capital standards could be substantial but is uncertain and depends on future rulemakings by the U.S. bankingagencies.               December 2016 Form 10-K     64              Managements Discussion and Analysis             Regulatory Capital Requirements   We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios under the regulatory capital requirements. A summary of thecalculations of regulatory capital, risk-weighted assets (RWAs) and transition provisions follows.    RegulatoryCapital.  Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital. Certain adjustments to and deductions from capital are required for purposes of determining these ratios,such as goodwill, intangibles, certain deferred tax assets, other amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) and investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions. Certain of theseadjustments and deductions are also subject to transitional provisions.    In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements,on a fully  phased-in  basis by 2019, we will be subject to:                A greater than 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer;               The Common Equity Tier 1 global systemically important bank (G-SIB)  capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and                Up to a 2.5% Common Equity Tier 1 countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB), currently set by bankingregulators at zero (collectively, the buffers).    In 2017, the phase-in  amount for each of the buffers is 50% of the fully  phased-in  buffer requirement. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on our ability tomake capital distributions, including the payment of dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to  executive officers. For a further discussion of the  G-SIB  capital surcharge, see  G-SIB  CapitalSurcharge herein.    Risk-Weighted Assets.  RWAs reflect both our  on-  and  off-balance  sheet risk as well as capital charges attributable to the risk of loss arising from the following:                Credit risk: The failure of a borrower, counterparty or issuer to meet its financial obligations to us;               Market risk: Adverse changes in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities,correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity; and                Operational risk: Inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physical assets).    For a furtherdiscussion of our market, credit and operational risks, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Item 7A.   Our binding risk-based capital ratios for regulatory purposes are the lower of the capital ratios computed under (i) the standardizedapproaches for calculating credit risk and market risk RWAs (the Standardized Approach) and (ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the AdvancedApproach). At December 31, 2016, our binding ratios are based on the Advanced Approach transitional rules.    The methods forcalculating each of our risk-based capital ratios will change through January 1, 2022 as aspects of the capital rules are phased in. These changes may result in differences in our reported capital ratios from one reporting period to the nextthat are independent of changes to our capital base, asset composition,  off-balance  sheet exposures or risk profile.                   65     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis            Minimum Risk-Based Capital Ratios: Transitional Provisions                    1.

The Federal Reserve has not yet revised the well-capitalized standard for financial holding companies to reflect the higher capital standards required for us under thecapital rules. Assuming that the Federal Reserve would apply the same or very similar well-capitalized standards to financial holding companies, each of our risk-based capital ratios and Tier 1 leverage ratio at December 31, 2016 would haveexceeded the revised well-capitalized standard. The Federal Reserve may require us to maintain risk- and leverage-based capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a financialholding companys particular condition, risk profile and growth plans.                    67     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             Regulatory Capital Calculated under Advanced Approach Transitional Rules                  $ in millions        At  December 31, 2016          At  December 31,   2015        Common Equity Tier 1 capital                  Common stock and surplus      $                17,494        $                20,114        Retained earnings         53,679           49,204        AOCI         (2,643  )         (1,656  )      Regulatory adjustments and deductions:                  Net goodwill         (6,526  )         (6,582  )      Net intangible assets (other than goodwill and mortgage servicingassets)         (1,631  )         (1,192  )      Credit spread premium over risk-free rate for derivativeliabilities         (271  )         (202  )      Net deferred tax assets         (304  )         (675  )      Net  after-tax  DVA 1         357           156        Adjustments related to AOCI         422           411        Other adjustments and deductions         (179  )         (169  )      Total Common Equity Tier 1capital      $  60,398        $  59,409        Additional Tier 1 capital                  Preferred stock      $  7,520        $  7,520        Trust preferred securities                    702        Noncontrolling interests         613           678        Regulatory adjustments and deductions:                              Net deferred tax assets         (202  )         (1,012  )      Credit spread premium over risk-free rate for derivativeliabilities         (181  )         (303  )      Net  after-tax  DVA 1         238           233        Other adjustments and deductions         (101  )         (253  )      Additional Tier 1 capital      $  7,887        $  7,565        Deduction for investments in covered funds         (188  )         (252  )      Total Tier 1 capital      $  68,097        $  66,722        Tier 2 capital                  Subordinated debt      $  10,303        $  10,404        Trust preferred securities                    2,106        Other qualifying amounts         62           35        Regulatory adjustments and deductions         180           136        Total Tier 2 capital      $  10,545        $  12,681        Total capital      $  78,642        $  79,403        Rollforward of Regulatory Capital Calculated under Advanced Approach Transitional Rules              $ in millions     2016        Common Equity Tier 1 capital           Common Equity Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2015     $                  59,409        Change related to the following items:           Value of shareholders common equity        868        Net goodwill        56        Net intangible assets (other than goodwill and mortgage servicingassets)        (439  )      Credit spread premium over risk-free rate for derivativeliabilities        (69  )      Net deferred tax assets        371        Net  after-tax  DVA 1        201        Adjustments related to AOCI        11        Other deductions and adjustments        (10  )      Common Equity Tier 1 capital at December 31,2016     $  60,398        Additional Tier 1 capital           Additional Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2015     $  7,565        Change related to the following items:           Trust preferred securities        (702  )      Noncontrolling interests        (65  )      Net deferred tax assets        810        Credit spread premium over risk-free rate for derivativeliabilities        122        Net  after-tax  DVA 1        5        Other adjustments and deductions        152        Additional Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2016        7,887        Deduction for investments in covered funds at December 31,2015        (252  )      Deduction for investments in covered funds        64        Deduction for investments in covered funds at December 31,2016        (188  )      Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2016     $  68,097        Tier 2 capital           Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2015     $  12,681        Change related to the following items:           Subordinated debt        (101  )      Trust preferred securities        (2,106  )      Noncontrolling interests        27        Other adjustments and deductions        44        Tier 2 capital at December 31, 2016     $  10,545        Total capital at December 31, 2016     $  78,642            1.

Supplementary Leverage Ratio   We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are required to publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratios, which will become effective as acapital standard on January 1, 2018. By January 1, 2018, we must also maintain a Tier 1 supplementary leverage capital buffer of at least 2% in addition to the 3% minimum supplementary leverage ratio (for a total of at least 5%), in orderto avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. In addition,  beginning in 2018, our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of 6% to be considered well-capitalized.

Computed as the arithmetic mean of the  month-end  balances over the calendarquarter ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.     3.    Adjustments are to: (i) incorporate derivative exposures, including adding the related potential future exposure(including for derivatives cleared for clients), grossing up cash collateral netting where qualifying criteria are not met and adding the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit protection;(ii) reflect the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; (iii) add the credit equivalent amount for  off-balance  sheet exposures; and (iv) apply other adjustments to Tier 1 capital,including disallowed goodwill, transitional intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets and certain investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions.   Based on our current understanding of the rules and other factors, we estimate our pro forma fully phased-in  supplementary leverage ratio to be approximately 6.2% at December 31, 2016 and 5.8% at December 31, 2015. These estimates utilize a fully  phased-in Tier 1 capital numerator and a fully  phased-in  denominator of approximately $1,061.5 billion at December 31, 2016 and $1,095.6 billion at December 31, 2015, which takes into considerationthe Tier 1 capital deductions that would be applicable in 2018 after the  phase-in  period has ended.

Our estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from estimates based on these regulations. Further, theseexpectations should not be taken as projections of what our supplementary leverage ratios, earnings, assets or exposures will actually be at future dates. For a discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our future results, see RiskFactors in Part I, Item 1A.                    69     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             G-SIB  Capital Surcharge   We and other U.S.  G-SIBs  are subject to a risk-based capital surcharge. A  G-SIB  must calculate its  G-SIB  capital surcharge under two methods and use the higher of the two surcharges. The first method considers the G-SIBs  size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, substitutability and complexity, which is generally consistent with the methodology developed by the Basel Committee (Method1). The second method uses similar inputs, but replaces substitutability with the use of short-term wholesale funding (Method 2) and generally results in higher surcharges than the first method. The G-SIB  capital surcharge must be satisfied using Common Equity Tier 1 capital and functions as an extension of the capital conservation buffer. Our current  G-SIB surcharge is 3%. The surcharge is being phased in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019, and the  phase-in  amount for 2017 is 50% of the applicable surcharge (see Minimum Risk-BasedCapital Ratios: Transitional Provisions herein).    Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company Requirements   On December 15, 2016, the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule for  top-tier  bankholding companies of U.S.  G-SIBs  (covered BHCs), including the Parent Company, that establishes external TLAC, long-term debt (LTD) and clean holding company requirements. The finalrule contains various definitions and restrictions, such as requiring eligible LTD to be issued by the covered BHC and be unsecured, have a maturity of one year or more from the date of issuance and not have certain derivative-linked features,typically associated with certain types of structured notes. Covered BHCs must comply with all requirements under the rule by January 1, 2019, which we expect to accomplish.   The main purpose of the Federal Reserves minimum external TLAC and LTD requirements is to ensure that covered BHCs, including the ParentCompany, will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where a single point of entry(SPOE) resolution strategy is used (see BusinessSupervision and RegulationFinancial Holding CompanyResolution and Recovery Planning in Part I, Item 1 and Risk FactorsLegal, Regulatory andCompliance Risk in Part I, Item 1A).    Under the final rule, a covered BHC is required to maintain minimum external TLAC equal to thegreater of 18% of total RWAs and 7.5% of its total leverage exposure (the denominator of its supplementary leverage ratio). In addition, covered BHCs must meet a separate external LTD requirement equal to the greater of 6% of total RWAs plus the  greater of the Method 1 and Method 2  G-SIB  capital surcharge applicable to the Parent Company and 4.5% of its total leverage exposure.   In addition, the final rule imposes TLAC buffer requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage-exposure-based external TLAC minimumrequirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%, the covered BHCs Method 1  G-SIB  surcharge and the countercyclical capital buffer, if any, as a percentage of total RWAs. Theleverage-exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered BHCs total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the TLAC buffers would result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers.   The final rule provides permanent grandfathering for debt instruments issued prior to December 31, 2016 that would be eligible LTDbut for having impermissible acceleration clauses or being governed by foreign law.    Furthermore, under the clean holding companyrequirements of the final rule, a covered BHC is prohibited from incurring any external short-term debt or certain other liabilities, regardless of whether the liabilities are fully secured or otherwise senior to eligible LTD, or entering intocertain other prohibited transactions. Certain other external liabilities, including structured notes, are subject to a cap equal to 5% of the covered BHCs outstanding external TLAC amount.   Capital Plans and Stress Tests   Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large bank holdingcompanies, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserves annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) framework.   We must submit an annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking into account the results of separate stress tests designed by us and theFederal Reserve, so that the Federal Reserve may assess our systems and processes that incorporate forward-looking projections of revenues and losses to monitor and maintain our internal capital adequacy.   The capital plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of adebt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution ( i.e. , payments of dividends or stock repurchases) and any similar action that the Federal Reserve determines could impact our consolidated capital. The capital plan must include adiscussion of how we will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios, including the requirements that are phased in over the planning horizon, and serve as a source of strength to our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries under supervisory stressscenarios. In                December 2016 Form 10-K     70              Managements Discussion and Analysis             addition, the Federal Reserve has issued guidance setting out its heightened expectations for capital planning practices at certain large financial institutions, including us.   In November 2015, the Federal Reserve amended its capital plan and stress test rules to delay until 2017 the use of the supplementary leverageratio requirement, defer indefinitely the use of the Advanced Approach risk-based capital framework in capital planning and  company-run  stress tests, and incorporate the Tier 1 capital deductions for certaininvestments in Volcker Rule covered funds into the pro forma minimum capital requirements for capital plan and stress testing purposes.   The capital plan rule requires that large bank holding companies receive no objection from the Federal Reserve before making a capitaldistribution. In addition, even with an approved capital plan, the bank holding company must seek the approval of the Federal Reserve before making a capital distribution if, among other reasons, the bank holding company would not meet itsregulatory capital requirements after making the proposed capital distribution. A bank holding companys ability to make capital distributions (other than scheduled payments on Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) is also limitedif its net capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan.    In addition, we must conduct semiannual  company-run  stress tests and are subject to an annual Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve.   On April 5, 2016, we submitted our 2016 CCAR capital plan, and summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress testswere published by the Federal Reserve in June. We exceeded all stressed capital ratio minimum requirements in the Federal Reserve severely adverse scenario, and our quantitative capital results improved from our prior-year submission. InJune 2016, we received a conditional  non-objection  from the Federal Reserve to our 2016 capital plan (see Capital Management herein). On December 29, 2016, we resubmitted our capital plan, asrequired by the Federal Reserve, to address weaknesses identified in our capital planning process.   Future capital distributions may berestricted if these identified weaknesses are not satisfactorily addressed when the Federal Reserve reviews our resubmitted capital plan. Pursuant to the conditional  non-objection,  we are able to execute thecapital actions set forth in our 2016 capital plan, which included increasing our common stock dividend to $0.20 per share beginning in the third quarter of 2016 and executing share repurchases of $3.5 billion during the period July 1,2016 through June 30, 2017. In addition, we submitted the results of our  mid-cycle   company-run  stress test to the  Federal Reserve on October 5, 2016, and we disclosed a summary of the results on October 31, 2016.   For the 2017 capital planning and stress test cycle, we are required to submit our capital plan and company-run  stress test results to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2017. We expect that the Federal Reserve will provide its response to our 2017 capital plan by June 30, 2017. The Federal Reserve isexpected to publish summary results of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of each large bank holding company, including us, by June 30, 2017. We are required to disclose a summary of the results of our  company-run  stress tests within 15 days of the date the Federal Reserve discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. In addition, we must submit the results of our mid-cycle   company-run  stress test to the Federal Reserve by October 5, 2017 and disclose a summary of the results between October 5, 2017 and November 4,2017.    In January 2017, the Federal Reserve adopted revisions to the capital plan and stress test rules that, among other things, reducethe  de minimis  threshold for additional capital distributions that a firm may make during a capital plan cycle without seeking the Federal Reserves prior approval. The final rule also establishes a blackout period beginningin March of each year while the Federal Reserve is conducting CCAR reviews during which firms are not permitted to submit  de minimis  exception notices or prior approval requests for additional capital distributions. The Federal Reserve iscurrently considering making further changes to CCAR requirements, which may increase minimum capital requirements for the Firm.    TheDodd-Frank Act also requires each of our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to conduct an annual stress test. MSBNA and MSPBNA submitted their 2016 annual  company-run  stress tests to the OCC on April 5, 2016 andpublished a summary of their stress test results on June 23, 2016. For the 2017 stress test cycle, MSBNA and MSPBNA must submit their 2017 annual  company-run  stress tests to the OCC by April 5, 2017and publish the summary results between June 15, 2017 and July 15, 2017.    Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the RequiredCapital Framework    Our required capital (Required Capital) estimation is based on the Required Capital framework, aninternal capital adequacy measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments is based on capital usage calculated by the Required Capital framework, as well as each business segments relative contribution to our total RequiredCapital. Required Capital is assessed for each business segment and further attributed to product lines. This process is intended to align capital with the                   71     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis             risks in each business segment in order to allow senior management to evaluate returns on a risk-adjusted basis.   The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage use-of-capital  measure, which is compared with our regulatory capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern capital after absorbing potential losses fromstress events, where applicable, at a point in time. We define the difference between our total average common equity and the sum of the average common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as Parent Company equity. We generally holdParent Company equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth, acquisitions and other capital needs.    EffectiveJanuary 1, 2016, the common equity estimation and attribution to the business segments are based on our pro forma fully  phased-in  regulatory capital, including supplementary leverage and stress losses(which results in more capital being attributed to the business segments), whereas prior periods were attributed based on transitional regulatory capital provisions. Also, beginning in 2016, the amount of capital allocated to the business segmentswill be set at the beginning of each year and will remain fixed throughout the year until the next annual reset. Differences between available and Required Capital will be attributed to Parent Company equity during the year. Periods prior to 2016have not been recast under this new methodology.    The Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over time in response to changes inthe business and regulatory environment, for example, to incorporate stress testing or enhancements in modeling techniques. We will continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

Amounts are calculated on a monthly basis. Average common equity is a  non-GAAP financial measure that we consider to be a useful measure for us, investors and analysts to assess capital adequacy.    RegulatoryDevelopments    Resolution and Recovery Planning   Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to submit to the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation(FDIC) an annual resolution plan that  describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material financial distress or failure.   Our preferred resolution strategy, which is set out in our 2015 resolution plan, is an SPOE strategy. On September 30, 2016, we submitteda status report to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC in respect of certain shortcomings identified in our 2015 resolution plan. Pursuant to the status report, we indicated that the Parent Company will amend and restate its support agreement with itsmaterial subsidiaries that is designed to ensure that such subsidiaries have sufficient capital and liquidity as and when needed throughout a resolution scenario.   Under the amended and restated support agreement, upon the occurrence of a resolution scenario, the Parent Company will be obligated tocontribute or loan on a subordinated basis all of its material assets, other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company and certain intercompany receivables, to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material subsidiaries.   The obligations of the Parent Company under the amended and restated support agreement will be secured on a senior basis by the assets of theParent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company). As a result, claims of our material subsidiaries against the assets of the Parent Company (other than shares in subsidiaries of the Parent Company) will be effectively seniorto unsecured obligations of the Parent Company.    Our next full resolution plan submission will be on July 1, 2017. If the FederalReserve and the FDIC were to jointly determine that our 2017 resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly resolution, and if we were unable to address any deficiencies identified by the regulators, we or any of our subsidiariesmay be subject to more stringent capital, leverage, or liquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, or, after a  two-year  period, we may be required to divest assets oroperations.    In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines that establish enforceable standards for recovery planning by nationalbanks and certain other institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, calculated on a rolling four-quarter average basis, including MSBNA. The guidelines were effective on January 1, 2017, and MSBNA must be incompliance by January 1, 2018.    In May 2016, the Federal Reserve proposed a rule that would impose contractual requirements oncertain qualified financial contracts (covered QFCs) to which U.S.  G-SIBs,                December 2016 Form 10-K     72              Managements Discussion and Analysis             including us, and their subsidiaries are parties. In August 2016, the OCC proposed a rule that would subject national banks that are subsidiaries of U.S. G-SIBs,  including our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, as well as certain other institutions (collectively with U.S.  G-SIBs  and their other subsidiaries, coveredentities), to substantively identical requirements.    Under the proposals, covered QFCs must expressly provide that transferrestrictions and default rights against a covered entity are limited to the same extent as provided under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act and their implementing regulations. In addition, covered QFCs may notpermit the exercise of cross-default rights against a covered entity based on an affiliates entry into insolvency, resolution or similar proceedings. If adopted as proposed, the requirements would take effect at the start of the first calendarquarter that begins at least one year after the final rules are issued. We continue to evaluate the potential impact of the proposals, which are subject to public comment and further rulemaking procedures.   For more information about resolution and recovery planning requirements and our activities in these areas, seeBusinessSupervision and RegulationFinancial Holding CompanyResolution and Recovery Planning in Part I, Item 1.   Legacy Covered Funds under the Volcker Rule   The Volcker Rule prohibits banking entities, including us and our affiliates, from engaging in certain proprietarytrading activities, as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to exemptions for underwriting, market-making-related activities, risk-mitigating hedging and certain other activities. The Volcker Rule also prohibits certain investments andrelationships by banking entities with covered funds, with a number of exemptions and exclusions.    Banking entities wererequired to bring all of their activities and investments into conformance with the Volcker Rule by July 21, 2015, subject to certain extensions. The Federal Reserve has extended the conformance period until July 21, 2017 for investmentsin, and relationships with, covered funds that were in place before December 31, 2013, referred to as legacy covered funds. The Volcker Rule also permits the Federal Reserve to provide an additional transition period of up to fiveyears for banking entities to conform investments in certain legacy covered funds that are also illiquid funds.  On December 12, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a policy statement with information abouthow banking entities may seek this further statutory extension. Additionally, the Federal Reserve stated that it expects the illiquid funds of banking entities to generally qualify for extensions, although they may not be granted if the bankingentity has not demonstrated meaningful progress to conform or divest its illiquid funds, or has a deficient compliance program under the Volcker Rule, or if the Federal Reserve has concerns about evasion. We submitted our application for illiquidfunds extension in January 2017, covering essentially all of our approximately $1.9 billion of  non-conforming  investments in, and relationships with, legacy covered funds subject to the Volcker Rule.   Off-Balance  Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   Off-Balance  Sheet Arrangements   We enter into various  off-balance  sheet arrangements, including through unconsolidated special purposeentities (SPEs) and lending-related financial instruments ( e.g. , guarantees and commitments), primarily in connection with the Institutional Securities and Investment Management business segments.   We utilize SPEs primarily in connection with securitization activities. For information on our securitization activities, see Note 13 to theconsolidated financial statements in Item 8.    For information on our commitments, obligations under certain guarantee arrangements andindemnities, see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. For further information on our lending commitments, see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskRisk ManagementCredit RiskLendingActivities in Item 7A.    Contractual Obligations   In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligationsinclude long-term borrowings, other secured financings, contractual interest payments, contractual payments on time deposits, operating leases and purchase obligations.                   73     December 2016 Form 10-K          Managements Discussion and Analysis                                           At December 31, 2016            Payments Due in:      $ in millions     2017        2018-2019        2020-2021        Thereafter        Total        Long-termborrowings 1     $  26,127        $  41,689        $  33,915        $  63,044        $  164,775        Other securedfinancings 1        3,377           5,551           270           206           9,404        Contractual interest payments 2        4,654           7,263           4,954           13,794           30,665        Timedeposits 3        1,210           43           8           50           1,311        Operating leases premises 4        649           1,176           949           2,958           5,732        Purchaseobligations 5        438           485           167           208           1,298       Total 6     $      36,455        $  56,207        $  40,263        $  80,260        $      213,185            1.    For further information on long-term borrowings and other secured financings, see Note 11 to the consolidated financialstatements in Item 8. Amounts presented for Other secured financings are financings with original maturities greater than one year.     2.    Amounts represent estimated future contractual interest payments related to unsecured long-term borrowings based onapplicable interest rates at December 31, 2016.     3.    Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments related to time deposits primarily held at our U.S. BankSubsidiaries.     4.    For further information on operating leases covering premises and equipment, see Note 12 to the consolidated financialstatements in Item 8.     5.    Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments for, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, computerand telecommunications maintenance agreements, and certain transmission, transportation and storage contracts related to the commodities business. Purchase obligations at December 31, 2016 reflect the minimum contractual obligation underlegally enforceable contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets.    6.    Amounts exclude unrecognized tax benefits, as the timing and amount of future cash payments are not determinable atthis time (see Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information).      Effects of Inflation and Changes in Interest and Foreign Exchange Rates   To the extent that an increased inflation outlook results in rising interest rates or has negative impacts on the valuation of financialinstruments that exceed the impact on the value of our liabilities, it may adversely affect our financial position and profitability. Rising inflation may also result in increases in our  non-interest  expensesthat may not be readily recoverable in higher prices of services offered. Other changes in the interest rate environment and related volatility as well as expectations about the level of future interest rates could also impact our results ofoperations.    A significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and changes in foreign exchangerates relative to the U.S. dollar, therefore, can affect the value of  non-U.S.  dollar net assets, revenues and expenses. Potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closelymonitored, and, where cost-justified, strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on our financial performance. These strategies may include the financing of  non-U.S. dollar assets with direct or swap-based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets, revenues, expenses or cash flows. For information aboutcumulative foreign currency translation adjustments, see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.                December 2016 Form 10-K     74            Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk      Risk Management   Overview    Management believes effectiverisk management is vital to the success of our business activities. Accordingly, we have established an enterprise risk management (ERM) framework to integrate the diverse roles of risk management into a holistic enterprise structure andto facilitate the incorporation of risk assessment into decision-making processes across the Firm. Risk is an inherent part of our businesses and activities. We have policies and procedures in place to identify, measure, monitor, advise, challengeand control the principal risks involved in the activities of the Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment Management business segments, as well as at the Parent Company level. The principal risks involved in our businessactivities include market (including  non-trading  interest rate risk), credit, operational, liquidity, model, compliance, strategic and reputational risk. Strategic risk is integrated into our businessplanning, embedded in the evaluation of all principal risks and overseen by our Board of Directors (the Board).    Thecornerstone of our risk management philosophy is the pursuit of risk-adjusted returns through prudent risk taking that protects our capital base and franchise. This philosophy is implemented through the ERM framework. Five key principles underliethis philosophy: integrity, comprehensiveness, independence, accountability and transparency. To help ensure the efficacy of risk management, which is an essential component of our reputation, senior management requires thorough and frequentcommunication and the appropriate escalation of risk matters. The fast-paced, complex and constantly evolving nature of global financial markets  requires us to maintain a risk management culture that is incisive, knowledgeable about specialized products and markets, and subject to ongoing review and enhancement.   Our risk appetite defines the types of risk that the Firm is willing to accept in pursuit of our strategic objectives and business plan,taking into account the interest of clients and fiduciary duties to shareholders, as well as capital and other regulatory requirements. This risk appetite is embedded in our risk culture and linked to our short-term and long-term strategic, capitaland financial plans, as well as compensation programs. This risk appetite and the related Board-level risk limits and risk tolerance statements are reviewed and approved by the Risk Committee of the Board (BRC), and the Board on, atleast, an annual basis.    Risk Governance Structure   Risk management at the Firm requires independent Firm-level oversight, accountability of our business divisions, and effective communicationof risk matters across the Firm, to senior management and ultimately to the Board. Our risk governance structure is composed of the Board; the BRC, the Audit Committee of the Board (BAC), and the Operations and Technology Committee ofthe Board (BOTC); the Firm Risk Committee (FRC); the functional risk and control committees; senior management oversight (including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officerand Chief Compliance Officer); the Internal Audit Department and risk managers, committees, and groups within and across the business segments and operating legal entities. The ERM framework, composed of independent but complementary entities,facilitates efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes.                    75     December 2016 Form 10-K          Risk Disclosures                     1.    Committees include Securities Risk Committee, Wealth Management Risk Committee and Investment Management RiskCommittee     2.    Committees include Capital Commitment Committee, Global Large Loan Committee, Equity Underwriting Committee,Leveraged Finance Underwriting Committee, Municipal Capital Commitment Committee      Morgan Stanley Board of Directors.     The Board has oversight for theERM framework and is responsible for helping to ensure that our risks are managed in a sound manner. The Board has authorized the committees within the ERM framework to help facilitate our risk oversight responsibilities. As set forth in ourCorporate Governance Policies, the Board also oversees, and receives reports on, our financial performance, strategy and business plans as well as our practices and procedures relating to culture, values and conduct.   Risk Committee of the Board.     The BRC is composed of  non-management directors. The BRC oversees our global ERM framework; oversees the major risk exposures of the Firm, including market, credit, operational, model, liquidity, and reputational risk, against established risk measurement methodologies and the stepsmanagement has taken to monitor and control such exposures; oversees our risk appetite statement, including risk limits and tolerances; reviews capital, liquidity and funding strategy and related guidelines and policies; reviews the contingencyfunding plan and internal capital adequacy assessment process and capital plan; oversees our significant risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies; oversees the performance of the Chief Risk Officer; reviews reports from ourStrategic Transactions Committee, Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) Committee, and Resolution and Recovery Planning (RRP) Committee; reviews significant reputational risk, franchise risk, new product risk,emerging risks and regulatory matters; and reviews results of Internal Audit reviews and assessment of the risk management, liquidity and capital functions. The BRC reports to the entire Board on a regular basis, coordinates with other Boardcommittees with  respect to oversight of risk management and risk assessment guidelines and the entire Board attends quarterly meetings with the BRC.   Audit Committee of the Board.     The BAC is composed of independent directors. The BAC oversees the integrity ofour consolidated financial statements, compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and system of internal controls; oversees risk management and risk assessment guidelines in coordination with the Board, BRC and BOTC and reviews the majorlegal and compliance risk exposures of the Firm and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; selects, determines the fees, evaluates and when appropriate, replaces the independent auditor; oversees the qualifications,independence and performance of our independent auditor, and  pre-approves  audit and permitted  non-audit  services; oversees the performance of our Global Audit Director;and after review, recommends to the Board the acceptance and inclusion of the annual audited consolidated financial statements in the Firms Annual Report on Form  10-K.  The BAC reports to the entire Boardon a regular basis.    Operations and Technology Committee of the Board.      The BOTC is composed of  non-management  directors. The BOTC oversees our operations and technology strategy, including trends that may affect such strategy; reviews operations and technology budget and significant expenditures andinvestments in support of such strategy; reviews operations and technology metrics; oversees risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies regarding operations and technology risk; reviews the major operations and technology               December 2016 Form 10-K     76              Risk Disclosures             risk exposures of the Firm, including information security and cybersecurity risks, and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures; and oversees our business continuityplanning. The BOTC reports to the entire Board on a regular basis.    Firm Risk Committee.     The Board has alsoauthorized the FRC, a management committee appointed and chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Firm, including the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to oversee theglobal ERM framework. The FRCs responsibilities include oversight of our risk management principles, procedures and limits and the monitoring of capital levels and material market, credit, operational, model, liquidity, legal, compliance andreputational risk matters, and other risks, as appropriate, and the steps management has taken to monitor and manage such risks. The FRC also establishes and communicates risk tolerance, including aggregate Firm limits and tolerance, as appropriate.The Governance Process Review Subcommittee of the FRC oversees governance and process issues on behalf of the FRC. The FRC reports to the entire Board, the BAC, the BOTC and the BRC through the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Financial Officer and ChiefLegal Officer.    Functional Risk and Control Committees.     Functional risk and control committees comprisingthe ERM framework, including the Firm Credit Risk Committee, the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, the Asset/Liability Management Committee, the Global Compliance Committee, the Technology Governance Committee and the Firm Franchise Committee,facilitate efficient and comprehensive supervision of our risk exposures and processes. The Strategic Transactions Committee reviews large strategic transactions and principal investments for the Firm; the CCAR Committee and oversee ourComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review and Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing; our RRP Committee oversees our Title I Resolution Plan and Recovery Plan; the Global Legal Entity Oversight and Governance Committee monitors the governance framework thatoperates over our consolidated legal entity population; the Enterprise Regulatory Oversight Committee oversees significant regulatory and supervisory requirements and assessments; various commitment and underwriting committees are responsible forreviewing capital, lending and underwriting commitments on behalf of us; and the Culture, Values and Conduct Committee oversees Firm-wide standards and initiatives relating to culture, values and conduct, including training and enhancements toperformance and compensation processes.    In addition, each business segment has a risk committee that is responsible for helping to ensurethat the business segment, as applicable, adheres to established limits for market, credit, operational and other risks; implements risk measurement, monitoring, and management policies, procedures, controls and  systems that are consistent with the risk framework established by the FRC; and reviews, on a periodic basis, our aggregate risk exposures, risk exception experience, and the efficacy of our riskidentification, measurement, monitoring and management policies and procedures, and related controls.    Chief RiskOfficer.     The Chief Risk Officer, who is independent of business units, reports to the BRC and the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Risk Officer oversees compliance with our risk limits; approves exceptions to our risklimits; independently reviews material market, credit, liquidity, model and operational risks; and reviews results of risk management processes with the Board, the BRC and the BAC, as appropriate. The Chief Risk Officer also coordinates with theChief Financial Officer regarding capital and liquidity management and works with the Compensation, Management Development and Succession Committee of the Board to help ensure that the structure and design of incentive compensation arrangements donot encourage unnecessary and excessive risk taking.    Independent Risk Management Functions.     The independentrisk management functions (Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Model Risk and Liquidity Risk Management Departments) are independent of our business units. These functions assist senior management and the FRC in monitoring and controllingour risk through a number of control processes. Each function maintains its own risk governance structure with specified individuals and committees responsible for aspects of managing risk. Further discussion about the responsibilities of the riskmanagement functions may be found below under Market Risk, Credit Risk, Operational Risk, Model Risk, and Liquidity Risk.   Support and Control Groups.     Our support and control groups include the Legal and Compliance Division, theFinance Division, the Operations Division, the Technology and Data Division, the Human Resources Department, Strategy and Execution, and Corporate Services. Our support and control groups coordinate with the business segment control groups to reviewthe risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to, among other things, controls over financial reporting and disclosure; the business segments market, credit and operational risk profile; liquidity risks; model risks;sales practices; reputational, legal enforceability, compliance and regulatory risk; and technological risks. Participation by the senior officers of the Firm and business segment control groups helps ensure that risk policies and procedures,exceptions to risk limits, new products and business ventures, and transactions with risk elements undergo thorough review.    InternalAudit Department.     The Internal Audit Department provides independent risk and control assessment and reports to the BAC. The Internal Audit Department provides an independent assessment of our control environment and risk                   77     December 2016 Form 10-K          Risk Disclosures             management processes using a risk-based audit coverage model and audit execution methodology developed from professional auditing standards. The Internal Audit Department also reviews and testsour compliance with internal guidelines set for risk management and risk monitoring, as well as external rules and regulations governing the industry. It effects these responsibilities through periodic reviews (with specified minimum frequency) ofour processes, activities, products or information systems; targeted reviews of specific controls and activities;  pre-implementation  or initiative reviews of new or significantly changed processes, activities,products or information systems; and special investigations required as a result of internal factors or regulatory requests. In addition to regular reports to the BAC, the Global Audit Director also periodically reports to the BRC and BOTC onrisk-related controls.    Culture, Values and Conduct of Employees.     Employees of the Firm are accountable forconducting themselves in accordance with our core values:  Putting Clients First, Doing the Right Thing, Leading with Exceptional Ideas and Giving Back . We are committed to building on our strong culture anchored in these core values, andsupported by our governance framework, Board and management oversight, effective risk management and controls, training and development programs, policies, procedures, and defined roles and responsibilities, including the role of the Culture, Valuesand Conduct Committee. Our Code of Conduct (the Code) establishes standards for employee conduct that further reinforce the Firms commitment to integrity and ethical conduct. Every new hire and every employee annually mustcertify to their understanding of and adherence to the Code. The employee annual review process includes evaluation of adherence to the Code and our core values. The Global Incentive Compensation Discretion Policy sets forth standards for managerswhen making annual compensation decisions and specifically provides that managers must consider whether their employees effectively managed and/or supervised risk control practices during the performance year. We also have several mutuallyreinforcing processes to identify employee conduct that may have an impact on employment status, current-year compensation and/or prior-year compensation. Our clawback and cancellation provisions, which permit recovery of deferred incentivecompensation, apply to a broad scope of employee conduct, including any act or omission that constitutes a breach of obligation to the Firm (including failure to comply with internal compliance, ethics or risk management standards, and failure orrefusal to perform duties satisfactorily, including supervisory and management duties), causes a restatement of our consolidated financial results, constitutes a violation of our global risk management principles, policies and standards, or causes aloss of revenues associated with a position on which the employee was paid and the employee operated outside of internal control policies.  Risk Management Process   The following is a discussion of our risk management policies and procedures for our principal risks (capital and liquidity risk is discussedin Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7). The discussion focuses on our securities activities (primarily our institutional tradingactivities) and corporate lending and related activities. We believe that these activities generate a substantial portion of our principal risks. This discussion and the estimated amounts of our risk exposure generated by our statistical analysesare forward-looking statements. However, the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events, and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which we operate and certain otherfactors described below.    Risk Limits Framework   Risk limits and quantitative metrics provide the basis for monitoring risk-taking activity and avoiding outsized risk-taking. Our risk-takingcapacity is sized through the Firms capital planning process where losses are estimated under the Firms Bank Holding Company Severely Adverse stress testing scenario. We also maintain a comprehensive suite of risk limits and quantitativemetrics to support and implement our risk appetite statement. Our risk limits support linkages between the overall risk appetite, which is reviewed by the Board, and more granular risk-taking decisions and activities.   Risk limits, once established, are reviewed and updated on at least an annual basis, with more frequent updates as necessary. Board-level risklimits address the most important Firm-wide aggregations of risk, including, but not limited to, stressed market, credit and liquidity risks. Additional risk limits approved by the FRC address more specific types of risk and are bound by thehigher-level Board risk limits.    Market Risk   Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, implied volatilities (the pricevolatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices), correlations or other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market risk as a result of trading, investingand client facilitation activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business segment where the substantial majority of our  Value-at-Risk (VaR) for market risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur trading-related market risk within the Wealth Management business segment. The Investment Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading  market risk from capital investments in real estate funds and investments in private equity               December 2016 Form 10-K     78              Risk Disclosures             vehicles. Market risk includes  non-trading  interest rate risk.  Non-trading  interest rate risk in the banking book(amounts classified for regulatory capital purposes under the banking book regime) refers to the exposure that a change in interest rates will result in prospective earnings changes for assets and liabilities in the banking book.   Sound market risk management is an integral part of our culture. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuringthat market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. The control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management. The Market Risk Department is responsible for ensuringtransparency of material market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits and escalating risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Market Risk Department monitors our risk against limitson aggregate risk exposures, performs a variety of risk analyses, routinely reports risk summaries, and maintains our VaR and scenario analysis systems. These limits are designed to control price and market liquidity risk. Market risk is alsomonitored through various measures: by use of statistics (including VaR and related analytical measures); by measures of position sensitivity; and through routine stress testing, which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios ofspecified changes in market factors, and scenario analyses conducted by the Market Risk Department in collaboration with the business units. The material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Market RiskDepartment that are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and the Board.    The Chief Risk Officer, amongother things, monitors market risk through the Market Risk Department, which reports to the Chief Risk Officer and is independent of the business units, and has close interactions with senior management and the risk management control groups in thebusiness units. The Chief Risk Officer is a member of the FRC, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer, which includes the most senior officers of the Firm, and regularly reports on market risk matters to this committee, as well as to the BRCand the Board.    Sales and Trading and Related Activities   Primary Market Risk Exposures and Market Risk Management.     During 2016, we had exposures to a wide range ofinterest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity pricesand the associated implied volatilities and spreadsrelated to the global markets in which we conduct our trading activities.   We are exposed to interest rate and credit spread risk as a result of our market-making activities and other trading in  interest rate-sensitive financial instruments ( e.g ., risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates, the timing of mortgage prepayments, the shape of theyield curve and credit spreads). The activities from which those exposures arise and the markets in which we are active include, but are not limited to, the following: corporate and government debt across both developed and emerging markets andasset-backed debt (including mortgage-related securities).    We are exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result ofmaking markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining other positions (including positions in  non-public  entities). Positions in  non-public  entities mayinclude, but are not limited to, exposures to private equity, venture capital, private partnerships, real estate funds and other funds. Such positions are less liquid, have longer investment horizons and are more difficult to hedge than listedequities.    We are exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies andforeign currency derivatives, from maintaining foreign exchange positions and from holding  non-U.S.  dollar-denominated financial instruments.   We are exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of market-making activities in commodity products related primarilyto electricity, natural gas, oil and precious metals. Commodity exposures are subject to periods of high price volatility as a result of changes in supply and demand. These changes can be caused by weather conditions; physical production andtransportation; or geopolitical and other events that affect the available supply and level of demand for these commodities.    We manageour trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activities consist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financialinstruments, including a variety of derivative products ( e.g ., futures, forwards, swaps and options). Hedging activities may not always provide effective mitigation against trading losses due to differences in the terms, specificcharacteristics or other basis risks that may exist between the hedge instrument and the risk exposure that is being hedged. We manage the market risk associated with our trading activities on a Firm-wide basis, on a worldwide trading division leveland on an individual product basis. We manage and monitor our market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that we believe is well-diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and that reflects our aggregaterisk tolerance as established by our senior management.                    79     December 2016 Form 10-K          Risk Disclosures             Aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the Firm across all divisions worldwide.Additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and, as appropriate, products and regions. Trading division risk managers, desk risk managers, traders and the Market Risk Department monitor market risk measures against limits inaccordance with policies set by our senior management.    VaR.     We use the statistical technique knownas VaR as one of the tools used to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures of our trading portfolios. The Market Risk Department calculates and distributes daily  VaR-based  risk measures tovarious levels of management.    VaR Methodology, Assumptions and Limitations.      We estimate VaR using amodel based on volatility-adjusted historical simulation for general market risk factors and Monte Carlo simulation for name-specific risk in corporate shares, bonds, loans and related derivatives. The model constructs a distribution of hypotheticaldaily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on the following: historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market risk factors; and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market riskfactor changes. Our VaR model uses four years of historical data with a volatility adjustment to reflect current market conditions. VaR for risk management purposes (Management VaR) is computed at a 95% level of confidence over a  one-day  time horizon, which is a useful indicator of possible trading losses resulting from adverse daily market moves. The  95%/one-day  VaR corresponds to the unrealized lossin portfolio value that, based on historically observed market risk factor movements, would have been exceeded with a frequency of 5%, or five times in every 100 trading days, if the portfolio were held constant for one day.   Our VaR model generally takes into account linear and  non-linear  exposures to equity and commodityprice risk, interest rate risk, credit spread risk and foreign exchange rates. The model also takes into account linear exposures to implied volatility risks for all asset classes and  non-linear  exposures toimplied volatility risks for equity, commodity and foreign exchange referenced products. The VaR model also captures certain implied correlation risks associated with portfolio credit derivatives, as well as certain basis risks ( e.g., corporate debt and related credit derivatives).    We use VaR as one of a range of risk management tools. Among their benefits, VaR modelspermit estimation of a portfolios aggregate market risk exposure, incorporating a range of varied market risks and portfolio assets. One key element of the VaR model is that it reflects risk reduction due to portfolio diversification orhedging activities. However, VaR has various limitations, which include, but are not  limited to: use of historical changes in market risk factors, which may not be accurate predictors of future market conditions and may not fully incorporate the risk of extreme market events thatare outsized relative to observed historical market behavior or reflect the historical distribution of results beyond the 95% confidence interval; and reporting of losses in a single day, which does not reflect the risk of positions that cannot beliquidated or hedged in one day. A small proportion of market risk generated by trading positions is not included in VaR. The modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions relies on approximations that, under certain circumstances, couldproduce significantly different results from those produced using more precise measures. VaR is most appropriate as a risk measure for trading positions in liquid financial markets and will understate the risk associated with severe events, such asperiods of extreme illiquidity. We are aware of these and other limitations and, therefore, use VaR as only one component in our risk management oversight process. This process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analyses and extensiverisk monitoring, analysis and control at the trading desk, division and Firm levels.    Our VaR model evolves over time in response tochanges in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities. We are committed to continuous review and enhancement of VaR methodologies and assumptions in order to capture evolving risksassociated with changes in market structure and dynamics. As part of our regular process improvements, additional systematic and name-specific risk factors may be added to improve the VaR models ability to more accurately estimate risks tospecific asset classes or industry sectors.    Since the reported VaR statistics are estimates based on historical data, VaR should not beviewed as predictive of our future revenues or financial performance or of our ability to monitor and manage risk. There can be no assurance that our actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated below or that suchlosses will not occur more than five times in 100 trading days for a  95%/one-day  VaR. VaR does not predict the magnitude of losses that, should they occur, may be significantly greater than the VaR amount.   VaR statistics are not readily comparable across firms because of differences in the firms portfolios, modeling assumptions andmethodologies. These differences can result in materially different VaR estimates across firms for similar portfolios. The impact of such differences varies depending on the factor history assumptions, the frequency with which the factor history isupdated and the confidence level. As a result, VaR statistics are more useful when interpreted as indicators of trends in a firms risk profile rather than as an absolute measure of risk to be compared across firms.               December 2016 Form 10-K     80              Risk Disclosures             We utilize the same VaR model for risk management purposes, as well as for regulatory capitalcalculations. Our VaR model has been approved by our regulators for use in regulatory capital calculations.    The portfolio of positionsused for Management VaR differs from that used for regulatory capital requirements (Regulatory VaR), as Management VaR contains certain positions that are excluded from Regulatory VaR. Examples include counterparty credit valuationadjustment (CVA) and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges.    The followingtable presents the Management VaR for the Trading portfolio, on a  period-end,  annual average, and annual high and low basis. To further enhance the transparency of the traded market risk, the Credit PortfolioVaR has been disclosed as a separate category from the Primary Risk Categories. The Credit Portfolio includes counterparty CVA and related hedges, as well as loans that are carried at fair value and associated hedges.

Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total Management VaR and the sum of the component VaRs. Thisbenefit arises because the simulated  one-day  losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component.    2.    The high and low VaR values for the total Management VaR and each of the component VaRs might have occurred on differentdays during the year, and therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.  The average total Management VaR for 2016 was $43 million compared with $50 millionfor 2015. The average Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories for 2016 was $36 million compared with $47 million in 2015. The noted decreases were driven by an overall reduction in risk exposures across the Sales and Tradingbusinesses.    Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues for 2016.      One method of evaluating thereasonableness of our VaR model as a measure of our potential volatility of net revenues is to compare VaR with actual trading revenues. Assuming no intraday trading, for a  95%/one-day  VaR, the expected numberof times that trading losses should exceed VaR during the year is 13, and, in general, if trading losses were to exceed VaR more than 21 times in a year, the adequacy of the VaR model would be questioned. We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaRmodel by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results for the Firm, as well as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of tradinglosses to evaluate the VaR models accuracy relative to realized trading results.    The distribution of VaR Statistics and NetRevenues is presented in the following histograms for the Total Trading populations.    TotalTrading.      As shown in the  95%/One-Day  Management VaR table on the preceding page, the average  95%/one-day  total Management VaR for 2016was $43 million. The following histogram presents the distribution of the daily  95%/one-day  total Management VaR for 2016, which was in a range between $30 million and $60 million forapproximately 99% of trading days during the year.            The following histogram shows the distribution for 2016 of daily net trading revenues, including profitsand losses from Interest rate and credit spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price, and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities, for our Trading businesses. Daily net trading revenues also include intradaytrading activities but exclude certain items not captured in the VaR model, such as fees, commissions and net interest income. Daily net trading revenues                   81     December 2016 Form 10-K          Risk Disclosures             differ from the definition of revenues required for Regulatory VaR backtesting, which further excludes intraday trading. During 2016, we experienced net trading losses on 18 days, of which no daywas in excess of the  95%/one-day  Total Management VaR.               Non-Trading  Risks   We believe that sensitivity analysis is an appropriate representation of our  non-trading  risks.Reflected below is this analysis covering substantially all of the  non-trading  risk in our portfolio.   Counterparty Exposure Related to Our Own Credit Spread.      The credit spread risk sensitivity of thecounterparty exposure related to our own credit spread corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $6 million for each 1 basis point widening in our credit spread level at both December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   Funding Liabilities.      The credit spread risk sensitivity of our  mark-to-market  funding liabilities corresponded to an increase in value of approximately $17 million and $11 million for each 1 basis point widening in our credit spread level at December 31,2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    Interest Rate Risk Sensitivity.      The following tablepresents an analysis of selected instantaneous upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks on net interest income over the next 12 months for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. These shocks are applied to our 12-month  forecast for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries, which incorporates market expectations of interest rates and our forecasted business activity, including our deposit deployment strategy and asset-liabilitymanagement hedges.    During the fourth quarter of 2016, we changed the criteria used to determine the pricing for our deposit liabilitiesto client cash balances from client assets under management. As a result of the change, the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries balance sheet is expected to have greater sensitivity to higher rates than in prior periods.  U.S. Bank Subsidiaries Net Interest Income Sensitivity Analysis                  $ in millions      At December 31, 2016         At December 31, 2015         +200 basis points      $  550        $  (149)        +100 basis points         262           (84)         -100 basis points         (655  )         (512)       At December 31, 2016, the upward instantaneous interest rate shocks result in a positive impact to ourU.S. Bank Subsidiaries projected net interest income over the following 12 months.    We do not manage to any single rate scenario butrather manage net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to optimize across a range of possible outcomes. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no changes in othermacroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates, and includes subjective assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior and other factors.   Investments .    We have exposure to public and private companies through direct investments, as well as throughfunds that invest in these assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions with long investment horizons, a portion of which are for business facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these investments is measured by estimatingthe potential reduction in net income associated with a 10% decline in investment values and related impact on performance fees.    Investments Sensitivity,Including Related Performance Fees                          10% Sensitivity      $ in millions        At  December 31, 2016           At  December 31,   2015        Investments related to Investment Management activities      $               332         $               371        Other investments:                   Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co., Ltd.         158            142        Other Firm investments         130            194       Equity Market Sensitivity.     In the Wealth Management and Investment Managementbusiness segments, certain  fee-based  revenue streams are driven by the value of clients equity holdings. The overall level of revenues for these streams also depends on multiple additional factors thatinclude, but are not limited to, the level and duration of the equity market decline, price volatility, the geographic and industry mix of client assets, the rate and magnitude of client investments and redemptions, and the impact of such marketdecline and price volatility on client behavior. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate completely with changes in the equity markets.               December 2016 Form 10-K     82              Risk Disclosures             Credit Risk   Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower, counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to us. Weprimarily incur credit risk exposure to institutions and individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business segments.   We may incur credit risk in our Institutional Securities business segment through a variety of activities, including, but not limited to, thefollowing:                extending credit to clients through various lending commitments;               entering into swap or other derivative contracts under which counterparties have obligations to make paymentsto us;                providing short- or long-term funding that is secured by physical or financial collateral whose value may attimes be insufficient to fully cover the loan repayment amount;                posting margin and/or collateral to clearinghouses, clearing agencies, exchanges, banks, securities firms andother financial counterparties;                placing funds on deposit at other financial institutions to support our clearing and settlement obligations;and                investing or trading in securities and loan pools, whereby the value of these assets may fluctuate based onrealized or expected defaults on the underlying obligations or loans.    We incur credit risk in our Wealth Managementbusiness segment, primarily through lending to individuals and entities, including, but not limited to, the following:                margin loans collateralized by securities;               securities-based lending and other forms of secured loans, including tailored lending, to high net worthclients; and                single-family residential mortgage loans in conforming,  non-conforming or home equity lines of credit (HELOC) form, primarily to existing Wealth Management clients.    Monitoring and Control   In order to help protect us from losses, the Credit Risk Management Department establishes Firm-wide practices to evaluate,monitor and control credit risk exposure at the transaction, obligor and portfolio levels. The Credit Risk Management Department approves extensions of credit, evaluates the creditworthiness of the counterparties and borrowers on a regular basis,and ensures that credit exposure is actively monitored and managed. The evaluation of counterparties and  borrowers includes an assessment of the probability that an obligor will default on its financial obligations and any losses that may occur when an obligor defaults. In addition, credit riskexposure is actively managed by credit professionals and committees within the Credit Risk Management Department and through various risk committees, whose membership includes individuals from the Credit Risk Management Department. A comprehensiveand global Credit Limits Framework is utilized to manage credit risk levels across the Firm. The Credit Limits Framework is calibrated within our risk tolerance and includes single-name limits and portfolio concentration limits by country, industryand product type.    The Credit Risk Management Department ensures transparency of material credit risks, compliance with established limitsand escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. The Credit Risk Management Department also works closely with the Market Risk Department and applicable business units to monitor risk exposures and to perform stress tests toidentify, analyze and control credit risk concentrations arising in the lending and trading activities. The stress tests shock market factors ( e.g. , interest rates, commodity prices, credit spreads), risk parameters  (e.g. , defaultprobabilities and loss given default), recovery rates and expected losses in order to assess the impact of stresses on exposures, profit and loss, and our capital position. Stress and scenario tests are conducted in accordance with our establishedpolicies and procedures.    Credit Evaluation  The evaluation of corporate and institutional counterparties and borrowers includes assigning obligor credit ratings, which reflect anassessment of an obligors probability of default and loss given default. Credit evaluations typically involve the assessment of financial statements; leverage; liquidity; capital strength; asset composition and quality; market capitalization;access to capital markets; adequacy of collateral, if applicable; and in the case of certain loans, cash flow projections and debt service requirements. The Credit Risk Management Department also evaluates strategy, market position, industrydynamics, management and other factors that could affect the obligors risk profile. Additionally, the Credit Risk Management Department evaluates the relative position of our exposure in the borrowers capital structure and relativerecovery prospects, as well as other structural elements of the particular transaction.    The evaluation of consumer borrowers is tailoredto the specific type of lending. Margin and securities-based loans are evaluated based on factors that include, but are not limited to, the amount of the loan, the degree of leverage and the quality, diversification, price volatility and liquidityof the collateral. The underwriting of residential real estate loans includes, but is not limited to, review of the obligors income,                   83     December 2016 Form 10-K          Risk Disclosures             net worth, liquidity, collateral,  loan-to-value  ratio and credit bureau information. Subsequent credit monitoringfor individual loans is performed at the portfolio level, and collateral values are monitored on an ongoing basis.    Credit risk metricsassigned to our borrowers during the evaluation process are incorporated into the Credit Risk Management Departments maintenance of the allowance for loan losses for the loans held for the investment portfolio. Such allowance serves as areserve for probable inherent losses, as well as probable losses related to loans identified for impairment. For more information on the allowance for loan losses, see Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.   Risk Mitigation    We may seek tomitigate credit risk from our lending and trading activities in multiple ways, including collateral provisions, guarantees and hedges. At the transaction level, we seek to mitigate risk through management of key risk elements such as size, tenor,financial covenants, seniority and collateral. We actively hedge our lending and derivatives exposure through various financial instruments that may include single-name, portfolio and structured credit derivatives. Additionally, we may sell, assignor syndicate loans and lending commitments to other financial institutions in the primary and secondary loan markets. In connection with our derivatives trading activities, we generally enter into master netting agreements and collateralarrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered under the same master agreement in the event of a counterpartydefault. A collateral management group monitors collateral levels against requirements and oversees the administration of the collateral function. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information about ourcollateralized transactions.    Lending Activities   We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high net worthindividuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the secondary market. In the consolidated balance sheets, these loans and lending commitments are carried at either fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings; held for investment, whichare recorded at amortized cost; or held for sale, which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loans held for investment and loans held for sale are classified in Loans, and loans held at fair value are classified in Trading assets in theconsolidated balance sheets. See Notes 3, 7 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.

See Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.     3.    Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to provide funding to clients for alllending transactions. Since commitments associated with these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity, they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.     4.    For syndications led by us, the lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed are net of the amountsagreed to by counterparties that will participate in the syndication. For syndications that we participate in and do not lead, lending commitments accepted by the borrower but not yet closed include only the amount that we expect will be allocatedfrom the lead, syndicate bank. Due to the nature of our obligations under the commitments, these amounts include certain commitments participated to third parties.               December 2016 Form 10-K     84              Risk Disclosures             Our credit exposure from our loans and lending commitments is measured in accordance with ourinternal risk management standards. Risk factors considered in determining the aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses include the borrowers financial strength, seniority of the loan, collateral type, volatility of collateral value,debt cushion,  loan-to-value  ratio, debt service ratio, covenants and counterparty type. Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and business conditions,nature and volume of the portfolio and lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may also be considered.    AtDecember 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses related to loans that were accounted for as held for investment was $274 million and $225 million, respectively, and the allowance for commitment lossesrelated to lending commitments that were accounted for as held for investment was $190 million and $185 million, respectively. The aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses increased over the year ended December 31, 2016primarily due to the energy sector. See Institutional Securities Lending Exposures Related to the Energy Industry herein and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information.   Institutional Securities Lending Activities .      In connection with certain of ourInstitutional Securities business segment activities, we provide loans and lending commitments to a diverse group of corporate and other institutional clients. These activities include corporate lending, commercial and residential mortgage lending,asset-backed lending, corporate loans purchased in the secondary market, financing extended to equities and commodities customers, and loans to municipalities. These loans and lending commitments may have varying terms; may be senior orsubordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual conditions applicable to the borrower; and may be syndicated, traded or hedged by us.   We also participate in securitization activities whereby we extend short-term or long-term funding to clients through loans and lendingcommitments that are secured by the assets of the borrower and generally provide for over-collateralization. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for information about our securitization activities.   Institutional Securities loans and lending commitments are mainly related to relationship-based and event-driven lending to select corporateclients. Relationship-based loans and lending commitments are used for general corporate purposes, working capital and liquidity purposes by our investment banking clients and typically consist of revolving lines of credit, letter of creditfacilities and term loans. In  connection with the relationship-based lending activities, we had hedges (which included single-name, sector and index hedges) with a notional amount of $20.2 billion and $12.0 billionat December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Event-driven loans and lending commitments are associated with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client merger, acquisition, recapitalization and project financeactivities. Event-driven loans and lending commitments typically consist of revolving lines of credit, term loans and bridge loans.

Institutional Securities Lending Exposures Related to the EnergyIndustry.     At December 31, 2016, Institutional Securities loans and lending commitments related to the energy industry were $11.8 billion, of which approximately  68% are accounted for as held for investment and 32% are accounted for as either held for sale or at fair value. Additionally, approximately 52% of the total energy industry loans and lendingcommitments were to investment grade counterparties. At December 31, 2016, the energy industry portfolio included $1.3 billion in loans and $2.1 billion in lending commitments to Oil and Gas Exploration and Production(E&P) companies.    The E&P loans were to  non-investment  grade counterparties,which are generally subject to periodic borrowing base reassessments based on the value of the underlying oil and gas reserves pledged as collateral. In limited situations, we may extend the period related to borrowing base reassessments typicallyin conjunction with taking certain risk mitigating actions with the borrower. Approximately 54% of the E&P lending commitments were to investment grade counterparties. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we increased the allowance forloan and commitment losses on held for investment energy exposures and incurred  mark-to-market  losses related to energy loans and lending commitments. See CreditRiskLending Activities herein for further information. To the extent commodities prices, or oil prices, remain at  year-end  levels, or deteriorate further, we may incur additional lending losses.   Institutional Securities Margin Lending.     In addition to the activities noted above, InstitutionalSecurities provides margin lending, which allows the client to borrow against the value of qualifying securities. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amounts related to margin lending were $11.9 billion and$10.6 billion, respectively, which were classified within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.   Wealth Management Lending Activities.     The principal Wealth Management lending activities includesecurities-based lending and residential real estate loans.    Securities-based lending provided to our retail clients is primarilyconducted through our Portfolio Loan Account (PLA) and Liquidity Access Line (LAL) platforms, which had an outstanding loan balance of $29.7 billion and $24.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31,2015, respectively. These loans allow the client to borrow money against the value of qualifying securities for any purpose other than purchasing securities. We establish approved credit lines against qualifying securities andmonitor limits daily and, pursuant to such guidelines, require customers to deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when necessary. These credit lines are primarily uncommitted loan facilities, as we reserve the rightto not make any advances, or may terminate these credit lines at any time. Factors considered in the review of these loans include, but are not limited to, the loan amount, the clients credit profile, the degree of leverage, collateraldiversification, price volatility and liquidity of the collateral.               December 2016 Form 10-K     86              Risk Disclosures             Residential real estate loans consist of first and second lien mortgages, including HELOC loans.Our underwriting policy is designed to ensure that all borrowers pass an assessment of capacity and willingness to pay, which includes an analysis utilizing industry standard credit scoring models ( e.g. , Fair Isaac Corporation(FICO) scores), debt ratios and assets of the borrower.  Loan-to-value  ratios are determined based on independent third-party property appraisal/valuations,and security lien position is established through title/ownership reports. The vast majority of mortgage and HELOC loans are held for investment in the Wealth Management business segments loan portfolio.   For the year ended December 31, 2016, loans and lending commitments associated with the Wealth Management business segment lending activitiesincreased by approximately 24%, mainly due to growth in LAL and residential real estate loans.

The Wealth Management business segment also provides margin lending to clients and had an outstanding balance of  $12.5 billion and $14.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which were classified within Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets.   In addition, the Wealth Management business segment has employee loans of $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2016 and December31, 2015, respectively, that are granted in conjunction with programs established by us to retain and recruit certain employees. These loans are recorded in Customer and other receivables in the consolidated balance sheets. These loans are fullrecourse, generally require periodic payments and have repayment terms ranging from 1 to 12 years. We establish an allowance for loan amounts we do not consider recoverable, which is recorded in Compensation and benefits expense.   Credit ExposureDerivatives    Weincur credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives. Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. In connection with our OTC derivative activities, wegenerally enter into master netting agreements and collateral arrangements with counterparties. These agreements provide us with the ability to demand collateral, as well as to liquidate collateral and offset receivables and payables covered underthe same master netting agreement in the event of counterparty default. We manage our trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies. These strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging. Hedging activitiesconsist of the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments, including a variety of derivative products ( e.g. , futures, forwards, swaps and options). For credit exposure information on our OTC derivativeproducts, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.    Credit Derivatives .    A creditderivative is a contract between a seller and buyer of protection against the risk of a credit event occurring on one or more debt obligations issued by a specified reference entity. The buyer typically pays a periodic premium over the life of thecontract and is protected for the period. If a credit event occurs, the seller is required to make payment to the beneficiary based on the terms of the credit derivative contract. Credit events, as defined in the contract, may be one or more of thefollowing defined events: bankruptcy, dissolution or insolvency of the referenced entity, failure to pay, obligation acceleration, repudiation, payment moratorium and restructurings.   We trade in a variety of credit derivatives and may either purchase or write protection on a single name or portfolio of referenced entities.In transactions referencing a portfolio of entities or securities, protection may be limited to a tranche of                   87     December 2016 Form 10-K          Risk Disclosures             exposure or a single name within the portfolio. We are an active market maker in the credit derivatives markets. As a market maker, we work to earn a bid-offer  spread on client flow business and manage any residual credit or correlation risk on a portfolio basis. Further, we use credit derivatives to manage our exposure to residential and commercialmortgage loans and corporate lending exposures. The effectiveness of our credit default swap (CDS) protection as a hedge of our exposures may vary depending upon a number of factors, including the contractual terms of the CDS.   We actively monitor our counterparty credit risk related to credit derivatives. A majority of our counterparties are composed of banks,broker-dealers, insurance and other financial institutions. Contracts with these counterparties may include provisions related to counterparty rating downgrades, which may result in the counterparty posting additional collateral to us. As with allderivative contracts, we consider counterparty credit risk in the valuation of our positions and recognize credit valuation adjustments as appropriate within Trading revenues in the consolidated income statements.

For further information on derivative instruments and hedging activities, see Note 4 to the consolidated financialstatements in Item 8.    Country Risk Exposure  Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might adversely affectus. We actively manage country risk exposure through a comprehensive risk management framework that combines credit and market fundamentals and allows us to effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. Country risk exposure before andafter hedging is monitored and managed.    Our obligor credit evaluation process may also identify indirect exposures whereby an obligor hasvulnerability or exposure to another country or jurisdiction. Examples of indirect exposures include mutual funds that invest in a single country, offshore companies whose assets reside in another country to that of the offshore jurisdiction andfinance company subsidiaries of corporations. Indirect exposures identified through the credit evaluation process may result in a reclassification of country risk.               December 2016 Form 10-K     88              Risk Disclosures             We conduct periodic stress testing that seeks to measure the impact on our credit and marketexposures of shocks stemming from negative economic or political scenarios. When deemed appropriate by our risk managers, the stress test scenarios include possible contagion effects. Second order risks such as the impact for core European banks oftheir peripheral exposures may also be considered. This analysis, and results of the stress tests, may result in the amendment of limits or exposure mitigation.   In addition to our country risk exposure, we disclose our cross-border risk exposure in Financial Statements and SupplementaryDataFinancial Data Supplement (Unaudited) in Item 8. It is based on the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Councils regulatory guidelines for reporting cross-border information and represents the amounts that we may not beable to obtain from a foreign country due to country-specific events, including unfavorable economic and political conditions, economic and social instability, and changes in government policies.   There can be substantial differences between our country risk exposure and cross-border risk exposure. For instance, unlike the cross-borderrisk exposure, our country risk exposure includes the effect of certain risk mitigants. In addition, the basis for determining the domicile of the country risk exposure is different from the basis for determining the cross-border risk exposure.Cross-border risk exposure is reported based on the country of jurisdiction for the obligor or guarantor. For country risk exposure, we consider factors in  addition to that of country of jurisdiction, including physical location of operations or assets, location and source of cash flows/revenues and location of collateral (if applicable) in order todetermine the basis for country risk exposure. Furthermore, cross-border risk exposure incorporates CDS only where protection is purchased, while country risk exposure incorporates CDS where protection is purchased or sold.   Our sovereign exposures consist of financial instruments entered into with sovereign and local governments. Our non-sovereign exposuresconsist of exposures to primarily corporations and financial institutions. The following table shows our 10 largest non-U.S. country risk net exposures at December 31, 2016. Index credit derivatives are included in the country risk exposure table.Each reference entity within an index is allocated to that reference entitys country of risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference entity in the index,adjusted for any fair value receivable/payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an entity in a differentcountry, the fair value of the CDS is reflected in the Net Counterparty Exposure column based on the country of the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted for the fair value of the receivable/payable is reflected in the NetInventory column based on the country of the underlying reference entity.                    89     December 2016 Form 10-K          Risk Disclosures            Top Ten Country Exposures at December 31, 2016                                      $ in millions      Net Inventory 1          Net  Counterparty   Exposure 2,3        Loans         Lending Commitments         Exposure Before Hedges        Hedges 4        Net Exposure 5        Country                                                  United Kingdom:                                                  Sovereigns      $  (1,220  )      $  9        $                          $                     $  (1,211  )      $              (255  )      $  (1,466  )      Non-sovereigns         353           9,264           3,208            5,374            18,199           (2,031  )         16,168        Total      $  (867  )      $  9,273        $  3,208         $  5,374         $  16,988        $  (2,286  )      $  14,702        France:                                                  Sovereigns      $  3,325        $  5        $           $           $  3,330        $  (50  )      $  3,280        Non-sovereigns         (105  )         2,128           168            2,847            5,038           (1,349  )         3,689        Total      $  3,220        $  2,133        $  168         $  2,847         $  8,368        $  (1,399  )      $  6,969        Brazil:                                                  Sovereigns      $  4,644        $          $           $           $  4,644        $  (11  )      $  4,633        Non-sovereigns         124           232           945            73            1,374           (792  )         582        Total      $  4,768        $  232        $  945         $  73         $  6,018        $  (803  )      $  5,215        Japan:                                                  Sovereigns      $  (260  )      $  174        $           $           $  (86  )      $  (82  )      $  (168  )      Non-sovereigns         486           3,046           319                        3,851           (141  )         3,710        Total      $              226        $  3,220        $  319         $           $  3,765        $  (223  )      $  3,542        Canada:                                                  Sovereigns      $  134        $              56        $           $           $              190        $          $              190        Non-sovereigns         (72  )         1,462           175            1,473            3,038           (423  )         2,615        Total      $  62        $  1,518        $  175         $  1,473         $  3,228        $  (423  )      $  2,805        Netherlands:                                                  Sovereigns      $  (39  )      $          $           $           $  (39  )      $  (20  )      $  (59  )      Non-sovereigns         289           728           413            1,420            2,850           (344  )         2,506        Total      $  250        $  728        $  413         $  1,420         $  2,811        $  (364  )      $  2,447        Italy:                                                  Sovereigns      $  1,090        $  (2  )      $           $           $  1,088        $  10        $  1,098        Non-sovereigns         119           556           39            647            1,361           (266  )         1,095        Total      $  1,209        $  554        $  39         $  647         $  2,449        $  (256  )      $  2,193        China:                                                  Sovereigns      $  82        $  274        $           $           $  356        $  (550  )      $  (194  )      Non-sovereigns         1,036           216           770            257            2,279           (10  )         2,269        Total      $  1,118        $  490        $  770         $  257         $  2,635        $  (560  )      $  2,075        Singapore:                                                  Sovereigns      $  1,600        $  92        $           $           $  1,692        $          $  1,692        Non-sovereigns         70           155           39            38            302                      302        Total      $  1,670        $  247        $  39         $  38         $  1,994        $          $  1,994        United Arab Emirates:                                                  Sovereigns      $  (27  )      $  1,227        $           $           $  1,200        $  (39  )      $  1,161        Non-sovereigns         (13  )         278           32            83            380           (15  )         365        Total      $  (40  )      $  1,505        $  32         $  83         $  1,580        $  (54  )      $  1,526            1.

At December 31, 2016,gross purchased protection, gross written protection, and net exposures related to single-name and index credit derivatives for those countries were $(85.3) billion, $83.7 billion and $(1.6) billion, respectively. For a further description ofthe triggers for purchased credit protection and whether those triggers may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see Credit ExposureDerivatives herein.     2.    Net counterparty exposure ( i.e ., repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC derivatives) takes intoconsideration legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral.     3.    At December 31, 2016, the benefit of collateral received against counterparty credit exposure was$9.5 billion in the U.K., with 96% of collateral consisting of cash and government obligations of the U.K., U.S. and France, and $6.6 billion in Japan with nearly all collateral consisting of cash and government obligations of Japan. Thebenefit of collateral received against counterparty credit exposure in the other countries totaled approximately $10.6 billion, with collateral primarily consisting of cash and government obligations of the U.S. These amounts do not includecollateral received on secured financing transactions.     4.    Amounts represent CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty exposure and lending executed by trading desksresponsible for hedging counterparty and lending credit risk exposures for us. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable.     5.    In addition, at December 31, 2016, we had exposure to these countries for overnight deposits with banks ofapproximately $10.2 billion.              December 2016 Form 10-K     90              Risk Disclosures             Country Risk Exposures Related to the United Kingdom.     AtDecember 31, 2016, our country risk exposures in the U.K. included net exposures of $14,702 million (shown in the previous table) and overnight deposits of $5,514 million. The $16,168 million (shown in the previous table) ofexposures to  non-sovereigns  were diversified across both names and sectors. Of this exposure, $14,161 million is to investment grade counterparties, with the largest single component ($4,408 million) toexchanges and clearinghouses.   Country Risk Exposures Related to Brazil .    At December 31, 2016, ourcountry risk exposures in Brazil included net exposures of $5,215 million (shown in the previous table). Our sovereign net exposures in Brazil were principally in the form of local currency government bonds held onshore to support clientactivity. The $582 million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to  non-sovereigns  were diversified across both names and sectors.   Country Risk Exposures Related to China.      At December 31, 2016, our country riskexposures in China included net exposures of $2,075 million (shown in the previous table) and overnight deposits with international banks of $159 million. The $2,269 million (shown in the previous table) of exposures to  non-sovereigns  were diversified across both names and sectors and were primarily concentrated in high-quality positions with negligible direct exposure to onshore equities.  Operational Risk    Operational riskrefers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or systems, human factors or from external events ( e.g. , fraud, theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to physicalassets). We may incur operational risk across the full scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating activities ( e.g ., sales and trading) and support and control groups ( e.g. , information technology and tradeprocessing). On March 4, 2016, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) updated its proposal for calculating operational risk regulatory capital. Under the proposal, which would eliminate the use of an internal model-basedapproach, required levels of operational risk regulatory capital would generally be determined under a standardized approach based primarily on a financial statement-based measure of operational risk exposure and adjustments based on the particularinstitutions historic operational loss record. The revised proposal will be subject to further rulemaking procedures and its timing has not been specified.  We have established an operational risk framework to identify, measure, monitor and control riskacross the Firm. Effective operational risk management is essential to reducing the impact of operational risk incidents and mitigating legal, regulatory and reputational risks. The framework is continually evolving to account for changes in theFirm and to respond to the changing regulatory and business environment. We have implemented operational risk data and assessment systems to monitor and analyze internal and external operational risk events, to assess business environment andinternal control factors and to perform scenario analysis. The collected data elements are incorporated in the operational risk capital model. The model encompasses both quantitative and qualitative elements. Internal loss data and scenario analysisresults are direct inputs to the capital model, while external operational incidents, business environment and internal control factors are evaluated as part of the scenario analysis process.   In addition, we employ a variety of risk processes and mitigants to manage our operational risk exposures. These include a strong governanceframework, a comprehensive risk management program and insurance. Operational risks and associated risk exposures are assessed relative to the risk tolerance established by the Board and are prioritized accordingly. The breadth and range ofoperational risk are such that the types of mitigating activities are wide-ranging. Examples of activities include enhancing defenses against cyberattacks; use of legal agreements and contracts to transfer and/or limit operational riskexposures; due diligence; implementation of enhanced policies and procedures; technology change management controls; exception management processing controls; and segregation of duties.  Primary responsibility for the management of operational risk is with the business segments, the control groups and the business managerstherein. The business managers maintain processes and controls designed to identify, assess, manage, mitigate and report operational risk. Each of the business segments has a designated operational risk coordinator. The operational risk coordinatorregularly reviews operational risk issues and reports to our senior management within each business. Each control group also has a designated operational risk coordinator and a forum for discussing operational risk matters with our seniormanagement. Oversight of operational risk is provided by the Operational Risk Oversight Committee, legal entity risk committees, regional risk committees and senior management. In the event of a merger; joint venture; divestiture; reorganization; orcreation of a new legal entity, a new product or a business activity, operational risks are considered, and any necessary changes in processes or controls are implemented.                   91     December 2016 Form 10-K          Risk Disclosures             The Operational Risk Department is independent of the divisions and reports to the Chief RiskOfficer. The Operational Risk Department provides oversight of operational risk management and independently assesses, measures and monitors operational risk. The Operational Risk Department works with the divisions and control groups to help ensurea transparent, consistent and comprehensive framework for managing operational risk within each area and across the Firm. The Operational Risk Department scope includes oversight of the technology and data risk management program ( e.g. ,cybersecurity), fraud risk management and prevention program, and supplier risk management (vendor risk oversight and assessment) program. Furthermore, the Operational Risk Department supports the collection and reporting of operational riskincidents and the execution of operational risk assessments; provides the infrastructure needed for risk measurement and risk management; and ensures ongoing validation and verification of our advanced measurement approach for operational riskcapital.    Business Continuity Management is responsible for identifying key risks and threats to our resiliency and planning to ensurethat a recovery strategy and required resources are in place for the resumption of critical business functions following a disaster or other business interruption. Disaster recovery plans are in place for critical facilities and resources on aFirm-wide basis, and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate. The key components of our Business Continuity Management Program include: crisis management; business recovery plans; applications/data recovery; work area recovery;and other elements addressing management, analysis, training and testing.    We maintain an information security program that coordinatesthe management of information security risks and is designed to address regulatory requirements. Information security policies are designed to protect our information assets against unauthorized disclosure, modification or misuse. These policiescover a broad range of areas, including: application entitlements, data protection, incident response, internet and electronic communications, remote access, mobile banking products, and portable devices. We have also established policies,procedures and technologies to protect our computers and other assets from unauthorized access.    In connection with our ongoingoperations, we utilize the services of external vendors, which we anticipate will continue and may increase in the future. These services include, for example, outsourced processing and support functions and other professional services. Wemanage our exposures to these services through a variety of means such as the performance of due diligence, consideration of operational risk, implementation of service level and othercontrac-  tual agreements, and ongoing monitoring of the vendors performance. We maintain a supplier risk management program with policies, procedures, organization, governance and supportingtechnology that satisfies regulatory requirements. The program is designed to ensure that adequate risk management controls over the services exist, including, but not limited to, information security, operational failure, financial stability,disaster recoverability, reputational risk, safeguards against corruption and termination.    Model Risk   Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model risk can lead tofinancial loss, poor business and strategic decision making, or damage to a Firms reputation. The risk inherent in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. Model risk is generated fromthe use of models impacting financial statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and the formulation of strategy.    Soundmodel risk management is an integral part of our Risk Management Framework. Model Risk Management is a distinct department in Risk Management responsible for the independent oversight of model risk. It is independent of the business units andreports to the Chief Risk Officer.    The Model Risk Management Department establishes a model risk tolerance in line with our riskappetite. The tolerance is based on an assessment of the materiality of the risk of financial loss or reputational damage due to errors in design, implementation, and/or inappropriate use of models. The tolerance is monitored through model-specificand aggregate business-level assessments, which are based upon qualitative and quantitative factors.    A guiding principle for managingmodel risk is the effective challenge of models. The effective challenge of models is represented by the critical analysis by objective, informed parties who can identify model limitations and assumptions and drive appropriate changes.The Model Risk Management Department provides effective challenge of models, independently validates and approves models for use, annually recertifies models, reports identified model validation limitations to key stakeholders, tracks remediationplans for model validation limitations, and reports on model risk metrics. The department also develops controls to support a complete and accurate Firm-wide model inventory. The Model Risk Management Department reports on our model risk relative torisk tolerance and presents these reports to the Model Oversight Committee, the FRC, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Chief Risk Officer also provides quarterly updates to the BRC on model risk metrics.               December 2016 Form 10-K     92              Risk Disclosures             Liquidity Risk   Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets ordifficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our financial obligations without experiencing significant business disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability asa going concern. Liquidity risk also encompasses the associated funding risks triggered by the market or idiosyncratic stress events that may negatively affect our liquidity and may impact our ability to raise new funding. Generally, we incurliquidity and funding risk as a result of our trading, lending, investing and client facilitation activities.    Our Liquidity RiskManagement Framework is critical to helping ensure that we maintain sufficient liquidity reserves and durable funding sources to meet our daily obligations and to withstand unanticipated stress events. The Liquidity Risk Department is a distinctarea in Risk Management responsible for the oversight and monitoring of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Risk Department is independent of the business units and reports to the Chief Risk Officer. The Liquidity Risk Department ensures transparency ofmaterial liquidity and funding risks, compliance with established risk limits and escalation of risk concentrations to appropriate senior management. To execute these responsibilities, the Liquidity Risk Department establishes limits in line withour risk appetite, identifies and analyzes emerging liquidity and funding risks to ensure such risks are appropriately mitigated, monitors and reports risk exposures against metrics and limits, and reviews the methodologies and assumptionsunderpinning our Liquidity Stress Tests to ensure sufficient liquidity and funding under a range of adverse scenarios. The liquidity and funding risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the Liquidity Risk Departmentthat are circulated to and discussed with senior management, the FRC, the BRC and the Board, as appropriate.  The Treasury Department and applicable business units have primary responsibility forevaluating, monitoring and controlling the liquidity and funding risks arising from our business activities, and for maintaining processes and controls to manage the key risks inherent in their respective areas. The Liquidity Risk Departmentcoordinates with the Treasury Department and these business units to help ensure a consistent and comprehensive framework for managing liquidity and funding risk across the Firm. See also Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7.    Legal and Compliance Risk   Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties, judgments,damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This riskalso includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable. It also includes compliance with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing rules and regulations. We aregenerally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which we conduct our business (see also BusinessSupervision and Regulation in Part I, Item 1, and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A).We have established procedures based on legal and regulatory requirements on a worldwide basis that are designed to facilitate compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and to require that our policies relating to businessconduct, ethics and practices are followed globally. In addition, we have established procedures to mitigate the risk that a counterpartys performance obligations will be unenforceable, including consideration of counterparty legal authorityand capacity, adequacy of legal documentation, the permissibility of a transaction under applicable law and whether applicable bankruptcy or insolvency laws limit or alter contractual remedies. The heightened legal and regulatory focus on thefinancial services and banking industry presents a continuing business challenge for us.                    93     December 2016 Form 10-K    Item 8.
