We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.     Liquidity and Capital Resources    History and Background:    We generally rely on cash from operations and equity and debt offerings, to the extent available, to satisfy our liquidity needs.  From February 1996 (when our initial public offering occurred) through the end of our fiscal 2013, inclusive, we have raised a net total of approximately $104 million from the issuance of common and preferred stock, the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants for our common stock.             10                In 2006, the Company implemented a cash conservation strategy by reducing its operating costs, which included restructuring its manufacturing operations. Our cash conservation strategy has also included measures such as extending payment terms with certain of our suppliers, delaying purchases for as long as practicable using just-in-time ordering practices and managing headcount and salaries for our staff to reflect order demand. This business strategy has resulted in the fundamentals of the Company improving each year.  Fiscal 2013 was the first profitable year in the Company’s history. In fiscal 2012, we achieved positive cash flow from operations. Cash provided by operations was approximately $556,000 and $406,000 during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively. The improvements in cash flows from operations are as a result of increased revenues from the additional markets we are able to address due to our lower cost structure as well as manufacturing and product efficiencies. Although we reported net income for fiscal 2013 we had recurring losses from operations in previous years. As of June 30, 2013, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $204 million.  Our accumulated deficit was approximately $205 million for fiscal year 2012.  On September 3, 2013 we had a book cash balance of $2,766,910.    Management has developed an operating plan for fiscal 2014 and believes the Company has adequate financial resources for achievement of this plan and to sustain its current operations in the coming year. The fiscal 2014 operating plan and related financial projections we have developed anticipate sales growth primarily from precision molded optics, with the emphasis on low-cost, high-volume applications, optical assemblies including our redesigned collimator product line and infrared products.    We expect further margin improvements based on production efficiencies and yield improvements.    We expect this continued growth in our precision molded optic lenses due to what we believe is the beginning of a multi-year growth cycle of the optical market.  This multi-year growth cycle is driven by four major trends: cloud computing; video distribution via digital technology; wireless broadband; and machine to machine connection.  Cloud computing is causing a shift in enterprise technology with increased spending for software-as-a-service (“SAAS”) and infrastructure-as-a-service (“IAAS”) capital investments.  Delivery of applications and technology using SAAS or IAAS requires larger and faster network bandwidth.  The explosion of mobile devices, which includes smartphones and tablet devices, is also requiring the expansion of network bandwidth as users are receiving and transferring larger amounts of data via their mobile devices.  The number of mobile devices will exceed the global population by 2016 and is estimated to be a 1.4 devices per person.  Individuals are also streaming more video on their mobile devices or through their smart TVs.  This type of video distribution, which is estimated to be 70% of all network traffic by 2016, is creating a huge demand for larger and faster bandwidth.  Finally, machine to machine connection technology allows wireless and wired systems to communicate with other devices of the same type.  This type of networking often requires bandwidth in order for the machines to communicate with each other.  All of these trends require the expansion of bandwidth, and thus, the growth of optical communication networks.  LightPath produces products, such as our precision molded optic lenses, that can be used as a component in optical communication networks.  These trends combined with the excellent value proposition that we bring to our customers with competitive prices and superior quality are the reasons we believe we are experiencing in increase in demand for our precision molded optic lenses and why we have confidence in our continued growth in the future.    We expect continued improvement of overhead absorption as we increase the volume of products produced and lower material costs since we will be able to purchase materials in higher volumes. We also will continue to implement cost reductions with programs to improve tool life and lower anti-reflective coating costs by coating the lenses at our facilities. We have established milestones that will be tracked to ensure that as funds are being used that we are achieving results before additional funds are committed. Management will be monitoring the operating plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met, remedial actions will be initiated.    We continue to face financial challenges along with many in the industries we do business with, as the slow recovery of the global economy continues to create instability in the market.  We continue efforts to keep costs under control as we seek renewed sales growth. Our efforts are directed toward reaching positive cash flow and profitability. If these efforts are not successful, we will need to raise additional capital. Should capital not be available to us at reasonable terms, other actions may become necessary in addition to cost control measures and continued efforts to increase sales. These actions may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the Company, the sale of certain product lines, the creation of joint ventures or strategic alliances under which we will pursue business opportunities, the creation of licensing arrangements with respect to our technology, or other alternatives.     We execute all foreign sales from our Orlando facility and inter-company transactions in United States dollars, mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  Assets and liabilities denominated in non-United States currencies, primarily the Chinese Renminbi, are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the year. During the years ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, we incurred a loss of $35,522 and a gain of $37,665 on foreign currency translation, respectively.    During fiscal 2013 we decided to no longer market our isolator product line and we reserved all isolator inventories at 100%.             11                Cash Flows - Financings:    Convertible Debentures  On March 25, 2013, the Company and holders of our Debentures holding approximately 93.10% of the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures executed the Conversion Agreement in connection with the early conversion of the Debentures. The Debenture holder’s party to the Conversion Agreement were Steven Brueck, J. James Gaynor, Louis Leeburg, Robert Ripp and Gary Silverman, all of whom are directors or officers of the Company, and Berg & Berg Enterprises, LLC (“BBE”), a greater than 5% beneficial stockholder of the Company. The Conversion Agreement provided, among other things, for the issuance of 559,448 shares of Class A common stock as an incentive to convert the Debentures into shares of common stock.  All of the holders party to the Conversion Agreement, except for BBE, fully converted their Debentures. In order to ensure BBE did not exceed a 19.9% beneficial ownership limitation, it partially converted its Debenture, and the Company repaid $105,000, representing the outstanding principal amount due under its Debenture. The remaining holder not party to the Conversion Agreement was repaid $75,000, representing the outstanding principal amount due under its Debenture. As of June 30, 2013, none of the Debentures remain outstanding.    Private Placement  On June 11, 2012, we executed a Securities Purchase Agreement (the “SPA”) with 19 institutional and other accredited investors with respect to a private placement of an aggregate of 1,943,852 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, at $1.02 per share, and warrants to purchase 1,457,892 shares of common stock.  The warrants had an initial exercise price of $1.32 (subsequently adjusted to $1.26),  are exercisable for a period of five years beginning December 11, 2012, and contain customary, weighted-average anti-dilution protection with respect to the exercise price (subject to a floor price of $1.15).    The Company received gross cash proceeds from the issuance of the common stock (exclusive of proceeds from any future exercise of the warrants) in the amount of approximately $1,982,727.  The Company is required by the terms of the SPA to use the funds for general working capital purposes to support the continued growth of the Company’s business, with the primary uses of the funds used for expansion of our infrared molding capacity and enhancement of our glass preparation processes and test and measurement capability.  The funding will also support new product development and the acquisition of new equipment, also critical to the Company’s growth plans.    The Company paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering, Meyers Associates, LP, in an amount equal to $198,273, plus a non-accountable marketing and expense fee of $20,000, and reimbursement of up to $10,000 of its legal and due diligence expenses related to the private placement offering.  The Company also issued the placement agent and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of 194,385 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price equal to $1.32, subsequently adjusted to $1.26 per share.  The warrants have a five-year term and were exercisable after December 11, 2012.    The private placement was exempt from the registration requirements of the Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Act (in that the shares of common stock, warrants, and shares of common stock underlying the warrants were sold by the Company in a transaction not involving any public offering) and pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.  On June 20, 2012 we filed a registration statement to register the shares of common stock, warrants and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants. The registration statement was declared effective on July 2, 2012.    Warrant Exercises  During July and August 2013 the Company received $1,304,678 in proceeds from the exercise of warrants. The Company issued 829,178 shares of common stock in connection with these exercises. The exercise prices ranged from $0.87 to $1.89 per share of common stock.    Cash Flows – Operating and Investing:    Cash flow provided by operations was approximately $556,000 for the year ended June 30, 2013, an increase of approximately $150,000 from fiscal 2012. Our cash flow provided by operations was approximately $622,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. Our fiscal 2014 operating plan and related financial projections anticipate continued improvement in our cash flows in future years due to sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs, offset by marginal increases in selling, administrative and new product development expenditures. For example, we expect lower glass costs as a result of replacing internally fabricated material with purchased materials from suppliers in Asia and lower coating costs due to larger unit volumes and due to our ability to coat the lenses in-house rather than out-sourcing this service.     During fiscal 2013, we expended approximately $1.10 million for capital equipment as compared to $629,000 during fiscal 2012. The majority of our capital expenditures during both fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 were related to the purchase of equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity and tooling for our precision molded products.  We anticipate increasing our expenditures during fiscal 2014 to enhance or expand our production capacity; however, the total amount expended will depend on opportunities and circumstances.             12                Results of Operations    Operating Results for Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2013 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2012:     Revenue for fiscal 2013 totaled $11.78 million compared to $11.28 million for fiscal 2012, an increase of 4%. This increase was primarily attributable to revenue from precision molded lenses for the telecommunications and laser tool markets and custom optics.  The number of units of precision molded optics sold increased by 35% due to the Company’s increased production capability and the pursuit of the low-cost, high-volume lens business. We expect continued growth in sales to be derived primarily from our precision molded optics product line, particularly our low-cost lenses sold in Asia, and the Company’s infrared and collimator product lines.     Gross margin percentage for fiscal 2013 was 44% compared to 36% in fiscal 2012. Total manufacturing costs of $6.61 million were approximately $642,000 lower in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. This decrease in manufacturing costs resulted from an increase in direct costs of $31,000 for materials, labor and outside services due to higher revenues offset by a decrease of $219,000 in labor costs, a decrease of $304,000 in tooling costs, a decrease of $92,000 in freight costs and a decrease of $55,000 in supplies. Direct costs, which include material, labor and services, were 24% of revenue in fiscal 2013, as compared to 25% of revenue in fiscal 2012.     We plan to continue emphasizing unit cost reductions by efficiently purchasing raw materials and increasing sourcing of coating services in China. We also continue to have improvements in productivity due to a more experienced workforce at LPOI’s Shanghai facility and press efficiencies due to higher unit volumes.    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $110,000 to $3.99 million in fiscal 2013 from $3.88 million in fiscal 2012. This increase is due to $78,000 in higher wages and benefits, $58,000 in higher legal fees, $163,000 in higher fees for consulting services for IT support, $72,000 in higher fees for investor relations, offset by lower depreciation of $41,000 and the write-off of $221,000 in expenses in fiscal 2012 related to our withdrawn shelf offering in fiscal 2012. Our operating plan for fiscal 2014 projects an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses due a projected higher level of sales. We plan to manage our workforce size to meet profit and cash flow goals.    New product development costs in fiscal 2013 decreased by approximately $107,000 to $939,000.  This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in wages and materials purchased for projects as our staff continued to work on the purchase order for Raytheon Vision Systems (“Raytheon”). Our operating plan for fiscal 2014 projects an increase in product development spending due to enhanced efforts in the development of the infrared product line.    In fiscal 2013, our amortization of intangibles remained at approximately $33,000 and is expected to remain at this level for fiscal 2014. Interest expense was approximately $100,000 for fiscal 2013 as compared to approximately $92,000 for fiscal 2012. The Debentures accounted for all of the interest expense during fiscal 2013 and 2012. This represented periodic interest of 8% per annum, amortization and the write-off of the debt issuance costs and debt discount.    In fiscal 2013 and 2012, we recognized a $15,000 loss and a $103,000 gain, respectively, related to the change in the fair value of derivative warrants issued in our June 2012 private placement. This fair value will be re-measured each reporting period throughout the five year life of the warrants, or until exercised.    Investment and other income increased by approximately $72,000 to $120,000 in fiscal 2013 primarily from a $54,000 in royalty income.    Net income for fiscal 2013 was approximately $215,000 compared with a net loss of approximately $865,000 in fiscal 2012, a change of approximately $1.08 million. This improvement of net income was comprised principally of an increase in revenues of $499,000 and a decrease of $642,000 in cost of goods sold, resulting in a $1.14 million increase in gross margin.             13                Key Performance Indicators    How we operate    We have continuing sales of two basic types: occasional sales via ad-hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations (our “turns” business) and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business of customer product development. In this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them, including complex multi-component designs that we call “engineered assemblies.” This is followed by “sampling” small numbers of the product for the customer’s test and evaluation. Thereafter, should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need; we negotiate and “win” a contract (sometimes called a “design win”) – whether of a “blanket purchase order” type or a supply agreement. The strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business, which is unpredictable and uneven. This annuity revenue stream can also generate low-cost, high-volume type orders. A key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible. We face several challenges in doing so:              ·    Maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability, including a high-quality and responsive optical design engineering staff;                 ·    The fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume, commercial production (for example, in the case of molded optics, this may be volumes over one million pieces per year) they begin to work seriously to reduce costs – which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers, even if sacrificing quality; and                 ·    Our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures – in other words, because of our limited cash resources and cash flow, we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures.       Despite these challenges to winning more “annuity” business, we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market, a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering. Additionally, we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the United States should they be unwilling to commit their entire source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources. We also continue to have the proprietary GRADIUM lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets.    Our key indicators    Usually on a weekly basis, management reviews a number of performance indicators. Some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative. These indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change. They are mostly non-financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line, production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product. These indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per-shift, which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time. Higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications. The data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes. We believe that our non-financial production indicators, such as those noted, are proprietary information.    The discussions of our results as presented in this Annual Report include use of the non-GAAP terms “EBITDA” and “gross margin.”  EBITDA is discussed below.  Gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue. Cost of sales includes manufacturing direct and indirect labor, materials, services, fixed costs for rent, utilities and depreciation, and variable overhead. Gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income, which are determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that gross margin, although a non-GAAP financial measure, is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions. It provides investors with information that demonstrates our cost structure and provides funds for our total costs and expenses. We use gross margin in measuring the performance of our business and have historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly. Other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner.     Financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro-level business cycle:              ·    sales backlog;                 ·    EBITDA;                 ·    inventory levels; and                 ·    accounts receivable levels and quality.       These indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below.             14                Sales Backlog:    Sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success. Our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our “order book.” Our order book equates to sales “backlog.” It has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect: quantitatively, our backlog’s prospective dollar value and qualitatively, what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date-certain delivery. We define our “12-month backlog” as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues. This includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria. Generally, higher 12-month backlog is better for us.    The 12-month backlog, as defined above, has been as follows in the preceding eight fiscal quarters:        Fiscal  Quarter    Ended   Approximate   12-month  Backlog       Q4-2013    6/30/2013      $  4,144,000       Q3-2013    3/31/2013      $  5,014,000       Q2-2013    12/31/2012      $  4,640,000       Q1-2013    9/30/2012      $  5,458,000       Q4-2012    6/30/2012      $  4,892,000       Q3-2012    3/31/2012      $  4,391,000       Q2-2012    12/31/2011      $  3,827,000       Q1-2012    9/30/2011      $  4,203,000         Our 12-month backlog at June 30, 2013 was approximately $4.14 million compared to $4.89 million as of June 30, 2012. We believe this decrease in the 12-month backlog is temporary as there were three large orders expected in the fourth quarter of 2013 that were delayed until the first quarter of 2014 totaling over $700,000. Bookings and quote activity have continued to increase for our industrial low-cost lenses in Asia and we project continued production and shipment growth for these low-cost lenses in Asia during fiscal 2014.    We continue to diversify our business by entering into additional markets such as digital imaging, laser tools, telecommunications, digital projectors, industrial equipment, weapon sights and green lasers. We expect to show increases in revenue for fiscal 2014 as a result of this diversification.    EBITDA:  EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management, lenders and certain investors as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of some aspects of a corporation's financial position and core operating performance. Investors sometimes use EBITDA as it allows for some level of comparability of profitability trends between those businesses differing as to capital structure and capital intensity by removing the impacts of depreciation and amortization. EBITDA also does not include changes in major working capital items such as receivables, inventory and payables, which can also indicate a significant need for, or source of, cash. Since decisions regarding capital investment and financing and changes in working capital components can have a significant impact on cash flow, EBITDA is not a good indicator of a business's cash flows. We use EBITDA for evaluating the relative underlying performance of the Company's core operations and for planning purposes. We calculate EBITDA by adjusting net income (loss) to exclude net interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization, thus the term “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization” and the acronym “EBITDA.”    We also calculated an Adjusted EBITDA which excludes the effect of the non-cash expense associated with the mark-to-market adjustments related to our June 2012 Warrants. We believe this Adjusted EBITDA is helpful for investors to better understand the financial results of our business operations.             15                The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income (loss) to EBITDA as well as to adjusted EBITDA for the preceding eight quarters:      Fiscal Quarter Ended       Net Income (Loss)          Depreciation & Amorization          Interest Exp.          EBITDA          Warrant Adjustment          Adjusted EBITDA                                                                   6/30/2013         (243,765  )        211,900           428           (31,437  )        502,827           471,390       3/31/2013         217,094           193,039           53,083           463,216           (222,766  )        240,450       12/31/2012         140,772           199,658           15,500           355,930           (169,552  )        186,378       9/30/2012         101,221           208,637           31,306           341,164           (95,784  )        245,380                                                                                    6/30/2012         195,864           266,317           22,659           484,840           (103,364  )        381,476       3/31/2012         (518,985  )        286,014           22,582           (210,389  )        —           (210,389  )    12/31/2011         (343,299  )        326,269           22,566           5,536           —           5,536       9/30/2011         (198,447  )        245,438           24,220           71,211           —           71,211                                                                                    6/30/2011         429           257,798           23,058           281,285           —           281,285       3/31/2011         (375,728  )        227,861           89,560           73,477           —           73,477       12/31/2010         (373,714  )        215,727           113,127           (44,860  )        —           (44,860  )    9/30/2010         (852,950  )        211,543           380,510           (260,897  )        —           (260,897  )       The primary reason for the improvement in Adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 from the same period in fiscal 2012 is due to higher revenue, improved margins and the warrant adjustment resulting in net income. The primary reason for the decline in EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 from the same period in fiscal 2012 is due to net losses.     Inventory levels:  We manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree. We review our inventory for obsolete items quarterly. While the mix of inventory is an important factor, including adequate safety stocks of long lead-time materials, an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter’s ending inventory expressed as a number of days’ worth of the quarter’s cost of sales, also known as “days cost of sales in inventory,” or “DCSI.” It is calculated by dividing the quarter’s ending inventory by the quarter’s cost of goods sold, multiplied by 365 and divided by 4. Generally, a lower DCSI measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital. The table below shows our DCSI for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters:          Fiscal  Quarter          Ended          DCSI (days)      Q4-2013         6/30/2013         94       Q3-2013         3/31/2013         110       Q2-2013         12/31/2012         96       Q1-2013         9/30/2012         85       Fiscal 2013 average         98       Q4-2012         6/30/2012         74       Q3-2012         3/31/2012         75       Q2-2012         12/31/2011         90       Q1-2012         9/30/2011         100       Fiscal 2012 average         76         Our average DCSI for fiscal 2012 was 76, compared to 98 for fiscal 2013.  This increase in DCSI for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 was due to higher inventory balances as we ramped up production for higher sales forecasts and the impact of a decrease in cost of goods sold due to our continued cost reduction efforts. We will continue to review inventory balances and sales forecast quarterly in order to manage our inventory levels more effectively.             16                Accounts receivable levels and quality:  Similarly, we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital. We escalate our collection efforts when invoices are fifteen days past the due date.  Weekly, we also review all receivables that are sixty days past terms. These past due accounts are contacted and all future shipments to them are placed on hold. We measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms, which are generally 30-45 days. The most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter’s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days’ worth of the quarter’s net revenues, also known as “days sales outstanding,” or “DSO.” It is calculated by dividing the quarter’s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter’s net revenues, multiplied by 365 and divided by 4. Generally, a lower DSO measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital. The table below shows our DSO for the preceding eight fiscal quarters:         Fiscal  Quarter          Ended          DSO (days)      Q4-2013         6/30/2013         62       Q3-2013         3/31/2013         72       Q2-2013         12/31/2012         75       Q1-2013         9/30/2012         69       Fiscal 2013 average         66       Q4-2012         6/30/2012         63       Q3-2012         3/31/2012         79       Q2-2012         12/31/2011         62       Q1-2012         9/30/2011         69       Fiscal 2012 average         68        Our average DSO for fiscal 2013 was 66 compared to 68 for fiscal 2012.  For the past two years over 47% of our quarterly sales are shipped in the third month of each quarter. These revenues will not be collected before the quarter ends, which negatively impacts our DSO. Also international sales which are approximately one third of our revenues have a longer collection cycle. We plan to monitor our collections efforts to keep this key indicator as low as reasonably possible. We strive to have DSO no higher than 65.     Critical Accounting Policies    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented. Our significant estimates include the allowance for trade receivables which is made up of reserves for bad debts, inventory reserves for obsolescence, revenue recognition, valuation of compensation expense on stock-based awards and beneficial conversion and warrant valuation related to convertible debentures. Although we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied.    Management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our board of directors, and the board of directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this prospectus. The critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows:     Allowance for accounts receivable,  is calculated by taking 100% of the total of invoices that are over 90 days past due from the due date and 10% of the total of invoices that are over 60 days past due from the due date. Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. We perform continuing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition. Recovery of bad debt amounts previously written off is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense in the period the payment is collected. If our actual collection experience changes, revisions to its allowance may be required. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance.     Inventories,  which consist principally of raw materials, work-in-process and finished lenses, collimators and assemblies are stated at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Acquisition of goods from our vendors has a purchase burden added to cover customs, shipping and handling costs. Fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed. We look at the following criteria for parts to consider for the inventory reserve: items that have not been sold in two years or that have not been purchased in two years or of which we have more than a two year supply.  These items as identified are reserved at 100%, as well as reserving 50% for other items deemed to be slow moving within the last twelve months and reserving 25% for items deemed to have low material usage within the last six months. The parts identified are adjusted for recent order and quote activity to determine the final inventory reserve. In the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we placed a 100% reserve on our isolator inventories due to our current sales forecast for this product line.             17                Property and equipment  are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from one to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method.    Long-lived assets , such as property, plant, and equipment, tooling and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.    Deferred rent  relates to certain of our operating leases containing predetermined fixed increases of the base rental rate during the lease term being recognized as rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have recorded the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amounts payable under the leases as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.    Deferred revenue  relates to a $1.1 million purchase order from Raytheon for which revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis. The Company is using the “cost-to-cost method” to allow it to measure progress toward completion based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs. The Company recorded in deferred revenue, or other receivables, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, based on the difference between the amounts invoiced on the project and the amount recognized into revenue or expenses incurred. As of June 30, 2013, the Company invoiced $743,500 and recognized $1,097,030 as revenue with the difference of $353,530 recorded as other receivables. At June 30, 2013, we had no billed accounts receivable outstanding with respect to this purchase order. The project is expected to be completed by December 2013.    Income taxes  are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on the basis of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.    We have not recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits or penalties has not been provided since there is no unrecognized benefit or penalty since the date of adoption. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit or penalty, we would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.    We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2010.    Revenue  is recognized from product sales when products are shipped to the customer, provided that we have received a valid purchase order, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured, and there are no remaining significant obligations. Revenues from product development agreements are recognized as milestones and are completed in accordance with the terms of the agreements and upon shipment of products, reports or designs to the customer. Invoice amounts for sales or VAT taxes are posted to the balance sheet and not included in revenue.     New product development  costs are expensed as incurred.    Stock based compensation  is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period.  We estimate the fair value of each stock option and restricted stock unit as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. Most awards granted under our Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan vest ratably over two to four years and generally have four to ten-year contract lives.  The volatility rate is based on four-year historical trends in Class A common stock closing prices and the expected term was determined based primarily on historical experience of previously outstanding awards.  The interest rate used is the United States Treasury interest rate for constant maturities. The likelihood of meeting targets for option grants that are performance based are evaluated each quarter. If it is determined that meeting the targets is probable then the compensation expense will be amortized over the remaining vesting period.    Management makes estimates  and assumptions during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes available, which in turn could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.             18                Financial instruments.  We account for financial instruments in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  (“ASC 820”), which provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities.  ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:    Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.    Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable.    Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.    Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of June 30, 2013.  We use the market approach to measure fair value for its Level 1 financial assets and liabilities, which include cash equivalents of $728,000 and $1.77 million at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities.    The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values.  These financial instruments which include cash, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are receivable or payable on demand.    The Company values its warrant liabilities based on open-form option pricing models which, based on the relevant inputs, render the fair value measurement at Level 3. The Company bases its estimates of fair value for warrant liabilities on the amount it would pay a third-party market participant to transfer the liability and incorporates inputs such as equity prices, historical and implied volatilities, dividend rates and prices of convertible securities issued by comparable companies maximizing the use of observable inputs when available.    The Company does not have any other financial or non-financial assets or liabilities that would be characterized as Level 2 or Level 3 instruments.    Derivative financial instruments.   The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging  (“ASC 815”), which requires additional disclosures about the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how the derivative instruments and related hedging items affect the financial statements.    The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risk.  Terms of convertible debt instruments are reviewed to determine whether or not they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under ASC 815 to be accounted for separately from the host contract, and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  The fair value of derivative liabilities, if any, is required to be revalued at each reporting date, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in current period operating results.     Freestanding warrants issued by the Company in connection with the issuance or sale of debt and equity instruments are considered to be derivative instruments.  Pursuant to ASC 815, an evaluation of specifically identified conditions is made to determine whether the fair value of warrants issued is required to be classified as equity or as a derivative liability.    Comprehensive income (loss)  of the Company is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.  It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  Comprehensive income (loss) has two components, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), and is included on the statement of operations and comprehensive income. Our other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the foreign currency translation adjustment.    Business segments  are required to be reported by the Company. As we only operate in principally one business segment, no additional reporting is required.             19                Recent accounting pronouncements  issued by FASB (including Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.    In July 2013 the FASB issued ASU 2013-11, “Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists,” which amends ASC 740, “Income Taxes.” This new guidance requires that a liability related to an unrecognized tax benefit be offset against a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward if certain criteria are met. The provisions of this update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2013. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied prospectively to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company will adopt this guidance during fiscal 2015 and does not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
