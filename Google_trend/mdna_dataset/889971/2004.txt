Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. All statements in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this report, other than statements of historical facts, which address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures, growth, product development, sales, business strategy and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements set forth herein as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our products current stage of development, the need for additional financing, competition in various aspects of its business and other risks described in this report and in our other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In light of these risks and uncertainties, all of the forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.    SIZE="1">    Liquidity and Capital Resources        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> History: From February 1996 (when our IPO occurred) to fiscal 2001, inclusive, we raised a net total of approximately $86 million from the issuance of common and preferred stocks, the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants on our capital stock. We did not have any equity or debt financing transactions in fiscal 2002 or fiscal 2003; however in fiscal 2004 we raised approximately $2 million from the issuance of common stock.        SIZE="2">Our optical product markets experienced a severe downturn beginning in 2001, which continued into 2003 and resulted in a significant decline in the demand for our products over that period. In 2004, we believe that some improvement occurred in demand for our products in several of our markets. Nevertheless, we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during this fiscal year. We have developed our operating plan for fiscal 2005 and believe the Company has adequate financial resources for achievement of that plan. Nevertheless, we will be managing against that plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met during the year, remedial actions will be initiated. Such necessary actions, in addition to cost controls and vigorous sales activities, may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the Company or of some of the          28           Companys product capabilities. It is also possible that the Company may be required to seek additional external financing in fiscal 2005, which may not be available on reasonable terms and could be highly dilutive to current shareholders. The Company has no firm commitments for any material future financing at this time and we have a cash balance of approximately $2.5 million at July 30, 2004. We may still seek external debt or equity financing if it can be obtained in an amount and on terms that are acceptable to us.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Cash flows: Cash used by operations during fiscal 2004 was approximately $2.5 million, a decrease of approximately $7.2 million from fiscal 2003. Throughout fiscal 2004, on a comparative basis to 2003, we reduced our cash expenditures through the favorable effect of the 2003 consolidations of equipment and facilities and significant overall reduction in employment. Cash use was also favorably affected in 2004 by operating improvements that generated a positive gross margin and other expense control measures.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> While progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow in fiscal 2003 and 2004, significant risk and uncertainty remains. The Companys cash used by operations was approximately $0.5 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and $0.1 million for the month ended July 2004. The fiscal 2005 operating plan and related financial projections we have developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs, offset by marginal increases in selling, administrative and new product development expenditures.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     Factors which could adversely affect cash balances in future quarters include, but are not limited to, a decline in revenue or a lack of anticipated sales growth, increased material costs, increased labor costs, planned production efficiency improvements not being realized, increases in property, casualty, benefit and liability insurance premiums and increases in other discretionary spending, particularly sales and marketing related.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> In the event that we find it necessary to raise additional funds to sustain operations and we are unable to do so, we may need to take such actions as additional restructuring of operations to reduce costs. Should that occur, the realizability of certain assets, especially inventory, property and equipment, intellectual property and other intangible assets may be such that significant adjustments to our consolidated financial statements would be required.        SIZE="2">During fiscal 2004, we expended approximately $358,000 for capital equipment in comparison to $173,000 during fiscal 2003. The majority of the capital expenditures during fiscal 2004 were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity. The Companys operating plan for fiscal 2005 estimates expenditures at similar levels to enhance or expand our capacity, however, we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     Key Performance Indicators    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px">     How we operate    SIZE="1">    The Company has continuing sales of two basic types: occasional sales via ad-hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations (our turns business) and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business with characteristics of the semiconductor industry. In this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them, including complex multi-component designs that we call engineered assemblies. That is followed by sampling them small numbers of the product for their test and evaluation. Thereafter, should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need, we negotiate and win a contract (sometimes called a design win)  whether of a blanket purchase order type or a supply agreement. The strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business, which is unpredictable and uneven. A key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible. We have several challenges in doing so:              Maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability, including a high-quality and responsive optical design engineering staff.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">      29                The fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume, commercial production (for example, in the case of molded optics, this may be volumes over one million pieces per year) they begin to work seriously to reduce costs  which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers, even if sacrificing quality.    SIZE="1">          Our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures  in other words, because of our limited cash resources and cash flow, we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures.       Despite these challenges to winning more annuity business, we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market, a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering. Additionally, we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the United States should they be unwilling to commit all of their source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources. We also continue to have the proprietary GRADIUM lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"> Our key indicators        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Usually on a weekly basis, management reviews a number of performance indicators. Some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative. These indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change. They are mostly non-financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line, production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished shippable product. These indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per-shift, which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time. Higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications. The data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes. The Company believes that its non-financial production indicators, such as those noted, are proprietary information.        Financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro-level busincss cycle:              sales backlog              inventory levels              accounts receivable levels and quality        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> These indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     Sales Backlog:    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px">     Going forward, sales growth will be our best indicator of success. Our best view into the effectiveness of our sales efforts is in our order book. Our order book equates to sales backlog. It has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect: quantitatively, our backlogs prospective dollar value and qualitatively, what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date-certain delivery. We define our Disclosure Backlog as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues. This includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria. Generally, higher backlog is better for the Company.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">      30          Disclosure backlog, as defined above, has been as follows in the immediately preceding six fiscal quarters:                   Fiscal   Quarter WIDTH="42" SIZE="1" NOSHADE ALIGN="left" COLOR="#000000">       Ended       Approximate   FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1"> Disclosure   Backlog     Q4-2004     6/30/2004     $3,280,000     Q3-2004     3/31/2004     $2,810,000     Q2-2004     12/31/2003     $1,520,000     Q1-2004     9/30/2003     $1,440,000     Q4-2003     6/30/2003     $1,360,000     Q3-2003     3/31/2003     $1,640,000     Note: Due to the consolidation of multiple accounting systems after 12/31/02, comparative data is not available for quarters prior to Q3-2003        We believe this general trend toward increase in the Disclosure Backlog is attributable to several factors:              better organized and more concentrated sales efforts              a stronger general economy, including in products requiring optics such as we produce    SIZE="1">          our efforts to increase the proportion of our business that is under larger or longer-term orders and supply agreements, and    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px">           new products        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%; text-indent:-2%"> Inventory levels:        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Inventory levels are managed by the Company to minimize investment in working capital and still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree. While the mix of inventory is an important factor, including adequate safety stocks of long lead-time materials, an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarters ending inventory expressed as a number of days worth of the quarters cost of sales, also known as days cost of sales in inventory, or DCSI. It is calculated by dividing the quarters ending inventory by the quarters cost of goods sold, multiplied by 365 and divided by 4. Generally, a lower DCSI measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital. The table below shows the Companys DCSI for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters:                   Fiscal   Quarter WIDTH="42" SIZE="1" NOSHADE ALIGN="left" COLOR="#000000">       Ended       DCSI (days)     Q4-2004     6/30/2004     72     Q3-2004     3/31/2004     63     Q2-2004     12/31/2003     57     Q1-2004     9/30/2003     82     Fiscal 2004 average     69     Q4-2003     6/30/2003     58     Q3-2003     3/31/2003     72     Q2-2003     12/31/2002     76     Q1-2003     9/30/2002     95     Fiscal 2003 average     75        SIZE="2">Accounts receivable levels and quality:        Accounts receivable levels are similarly managed by the Company to minimize investment in working capital. We measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms, which are generally 30 days. The most important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarters ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days          31           worth of the quarters net revenues, also known as days sales outstanding, or DSO. It is calculated by dividing the quarters ending net accounts receivable by the quarters net revenues, multiplied by 365 and divided by 4. Generally, a lower DSO measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital. The table below shows the Companys DSO for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters:                  Fiscal   SIZE="1"> Quarter       Ended       DSO (days)     Q4-2004     6/30/2004     59     Q3-2004     3/31/2004     59     Q2-2004     12/31/2003     66     Q1-2004     9/30/2003     66     Fiscal 2004 average     62     Q4-2003     6/30/2003     65     Q3-2003     3/31/2003     65     Q2-2003     12/31/2002     52     Q1-2003     9/30/2002     61     Fiscal 2003 average     61        The table below presents certain of our significant contractual obligations as of June 30, 2004. The operating leases relate to real estate and are commitments that are expensed as paid per the terms of the related contracts.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     Contractual Obligations  Payments Due By Period    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:2%; text-indent:-2%"> (dollars in 000s)                             Less than 1 Year      1-3 Years      4-5 Years      After 5 Years        Comments     Operating leases      845      1,696      1,249              Real estate leases with monthly payments     Other restructuring and exit costs      34                              Balance of payments due on New Jersey lease assigned     Outstanding purchase obligations      870                              Current purchase orders outstanding        Year ended June 30, 2004 compared to the year ended June 30, 2003        Consolidated Operations       Our consolidated revenues totaled $8.3 million for fiscal 2004, an increase of approximately $1.5 million or 22% compared to revenues for fiscal 2003 of $6.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in our aspheric lens and isolator products. While both represented increased total demand, the aspheric lens increases were from across several of the industries that we serve with that product line while the isolator increases were from just a few customers, mostly in communications markets, specifically data communications. Our operating plan for fiscal 2005 projects continued revenue gains from all product areas and all markets.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Fiscal 2004 consolidated cost of sales of $6.3 million was approximately 75% of net revenues of $8.3 million, compared to fiscal 2003 when our cost of sales was approximately 120% of net revenues. This improvement was caused by several factors. Primary among them was having the benefit of the 2003 consolidation in our manufacturing sites to enable us to operate without the overhead of severely underutilized facilities. Additionally, substantial work was accomplished to reduce materials costs and to rationalize the production lines when they were re-assembled in Orlando. Going forward into fiscal 2005, the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and higher yields from statistical process control applications. Our operating plan projects higher gross margin levels in fiscal 2005 than we achieved in fiscal 2004.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">      32          Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by over $1.3 million to $5.2 million in fiscal 2004 from $6.5 million in fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily due to lower headcount for parts of the year, some driven by the site consolidations and some by job consolidations in Orlando. Other improvements were realized from cost savings such as the reduction in our director and officers insurance premium in 2004 over 2003. Our operating plan for fiscal 2005 projects business levels that will require selling, general and administrative expenses to increase, primarily caused by selected headcount additions and expected cost increases in certain items.        SIZE="2">New product development costs were reduced by $1.8 million to $1.0 million in fiscal 2004 from $2.8 million in fiscal 2003. Similar to SG&A costs, this decrease was primarily due to lower headcount in this department for part of the year driven by the site consolidations that occurred in 2003. Late in fiscal 2004 we increased headcount in new product development to support certain new product projects and to support customer requests for new or modified product designs as part of our sales and marketing process. Our operating plan for fiscal 2005 projects some increases in new product development spending in order to support increased quote and customer design activity as well as continue modest investment in new product projects.        In fiscal 2004 our amortization of intangibles decreased by approximately $0.7 million to approximately $1.9 million from approximately $2.7 million in fiscal 2003. The most significant component of our identified intangibles subject to amortization relates to the developed technology (molded aspheric lenses) from the Companys acquisition of Geltech in fiscal 2001. That asset was determined to have a four-year life at the time of the acquisition, which was accounted for by the purchase method. That amortization will end after the first quarter of fiscal 2005 and amortization thereafter, in accordance with our operating plan, will be at a rate of approximately $600,000 per year.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> We offered excess production equipment for sale throughout fiscal 2004 that was salvaged from our site consolidations in fiscal 2003 and we realized a gain of approximately $121,000 during the year on proceeds of $137,000. We do not anticipate further sales or such gains in fiscal 2005.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> Other income and expense for fiscal 2004 contained several items that are generally not expected to be recurring:    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px">           We settled litigation in the third quarter of fiscal 2004 for gross proceeds of $790,000 to us, which was offset by legal costs of $187,000, for a net gain of approximately $600,000. We have no further litigation in which we are the plaintiff and therefore anticipate no such gain in fiscal 2005.              Our investment income in fiscal 2004 reached only $39,000 compared with over $400,000 in fiscal 2003 when available interest rates and our investable balances were higher. Our operating plan for 2005 continues to assume low available interest rates and modest investable balances and therefore investment income will be negligible.    SIZE="1">          The primary remaining balance in other income and expense is the amortization of the fair value of a warrant issued to a related party in early fiscal 2004. That amortization expense will be concluded after the first quarter of fiscal 2005.        FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Net loss for fiscal 2004 was approximately $5.6 million compared with $21.2 million in fiscal 2003, an improvement of approximately $15.6 million. This $15.6 million improvement in the current year was comprised approximately of:              gross margin improvement of $3.4 million              improved departmental operating costs of $3.1 million              reduced amortization of intangibles of $0.7 million              a lack of asset impairments compared with the prior year of $5.5 million              a reduction in reorganization and relocation expenses of $0.5 million              a prior year change in accounting principle of $2.3 million.         33          Year ended June 30, 2003 compared to the year ended June 30, 2002    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px">     Consolidated Operations    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px">     Our consolidated revenues totaled $6.8 million for fiscal 2003, a decrease of approximately $5.7 million or 46% compared to revenues for fiscal 2002. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in laser component product sales of $2.7 million or 61% and a decrease in optical lens sales of $3.0 million or 37%. This decrease was largely a result of an overall decrease in market demand for optical lenses and laser component products, primarily in the telecom sector.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> In fiscal 2003, consolidated cost of sales was approximately 120% of net revenues, which is comparable to fiscal 2002 in which we reported cost of sales of 121% of net revenues. Both years included inventory write-downs ($0.5 million and $3 million in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively).        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> During fiscal 2003, selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $9.8 million from fiscal 2002 to $6.5 million. The decrease is due primarily to a $1.5 million legal settlement accrual included in fiscal 2002 and a $4.8 million decrease in stock-based compensation. In addition, the Company has taken additional actions to reduce costs, including consolidation of the Companys New Mexico and California operating plants to its Orlando, Florida facility, and other targeted headcount reductions.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> New product development costs decreased by approximately $4.3 million to $2.8 million in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002, due primarily, to reduced personnel and discontinuation of the research and development efforts directed at developing an optical cross-connect switch.        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> We incurred several non-cash charges during fiscal 2003, including $3.4 million related to the write down of the Companys investment in LightChip, $2.5 million related to the write down of the Companys goodwill and remaining intangible assets from the Horizon acquisition, $1.9 million of asset impairment charges primarily from manufacturing equipment related to the isolator business, and $2.7 million in amortization of intangibles from acquisitions, offset by the forfeitures of restricted stock awards resulting in a $69,638 credit to income in stock-based compensation.    SIZE="1">    During fiscal 2003, the Company also recorded approximately $0.5 million of reorganization and relocation expenses incurred in connection with its previously announced plans to consolidate its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities from New Mexico to Florida. These expenses consist primarily of costs to dispose and move equipment to Florida, employee relocation and travel expenses.        Investment and other income decreased approximately $0.7 million, to $0.4 million from $1.1 million, as interest earned on investments in fiscal 2003 declined due to lower available interest rates and a decrease in cash balances. In addition, fiscal 2002 included a gain on the sale of assets (other income) of approximately $0.4 million not present in fiscal 2003. Interest and other expense in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 were not significant.    SIZE="1">    Net loss was $21.2 million in fiscal 2003. Included in the net loss was approximately $10.5 million from the non-cash charges described above, $0.5 million in inventory write-downs, and $0.5 million in reorganization and relocation expenses. This compares with fiscal 2002 in which we reported a net loss of $50.7 million including $29.2 million in non-cash charges, a $3 million inventory write down, $2.2 million of charges related to a litigation settlement and related legal costs and $1.1 million related to consolidation of facilities. The $29.5 million decrease in net loss from fiscal 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to the decrease of $18.2 million non-cash and other charges and reductions in operating costs, primarily in selling, general and administrative expense and research and development. Effective July 1, 2002, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . Accordingly, amortization expense decreased by approximately $1.3 million for fiscal 2003. Net loss of $21.2          34           million for fiscal 2003 resulted in a net loss per share of $8.20, a decrease of $12.30 per share compared to fiscal 2002 net loss per applicable common share of $20.50. Net loss applicable to common shareholders for fiscal 2002 of $50.7 million included $61,906 attributable to a premium on the Companys preferred stock previously outstanding.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     Critical Accounting Policies    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px">     The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to select appropriate company accounting policies, and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies. In applying the Companys accounting policies, different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     In response to the Securities and Exchange Commissions (SEC) Release No. 33-8040, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies, the Company has identified the most critical accounting principles upon which the Companys financial statements depend. The critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The most critical accounting principles identified relate to: (i) revenue recognition; (ii) inventory valuation; (iii) long-lived assets; and (iv) intangible assets. These critical accounting policies and the Companys other significant accounting policies are further disclosed in Note 2 to the Companys Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.        Revenue recognition .  We recognize revenue upon shipment of the product provided that persuasive evidence of a final agreement exists, title has transferred, the selling price is fixed and determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured.        Inventory valuation .  We regularly assess the valuation of inventories and write down those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to estimated net realizable value. Estimates of realizable value are based upon the Companys analyses and assumptions, including, but not limited to, forecasted sales levels by product, expected product lifecycle, product development plans and future demand requirements. If market conditions are less favorable than our forecast or actual demand from customers is lower than our estimates, we may be required to record additional inventory write-downs. If demand is higher than expected, we may be able to use or sell inventories that have previously been written down.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     Long-Lived Assets . We evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances include, but are not limited to, a prolonged industry downturn, a significant decline in the Companys market value, or significant reductions in projected future cash flows. If facts and circumstances warrant such a review, a long-lived asset would be impaired if future undiscounted cash flows, without consideration of interest, are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long-lived asset. Once deemed impaired, the long-lived asset is written down to its fair value which could be considerably less than the carrying amount or future undiscounted cash flows. The determination of future cash flows and, if required, fair value of a long-lived asset is, by its nature, a highly subjective judgment. Fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon the Companys weighted average cost of capital. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows, including long-term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and the Companys percentage of that market, groupings of assets, discount rate and terminal growth rates. Changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of long-lived assets, thereby requiring us to write down the assets.        FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"> Intangible Assets . We generally obtain intangible assets in connection with a business unit purchase (for example, in a business combination). The assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires          35           the use of a specialist, such as an appraiser. The assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward-looking, and thus subject to significant judgment. Because individual intangible assets may be: (i) expensed immediately upon acquisition (for example, purchased in-process research and development assets); or (ii) amortized over their estimated useful life (for example, acquired technology), their assigned values could have a material affect on current and future period results of operations. Further, intangible assets are subject to the same judgments when evaluating for impairment as other long-lived assets.    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px">     Recent Accounting Pronouncements    STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px">     In March 2004, the FASB issued an Exposure Draft (ED) of a proposed Statement, Share-Based Payments, that addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the enterprise or (b) liabilities that are based on fair value of the enterprises equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The ED would eliminate the ability to account for share-based compensation transactions using APB Opinion No. 25,  Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and generally would require instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method, preferably one called the binomial or lattice method. The ED as currently drafted would be effective for awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2004 (our fiscal 2006), for public entities that used the fair-value-based methods of accounting under the original provisions of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation for recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes. Since the Company is using and expects to continue using stock options in its compensation mix, the ED is likely to have the impact of increasing our reported costs for compensation which are classified as cost of sales, selling, general and administrative costs, and new product development costs. It is not expected to affect cash flow unless we choose to partially or wholly replace stock options with cash compensation.        In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 and subsequently amended it with the issuance of Interpretation No. 46-R in December 2003. This Interpretation and its amendment addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the Interpretation. The Interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003, and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after January 31, 2003. The adoption of this Interpretation did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidation financial statements.       In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity. SFAS No. 150 establishes accounting standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. It requires certain financial instruments that were previously classified as equity to be classified as assets or liabilities. The provisions are effective for transactions entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. It is possible that, in the future, we may find it desirable or necessary to seek external financing and we may enter into an agreement that would be governed by SFAS No. 150 whereby the financing we receive cannot be classified as equity in our consolidated balance sheet.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk        STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"> LightPaths liquid investments were invested in money market accounts or overnight repurchase agreements until late August 2003. LightPath does not believe that the market risk related to these investments was significant. In late August 2003, we began investing much of our cash resources in short-term taxable auction rate certificates (ARCs) in order to improve our effective received yield on our invested cash by approximately 30 basis points. The ARCs we have chosen have Aaa ratings and, due to their short-term nature (30 day rate resets), we do not believe that changes in market interest rates of up to 10 percent either up or down will have a material effect on the our results of operations.         36           Item 8.
