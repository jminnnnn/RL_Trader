Item 7.    Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the Company. All statements in this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this report, other than statements of historical facts, which address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will or may occur in the future, including such things as future capital expenditures, growth, product development, sales, business strategy and other similar matters are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our current expectations and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. Actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements set forth herein as a result of a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our products current stage of development, the need for additional financing, competition in various aspects of its business and other risks described in this report and in our other reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In light of these risks and uncertainties, all of the forward-looking statements made herein are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by us will be realized. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.       Liquidity and Capital Resources     History and Background:    From February 1996 (when our IPO occurred) through fiscal 2011, inclusive, we have raised a net total of approximately $102 million from the issuance of common and preferred stock, the sale of convertible debt and the exercise of options and warrants for our capital stock.    Overtime, LightPath has transformed its business model to accommodate the changes in the optical market. In 2006, the Company began a program to reduce its operating costs, including restructuring its manufacturing operations. By 2008, the major elements of this program were implemented resulting in a significant reduction of costs. The elements of the program were: 1) moving the majority of our manufacturing to our Shanghai facility; 2) converting our tooling to a less expensive ceramic system; and 3) introducing lower cost glass materials. With this new cost structure we have focused on leveraging our facility in Shanghai to address high volume, lower cost applications.  During this period, we enhanced our sales channels by adding distribution coverage in North America and Asia, and adding a master distributor in Europe.  Additionally, we have designed lenses specifically for particular markets.    As we have implemented this new business strategy the fundamentals of the company have been improving each year and as we continue to build the business volume we anticipate that the company will reach profitability in the future.  However, we did not reach a status of positive cash flow or profitability during fiscal 2011 or 2010.    As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring losses from operations and as of June 30, 2011 the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $204 million. Cash provided by (used in) operations was $95,000, ($471,000) and ($1.5 million) during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The improvements in the cash flows from operations are as a result of the cost reductions we implemented and the additional markets the Company is able to address due to its lower cost structure.  In addition, starting in fiscal 2009   we redesigned the collimator product line, increased sales prices on GRADIUM products, obtained more favorable material costs by sourcing some purchased components in China, and instituted more efficient management techniques, all of which have improved our product yields.    Management believes these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability, assuming we meet our sales targets.    Management has developed an operating plan for fiscal 2012 and believes the Company has adequate financial resources for achievement of that plan and to sustain its current operations in the coming year. Nevertheless, management will be monitoring the plan closely during the year and should the plan objectives not be met during the year, remedial actions will be initiated. The Company had a cash balance of approximately $929,000 at June 30, 2011.  During fiscal 2010, the Company raised approximately $2.4 million from the sale of common stock and warrants.  The Company may still seek external debt or equity financing if it can be obtained in an amount and on terms that are acceptable; however, the Company may be required to seek external financing regardless of whether the terms would otherwise be acceptable if the Company’s financial resources are not sufficient to sustain its operations or to pursue its business plan.    The fiscal 2012 operating plan and related financial projections we have developed anticipate sales growth primarily from precision molded optics, with the emphasis on low cost high volume applications, optical assemblies including our redesigned collimator product line and infrared products.    We expect margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs as a result of the shifting of our manufacturing operations to Shanghai, and improved overhead absorption as we increase the volume of products produced, which in turn lowers our material costs since we are able to purchase materials in higher             13                volumes. We also will continue to implement new cost reductions with programs to improve tool life and lower anti-reflective coating costs.    We have taken certain actions to conserve our cash including extending payment terms with certain of our suppliers and by delaying purchases for as long as practical using just in time ordering practices.     In March 2009 the Orlando staff was reduced to a four day work week.  Increased sales allowed us to return to a five day work week in November 2009. This reduced work week resulted in savings of $438,000 in fiscal 2010 in wages and benefits. In fiscal 2011, we redesigned certain product lines – collimators and precision molded optics, increased sales prices on GRADIUM products, obtained more favorable material costs by sourcing some purchased components in China, and have instituted more efficient management techniques which have improved our product yields.   We believe these factors will contribute towards achieving profitability assuming we meet our sales targets. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.     We continue to face financial challenges along with many in the industries we do business with, as the worldwide economic instability continues to create turbulence in the market.   We engaged in continuing efforts to keep costs under control as we sought renewed sales growth. Our efforts were directed toward reaching positive cash flow and profitability. If these efforts are not successful, we will need to raise additional capital. Should capital not be available to us at reasonable terms, other actions may become necessary in addition to cost control measures and continued efforts to increase sales. These actions may include exploring strategic options for the sale of the Company, the sale of certain product lines, the creation of joint ventures or strategic alliances under which we will pursue business opportunities, the creation of licensing arrangements with respect to our technology, or other alternatives. On September 6, 2011, the Company had a book cash balance of approximately $658,034.     We execute all foreign sales from our Orlando facility and inter-company transactions in United States dollars, mitigating the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.  Assets and liabilities denominated in non-United States currencies, primarily the Chinese Renminbi, are translated at rates of exchange prevailing on the balance sheet date, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange for the year. During the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010 we incurred a $27,127 gain and a $34,767 loss on foreign currency translation, respectively.     Cash Flows - Financings:    On August 1, 2008, we executed a Securities Purchase Agreement with twenty-four institutional and private investors with respect to the private placement of 8% senior convertible debentures (the “Debentures”). The Debentures are secured by substantially all of our previously unencumbered assets pursuant to a Security Agreement and are guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Geltech and LPOI pursuant to a Subsidiary Guarantee.  The sale of the Debentures generated gross proceeds of approximately $2.9 million and net proceeds of $2.7 million.  We used the funds to provide working capital for our operations.  Among the investors were Steven Brueck, J. James Gaynor, Louis Leeburg, Robert Ripp, Gary Silverman and James Magos, all of whom were directors or officers of LightPath as of August 1, 2008. Mr. Magos resigned effective September 2, 2008.     The original maturity date of the Debentures was August 1, 2011, on which date the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures would have been due.  Interest of $39,053 was due on October 1, 2008 and was prepaid by the Company on August 1, 2008 by issuing 27,893 shares of common stock in payment of such interest based upon the closing price of $1.40 per share (the “October Interest Shares”).  The interest accruing on the Debentures from October 1, 2008 to August 1, 2011 was prepaid by issuing common stock in December 2008.     Upon issuance the Debentures were immediately convertible into 1,901,948 shares of common stock, based on a conversion price of $1.54 per share, which was 110% of the closing bid price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on July 31, 2008. Investors also received warrants to purchase up to 950,974 shares of our common stock (the “Warrants”).  The Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on August 1, 2008 with 65% of the Warrants, exercisable for 618,133 shares, priced at $1.68 per share and the remaining 35% of the Warrants, exercisable for 332,841 shares, priced at $1.89 per share.     Investors who participated in our July 2007 offering were given an incentive to invest in the debenture offering.  Four investors from the July 2007 offering participated in the debenture offering and as a result, we reduced the exercise price of the warrants they received in the July 2007 offering from $5.50 per share to $2.61 per share.  The reduced exercise price lowered potential proceeds on the exercise of the warrants from the July 2007 offering by $119,212 to $107,663.  Additionally, such investors were issued an aggregate of 73,228 shares of common stock (the “Incentive Shares”), valued at $75,131.     We paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering, First Montauk Securities Corp. (“First Montauk”), in an amount equal to $216,570 plus costs and expenses.  We also issued to First Montauk and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of 190,195 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $1.68 per share, which was 120% of the closing bid             14                price of the our common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market on July 31, 2008. The warrants were valued at $194,057 using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model and were recorded as debt costs. The warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on August 1, 2008.  In addition, the exercise price of 50% of the warrants previously issued to First Montauk and its designees at the closing of the July 2007 offering was reduced from $5.50 to $2.61 per share. This reduced warrant exercise price lowered potential proceeds on the exercise of the warrants issued to First Montauk from the July 2007 offering by $115,600 to $104,400.     The private placement was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act (in that we sold the Debentures, Warrants and shares of common stock in a transaction not involving any public offering) and pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder.  The shares into which the Debentures are convertible, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, the October Interest Shares and the Incentive Shares have been registered for resale under the Act.  The registration was declared effective on October 16, 2008.     The Warrants and the Incentive Shares issued to the debenture holders were valued at issuance at $790,830 and recorded as a discount on the debt. The Incentive Shares were valued using the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of issuance. The Warrants were valued using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model using assumptions similar to those used to value the Company’s stock options and restricted stock units. In addition a beneficial conversion feature associated with the Debentures was valued at the date of issuance at $600,635 and was recorded as a discount on the debt. The total debt discount of $1,391,465 was amortized using the effective interest method over the original 36-month term of the Debentures and subsequently adjusted for the extension of the maturity date of the Debentures.     We also incurred debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the Debentures of $554,308 which were amortized over the original 36-month term using the effective interest method, adjusted for accelerated conversions of the Debentures and the extension of the maturity date of the Debentures.  The costs were for broker commissions, legal and accounting fees, filing fees and $194,057 representing the fair value of the 190,195 warrants shares issued to First Montauk.  We used the Black-Scholes-Merton model to determine fair value of the warrants issued to First Montauk. The warrants carry a five year term, expiring on August 1, 2013, and are immediately exercisable at a per share price of $1.68 for one-third of the warrants and $1.89 for two-thirds of the warrants. For the year ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, $118,977 and $147,550, respectively of the debt issuance costs were amortized through interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations.     On December 31, 2008 the Debentures were amended to allow debenture holders to convert 25% of their Debentures into shares of common stock.  As a result, $732,250 of the Debentures were converted into 475,496 shares of common stock.  As an inducement to partially convert the Debentures, we issued additional warrants (valued at $215,975 using the Black-Scholes-Merton method and recorded as interest expense) and prepaid the interest of $453,995 on the unconverted portion of the Debentures through the original maturity date of August 1, 2011, which resulted in the issuance of 589,614 shares of common stock.  The interest payment of $58,580 for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 resulted in the issuance of 76,078 shares of common stock.  As a result of the Debenture conversion, $304,382 of debt discount was written off to interest expense.   On May 29, 2009 we filed a registration statement to register those additional interest shares and the shares underlying the warrants which were issued in December 2008. The registration statement was declared effective on June 16, 2009.    During the year ended June 30, 2011, the Company’s debt obligations were reduced by $832,500 through the conversions of certain Debentures into shares of common stock. Costs associated with the conversion of these Debentures were $6,748, which reduced the proceeds recognized. These  transactions increased interest expense by $101,300 for the year ending June 30, 2011, reflecting debt issue costs, prepaid interest and discount on the debt that were written off as a result of the debt conversions of certain of the Debentures into shares of common stock. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2010, the Company’s debt obligations were reduced by $262,500 through conversion of certain of the Debentures into shares of common stock.    On March 30, 2011 debenture holders holding approximately 98.71% of the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures consented to an amendment to extend the maturity date from August 2011 to August 2013. The one debenture holder electing not to participate in the extension was paid all amounts due under the Debenture held by such holder, or $14,250, in April 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the amendment, interest will be prepaid in common stock annually each August. The extension of the maturity date of the Debentures was determined to be substantial and therefore triggered “debt extinguishment” accounting under ASC 470-50-40, which requires the Debentures to be adjusted to fair value. The Debentures are hybrid financial instruments that blend characteristics of both debt and equity securities.  The Debentures embody settlement alternatives to the holder providing for either redemption of principal and interest in cash (forward component) or conversion into the Company’s common stock (embedded conversion feature).  As a result of the debt extinguishment accounting, $63,692 of the unamortized debt discount and $25,372 of the unamortized debt issuance costs were written off to loss on extinguishment of debt. The calculated fair value of the amended Debentures as of March 31, 2011 was $1,706,919, and included $924,844 for the forward component and $782,075 for the embedded conversion feature.  The forward component was valued using the present value of discounted cash flows arising from the contractual principal and interest payment terms and the embedded conversion feature was valued using a Monte Carlo simulations method. The fair value of the amended             15                Debentures exceeded the carrying value of the Debentures just prior to the amendment date by $619,419, recognized as a premium. Approximately 93% of the Debentures are held by related parties and as such $576,700 of the premium was considered a capital contribution and was not included in the loss on extinguishment and therefore had no impact on additional paid in capital. The remaining $42,719 of the premium was associated with the Debentures to non-related parties and thus was recorded to loss on extinguishment of debt and additional paid in capital.     For the years ended June 30, 2011 and 2010, $316,693 and $370,385, respectively, of the amortized debt discount was amortized through interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations.     Total principal outstanding on the Debentures and the gross amount outstanding for directors’, officers’ and stockholders’ purchases under the Debentures was $1,087,500 and $1,012,500, respectively at June 30, 2011.     We can force the debenture holders to convert the Debentures into shares of our common stock if our stock price exceeds $5.00 per share. A forced conversion of the Debentures would include a 10% premium on the face amount.  No payment of dividends may be made while the Debentures are outstanding.    During fiscal 2010, we completed two private placement offerings with certain institutional and private investors. On August 19, 2009, we executed a Securities Purchase Agreement with thirty-three investors with respect to a private placement of an aggregate of 1,298,827 shares of our common stock at $1.26 per share and warrants to purchase 649,423 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.73 per share (the “August 2009 Warrants”). The August 2009 Warrants are exercisable for a period of five years beginning on February 19, 2010. We received aggregate gross cash proceeds from the issuance of the common stock (exclusive of proceeds from any future exercise of the August 2009 Warrants) in the amount $1,636,500.  We used the funds to provide working capital for our operations.             We paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering, Garden State Securities, Inc. (“Garden State”), in an amount equal to $148,100 plus costs and expenses.  We also issued to Garden State and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of 155,860 shares of our common stock at exercise price equal to $1.73 per share, for a five-year term beginning February 19, 2010.  Legal and other expenses to register the shares of $71,310 were netted against the proceeds.            The private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of the Act, pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act (in that the shares of common stock and August 2009 Warrants were sold by the Company in a transaction not involving any public offering) and pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The shares of common stock and the shares of common stock underlying the August 2009 Warrants have been registered for resale under the Act. The registration statement was declared effective on October 21, 2009.    On April 8, 2010, we executed a Securities Purchase Agreement with seven institutional and private investors, with respect to a private placement of an aggregate of 507,730 shares of common stock at $2.20 per share for all non-insider purchasers, and warrants to purchase 50,776 shares of common stock (the “April 2010 Warrants”). The April 2010 Warrants have an exercise price of $2.48 per share, are exercisable after October 8, 2010, and have a five-year term.  We received aggregate gross cash proceeds from the issuance of the common stock (exclusive of proceeds from any future exercise of the April 2010 Warrants) in the amount of $1,117,006.  We used the funds to provide working capital for its operations.  Among the investors were J. James Gaynor and Louis Leeburg, both of whom are directors or officers of LightPath, who paid $2.2325 per share of Common Stock.     We paid a commission to the exclusive placement agent for the offering, Garden State, in an amount equal to $88,610 plus costs and expenses.  We also issued to Garden State and its designees warrants to purchase an aggregate of 50,773 shares of Common Stock at exercise price equal to $2.48 per share.  The April 2010 Warrants have a five-year term and are exercisable by Garden State and its designees after October 8, 2010.     The private placement is exempt from the registration requirements of the Act, pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Act (in that the shares of common stock and the April 2010 Warrants were sold by the Company in a transaction not involving any public offering) and pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The shares of common stock and the shares of common stock underlying the warrants have been registered for resale under the Act. The registration statement was declared effective on May 20, 2010.             16                Cash Flows – Operating and Investing:    Cash provided during fiscal 2011 was approximately $95,000, an increase of approximately $566,000 from fiscal 2010. We anticipate lower glass costs to result from our replacement of internally fabricated material with purchased materials from suppliers in Asia and lower coating costs due to larger unit volumes. These cost reductions are expected to improve our cash flow in future years.    While progress has been made to reduce operating cash outflow since fiscal 2004, significant risk and uncertainty remains. Our cash provided by operations was approximately $162,000 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. Cost cutting measures were implemented in fiscal 2010 and 2011 but revenues were not high enough to cover fixed costs.  The fiscal 2012 operating plan and related financial projections we developed anticipate continued sales growth and continuing margin improvements based on production efficiencies and reductions in product costs, offset by marginal increases in selling, administrative and new product development expenditures.     During fiscal 2011, we expended approximately $908,000 for capital equipment in comparison to $988,000 during fiscal 2010. The majority of the capital expenditures during both fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 were related to equipment used to enhance or expand our production capacity and for tooling for our precision molded products.  Our operating plan for fiscal 2012 estimates expenditures at increased levels to enhance or expand our capacity, however, we may spend more or less depending on opportunities and circumstances.    Results of Operations    Operating Results for Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2011 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2010:     Revenue for fiscal year 2011 totaled $10.0 million compared to $9.3 million for fiscal year 2010, an increase of 8%. The increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to higher sales volumes for precision molded optics, collimators and GRADIUM lenses. Our precision molded optics sales units were significantly higher but our average selling price was lower. This is the result of our pursuit of the high volume low cost lens business. Growth in sales going forward is expected to be derived primarily from the precision molded optics product line, particularly our low cost lenses being sold in Asia and the growth of our infrared lens business.     Our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 decreased to 39% from 47%. Total manufacturing cost of $6.1 million was $1.1 million higher in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase in cost of goods sold resulted from increased costs associated with ramping up production volumes which included tooling and labor costs, competitive price pressures and product mix changes. We incurred increased labor costs of $225,000 for additional staff needed to manage our increased production volume and an increase in the Chinese labor rates totaling $238,000, higher freight costs of $124,000 and a one-time expense of $229,000 associated with increasing the amount of tooling inventory to support higher production levels. In addition, the changes in our product mix increased our costs by $286,000. The product mix change was due to higher sales of isolators, collimators and gradium lenses which all have a higher material cost.  Unit shipment volume in precision molded optics was up 38% in fiscal 2011 compared to last year.  Direct costs, which include material, labor and services, were 27% of revenue in fiscal 2011, as compared to 24% in the prior year.  Our average selling price decreased by 21% while our average cost per unit decreased by 10%.    Our plant capacity and overhead structure are sufficient to handle much higher levels of production.  Going forward into fiscal 2012, the emphasis will be continued unit cost reductions driven by efficient purchasing and more sourcing in China of raw materials and coating services and improved productivity due to a more experienced workforce at the Shanghai facility. Over the course of fiscal 2011, as we focused on new product development, we increased our headcount in Orlando from 49 to 54. We continue to produce over 95% of our precision molded optics production in our Shanghai facility.    Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $512,000 to $3.8 million in fiscal 2011 from $3.3 million in fiscal 2010. This increase is due to higher wages and benefits of $155,000, $55,000 higher recruiting fees in fiscal 2011 and the occurrence of some one-time events in fiscal 2010 that resulted in a $331,000 net reduction in selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010. These one-time events included receipt of $556,000 on our D&O insurance as a refund for legal expenses, a litigation settlement and corresponding legal expenses and a $76,000 reduction of legal expenses related to the reversal of accruals for litigation. Our operating plan for fiscal 2012 projects business levels that will require selling, general and administrative expenses to increase as we support a higher level of sales. We plan to manage our workforce size to meet profit and cash flow goals.    New product development costs in fiscal 2011 increased by approximately $126,000 to approximately $995,000.  This increase was primarily due to an increase in the cost of product development materials and higher labor costs. Our operating plan for fiscal 2012 projects that product development spending will increase due to enhanced efforts in the development of the infrared product line.             17                In fiscal 2011 our amortization of intangibles remained at approximately $33,000 and is expected to remain at this level for fiscal 2012.     Interest expense was approximately $606,000 for fiscal 2011 as compared to approximately $728,000 for fiscal 2010. Approximately $5,600 of the interest expense for fiscal 2010 was attributable to our equipment term loan and our capital equipment lease. The convertible debentures issued on August 1, 2008 accounted for approximately $606,000 and $722,000 of interest during fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. This represents periodic interest of 8% per annum, amortization and the write-off of the related debt issuance costs and debt discount. Included in these totals are related debt discount, debt issue costs and prepaid interest of $262,500 for debentures which were converted into common stock during fiscal 2010. In fiscal 2011 we had $132,000 for loss on extinguishment of debt incurred when we extended the maturity date of the debentures during fiscal 2011.     Investment and other income decreased by approximately $11,000 to an expense of $6,000 in fiscal 2011 from an income of approximately $5,000 in fiscal 2010, due to foreign currency exchange rate impacts during the year.    Net loss for fiscal 2011 was approximately $1.6 million compared with approximately $561,000 in fiscal 2010, a decline of approximately $1.0 million. This increase in loss in the current year was comprised principally of:        ·      Cost of goods sold increased by $648,000  primarily due to the change in product mix and increased labor rates in China and higher freight costs;         ·      One-time tooling costs of $229,000 to increase tooling inventory to support higher production levels; and         ·      Increased SG&A salaries and benefits of $155,000.         Key Performance Indicators    How we operate    We have continuing sales of two basic types: occasional sales via ad-hoc purchase orders of mostly standard product configurations (our “turns” business) and the more challenging and potentially more rewarding business of customer product development. In this latter type of business we work with a customer to help them determine optical specifications and even create certain optical designs for them, including complex multi-component designs that we call “engineered assemblies.” This is followed by “sampling” small numbers of the product for the customer’s test and evaluation. Thereafter, should the customer conclude that our specification or design is the best solution to their product need; we negotiate and “win” a contract (sometimes called a “design win”) – whether of a “blanket purchase order” type or a supply agreement. The strategy is to create an annuity revenue stream that makes the best use of our production capacity as compared to the turns business, which is unpredictable and uneven. A key business objective is to convert as much of our business to the design win and annuity model as is possible. We have several challenges in doing so:        ·      Maintaining an optical design and new product sampling capability, including a high-quality and responsive optical design engineering staff;         ·      The fact that as our customers take products of this nature into higher volume, commercial production (for example, in the case of molded optics, this may be volumes over one million pieces per year) they begin to work seriously to reduce costs – which often leads them to turn to larger or overseas producers, even if sacrificing quality; and         ·      Our small business mass means that we can only offer a moderate amount of total productive capacity before we reach financial constraints imposed by the need to make additional capital expenditures – in other words, because of our limited cash resources and cash flow, we may not be able to service every opportunity that presents itself in our markets without arranging for such additional capital expenditures.       Despite these challenges to winning more “annuity” business, we nevertheless believe we can be successful in procuring this business because of our unique capabilities in optical design engineering that we make available on the merchant market, a market that we believe is underserved in this area of service offering. Additionally, we believe that we offer value to some customers as a source of supply in the United States should they be unwilling to commit their entire source of supply of a critical component to foreign merchant production sources. We also continue to have the proprietary GRADIUM lens glass technology to offer to certain laser markets.    Our key indicators    Usually on a weekly basis, management reviews a number of performance indicators. Some of these indicators are qualitative and others are quantitative. These indicators change from time to time as the opportunities and challenges in the business change. They are mostly non-financial indicators such as units of shippable output by major product line, production yield rates by major product line and the output and yield data from significant intermediary manufacturing processes that support the production of the finished             18                shippable product. These indicators can be used to calculate such other related indicators as fully yielded unit production per-shift, which varies by the particular product and our state of automation in production of that product at any given time. Higher unit production per shift means lower unit cost and therefore improved margins or improved ability to compete where desirable for price sensitive customer applications. The data from these reports is used to determine tactical operating actions and changes. We believe that our non-financial production indicators, such as those noted, are proprietary information.     The discussions of our results as presented in this Annual Report include use of the non-GAAP terms “EBITDA” and “gross margin.”  Gross margin is determined by deducting the cost of sales from operating revenue. Cost of sales includes manufacturing direct and indirect labor, materials, services, fixed costs for rent, utilities and depreciation, and variable overhead. Gross margin should not be considered an alternative to operating income or net income, which are determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe that gross margin, although a non-GAAP financial measure is useful and meaningful to investors as a basis for making investment decisions. It provides investors with information that demonstrates our cost structure and provides funds for our total costs and expenses. We use gross margin in measuring the performance of our business and have historically analyzed and reported gross margin information publicly. Other companies may calculate gross margin in a different manner.     Financial indicators that are usually reviewed at the same time include the major elements of the micro-level business cycle:      ·      sales backlog;         ·      EBITDA;         ·      inventory levels; and         ·      accounts receivable levels and quality.       These indicators are similarly used to determine tactical operating actions and changes and are discussed in more detail below.    Sales Backlog :  Sales growth has been and continues to be our best indicator of success. Our best view into the efficacy of our sales efforts is in our “order book.” Our order book equates to sales “backlog.” It has a quantitative and a qualitative aspect: quantitatively, our backlog’s prospective dollar value and qualitatively, what percent of the backlog is scheduled by the customer for date-certain delivery. We define our “Disclosure Backlog” as that which is requested by the customer for delivery within one year and which is reasonably likely to remain in the backlog and be converted into revenues. This includes customer purchase orders and may include amounts under supply contracts if they meet the aforementioned criteria. Generally, higher backlog is better for us.    Disclosure Backlog, as defined above, has been as follows in the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters:             Fiscal  Quarter          Ended    Approximate  Disclosure  Backlog     Q4-2011    6/30/2011    $3,873,000     Q3-2011    3/31/2011    $3,633,000     Q2-2011    12/31/2010    $3,273,000     Q1-2011    9/30/2010    $3,186,000     Q4-2010    6/30/2010    $2,950,000     Q3-2010    3/31/2010    $3,927,000     Q2-2010    12/31/2009    $4,001,000     Q1-2010    9/30/2009    $3,093,000       Our disclosure backlog at June 30, 2011 was approximately $3.9 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 we debooked orders to two large customers, one due to non-payment and one due to customer cancellation.    We believe our backlog will grow as a result of our efforts to enter high volume lower cost commercial markets, including the industrial laser tool market and other imaging related product markets. We have seen increased quote activity for our Black Diamond product line and our new blue lenses.  With the continuing diversification of our backlog we expect to show increases in revenue starting in fiscal 2012. We have experienced an increase in bookings for our industrial low cost lenses in Asia. We project continued production and shipment growth for these low cost lenses in Asia.            19                EBITDA:    EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management, lenders and certain investors as a supplemental measure in the evaluation of some aspects of a corporation's financial position and core operating performance. Investors sometimes use EBITDA as it allows for some level of comparability of profitability trends between those businesses differing as to capital structure and capital intensity by removing the impacts of depreciation and amortization. EBITDA also does not include changes in major working capital items such as receivables, inventory and payables, which can also indicate a significant need for, or source of, cash. Since decisions regarding capital investment and financing and changes in working capital components can have a significant impact on cash flow, EBITDA is not a good indicator of a business's cash flows. We use EBITDA for evaluating the relative underlying performance of the Company's core operations and for planning purposes. We calculate EBITDA by adjusting net loss to exclude net interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, depreciation and amortization, thus the term "Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization" and the acronym "EBITDA."    Our EBITDA as defined above, has been as follows in the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters:           Fiscal  Quarter          Ended          EBITDA     Q4-2011    6/30/2011    $281,285     Q3-2011    3/31/2011    $73,477     Q2-2011    12/31/2010    ($44,860)     Q1-2011    9/30/2010    ($260,897)     Q4-2010    6/30/2010    $488,423     Q3-2010    3/31/2010    $397,308     Q2-2010    12/31/2009    $363,345     Q1-2010    9/30/2009    ($382,089)       Inventory levels :  We manage inventory levels to minimize investment in working capital but still have the flexibility to meet customer demand to a reasonable degree. We review our inventory for obsolete items quarterly. While the mix of inventory is an important factor, including adequate safety stocks of long lead-time materials, an important aggregate measure of inventory in all phases of production is the quarter’s ending inventory expressed as a number of days’ worth of the quarter’s cost of sales, also known as “days cost of sales in inventory,” or “DCSI.” It is calculated by dividing the quarter’s ending inventory by the quarter’s cost of goods sold, multiplied by 365 and divided by 4. Generally, a lower DCSI measure equates to a lesser investment in inventory and therefore more efficient use of capital. The table below shows our DCSI for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters:          Fiscal  Quarter       Ended       DCSI (days)     Q4-2011    6/30/2011    89     Q3-2011    3/31/2011    105     Q2-2011    12/31/2010    87     Q1-2011    9/30/2010    78     Fiscal 2011 average    90     Q4-2010    6/30/2010    86     Q3-2010    3/31/2010    71     Q2-2010    12/31/2009    76     Q1-2010    9/30/2009    98     Fiscal 2010 average    83       In comparison, our days cost of sales in inventory for the year ended June 30, 2010 was 83, compared to 90 for the year ended June 30, 2011. We believe this upward trend in DCSI was principally caused by our decision to run the production schedule to meet the sales forecast.  We increased our inventory in order to meet our sales forecast.  However, our sales did not reach forecasted levels.    Accounts receivable levels and quality :  Similarly, we manage accounts receivable levels to minimize investment in working capital. We escalate our collection efforts when invoices are fifteen days past the due date.  Weekly we also review all receivables that are sixty days past terms. These past due accounts are contacted and all future shipments to them are placed on hold. We measure the quality of receivables by the proportions of the total that are at various increments past due from our normally extended terms, which are generally 30-45 days. The most             20                important aggregate measure of accounts receivable is the quarter’s ending balance of net accounts receivable expressed as a number of days’ worth of the quarter’s net revenues, also known as “days sales outstanding,” or “DSO.” It is calculated by dividing the quarter’s ending net accounts receivable by the quarter’s net revenues, multiplied by 365 and divided by 4. Generally, a lower DSO measure equates to a lesser investment in accounts receivable and therefore more efficient use of capital. The table below shows our DSO for the immediately preceding eight fiscal quarters:        Fiscal  Quarter       Ended       DSO (days)     Q4-2011    6/30/2011    60     Q3-2011    3/31/2011    60     Q2-2011    12/31/2010    60     Q1-2011    9/30/2010    71     Fiscal 2011 average    63     Q4-2010    6/30/2010    71     Q3-2010    3/31/2010    68     Q2-2010    12/31/2009    60     Q1-2010    9/30/2009    57     Fiscal 2010 average    64       Our days sales outstanding for the year ended June 30, 2011 was 63 compared to 64 at June 30, 2010. We plan to monitor our collections efforts to keep this key indicator as low as reasonably possible. We strive to have DSO no higher than 55.     Critical Accounting Policies     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of income and expense during the reporting periods presented. Our significant estimates include the allowance for trade receivables which is made up of reserves for bad debts, inventory reserves for obsolesense, revenue recognition, valuation of compensation expense on stock-based awards and beneficial conversion and warrant valuation related to convertible debentures. Although we believe that these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates given a change in conditions or assumptions that have been consistently applied.     Management has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our Board of Directors, and the Board of Directors has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting policies and estimates in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The critical accounting policies used by management and the methodology for its estimates and assumptions are as follows:     Allowance for accounts receivable,  is calculated by taking 100% of the total of invoices that are over 90 days past due from the due date and 10% of the total of invoices that are over 60 days past due from the due date. Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company performs continuing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition. Recovery of bad debt amounts previously written off is recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense in the period the payment is collected. If the Company’s actual collection experience changes, revisions to its allowance may be required. After all attempts to collect a receivable have failed, the receivable is written off against the allowance.     Inventories,  which consist principally of raw materials, work-in-process and finished lenses, isolators, collimators and assemblies are stated at the lower of cost or market, on a first-in, first-out basis. Inventory costs include materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. Acquisition of goods from our vendors has a 9% purchase burden added to cover customs, shipping and handling costs. Fixed costs related to excess manufacturing capacity have been expensed. We look at the following criteria for parts to consider for the inventory reserve: items that have not been sold in two years or that have not been purchased in two years or of which we have more than a two year supply.  These items as identified are reserved at 100%, as well as reserving 50% for other items deemed to be slow moving within the last twelve months and reserving 25% for items deemed to have low material usage within the last six months. The parts identified are adjusted for recent order and quote activity to determine the final inventory reserve.     Property and equipment  are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets ranging from one to ten years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the related assets using the straight-line method.     Long-lived assets , such as property, plant, and equipment, tooling and purchased intangibles subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated             21                undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and are no longer depreciated. The assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet.     Intangible assets,  consisting of patents and trademarks, are recorded at cost. Upon issuance of the patent or trademark, the assets are amortized on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related assets ranging from two to seventeen years.     Debt costs  consist of third party fees incurred and other costs associated with the issuance of long-term debt. Debt costs are capitalized and amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method.     Deferred rent  relates to certain of the Company’s operating leases containing predetermined fixed increases of the base rental rate during the lease term being recognized as rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has recorded the difference between the amounts charged to operations and amounts payable under the leases as deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.     Income taxes  are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on the basis of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based upon enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances have been established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.     The Company has not recognized a liability for uncertain tax positions. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits or penalties has not been provided since there is no unrecognized benefit or penalty since the date of adoption. If there were an unrecognized tax benefit or penalty, the Company would recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.     The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2004.     Revenue  is recognized from product sales when products are shipped to the customer, provided that the Company has received a valid purchase order, the price is fixed, title has transferred, collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured, and there are no remaining significant obligations. Revenues from product development agreements are recognized as milestones and are completed in accordance with the terms of the agreements and upon shipment of products, reports or designs to the customer. Invoice amounts for sales or VAT taxes are posted to the balance sheet and not included in revenue.     New product development  costs are expensed as incurred.     Stock based compensation  is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period.  We estimate the fair value of each stock option as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. Most options granted under our Amended and Restated Omnibus Incentive Plan vest ratably over two to four years and generally have ten-year contract lives.  The volatility rate is based on four-year historical trends in common stock closing prices and the expected term was determined based primarily on historical experience of previously outstanding options.  The interest rate used is the United States Treasury interest rate for constant maturities. The likelihood of meeting targets for option grants that are performance based are evaluated each quarter. If it is determined that meeting the targets is probable then the compensation expense will be amortized over the remaining vesting period.     Management makes estimates  and assumptions during the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Such estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes available, which in turn could impact the amounts reported and disclosed herein.     Financial instruments.  The Company accounts for financial instruments in accordance with FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  (“ASC 820”), which provides a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosure about fair value measurements of assets and liabilities.  ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:    Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.             22                Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable.    Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing.    Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of June 30, 2011.  The Company uses the market approach to measure fair value for its Level 1 financial assets and liabilities, which include cash equivalents of $449,000 at June 30, 2011.  The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities.    The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values.  These financial instruments which include cash, trade receivables, accounts payable and accrued liabilities.  Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values for these financial instruments since they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are receivable or payable on demand.     On August 1, 2008, the Company executed a Securities Purchase Agreement with respect to the private placement of 8% senior convertible debentures (the “Debentures”) as described in Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Debentures issued were valued using observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2). The fair value of the Debentures as of June 30, 2011 was calculated to be approximately $1.1 million.     The Company does not have other financial or non-financial assets or liabilities that would be characterized as Level 2 or Level 3 instruments.     Derivative Financial Instruments.   The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging  (formerly referenced as SFAS No. 161,  Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities – an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 ) (“ASC 815”), which requires additional disclosures about the Company’s objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how the derivative instruments and related hedging items affect the financial statements.     The Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risk.  Terms of convertible debt instruments are reviewed to determine whether or not they contain embedded derivative instruments that are required under ASC 815 to be accounted for separately from the host contract, and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  The fair value of derivative liabilities, if any, is required to be revalued at each reporting date, with corresponding changes in fair value recorded in current period operating results.     Freestanding warrants issued by the Company in connection with the issuance or sale of debt and equity instruments are considered to be derivative instruments.  Pursuant to ASC 815, an evaluation of specifically identified conditions is made to determine whether the fair value of warrants issued is required to be classified as equity or as a derivative liability.     Beneficial Conversion and Warrant Valuation.   The Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature (“BCF”) related to the issuance of convertible debt instruments that had conversion features at fixed rates that were in-the-money when issued, and the fair value of warrants issued in connection with those instruments. The BCF for the convertible instruments was recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds to warrants, based on their relative fair value, and as a reduction to the carrying amount of the convertible instrument equal to the intrinsic value of the conversion feature.  The discounts recorded in connection with the BCF and warrant valuation were recognized as non-cash interest expense debt discount over the term of the convertible debt, using the effective interest method.     Comprehensive Income (Loss)  of the Company is defined as the change in equity (net assets) of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources.  It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners.  Comprehensive income (loss) has two components, net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss), and is included on the statement of stockholders’ equity. Our other comprehensive income (loss) consists of the foreign currency translation adjustment. For more information see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.     Business segments  are required to be reported by the Company. As the Company only operates in principally one business segment, no additional reporting is required.    Reclassifications  of certain items have been reclassified in the fiscal 2010 financial statements to conform to the fiscal 2011 presentation.             23                Recent accounting pronouncements  issued by FASB (including EITF), the AICPA and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company’s present or future financial statements.
