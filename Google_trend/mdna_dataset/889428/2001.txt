ITEM 7          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL                        CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW       Since its inception, the Company has been engaged primarily in research and development of its technologies and proposed products, and the commercialization of CLINICEL and the Sure-Closure System. In early 2000, in conjunction with the discontinuation of the CLINICEL product line, the Company refocused its strategy solely toward the development of products for the prevention and/or reduction of post surgical adhesions.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     1999 VS. 2000       The Company had revenue of $101,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 of which $58,000 was attributed to the sale of CLINICEL products and $43,000 represented royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System. Total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 was $1,249,000, comprised of $1,201,000 in CLINICEL sales and $48,000 in royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System. The decline in CLINICEL sales was due to the discontinuation of sale of CLINICEL products in February 2000.       Cost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 was $4,000 as compared to $556,000 for the prior year. The reduction is attributable to the reduced level of CLINICEL sales and the write-off of certain inventories in the prior year.       Sales and marketing expenses declined to $20,000 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 from $437,000 for the comparable period in 1999. The reduction reflected the elimination of consumer and professional advertising associated with the discontinuation of the sale of CLINICEL products.       The Company incurred research and development expenses of $316,000 and $788,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The reduction was primarily attributable to the scale back of expenditures on several bioresorbable polymer-based product development programs.       General and administrative expenses totaled $759,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to $1,684,000 for the previous fiscal year. The reduction was related to termination of most remaining staff members in July 2000.       Interest income declined to $11,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 from $16,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999.       Interest expense was $1,000 and $4,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.       The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of $468,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000; compared to $817,000 in the prior year. These amounts were attributable to the receipt of funds associated with the sale of certain accumulated New Jersey State tax operating losses; the reduction compared to the prior year was largely the result of lower overall funding allocated by the State to the program.                                          21        The Company recorded an extraordinary item of $432,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999. This extraordinary item was attributable to a gain on the extinguishment of amounts owed to suppliers by the transfer of title to equipment that had previously been charged to research and development expenses.       The Company recorded a net loss of $520,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2000 as compared to a net loss of $955,000 for the prior year. The decrease in the current period net loss is attributable to the reasons described above.     1998 VS. 1999       The Company had revenue of $1,249,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 of which $1,201,000 was attributed to the sale of CLINICEL products and $48,000 represented royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System. Total for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 was $1,770,000 comprised of $1,715,000 in CLINICEL sales and $55,000 in royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System. The decline in CLINICEL sales was largely related to reduced trade purchases and lower direct-to-consumer orders associated with lower advertising expenditures.       Cost of goods sold of $556,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $820,000 for the prior year. The reduction is attributable to the reduced level of CLINICEL sales.       Sales and marketing expenses declined to $437,000 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 from $3,142,000 for the comparable period in 1998. The reduction reflected lower levels of consumer and professional advertising and promotion expenditures in support of CLINICEL coupled with one-time start-up costs associated with the CLINICEL market launch in 1998.       The Company incurred research and development expenses of $788,000 and $3,584,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The reduction was primarily attributable to the scale back of expenditures on several bioresorbable polymer-based product development programs and the completion in 1998 of CLINICEL clinical development activities.       General and administrative expenses totaled $1,684,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $1,982,000 for the previous fiscal year. The reduction was related to fewer employees.       Interest income declined to $16,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 to $161,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998. This decline is primarily attributable to the lower average balance of cash and investments during 1999 versus 1998.       Interest expense was $4,000 and $5,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. For both 1998 and 1999, these amounts represent the interest on capital leases entered into during 1996 and 1997 on certain office equipment.       The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of $817,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999; there was no similar entry recorded in 1998. This was attributable to the receipt of funds associated with the sale of certain accumulated New Jersey State tax operating losses.       The Company recorded an extraordinary item of $432,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999; there was no similar entry in 1998. This extraordinary item was attributable to the gain on extinguishment of amounts owed to a contract manufacturer by the transfer of title to equipment that had previously been charged to research and development expenses.       The Company recorded a net loss of $955,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to a net loss of $7,602,000 for the prior year. The decrease in the current period net loss is primarily attributable to the previously mentioned other income coupled with lower levels of operating expenses.                                          22   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       At December 31, 2000, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $844,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $724,000 at December 31, 1999. The primary use of these funds is to fund the Company's research and development related to anti-adhesion products and general and administrative expenses associated with these activities. In December 2000, the company received a payment of $468,000 in exchange for the transfer of certain New Jersey State tax benefits; $817,000 was received under this program in the prior year. The Company closed on a Series A Convertible Preferred Stock financing in December 2000 which contributed $435,000 to cash flow.       At December 31, 2000, the Company had a working capital deficit of $513,000. The current cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 2000 will not be sufficient to meet the Company's cash requirements through 2001. The Company will be required to raise substantial additional funds to continue the clinical development and commercialization of its proposed products. There can be no assurance that such arrangements or financings will be available as needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company plans to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners, licensing arrangements for certain of its proposed products and additional equity or debt financings. The Company continues to be in discussion with venture and private investors regarding a private placement of new equity in amounts sufficient to support near term operations and with its advisors regarding other financing vehicles. Any additional financings may be dilutive to existing stockholders. The Company is also pursuing other initiatives, including state tax benefit transfers and licensing/marketing agreements intended to improve its financial condition. The Company has reduced spending on certain programs as a means of preserving its cash resources.  ITEM 7A.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
