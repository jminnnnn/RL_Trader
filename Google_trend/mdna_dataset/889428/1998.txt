ITEM 7.        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL                       Condition And Results of Operations  Financial Overview    Since its inception, the Company has been engaged primarily in research and development of its technologies and proposed products, commercialization of the Sure-Closure System and organizational activities. In July 1994, the Company sold the Sure-Closure System and focused its resources primarily on development of its in-situ tissue culturing technology and bioresorbable polymer technology as well as proposed products to be derived from such technologies.  During the second half of 1997, the Company concluded that its in-situ tissue culturing technology products in clinical trials would not yield the desired benefits and therefore revised its strategy to concentrate its resources on the proposed products based on its bioresorbable polymer technology.  All revenue to date has been derived from sales of the Sure-Closure System or the royalties thereon.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   1996 vs. 1997    The Company had revenue of $155,000 and $64,000 from royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  The reduction in royalties from 1996 to 1997 can be attributed to the reduced sales of the Sure-Closure System.    The Company incurred research and development expenses of $2,779,000 and $6,271,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively. This increase can be attributed to increased spending  for the development, pre- clinical and clinical studies and manufacturing development of bioresorbable polymer adhesion prevention products, conduct of the European clinical studies of Cariel and Piliel and the domestic clinical study of Clinicel and additional expenditures supporting the management of the research and development function. During 1997, the Company acquired machinery and equipment for use in its bioresorbable polymer technology research and development program for approximately $996,000.  Accordingly, this cost was charged to research and development expense as incurred.  Additionally, a non-cash expense for stock- based compensation costs of $456,000 was recorded in 1996. There was no such expense in 1997. Research and development expenses are expected to increase for 1998 from the 1997 levels as the Company expands development of and conducts additional clinical trials on several products.    General and administrative expenses, which consist principally of management compensation, professional fees, investor materials and travel expenses were $1,743,000 and $2,012,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  This increase is attributable to the additional expenditures in connection with the business development effort during 1997.    Interest income was $540,000 and $557,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  Interest income increased primarily as a result of a larger average cash balance in 1997 as compared to 1996 due to the public offering completed in May 1996.    Interest expense was $3,000 and $4,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  For both 1996 and 1997, these balances represent the interest on capital leases entered into during 1996 and 1997 to acquire certain office equipment.    The Company's net loss was $3,830,000 and $7,666,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  This increase was primarily the result of the increased scale of operations as the Company expanded its product development efforts and strengthened its management.    1995 vs. 1996    The Company had revenue of $245,000 and $155,000 from royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  The reduction in royalties from 1995 to 1996 can be attributed to the reduced sales of the Sure-Closure System.    The Company incurred research and development expenses of $1,994,000 and $2,779,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively. This increase can be attributed to increased spending due to the development and pre-clinical studies of bioresorbable polymer adhesion prevention products, a full year of expenditures supporting the management of the research and development function, offset by a reduction in the clinical trial expenditures on Cariel and Piliel.   Additionally, a non-cash expense for stock based compensation costs of $456,000 was recorded in 1996.  There was no such expense in 1995.    General and administrative expenses, which consist principally of management compensation, professional fees, investor materials and travel expenses were $1,231,000 and $1,743,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  This increase is attributable to the additional management added during 1996.    Interest income was $183,000 and $540,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  Interest income increased primarily as a result of a larger cash balance in 1996 as compared to 1995 due to the public offering completed in May 1996.    Interest expense was $3,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1996, which represents the interest on capital leases entered into to acquire certain office equipment.    The Company's net loss was $2,797,000 and $3,830,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  This increase was primarily the result of the increased scale of operations as the Company expanded its product development efforts and strengthened its management.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    At December 31, 1997, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $7,569,000 compared to $14,278,000 at December 31, 1996. The cash, cash equivalents and investments for December 31, 1997, primarily reflect the remaining proceeds of the approximately $13.4 million public offering  of Common Stock made during May 1996.    Although the Company believes that the available cash will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through 1998, there can be no assurance that the Company will not require additional financing during that time or that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The Company will be required, however, to raise substantial additional funds to continue the clinical development and commercialization of its proposed products and to fund the growth that is expected to occur if any of its proposed products are approved for marketing. The Company plans to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners, licensing arrangements for certain of its proposed products and additional public or private financings, including equity financings. Any additional equity financings may be dilutive to stockholders. There can be no assurance that such arrangements or financings will be available as needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. Insufficient funds may require the Company to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs and manufacturing and marketing efforts or require it to license to third parties certain products or technologies that the Company would otherwise seek to commercialize itself.
