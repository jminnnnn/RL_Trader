Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below under “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.             30                We are a development stage regenerative medicine company seeking to develop novel cell-based and related therapies for the treatment of a broad range of diseases and medical conditions characterized by organ-specific cell damage.  Based on preclinical data obtained to date, we have identified diabetes, renal disease, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease as potential indications for therapies based on our technology.       Our development activities with respect to cell-based and related therapies have been limited to laboratory and preclinical testing. Our development plan calls for conducting additional preclinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to indentified and other potential indications.    In addition to our cell therapy business that we acquired in the Merger, we also continue the business conducted by our company prior to the Merger, which we refer to as the “SyntheMed business.”  Through the SyntheMed business we have been selling REPEL-CV® Bioresorbable Adhesion Barrier domestically since obtaining US Food and Drug Administration clearance in March 2009 and internationally since obtaining CE Mark approval in August 2006.  In the United States and some foreign countries, REPEL-CV’s marketing approval is limited to the pediatric market, while the CE Mark approval, which covers the European Union (EU) and other countries, as well as other foreign approvals subsequently obtained, apply broadly to both the adult and pediatric market segments.    Our cell therapy business represents our principal operations and we intend to devote substantially all of our efforts and resources to the development and commercialization of our cell therapy technology. Regarding the legacy SyntheMed business, our strategy includes continuing to seek a sale, licensing transaction or other strategic transaction for the assets of the business and maintaining the business on a limited basis without significant development or investment pending any such transaction.    Merger with Pathfinder, LLC    On September 2, 2011, we completed a reverse merger, business combination with Pathfinder, LLC in accordance with the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 22, 2010, by and among SyntheMed, SYMD Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SyntheMed (“Merger Sub”), and Pathfinder, LLC (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Pathfinder, LLC, with Pathfinder, LLC continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company.  We refer to the transaction as the “Merger.”       As a result of the Merger and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, each outstanding membership interest of Pathfinder, LLC was converted into the right to receive shares of Pathfinder common stock based on an exchange ratio of four times the number of shares of Pathfinder common stock outstanding or deemed outstanding immediately prior to the Merger divided by the number of Pathfinder, LLC membership interests outstanding immediately prior to the Merger.  In addition, each option to purchase membership interests of Pathfinder, LLC outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was assumed by Pathfinder and converted into an option to purchase Pathfinder common stock, the number of underlying shares and exercise price per share being adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio.    Upon completion of the Merger, the Pathfinder, LLC members immediately prior to the Merger owned approximately 80% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and the Company's stockholders immediately prior to the Merger owned approximately 20% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, in each case without taking into account any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to then outstanding options or warrants of the Company or options to purchase membership interests of Pathfinder, LLC.  Effective December 1, 2011, we restructured the arrangement with Yissum relating to our Polymer Technology and in connection therewith issued shares of our common stock to Yissum. Pursuant to and as contemplated by the terms of the Merger Agreement, the former members of Pathfinder, LLC were issued additional shares of our common stock to protect against the dilution associated with the Yissum issuance.            31                Pathfinder, LLC was deemed the “accounting acquirer” in the Merger, and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of our company by Pathfinder, LLC under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  Accordingly, the information reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Results of Operations” below for periods prior to the Merger is that of Pathfinder, LLC, which began operations on November 4, 2008.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our ability to continue as a going concern, uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation allowance, the useful life of intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation and income taxes.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies can be found in Note B in the Notes to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.                      Recent Accounting Pronouncements         In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-05, Presentation of Comprehensive Income, an amendment to FASB ASC Topic 220, “Comprehensive Income”.  The update gave companies the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  The amendments in the update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income.  ASU 2011-05 was effective for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011.  In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-12, Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-05.  This update stated that the specific requirement in ASU 2011-05 to present items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income alongside their respective components of net income and other comprehensive income will be deferred.  In February 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-02, Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.  This update requires companies to present the effects on the line items of net income of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income if the amount being reclassified is required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to be reclassified in its entirety to net income in the same reporting period.  ASU 2013-02 is effective prospectively for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2012.  The Company does not expect the adoption of the amended guidance to have a significant impact on its financial statements. The Company’s comprehensive loss is equal to its net loss for all periods presented, and, as a result, no statement of comprehensive loss has been included in the consolidated financial statements.            32                Results of Operations                Revenue and cost of goods sold comparisons to the prior year are not meaningful as the prior year does not include results of operations for the SyntheMed business prior to the merger date of September 2, 2011.  See Note F[1] of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of revenues and net loss on a pro forma basis for 2011 assuming the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2011.    Revenues for 2012 were $114,000, compared to $73,000 for 2011, an increase of 56.1% or $41,000 of which approximately 88% was attributable to customers outside the United States. The Company’s revenues are derived from the sale of REPEL-CV.  Pathfinder, LLC has not generated any revenue since inception.     Cost of goods sold for 2012 was $50,000 compared to $26,000 for 2011, an increase of 92.3% or $24,000. Cost of goods sold reflects raw material costs and the cost of processing and packaging REPEL-CV into saleable form.    Research and development expenses totaled $1,328,000 for 2012, compared to $1,676,000 for 2011, a decrease of 20.7% or $348,000. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in spending on pre-GMP services for cell development and production for use in pre-clinical animal models of $639,000, decreased legal fees of $46,000 and decreased consulting fees of $4,000, offset by increased fees under the research agreement with the University of Glasgow of $217,000 and increased expenses incurred for the legacy SyntheMed business of $115,000.     General and administrative expenses totaled $771,000 for 2012, compared to $1,959,000 for 2011, a decrease of 60.6% or $1,188,000. The decrease is primarily attributable to the recording of a merger related licensing fee of $687,000 in the prior year, decreases in stock based compensation expense of $514,000, investor relations expenses of $66,000, consulting fees of $64,000, travel related expenses of $47,000 and professional fees of $30,000, offset by increased salary related expenses of $102,000, increased Board of Director expenses of $54,000 and increased insurance expense of $77,000.      We incurred sales and marketing expenses of $25,000 for 2012, compared to $30,000 for 2011, a decrease of 16.6% or $5,000.  Comparisons to the prior year are not meaningful as the prior year does not include results of operations for the SyntheMed business prior to the merger date of September 2, 2011. The Company’s sales and marketing expenses are related to the sale of REPEL-CV.     We recorded an impairment loss of $8,127,000 in 2011. This amount was attributable to the goodwill generated by the deemed purchase of the SyntheMed assets in the Merger. An impairment analysis using a discounted cash flow method was performed and a determination made to record an impairment charge for the full amount of the recorded asset. There was no comparable amount for 2012.      Net interest expense totaled $96,000 for 2012 compared to $108,000 for 2011, a decrease of 11.1% or $12,000. The decrease is primarily attributable to interest charges related to lower balances of short term convertible notes payable to the Pathfinder investors in the current year.       We realized other income from the reversal of allowances for notes receivable from SyntheMed, Inc. of $459,000 for 2011. There was no comparable amount for the current year. As a result of the Merger, all amounts loaned by Pathfinder, LLC to our company (SyntheMed, Inc.) prior to the Merger (totaling $1,343,000) were automatically forgiven.  As of September 30, 2011, we reversed an allowance which was established to reserve for 100% of this note and accrued interest balances due in the amount of $1,343,000 at September 30, 2011. This reversal resulted in a net adjustment of $459,000 for 2011.     During 2011, we also realized other income of $88,000 (net) from the reversal of a liability for accrued royalty expense associated with the old Yissum agreement. Under the new agreement entered into with Yissum in December 2011, Yissum released us from any obligation to pay royalties under the old agreement. In addition, during 2011 we also realized other income of $36,000 from a reversal of accrued interest on the notes forgiven by our company (then SyntheMed, Inc.) in connection with the Merger. There was no comparable amount for the current year.             33                We incurred a net loss of $2,156,000 for 2012, compared to $11,270,000 for 2011, a decrease of 80.9% or $9,114,000.  The decrease is attributable to the factors described above. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    At December 31, 2012 we had cash and cash equivalents of $9,000, compared to $196,000 at December 31, 2011.    At December 31, 2012 we had negative working capital of $2,826,000, compared to negative working capital of $710,000 at December 31, 2011.    Net cash used in operating activities was $2,024,000 for 2012, compared to $2,330,000 for 2011.  Net cash used in operating activities for the current year period was primarily comprised of a net loss of $2,156,000, combined with a decrease in accounts payable of $167,000 offset by decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses totaling $180,000,   an increases in accrued expenses of $87,000 and the impact of $32,000 in non-cash charges. Net cash used in operating activities for the prior year was primarily comprised of a net loss of $11,270,000, offset by decreases in accounts receivable, interest receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses totaling $135,000, increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling $28,000 and the impact of $8,777,000 in non-cash charges mainly related to the Merger. Of these non-cash charges, $459,000 was for the reversal for allowance of notes and interest receivable, $88,000 was for the reversal of a liability for accrued royalty expense associated with the old Yissum agreement and $36,000 was for the reversal of a liability associated with accrued interest on the notes forgiven by our company (then SyntheMed, Inc.) in connection with the Merger offset by $8,127,000 of goodwill impairment losses related to the Merger, stock based compensation charges of $527,000,  and the  $687,000 cost of the 3% fee funded in stock by our principal stockholder to Massachusetts General Hospital in accordance with the MGH license agreement in respect of the Merger consideration.     Net cash used in investing activities for 2011 was $835,000. These amounts represent short-term loans provided by Pathfinder, LLC to our company (SyntheMed, Inc.)  at various times prior to the Merger and beginning in September 2010.  For 2011, the amount is net of $14,000 in cash acquired in the Merger.  Upon the Merger, all amounts borrowed by us from Pathfinder, LLC (together with accrued interest thereon) were automatically forgiven.  There was no comparable amount for 2012.     Net cash provided by financing activities for 2012 was $1,837,000, compared to $3,346,000 for the prior year.  The current year amount is comprised of $1,965,000 of proceeds from short term notes payable, offset by $128,000 in payments of insurance notes payable for the financing of our product liability insurance premiums and our directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums.  The 2011 amount  is comprised of $1,283,000 of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $2,125,000 of proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes,  offset by $62,000 paid on a note issued to finance our directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums.    Recent Financings    Immediately following the Merger and as contemplated thereby, on September 2, 2011 we completed the initial closing of a private placement (the “Capital Raise”) in which we sold an aggregate of 89,661,520 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 13.5% of the shares of our common stock outstanding after issuance, at a price of $0.05 per share, for net proceeds of $4,146,000.  Of the proceeds, $1,375,000 was paid in cash, and the balance was paid by conversion of Pathfinder, LLC debt held by investors in Pathfinder, LLC, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The converted debt was evidenced by promissory notes issued by Pathfinder, LLC between September 2010 and July 2011 to fund its operating costs, including its loans to our company that were cancelled in connection with the Merger.  The notes bore interest at 6% per annum, were due and payable on the earlier to occur of the first anniversary of issuance or the closing of the Merger and were convertible, at the election of the payee, into equity securities of our company for the subscription price thereof in an offering by our company conducted in connection with the Merger.  At December 31, 2012, we owed approximately $96,000 for unpaid accrued interest on the converted notes. Clubb Capital Limited, of which Mr. Joerg Gruber is Chairman, acted as placement agent for the financing and received a commission equal to 7% of the gross proceeds, a portion of which was paid in cash and a portion of which was payable by a note bearing interest at 6% per annum, payable on demand after December 30, 2011.   In addition, Clubb Capital Limited or its designees were granted warrants to purchase up to 6,276,306 shares of our common stock (representing 7% of the number of shares sold in the placement), exercisable at $0.055 per share and expiring September 30, 2016.            34                During 2012, we have borrowed from investors an aggregate principal amount of $1,965,000. An additional $ 305,000  has been borrowed in 2013 through March 31. The borrowings are evidenced by promissory notes bearing interest at 6% per annum.  Principal and interest are due and payable on the first anniversary of issuance.  At any time prior to completion or termination of the Capital Raise, the holders may elect to convert the principal amount of the promissory notes, and/or accrued interest thereon, into shares of our common stock in the Capital Raise at the subscription price thereof.     The cash balance as of December 31, 2012 and the subsequent borrowings through March 2013 are not sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months.  We will need to raise additional funds to support our planned operations.  We plan to raise an additional approximately $0.3 million in the Capital Raise, which would result in total gross proceeds for the Capital Raise, including converted debt, to approximately $7 million.  Even if we are successful in doing so, of which there can be no assurance, we will nevertheless need to raise additional capital to fund our plan of operations.  During the next 12 months, we anticipate spending approximately $1 million on research and development and other activities, assuming we are successful in raising the necessary capital.      If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our planned development programs and otherwise limit our operations.     The lack of profitable operations and the need to continue to raise funds raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The report of the independent registered public accounting firm relating to our 2012 audited financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph referring to an uncertainty that raises doubt about the our ability to continue as a going concern.       Our principal contractual obligations, which include the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pathfinder, LLC, include (i) a commitment to fund a remaining balance of approximately $408,000 for research and development activities through the University of Glasgow through March 2013, (which we anticipate renewing through March 2014 at a cost of approximately $332,000 for the year),and (ii) cumulative license fees anticipated to aggregate $315,000 through 2017 under the license agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital.  If first commercial sale is not achieved by 2017, annual payments of $150,000 will be required thereafter until first commercial sale.       At December 31, 2012,  we had an employment agreement with one individual that is scheduled to expire in September 2013, subject to automatic renewal for one-year periods. Pursuant to this agreement, in case of early termination under certain circumstances, our com mitment regarding cash severance benefits aggregates $28,000 at December 31, 2012.
