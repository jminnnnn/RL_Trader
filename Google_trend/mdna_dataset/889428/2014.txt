Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below under “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.             27                 We are a development stage regenerative medicine company seeking to develop novel cell-derived and related therapies for the treatment of a broad range of diseases and medical conditions characterized by organ-specific cell damage.  Based on preclinical data obtained to date, we have identified diabetes, renal disease, myocardial infarction, and peripheral vascular disease as potential indications for therapies based on our technology and are concentrating on renal disease.       Our development activities with respect to cell-derived and related therapies have been limited to laboratory and preclinical testing. Our development plan calls for conducting additional preclinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to indentified and other potential indications.      Merger with Pathfinder, LLC     On September 2, 2011, we completed a reverse merger, business combination with Pathfinder, LLC in accordance with the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 22, 2010, by and among SyntheMed, SYMD Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SyntheMed (“Merger Sub”), and Pathfinder, LLC (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Pathfinder, LLC, with Pathfinder, LLC continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company.  We refer to the transaction as the “Merger.”       As a result of the Merger and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, each outstanding membership interest of Pathfinder, LLC was converted into the right to receive shares of Pathfinder common stock based on an exchange ratio of four times the number of shares of Pathfinder common stock outstanding or deemed outstanding immediately prior to the Merger divided by the number of Pathfinder, LLC membership interests outstanding immediately prior to the Merger.  In addition, each option to purchase membership interests of Pathfinder, LLC outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was assumed by Pathfinder and converted into an option to purchase Pathfinder common stock, the number of underlying shares and exercise price per share being adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio.     Upon completion of the Merger, the Pathfinder, LLC members immediately prior to the Merger owned approximately 80% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and the Company's stockholders immediately prior to the Merger owned approximately 20% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, in each case without taking into account any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to then outstanding options or warrants of the Company or options to purchase membership interests of Pathfinder, LLC.  Effective December 1, 2011, we restructured the arrangement with Yissum relating to our Polymer Technology and in connection therewith issued shares of our common stock to Yissum. Pursuant to and as contemplated by the terms of the Merger Agreement, the former members of Pathfinder, LLC were issued additional shares of our common stock to protect against the dilution associated with the Yissum issuance.             28                Pathfinder, LLC was deemed the “accounting acquirer” in the Merger, and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of our company by Pathfinder, LLC under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  Accordingly, the information reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and in “Results of Operations” below for periods prior to the Merger is that of Pathfinder, LLC, which began operations on November 4, 2008.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our ability to continue as a going concern, uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation allowance, the useful life of intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation and income taxes.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies can be found in Note B in the Notes to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.             29                              Results of Operations            Revenues for 2013 were $54,000, compared to $114,000 for 2012, a decrease of 52.6% or $60,000.  Revenue is derived solely from REPEL-CV sales. The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to a lack of sales efforts. As a result of limited sales and increased operating costs associated with REPEL-CV and our focus on research and development, we have curtailed substantially all of the operations of the REPEL-CV business.  As a result, we do not anticipate future revenue from REPEL-CV sales.   Pathfinder, LLC has not generated any revenue since inception.     Cost of goods sold for 2013 was $37,000 compared to $50,000 for 2012, a decrease of 26% or $13,000. Cost of goods sold reflects raw material costs and the cost of processing and packaging REPEL-CV into saleable form. The current year also includes a charge of $13,000 for  an increase in the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory.     Research and development expenses totaled $672,000 for 2013, compared to $1,084,000 for 2012, a decrease of 38.0% or $412,000. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreased fees under the research agreement with the University of Glasgow of $274,000, decreases in spending on pre-clinical animal models of $75,000, and decreased expenses incurred for the legacy SyntheMed business of $46,000.     General and administrative expenses totaled $921,000 for 2013, compared to $1,015,000 for 2012, a decrease of 9.3% or $94,000. The decrease is primarily attributable to decreases in professional fees of $7,000, consulting fees of $35,000, investor relations related expense of $14,000 and insurance expense of $36,000.     We incurred sales and marketing expenses of $23,000 for 2013, compared to $25,000 for 2012, a decrease of 8.0% or $2,000.  The Company’s sales and marketing expenses are related to the sale of REPEL-CV.     We recorded an impairment charge of $161,000 in 2013. The charge was attributable to the termination of the MGH license agreement the second quarter of 2013. An impairment analysis was performed and a determination made to record an impairment charge for the net amount of the recorded asset. There were no comparable amounts for 2012.     Net interest expense totaled $196,000 for 2013 compared to $96,000 for 2012, an increase of 104.2% or $100,000. The increase is primarily attributable to interest charges related to increased balances of short term convertible notes payable.     We realized other income from the reversal of a liability of $250,000 in the current year. This liability was attributable to a long term payable for our estimated licensing fee obligations under the MGH license agreement. The reversal was recorded as a result of the MGH license agreement termination. There were no comparable amounts for the prior year.             30                We incurred a net loss of $1,705,000 for 2013, compared to $2,156,000 for 2012, a decrease of 20.9% or $451,000.  The decrease is attributable to the factors described above. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     At December 31, 2013 we had cash and cash equivalents of $44,000, compared to $9,000 at December 31, 2012.     At December 31, 2013 we had negative working capital of $4,587,000, compared to negative working capital of $2,827,000 at December 31, 2012.     Net cash used in operating activities was $1,601,000 for 2013, compared to $2,024,000 for 2012.  Net cash used in operating activities for the current year period was primarily comprised of a net loss of $1,705,000, combined with a decrease in accrued expenses of $103,000 and the impact of $73,000 in non-cash charges mainly comprised of the reversal of a  $250,000 liability  attributable to a long term payable for our estimated licensing fee obligations under the MGH license agreement which terminated upon cancellation of the of the MGH license agreement , offset by $161,000 of impairment losses  attributable to the impairment of the MGH license. These amounts were   offset by decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses totaling $163,000 and an increase in accounts payable of $114,000. Net cash used in operating activities for the prior year was primarily comprised of a net loss of $2,156,000, combined with a decrease in accounts payable of $167,000 offset by decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses totaling $180,000, an increase in accrued expenses of $70,000 and the impact of $49,000 in non-cash charges.      Net cash provided by financing activities for 2013 was $1,636,000, compared to $1,837,000 for the prior year.  The current year amount is comprised of $1,735,000 of proceeds from short term notes payable, offset by $99,000 in payments of insurance notes payable for the financing of our product liability insurance premiums and our directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums. The 2012 amount is comprised of $1,965,000 of proceeds from short term notes payable, offset by $128,000 in payments of insurance notes payable for the financing of our product liability insurance premiums and our directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums.             31                 At the time of the Merger in September 2011, we raised $4,146,000 in equity capital, $1,375,000 of which was paid in cash and the balance by conversion of debt. Since February 2012, we have borrowed from existing investors an aggregate principal amount of $3,700,000, much of which has been provided on a monthly, as needed basis by our principal stockholder and all of which remained outstanding as of December 31, 2013. An additional $330,000 has been borrowed in 2014 through March 31. The borrowings are evidenced by promissory notes bearing interest at 6% per annum.  Principal and interest are due and payable on the first anniversary of issuance. None of the holders whose notes have matured, aggregating $1,965,000 in principal amount as of December 31, 2013, have requested payment. The holders may elect to convert the principal amount of the promissory notes, and/or accrued interest thereon, into shares of our common stock at $.05 per share, reflecting the price paid in the capital raise at the time of the Merger, at any time prior to completion or termination of that capital raise.      The cash balance as of December 31, 2013 and the subsequent borrowings through March 2014 are not sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through December 31, 2014, which include an estimated $1 million for research and development and other expenditures.  We need to raise additional funds to support our planned operations.  If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our planned development programs and otherwise limit our operations.     The lack of profitable operations and the need to continue to raise funds raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The report of the independent registered public accounting firm relating to our 2013 audited financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph referring to an uncertainty that raises doubt about the our ability to continue as a going concern.     Our principal contractual obligations, which include the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pathfinder, LLC, include a commitment to fund a remaining balance of approximately $141,000 for research and development activities through the University of Glasgow through March 2014 (which we anticipate renewing through March 2015 at a cost of approximately $627,000 for the year).     At December 31, 2013, we had an employment agreement with one individual that is scheduled to expire in September 2014, subject to automatic renewal for one-year periods. Pursuant to this agreement, in case of early termination under certain circumstances, our commitment regarding cash severance benefits aggregates $28,000 at December 31, 2013.
