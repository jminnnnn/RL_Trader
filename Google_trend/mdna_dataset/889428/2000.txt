Item 7.         Management's Discussion And Analysis of Financial                        Condition And Results of Operations  Financial Overview        Since its inception, the Company has been engaged primarily in research and development of its technologies and proposed products, and the commercialization of CLINICEL and the Sure-Closure System. In early 2000, in conjunction with the discontinuation of the CLINICEL product line, the Company refocused its strategy solely on the more significant commercial opportunities associated with the application of its expertise in bioresorbable materials toward the development of products for the prevention and/or reduction of post surgical adhesions.  Results of Operations        1998 vs. 1999        The Company had revenue of $1,249,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 of which $1,201,000 was attributed to the sale of CLINICEL products and $48,000 represented royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System. Total for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 was $1,770,000 comprised of $1,715,000 in CLINICEL sales and $55,000 in royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System. The decline in CLINICEL sales was largely related to reduced trade purchases and lower direct-to-consumer orders associated with lower advertising expenditures.        Cost of goods sold of $556,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $820,000 for the prior year. The reduction is attributable to the reduced level of CLINICEL sales.        Sales and marketing expenses declined to $437,000 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 from $3,142,000 for the comparable period in 1998. The reduction reflected lower levels of consumer and professional advertising and promotion expenditures in support of CLINICEL coupled with one-time start-up costs associated with the CLINICEL market launch in 1998.        The Company incurred research and development expenses of $788,000 and $3,584,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The reduction was primarily attributable to the scale back of expenditures on several bioresorbable polymer-based product development programs and the completion in 1998 of CLINICEL clinical development activities.        General and administrative expenses totaled $1,684,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to $1,982,000 for the previous fiscal year. The reduction was related to fewer employees.        Interest income declined to $16,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 to $161,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998. This decline is primarily attributable to the lower average balance of cash and investments during 1999 versus 1998.        Interest expense was $4,000 and $5,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. For both 1998 and 1999, these amounts represent the interest on capital leases entered into during 1996 and 1997 on certain office equipment.        The Company recorded a benefit for income taxes of $817,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999; there was no similar entry recorded in 1998. This was attributable to the receipt of funds associated with the sale of certain accumulated New Jersey State tax operating losses.                                          22         The Company recorded an extraordinary item of $432,000 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999; there was no similar entry in 1998. This extraordinary item was attributable to the gain on extinguishment of amounts owed to a contract manufacturer by the transfer of title to equipment that had previously been charged to research and development expenses.        The Company recorded a net loss of $955,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1999 as compared to a net loss of $7,602,000 for the prior year. The decrease in the current period net loss is primarily attributable to the previously mentioned other income coupled with lower levels of operating expenses.        1997 vs. 1998        The Company had revenue of $1,715,000 from the sales of CLINICEL for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 and revenue of $64,000 and $55,000 from royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively. The reduction in royalties from 1997 to 1998 can be attributed to the reduced sales of the Sure-Closure System.        Cost of goods sold of $820,000 in 1998 reflects introductory start up and continuing commercial costs to produce, package and ship CLINICEL to the Company's consumer and trade customers.        Sales and marketing expenses of $3,142,000 in 1998 were exclusively associated with the introduction and continued promotion of CLINICEL. The major elements of this expense category were journal advertising to both consumer and professional audiences and contract telemarketing costs.        The Company incurred research and development expenses of $6,271,000 and $3,584,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively. This decrease can be attributed primarily to the termination of the European clinical studies of Cariel and Piliel as well as the completion of the REPEL U. S. pilot clinical trial as of December 1997. Finally, the Company incurred approximately $996,000 of costs for machinery and equipment utilized in research and development charged to expense during 1997. During 1998, expenses have been largely associated with the development and pre-clinical assessment of the Company's expanded range of post-operative adhesion prevention products based on its proprietary bioresorbable polymer technology.        General and administrative expenses, which consist principally of management compensation, professional fees, investor materials and travel expenses were $2,012,000 and $1,982,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.        Interest income was $557,000 and $161,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively. Interest income decreased primarily as a result of a lower average cash and investments balance in 1998 as compared to 1997 due to the use of cash and investments to fund commercialization of CLINICEL, develop the anti-adhesion products and fund general and administrative expenses.        Interest expense was $4,000 and $5,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively. For both 1997 and 1998, these amounts represent the interest on capital leases entered into during 1996 and 1997 to acquire certain office equipment.        The Company's net loss was $7,666,000 and $7,602,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.                                          23   Liquidity and Capital Resources        At December 31, 1999, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $724,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $485,000 at December 31, 1998. The primary use of these funds was to fund the Company's research and development related to anti-adhesion products; produce, market and sell CLINICEL products; and fund general and administrative expenses associated with these activities. On December 23,1999, the company received a payment of $817,000 in exchange for the transfer of certain New Jersey State tax benefits.        At December 31, 1999, the Company had a working capital deficit of $698,000. The current cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 1999 may not be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through 2000. The Company will be required to raise substantial additional funds to continue the clinical development and commercialization of its proposed products and to fund the growth that is expected to occur if any of its current and proposed products are approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that such arrangements or financings will be available as needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company plans to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners, licensing arrangements for certain of its proposed products and additional equity or debt financings. The Company continues to be in discussion with venture and private investors regarding a private placement of new equity in amounts sufficient to support near term operations and with its advisors regarding other public financing vehicles. Any additional financings may be dilutive to existing stockholders. The Company is also pursuing other initiatives, including state tax benefit transfers and licensing/marketing agreements intended to improve its financial condition. The company has reduced spending on certain programs as a means of preserving its cash resources and is currently in discussions with third parties regarding the licensing of certain technologies which it might otherwise seek to commercialize itself.
