Item 7.  Management's Discussion And Analysis of Financial           Condition And Results of Operations  Financial Overview    Since its inception, the Company has been engaged primarily in research and development of its technologies and proposed products, and the commercialization of CLINICEL and the Sure-Closure System.  In early 1998 the Company refocused its strategy on two areas: applying its expertise in bioresorbable materials toward the prevention and/or reduction of post surgical adhesions and the introduction and commercial sale of CLINICEL.  Results of Operations   1997 vs. 1998    The Company had revenue of $1,715,000 from sales of CLINICEL for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1998 and revenue of $64,000 and $55,000 from royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.  The reduction in royalties from 1997 to 1998 can be attributed to the reduced sales of the Sure-Closure System.    Cost of goods sold of $820,000 in 1998 reflects commercial costs to produce, package and ship CLINICEL to the Company's consumer and trade customers as well as certain introductory start up costs.    Sales and marketing expenses of $3,142,000 in 1998 were exclusively associated with the introduction and continued promotion of CLINICEL.  The major elements of this expense category were journal advertising to both consumer and professional audiences and contract telemarketing costs.    The Company incurred research and development expenses of $6,271,000 and $3,584,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively. This decrease can be attributed primarily to the termination of the European clinical studies of Cariel and Piliel as well as the completion of the REPEL U.S. pilot clinical trial as of December 1997. Finally, the Company incurred approximately $996,000 of costs for machinery and equipment utilized in research and development charged to expense during 1977. During 1998, expenses have been largely associated with the development and pre-clinical assessment of the Company's expanded range of post-operative adhesion prevention products based on its proprietary bioresorbable polymer technology.    General and administrative expenses, which consist principally of management compensation, professional fees, investor materials and travel expenses were $2,012,000 and $1,982,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.    Interest income was $557,000 and $161,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.  Interest income decreased primarily as a result of a lower average cash and investments balance in 1998 as compared to 1997 due to the use of cash and investments to fund commercialization of CLINICEL, develop the anti-adhesion products and fund general and administrative expenses.    Interest expense was $4,000 and $5,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.  For both 1997 and 1998, these amounts represent the interest on capital leases entered into during 1996 and 1997 to acquire certain office equipment.    The Company's net loss was $7,666,000 and $7,602,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1997 and 1998, respectively.   1996 vs. 1997    The Company had revenue of $155,000 and $64,000 from royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  The reduction in royalties from 1996 to 1997 can be attributed to the reduced sales of the Sure-Closure System.    The Company incurred research and development expenses of $2,779,000 and $6,271,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively. This increase can be attributed to increased spending for the development, pre- clinical and clinical studies and manufacturing development of bioresorbable polymer adhesion prevention products, conduct of the European clinical studies of Cariel and Piliel and the domestic clinical study of CLINICEL and additional expenditures supporting the management of the research and development function. During 1997, the Company acquired machinery and equipment for use in its bioresorbable polymer technology research and development program for approximately $996,000.  Accordingly, this cost was charged to research and development expense as incurred.  Additionally, a non-cash expense for stock- based compensation costs of $456,000 was recorded in 1996. There was no such expense in 1997.  Research and development expenses are expected to increase for 1998 from the 1997 levels as the Company expands development of and conducts additional clinical trials on several products.    General and administrative expenses, which consist principally of management compensation, professional fees, investor materials and travel expenses were $1,743,000 and $2,012,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  This increase is attributable to the additional expenditures in connection with the business development effort during 1997.    Interest income was $540,000 and $557,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  Interest income increased primarily as a result of a larger average cash balance in 1997 as compared to 1996 due to the public offering completed in May 1996.    Interest expense was $3,000 and $4,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  For both 1996 and 1997, these balances represent the interest on capital leases entered into during 1996 and 1997 to acquire certain office equipment.    The Company's net loss was $3,830,000 and $7,666,000 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1996 and 1997, respectively.  This increase was primarily the result of the increased scale of operations as the Company expanded its product development efforts and strengthened its management.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    At December 31, 1998, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $485,000 compared to cash and cash equivalents and investments of $7,569,000 at December 31, 1997. The primary use of these funds was to fund the Company's research and development related to anti adhesion products; introduce, produce, market and sell the CLINICEL product; and fund general and administrative expenses associated with these activities.    At December 31, 1998, the Company had a working capital deficit of $1,006,000. The current cash and cash equivalents balance as of December 31, 1998 may not be sufficient to meet its cash requirements through 1999. The Company will be required to raise substantial additional funds to continue the clinical development and commercialization of its proposed products and to fund the growth that is expected to occur if any of its current and proposed products are approved for marketing. There can be no assurance that such arrangements or financings will be available as needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. The Company plans to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners, licensing arrangements for certain of its proposed products and additional equity or debt financings. The Company continues to be in discussion with venture and private investors regarding a private placement of new equity in amounts sufficient to support near term operations and with its advisors regarding other public financing vehicles. Any additional financings may be dilutive to existing stockholders. The Company is also pursuing other initiatives, including trade receivable financing, state tax benefit transfers and licensing/marketing agreements intended to improve its financial condition. The company has reduced spending on certain programs as a means of preserving its cash resources and is currently in discussions with third parties regarding the licensing of certain technologies which it might otherwise seek to commercialize itself.
