Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below under “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.            29                We are a development stage regenerative medicine company seeking to develop novel cell-based therapies for the treatment of a broad range of diseases and medical conditions characterized by organ-specific cell damage.  Based on preclinical data obtained to date, we have identified diabetes, renal disease, myocardial infarction and peripheral vascular disease as potential indications for therapies based on our technology.  Other potential indications could include kidney transplantation, chronic heart disease, stroke, osteoarthritis and liver disease.    Our development activities with respect to cell-based therapies have been limited to laboratory and preclinical testing. Our development plan calls for conducting additional preclinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to indentified and other potential indications, with the goal of commencing a Phase I clinical study for a lead indication during 2014.    In addition to our cell therapy business which we acquired in the Merger, we also continue the business conducted by our company prior to the Merger, which we refer to as the “SyntheMed business.”  Through the SyntheMed business we have been selling REPEL-CV® Bioresorbable Adhesion Barrier domestically since obtaining US Food and Drug Administration clearance in March 2009 and internationally since obtaining CE Mark approval in August 2006.  In the United States and some foreign countries, REPEL-CV’s marketing approval is limited to the pediatric market, while the CE Mark approval, which covers the European Union (EU) and other countries, as well as other foreign approvals subsequently obtained, apply broadly to both the adult and pediatric market segments.    Our cell therapy business represents our principal operations and we intend to devote substantially all of our efforts and resources to the development and commercialization of our cell therapy technology. Regarding the legacy SyntheMed business, our strategy includes continuing to seek a sale, licensing transaction or other strategic transaction for the assets of the business and maintaining the business on a limited basis without significant development or investment pending any such transaction.    Merger with Pathfinder, LLC    On September 2, 2011, we completed a reverse merger, business combination with Pathfinder, LLC in accordance with the terms of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 22, 2010, by and among SyntheMed, SYMD Acquisition Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of SyntheMed (“Merger Sub”), and Pathfinder, LLC (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Pathfinder, LLC, with Pathfinder, LLC continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of our company.  We refer to the transaction as the “Merger.”       As a result of the Merger and in accordance with the Merger Agreement, each outstanding membership interest of Pathfinder, LLC was converted into the right to receive shares of Pathfinder common stock based on an exchange ratio of four times the number of shares of Pathfinder common stock outstanding or deemed outstanding immediately prior to the Merger divided by the number of Pathfinder, LLC membership interests outstanding immediately prior to the Merger.  In addition, each option to purchase membership interests of Pathfinder, LLC outstanding immediately prior to the Merger was assumed by Pathfinder and converted into an option to purchase Pathfinder common stock, the number of underlying shares and exercise price per share being adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio.     Upon completion of the Merger, the Pathfinder, LLC members immediately prior to the Merger owned approximately 80% of the outstanding common stock of the Company and the Company's stockholders immediately prior to the Merger owned approximately 20% of the outstanding common stock of the Company, in each case without taking into account (i) any shares of common stock issuable pursuant to then outstanding options or warrants of the Company or options to purchase membership interests of Pathfinder, LLC or (ii) the Capital Raise (defined under “- Liquidity and Capital Resources”).  Effective December 1, 2011, we restructured the arrangement with Yissum relating to our Polymer Technology and in connection therewith issued shares of our common stock to Yissum. Pursuant to and as contemplated by the terms of the Merger Agreement, the former members of Pathfinder, LLC were issued additional shares of our common stock to protect against the dilution associated with the Yissum issuance.            30                Pathfinder, LLC was deemed to be the “accounting acquirer” in the Merger, and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition of our company by Pathfinder, LLC under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  Accordingly, the information reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and in “-Results of Operations” below for periods prior to the Merger is that of Pathfinder, LLC, which began operations on November 4, 2008.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our ability to continue as a going concern, uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation allowance, the useful life of intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation and income taxes.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies can be found in Note B in the Notes to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements               In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment, which amended its guidance on the testing of goodwill impairment to allow an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the current two-step process is necessary. Under the new option, the calculation of the reporting unit’s fair value is not required unless as a result of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the unit’s carrying amount. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this guidance will have on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.    In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. The objective of ASU 2011-05 is to improve the comparability, consistency, and transparency of financial reporting, to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income, and to facilitate convergence of U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. To achieve this, the FASB decided to eliminate the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The amendments in ASU 2011-05 require that all non-owner changes in stockholders’ equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In the two-statement approach, the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income, the components of other comprehensive income, and the total of comprehensive income. Finally, current GAAP does not require an entity to present reclassification adjustments on the face of the financial statements from other comprehensive income to net income, which is required by the guidance in ASU 2011-05. For public entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted, because compliance with the amendments is already permitted. The amendments do not require any transition disclosures. In October 2011, the FASB announced that it will consider deferring certain aspects of ASU 2011-5 in its future meeting.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect this guidance will have on the Company’s consolidated financial position and results of operations.            31                Results of Operations             Revenue for 2011 was $73,000, of which approximately 91% was attributable to customers outside the United States. The Company’s revenues are from the sale of REPEL-CV in the United States, European Union and other international markets. There were no comparable amounts for the prior year, as the prior year does not include results of operations for the SyntheMed business and Pathfinder, LLC has not generated any revenue since inception.  See Note F[1] of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of revenue and net loss on a pro forma basis for 2010 and 2011 assuming the Merger had occurred on January 1, 2010.    Cost of goods sold for 2011 was $26,000. There were no comparable amounts for the prior year. Cost of goods sold reflects raw material costs and the cost of processing and packaging REPEL-CV into saleable form.     Research and development expenses totaled $1,676,000 for 2011, compared to $693,000 for 2010, an increase of $983,000. The increase is primarily attributable to new spending of $781,000 on pre-GMP services for cell development and production for use in pre-clinical animal models, increased legal expense of $109,000 and increased consulting fees of $37,000.      General and administrative expenses totaled $1,959,000 for 2011, compared to $134,000 for 2010, an increase of $1,825,000. The increase is primarily attributable to costs associated with the Merger including the recording of an additional licensing fee triggered by the Merger of $687,000 and increased stock-based compensation expense of $527,000. In addition the increase is attributable to increased compensation-related expense of $52,000, increased consulting expense of $167,000, increased investor relations expense of $102,000, increased professional fees of $124,000, increased Board of Director fees of $40,000 and director’s and officer’s insurance expense of $48,000.      We incurred sales and marketing expenses of $30,000 for 2011. There were no comparable amounts for the prior year.  The Company’s sales and marketing expenses are related to the sale of REPEL-CV.     We recorded an impairment loss of $8,127,000 in 2011. This amount was attributable to the goodwill generated by the deemed purchase of the SyntheMed assets in the Merger. An impairment analysis using a discounted cash flow method was performed and a determination made to record an impairment charge for the full amount of the recorded asset. There was no comparable amount for 2010.      Net interest expense totaled $108,000 for 2011 compared to $8,000 for 2010, an increase of $100,000. The increase is primarily attributable to interest charges related to the short term convertible notes payable to the Pathfinder investors.      We realized other income from the reversal of allowances for notes receivable from SyntheMed, Inc. of $459,000 for 2011. There was no comparable amount for the prior year. As a result of the Merger, all amounts loaned by Pathfinder, LLC to our company (SyntheMed, Inc.) prior to the Merger (totaling $1,343,000) were automatically forgiven.  As of September 30, 2011, we reversed an allowance which was established to reserve for 100% of this note and accrued interest balances due in the amount of $1,343,000 at September 30, 2011. This reversal resulted in a net adjustment of $459,000 for 2011.     During 2011, we also realized other income of $88,000 (net) from the reversal of a liability for accrued royalty expense associated with the old Yissum agreement. Under the new agreement entered into with Yissum in December 2011, Yissum released us from any obligation to pay royalties under the old agreement. In addition, during 2011 we also realized other income of $36,000 from a reversal of accrued interest on the notes forgiven by our company (then SyntheMed, Inc.) in connection with the Merger.      We reported a net loss of $11,270,000 for 2011, compared to $1,294,000 for 2010, an increase of $9,976,000.  The increase is attributable to the factors described above. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.            32                Liquidity and Capital Resources    At December 31, 2011 we had cash and cash equivalents of $196,000, compared to $15,000 at December 31, 2010.    At December 31, 2011 we had negative working capital of $710,000, compared to negative working capital of $1,207,000 at December 31, 2010.    Net cash used in operating activities was $2,330,000 for 2011, compared to $833,000 for 2010.  Net cash used in operating activities for the current year period was primarily comprised of a net loss of $11,270,000, offset by decreases in accounts receivable, interest receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses totaling $135,000,  increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses totaling $28,000 and the impact of $8,777,000 in non-cash charges mainly related to the Merger. Of these non-cash charges, $459,000 was for the reversal for allowance of notes and interest receivable, $88,000 was for the reversal of a liability for accrued royalty expense associated with the old Yissum agreement and $36,000 was for the reversal of a liability associated with accrued interest on the notes forgiven by our company (then SyntheMed, Inc.) in connection with the Merger offset by $8,127,000 of goodwill impairment losses related to the Merger, stock based compensation charges of $527,000,  and the  $687,000 cost of the 3% fee funded in stock by our principal stockholder to Massachusetts General Hospital in accordance with the MGH license agreement in respect of the Merger consideration. Net cash used in operating activities for the prior year was comprised of a net loss of $1,294,000 combined with a decrease in accounts payable of $4,000 and increases in  interest receivable and prepaid expenses totaling $19,000  offset by   an  increase in accrued expenses of $13,000 and  the impact of $471,000 in non-cash charges mainly compromised of $459,000 to establish an allowance of notes and interest receivable.     Net cash used in investing activities for 2011 was $835,000, compared to $324,000 for the prior year.  These amounts represent short-term loans provided by Pathfinder, LLC to our company (SyntheMed, Inc.)  at various times prior to the Merger and beginning in September 2010.  For 2011, the amount is net of $14,000 in cash acquired in the Merger. Upon the Merger, all amounts borrowed by us from Pathfinder, LLC (together with accrued interest thereon) were automatically forgiven.    Net cash provided by financing activities for 2011 was $3,346,000, compared to $1,159,000 for the prior year.  The current year amount is comprised of $1,283,000 of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and $2,125,000 of proceeds from the issuance of short-term notes, offset by $62,000 paid on a note issued to finance our directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums. The 2010 amount is comprised of proceeds from short term notes payable of $852,000 and member’s equity contributions of $307,000.    Recent Financings    Immediately following the Merger and as contemplated thereby, on September 2, 2011 we completed the initial closing of a private placement (the “Capital Raise”) in which we sold an aggregate of 89,661,520 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 13.5% of the shares of our common stock outstanding after issuance, at a price of $0.05 per share, for net proceeds of $4,146,000.  Of the proceeds, $1,375,000 was paid in cash, and the balance was paid by conversion of Pathfinder, LLC debt held by investors in Pathfinder, LLC, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Clubb Capital Limited, of which Mr. Joerg Gruber is Chairman, acted as placement agent for the financing and received a commission equal to 7% of the gross proceeds, a portion of which was paid in cash and a portion of which was payable by a note bearing interest at 6% per annum, payable on demand after December 30, 2011.   In addition, Clubb Capital Limited or its designees were granted warrants to purchase up to 6,276,306 shares of our common stock (representing 7% of the number of shares sold in the placement), exercisable at $0.055 per share and expiring September 30, 2016.    In February and March 2012, we borrowed from investors an aggregate principal amount of $570,000.   The borrowings are evidenced by promissory notes bearing interest at 6% per annum.  Principal and interest are due and payable on the first anniversary of issuance.  At any time prior to completion or termination of the Capital Raise, the holder may elect to convert the principal amount of the promissory note, and/or accrued interest thereon, into shares of our common stock in the Capital Raise at the subscription price thereof.                    The cash balance as of December 31, 2011 and the subsequent borrowings in February and March  2012 are not sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months.  We will need to raise additional funds to support our planned operations.  We are seeking to raise an additional approximately $1.6 million in the Capital Raise, which would result in total gross proceeds for the Capital Raise, including converted debt, to approximately $6 million.  Even if we are successful in doing so, of which there can be no assurance, we will nevertheless need to raise additional capital to fund our plan of operations.  During the next 12 months, we anticipate spending approximately $3 million on research and development and other activities, assuming we are successful in raising the necessary capital.            33                 If we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our planned development programs and otherwise limit our operations.     The lack of profitable operations and the need to continue to raise funds raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The report of the independent registered public accounting firm relating to our 2011 audited financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph referring to an uncertainty that raises doubt about the our ability to continue as a going concern.     Our principal contractual obligations, which include the obligations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Pathfinder, LLC, include (i) a commitment to fund approximately $163,000 in research and development activities through the University of Glasgow through March 2012, (which we anticipate renewing for the year ending March 2013 at a cost of approximately $667,000 for the year) (ii) cumulative license fees anticipated to aggregate $315,000 through 2017 under the license agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital.  If first commercial sale is not achieved by 2017, annual payments of $150,000 will be required thereafter until first commercial sale.     At December 31, 2011, we had an employment agreement with one individual that is scheduled to expire in September 2012, subject to automatic renewal for one-year periods. Pursuant to this agreement, in case of early termination under certain circumstances, our commitment regarding cash severance benefits aggregates $33,000 at December 31, 2011.
