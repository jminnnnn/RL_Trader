ITEM 7.          MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL                       CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  FINANCIAL OVERVIEW    Since its inception, the Company has been engaged primarily in research and development of its technologies and proposed products, commercialization of the Sure-Closure System and organizational activities. In September 1993, the Company commenced marketing the Sure-Closure System. The Company built and supported a direct sales organization calling on surgeons. As a result of a strategic decision to focus on the development and commercialization of its proposed products based on its platform technologies, in July 1994, the Company sold the Sure-Closure System to MedChem for payments aggregating $4 million plus a 10% royalty on net sales through June 2004. The Company had a net gain on the sale of the Sure-Closure System of approximately $3,354,000.  Following the sale of the Sure-Closure System, sales efforts ceased and sales and marketing expenses were eliminated; general and administrative expenses were significantly reduced; and the Company focused its resources primarily on development of its in-situ tissue culturing technology and bioresorbable polymer technology as well as proposed products to be derived from such technologies. All revenue to date has been derived from sales of the Sure-Closure System or the royalties thereon.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   1995 vs. 1996    The Company had revenue of $245,488 and $154,646 from royalties on sales of the Sure-Closure System for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  The reduction in royalties from 1995 to 1996 can be attributed to the reduced sales of the Sure-Closure System.    The Company incurred research and development expenses of $1,994,523 and $2,779,172 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively. This increase can be attributed to increased spending due to the development and pre-clinical studies of bioresorbable polymer adhesion prevention products, a full year of expenditures supporting the management of the research and development function, offset by a reduction in the clinical trial expenditures on Cariel and Piliel.  Additionally, a non-cash expense for stock based compensation costs of $456,273 was recorded in 1996.  There was no such expense in 1995. Research and development expenses are expected to increase for 1997 from the 1996 levels as the Company expands development of and conducts clinical trials on several products.    General and administrative expenses, which consist of management compensation, professional fees, investor materials and travel expenses were $1,230,970 and $1,742,648 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively. This increase is attributable to the additional management added during 1996.    Interest income was $183,213 and $539,695 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  Interest income increased primarily as a result of a larger cash balance in 1996 as compared to 1995 due to the public offering completed in May 1996.    Interest expense was $504 and $2,915 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  For both 1995 and 1996, these balances represent the interest on capital leases entered into during 1995 and 1996 to acquire certain office equipment.    The Company's net loss was $2,797,296 and $3,830,394 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  This increase was primarily the result of the increased scale of operations as the Company expanded its product development efforts and strengthened its management.     1994 vs. 1995    The Company had revenue of $1,496,281 from sales of the Sure-Closure System for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995, the Company had revenue, from royalties only, of $245,488. Revenues from product sales ceased in July 1994 upon the sale of the Sure-Closure System. The cost of these sales was $551,074 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994.    The Company incurred research and development expenses of $2,012,755 and $1,994,523 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively. The decrease is attributable to the cessation of research and development activities on the Sure-Closure System following its sale to MedChem, offset by an increase in research and development expenditures on its in-situ tissue culturing technology, polymer technology and other products.    The Company incurred sales and marketing expenses of $2,930,644 in the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994. Sales and marketing expenses were incurred for the introduction of the Sure-Closure System and the hiring and supporting of the direct sales force in the United States. Following the sale of the Sure-Closure System to MedChem, the Company ceased to incur sales and marketing expenses. There were no sales and marketing expenses incurred during 1995.    General and administrative expenses, which consist of management compensation, professional fees, investor materials, consulting expenses and travel expenses were $2,791,200 and $1,230,970 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively. General and administrative expenses were substantially reduced with the sale of the Sure-Closure System to MedChem.    Interest income was $77,692 and $183,213 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively. Interest income increased as a result of larger cash balances in 1995, as compared with 1994.    Interest expense was $41,010 and $504 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively. Included in interest expense for 1994 is accrued interest on amounts loaned to the Company by certain stockholders, the principal amount of which totaled $528,000. In November 1994, the Company agreed to convert indebtedness to certain officers, directors and stockholders into Common Stock of the Company.    The Company's net loss was $3,398,867 and $2,797,296 for the fiscal years ended December 31, 1994 and 1995, respectively. This decrease was primarily the result of scaled back operations subsequent to the sale of the Sure-Closure System to MedChem.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    At December 31, 1996, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $14,277,969 compared to $3,827,530 at December 31, 1995. The cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments for December 31, 1996, primarily reflect proceeds to the Company of approximately $13.4 million from the public offering  of Common Stock during May 1996.       Although the Company believes that the available cash will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for approximately the next 18 months, there can be no assurance that the Company will not require additional financing during that time or that financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. The Company will be required, however, to raise substantial additional funds to continue the clinical development and commercialization of its proposed products and to fund the growth that is expected to occur if any of its proposed products are approved for marketing. The Company plans to seek such additional funding through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners, licensing arrangements for certain of its proposed products and additional public or private financings, including equity financings. Any additional equity financings may be dilutive to stockholders. There can be no assurance that such arrangements or financings will be available as needed or on terms acceptable to the Company. Insufficient funds may require the Company to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its research and development programs and manufacturing and marketing efforts or require it to license to third parties certain products or technologies that the Company would otherwise seek to commercialize itself.
