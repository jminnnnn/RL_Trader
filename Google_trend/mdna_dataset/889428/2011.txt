Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    Certain statements in this Report under this Item 7 and elsewhere constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements regarding future cash requirements, the success of any pending or proposed clinical trial, the timing and ability to achieve necessary regulatory approvals and market launch of any of our products or product candidates.  Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of our company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to (i) potential adverse developments regarding our efforts to obtain and maintain required FDA and other approvals including, without limitation, approval by the FDA of an expanded indication of REPEL-CV to include adult cardiac surgery patients; (ii) potential inability to secure funding as and when needed or to engage in the proposed merger with Pathfinder or alternative strategic transaction and (iii) delays associated with manufacturing and marketing activities. See Item 1A. for a description of these as well as other risks and uncertainties. Without limiting the foregoing, the words “anticipates”, “plans”, “intends”, “expects” and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements speak only as of the date of this Report or such earlier date to which the statement may expressly refer.  We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.            19                 The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below under “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.    Proposed Merger with Pathfinder    We have entered into a definitive merger agreement with Pathfinder.  Upon the merger, and without giving effect to a planned capital raise which is expected to occur immediately after the merger, Pathfinder members will hold approximately 80% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company, with SyntheMed stockholders holding approximately 20% of the outstanding shares of common stock of the combined company.  The merger will be treated by SyntheMed as a reverse merger under the purchase method of accounting in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.  For accounting purposes, Pathfinder will be considered to be acquiring SyntheMed in the merger.  Accordingly, the purchase price will be allocated among the fair values of the assets and liabilities of SyntheMed, while the historical results of Pathfinder will be reflected in the results of the combined company.  Consummation of the merger is subject to a number of conditions, including obtaining approvals by the stockholders of SyntheMed and members of Pathfinder.    Overview    We are a biomaterials company engaged in the development and commercialization of innovative and cost-effective medical devices for therapeutic applications.  Our products and product candidates, all of which are based on our proprietary, bioresorbable polymer technology, are primarily surgical implants designed to prevent or reduce the formation of adhesions (scar tissue) following a broad range of surgical procedures.  Our commercialization efforts have been focused on our lead product, REPEL-CV® Bioresorbable Adhesion Barrier (“REPEL-CV”), for use in cardiac surgery.  REPEL-CV is a bioresorbable film designed to be placed over the surface of the heart at the conclusion of surgery to reduce the formation of post-operative adhesions.     We have been selling REPEL-CV domestically since obtaining US Food and Drug Administration clearance in March 2009 and internationally since obtaining CE Mark approval in August 2006.  In the United States and some foreign countries, our marketing approval is limited to the pediatric market, while the CE Mark approval, which covers the European Union (EU) and other countries, as well as other foreign approvals subsequently obtained, apply broadly to both the adult and pediatric market segments.   In 2010, we generated $344,000 in product sales from REPEL-CV, compared to $360,000 in the prior year.    Pathfinder is a regenerative medicine company seeking to develop novel cell-based therapies for the treatment of a broad range of diseases and medical conditions characterized by organ-specific cell damage.  Based on preclinical data obtained to date, Pathfinder has identified diabetes, renal disease and myocardial infarction as potential indications for therapies based on its technology.  Other potential indications could include kidney transplantation, chronic heart disease, peripheral artery disease, stroke, osteoarthritis and liver disease. Pathfinder commenced operations in November 2008.  Since commencing operations, Pathfinder’s development activities have been limited to laboratory and preclinical testing. Pathfinder’s development plan calls for conducting additional preclinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to indentified and other potential indications, with the goal of commencing a Phase I clinical study for a lead indication by the end of 2012 or early 2013.    If the proposed merger with Pathfinder is completed, the merged company will be focused primarily on the development and commercialization of Pathfinder’s technology, and our company’s management and board of directors will be comprised of individuals designated by Pathfinder. The strategy includes continuing to seek a sale, licensing transaction or other strategic transaction for the assets of SyntheMed and maintaining SyntheMed’s business on a limited basis without significant development or investment inSyntheMed’s assets pending any such transaction.  If, for any reason, the merger with Pathfinder is not completed, our board of directors may elect to, among other things, attempt to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets, attempt to complete another strategic transaction like the proposed Pathfinder merger or continue to operate SyntheMed’s business. Given our lack of cash resources and our deteriorating financial condition, it is unlikely we will be able to pursue or complete any of these transactions in a timely fashion and we will likely be forced to file for bankruptcy, cease operations or liquidate and dissolve.            20                The merger agreement with Pathfinder follows a lengthy effort by our company, together with an investment bank, to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of assets.  As previously reported, that effort began after we obtained direction from the US Food and Drug Administration regarding the scope and parameters of the clinical studies the FDA would require to approve an expanded indication for use of REPEL-CV® Bioresorbable Adhesion Barrier to include adults and after it became clear that we would have insufficient capital to fund such studies.  Pending consummation of the proposed merger our Board of Directors, through a special committee comprised of disinterested directors, will consider alternative third party proposals consistent with its fiduciary duties and desire to maximize shareholder value.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating the proposed merger with Pathfinder or any other alternative transaction.    In September 2010, in anticipation of entering into a definitive merger agreement, we entered into the Credit  Agreement with Pathfinder  pursuant to which Pathfinder has been funding shortfalls in our operating requirements.  As of March 3, 2011, we had borrowed approximately $629,000 principal amount from Pathfinder under the Credit  Agreement.     We have been forced to reduce expenditures due to lack of cash resources.  Effective November 30, 2010, we entered into agreements terminating the employment of Mr. Robert Hickey, our then President, CEO and CFO, and Dr. Eli Pines, our then Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer. While the termination arrangements contemplated that these individuals would continue through January 31, 2011 or earlier completion of the Pathfinder merger in the same capacity as part-time consultants, they have each elected to terminate their relationship with our company effective early January 2011.  As a result of the departure of these two individuals, our sole executive officer is our Executive Chairman, Dr. Richard Franklin.  Dr. Franklin is also President and CEO and sole manager of Pathfinder and he and one of our other directors are co-founders of Pathfinder.  Our lack of cash resources has also forced us to eliminate our US sales personnel and suspend substantially all of our research and development programs.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to uncollectible receivables, inventory valuation allowance, stock-based compensation and income taxes.  We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies can be found in Note B in the Notes to the Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.     Newly Adopted Accounting Pronouncements    In February 2010, FASB issued ASU 2010-09 Subsequent Event (Topic 855) Amendments to Certain Recognition and Disclosure Requirements. ASU 2010-09 removes the requirement for an SEC filer to disclose a date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in both issued and revised financial statements.  Revised financial statements include financial statements revised as a result of either correction of an error or retrospective application of GAAP. All of the amendments in ASU 2010-09 are effective upon issuance of the final ASU, except for the use of the issued date for conduit debt obligors. That amendment is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2010. The Company adopted ASU 2010-09 in February 2010 and did not disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated.    In June 2009, the FASB has issued FASB ASC 810-10 (previously known as SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No 46(R)) which amends certain requirements to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements. The adoption of FASB ASC 810-10 effective January 1, 2010 did not have any impact on the Company’s financial statements.               21                Recent Accounting Pronouncements    In October 2009, the FASB issued new guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables, which is effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010, although early adoption is permitted. This guidance eliminates the residual method under the current guidance and replaces it with the “relative selling price” method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement. The selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price, if it exists, otherwise third-party evidence of selling price shall be used. If neither exists for a deliverable, the vendor shall use its best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable. After adoption, this guidance will also require expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures. The Company does not currently enter into multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and, as a result, does not anticipate any impact, upon adoption of the statement, on its financial statements.    In April 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-017, Revenue Recognition – Milestone Method, (“ASU 2010-017”). ASU 2010-017 provides guidance in applying the milestone method of revenue recognition to research or development arrangements. Under this guidance management may recognize revenue contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety, in the period in which the milestone is achieved, only if the milestone meets all the criteria within the guidance to be considered substantive. This ASU is effective on a prospective basis for research and development milestones achieved in fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. We do not expect adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.    Results of Operations      Revenues were $344,000 for 2010, compared to $360,000 for 2009, a decrease of 4.7% or $16,000.  Revenue is attributable to product sales of REPEL-CV in the United States, European Union and other international markets.  The decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to the elimination of our US sales personnel and reduced orders from international distributors.  Of 2010 revenue, approximately 52% was attributable to customers in the United States.  For more detail on geographic breakdown, see Note O of Notes to Financial Statements.     Cost of goods sold was $92,000 for 2010, compared to $164,000 for 2009, a decrease of 43.9% or $72,000. The decrease is mainly attributable to decreased current year sales combined with lower current year inventory production costs offset by an increase in the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory of $18,000 as compared to charges in the prior year period of $90,000 for failed inventory production runs in addition to the costs associated with higher prior year sales, offset by reductions to the reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory of $15,000 in 2009. Cost of goods sold reflects costs to process and package REPEL-CV into saleable form. (See Note B [4] and Note L of Notes to Financial Statements)     Research and development expenses totaled $728,000 for 2010, compared to $1,387,000 for 2009, a decrease of 47.4% or $659,000. The decrease is primarily attributable to reductions of $47,000 in compensation related expense, lower consulting expense of $69,000, lower new product development costs of $193,000 and lower  regulatory costs of $329,000.     General and administrative expenses totaled $1,436,000 for 2010, compared to $1,421,000 for 2009, an increase of 1.0% or $15,000. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in consulting expense of $69,000 and legal expense of $58,000 which were offset by reductions in depreciation expense of $36,000 and  investor relations. insurance, bad debt and compensation related expenses totaling $61,000.     Sales and marketing expenses totaled $587,000 for 2010, compared to $1,508,000 for 2009, a decrease of 61.0% or $921,000. The decrease is primarily attributable to the elimination of our US sales personnel, specifically reductions in compensation-related expenses of $496,000, consulting fees of $224,000, recruiting expenses of $46,000, travel expenses of $89,000, advertising expense of $33,000, meetings expense of $23,000 and training expenses of $34,000, partially offset by increases in royalty expense of $50,000 and sales commissions of $23,000.      Interest income totaled $2,000 for 2010, compared to $20,000 for 2009, a decrease of 88.2% or $18,000.  The decrease is primarily attributable to lower average cash balances.      We recorded an income tax benefit of $433,000 in 2010. This amount was attributable to the receipt of funds associated with the sale of certain accumulated New Jersey State tax operating losses. There was no comparable amount for 2009. (See Note H of Notes to Financial Statements)             22                We reported a net loss of $2,076,000 for 2010, compared to  $4,103,000 for 2009, a decrease of 49.4% or $2,027,000.  The decrease is attributable to the factors described above. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.    Liquidity and Capital Resources    At December 31, 2010 we had cash and cash equivalents of $10,000, compared to $963,000 at December 31, 2009.    At December 31, 2010 we had negative working capital of $977,000, compared to working capital of $816,000 at December 31, 2009.    Net cash used in operating activities during 2010 was $1,290,000, compared to $3,488,000 during 2009.  Net cash used in operating activities during 2010 was primarily attributable to a net loss of $2,076,000, a decrease of $31,000 in accounts payable, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses totaling $220,000, an increase in accrued expenses of $315,000 and the impact of $282,000 in non-cash expenses mainly comprised of stock-based compensation expense. Net cash used in operating activities during 2009 was primarily attributable to a net loss of $4,103,000, an increase of $28,000 in accounts receivable and a decrease of $144,000 in accounts payable, partially offset by decreases in inventory and prepaid expenses totaling $254,000, an increase in accrued expenses of $96,000 and the impact of $437,000 in non-cash expenses mainly comprised of stock-based compensation expense.    Net cash provided by investing activities during 2010 was $6,000 which related to proceeds from the sale of furniture and equipment. There was no comparable amount for 2009.    Net cash provided by financing activities during 2010 was $331,000, compared to $1,507,000 during 2009.  The 2010 amount was comprised of $124,000 in payments of an insurance note payable for the financing of our product liability and directors and officers insurance premiums offset by the net proceeds from a short term note payable to Pathfinder of $455,000 under the Credit Agreement; the prior year amount was comprised of $1,643,000 from the sale of common stock and warrants,  proceeds of $25,000 from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $161,000 in payments of an insurance note payable for the financing of our product liability and directors and officers insurance premiums.    On January 14, 2010, the Company received proceeds of $433,000 from the sale of certain New Jersey State tax losses.    We do not anticipate having sufficient revenue from operations to fund planned expenditures. Insufficient funds has required us to limit our operations.  We have suspended substantially all of our research and development programs and have eliminated our US-based sales personnel and terminated the employment of two of our former executive officers.   We rely on borrowings from Pathfinder under the Credit Agreement to fund shortfalls in our operating requirements. As of December 31, 2010, we had borrowed $455,000 under the Credit Agreement, and an additional $174,000 since that date and through March 3, 2011.  No assurance can be given that additional financing through the Credit Agreement or alternate financing transactions will be available as and when needed.  Subject to limited exceptions, all borrowings under the Credit Agreement are at the discretion of Pathfinder and the funding period, which is scheduled to expire on April 30, 2011, is subject to early termination at the discretion of Pathfinder.  Moreover, expenditures from proceeds of any borrowings under the Credit Agreement are generally subject to prior approval by Pathfinder.  For a detailed description of the Credit Agreement and our borrowings thereunder, see Notes F and K of Notes to Financial Statements. In the absence of additional cash infusion, we will be unable to continue as a going concern. If the financing from Pathfinder is not made available, we would not be able to pay our liabilities, may lose the rights to the intellectual property under the Yissum Agreement and will likely be forced to file for bankruptcy, cease operations or liquidate and dissolve. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains an explanatory paragraph referring to an uncertainty concerning our ability to continue as a going concern.    At December 31, 2009, we had an employment agreement with one individual that will expire in September 2011. Pursuant to this agreement, our commitment regarding cash severance benefits aggregates $33,000 at December 31, 2010. For a discussion of certain other commitments, including commitments contingent on the proposed merger with Pathfinder and/or raising additional capital, see Note J of Notes to Financial Statements.
