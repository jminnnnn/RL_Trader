Item 7.   Management's Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     The discussion and analysis of ourfinancial condition and results of operations set forth below under “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity andCapital Resources” should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.      29          We are a regenerativemedicine company seeking to develop novel cell-derived and related therapies for the treatment of a broad range of diseasesand medical conditions characterized by organ-specific cell damage.  Based on preclinical data obtained to date, we haveidentified diabetes, renal disease, myocardial infarction,  peripheral vascular disease, and other diseases as potential indicationsfor therapies based on our technology.      Our development activitieswith respect to cell-derived and related therapies have been limited to laboratory and preclinical testing. Our development plancalls for conducting additional preclinical safety and efficacy studies with respect to indentified and other potential indications.     Our cell therapybusiness represents our principal operations and we intend to devote substantially all of our efforts and resources to the developmentand commercialization of our cell therapy technology. Prior to the Merger, our business was focused on development and commercializationof REPEL-CV and other polymer based products for medical applications. We have since curtailed substantially all of the operationsof that business and do not anticipate devoting any further resources to the business.     Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates     Our discussion and analysis of our financialcondition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accountingprinciples generally accepted in the United States.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to makeestimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses, and related disclosure of contingentassets and liabilities.  On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our ability to continueas a going concern, the useful life of intangible assets, and income taxes.  We base our estimates on historical experienceand on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basisfor making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Amore detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies can be found in Note B in the Notes to the FinancialStatements included elsewhere in this report. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.      30         Results of Operations     We had no revenue for 2014, compared torevenue of $54,000 for 2013.  Revenue has been derived solely from REPEL-CV sales. As a result of limited sales and increasedoperating costs associated with REPEL-CV and our focus on cell therapy, during the second quarter of 2014 we curtailed substantiallyall of the operations of the REPEL-CV business.  As a result, we do not anticipate future revenue from REPEL-CV sales.   Wehave not generated any revenue from our cell therapy business.     We had no cost of goods sold for 2014,compared to cost of goods sold of $37,000 for 2013. Cost of goods sold reflected raw material costs and the cost of processingand packaging REPEL-CV into saleable form. The prior year also included a charge of $13,000 for an increase in the reserve forslow moving and obsolete inventory.     Researchand development expenses totaled $262,000 for 2014, compared to $585,000 for 2013, a decrease of 55.2% or $323,000. The decreaseis primarily attributable to a reduction in University of Glasgow research fees of $326,000 attributable to a cost-free extensionprovided by the University through August 2014 following expiration of our most recent annual funding commitment in March 2014,decreases in spending on pre-clinical animal models of $57,000, and decreased expenses incurred for the legacy SyntheMed businessof $13,000, offset by an increase in consulting fees of $44,000 and   anincrease in spending on pre-GMP services for cell development and production for use in pre-clinical animal models of $30,000.     General and administrative expenses totaled$850,000 for 2014, compared to $1,008,000 for 2013, a decrease of 15.7% or $158,000. The decrease is primarily attributable todecreases in professional fees of $142,000, consulting fees of $28,000, decreased expenses incurred for the legacy SyntheMed businessof $14,000, offset by increases in board meeting expenses of $12,000 and insurance expense of $16,000.     We incurred sales and marketing expensesof $7,000 for 2014, compared to $23,000 for 2013, a decrease of 69.6% or $16,000.  The Company’s sales and marketingexpenses are primarily related to the sale of REPEL-CV.     We recorded an impairment charge of $161,000in 2013. The charge was attributable to the termination of the MGH license agreement the second quarter of 2013. An impairmentanalysis was performed and a determination made to record an impairment charge for the net amount of the recorded asset. Therewere no comparable amounts for 2014.     Net interest expense totaled $275,000for 2014 compared to $195,000 for 2013, an increase of 41% or $80,000. The increase is primarily attributable to interest chargesrelated to increased balances of short term convertible notes payable.     We realized otherincome from the reversal of a liability of $250,000 in 2013. This liability was attributable to a long term payable for our estimatedlicensing fee obligations under the MGH license agreement. The reversal was recorded as a result of the MGH license agreementtermination. There were no comparable amounts for 2014.      31         We incurred a net loss of $1,394,000 for2014, compared to $1,705,000 for 2013, a decrease of 18.2% or $311,000.  The decrease is attributable to the factorsdescribed above. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future.     Liquidity and Capital Resources     At December 31, 2014 we had cash and cashequivalents of $26,000, compared to $44,000 at December 31, 2013.     At December 31, 2014 we had negative workingcapital of $5,976,000, compared to negative working capital of $4,587,000 at December 31, 2013.     Net cash used in operating activitieswas $963,000 for 2014, compared to $1,601,000 for 2013.  Net cash used in operating activities for 2014 was primarilycomprised of a net loss of $1,394,000, offset by decreases in prepaid expenses of $77,000 and increases in accounts payable andaccrued expenses totaling $349,000. Net cash used in operating activities for the prior year was primarily comprised of a net lossof $1,705,000, combined with a decrease in accrued expenses of $103,000 and the impact of $73,000 in non-cash charges mainly comprisedof the reversal of a $250,000 liability attributable to a long term payable for our estimated licensing fee obligations under theMGH license agreement which terminated upon cancellation of the of the MGH license agreement, offset by $161,000 of impairmentlosses attributable to the impairment of the MGH license. These amounts were offset by decreases in accounts receivable, inventoryand prepaid expenses totaling $163,000 and an increase in accounts payable of $114,000.      Net cash provided by financing activitiesfor 2014 was $945,000, compared to $1,636,000 for 2013.  The 2014 amount is comprised of $1,005,000 of proceeds fromshort term notes payable, offset by $60,000 in payments of insurance notes payable for the financing of our directors’ andofficers’ insurance premiums. The 2013 amount is comprised of $1,735,000 of proceeds from short term notes payable, offsetby $99,000 in payments of insurance notes payable for the financing of our product liability insurance premiums and our directors’and officers’ insurance premiums.      32          At the time of theMerger in September 2011, we raised $4,146,000 in equity capital, $1,375,000 of which was paid in cash and the balance by conversionof debt. Since February 2012, we have borrowed from existing investors an aggregate principal amount of $4,705,000, much of whichhas been provided on a monthly, as needed basis by our principal stockholder and all of which remained outstanding as of December31, 2014. An additional $185,000 has been borrowed in 2015 through March 27th. The borrowings are evidenced by promissory notesbearing interest at 6% per annum.  Principal and interest are due and payable on the first anniversary of issuance. Noneof the holders whose notes have matured, aggregating $3,700,000 in principal amount as of December 31, 2014, has requested payment.The holders may elect to convert the principal amount of the promissory notes, and/or accrued interest thereon, into shares ofour common stock at $.05 per share, reflecting the price paid in the capital raise at the time of the Merger, at any time priorto completion or termination of that capital raise.     The cash balanceas of December 31, 2014 and the subsequent borrowings through March 27, 2015 are not sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirementsthrough December 31, 2015, which include an estimated $1 million for research and development and other expenditures.  Weneed to raise additional funds to support our planned operations.  If we are unable to obtain adequate financing ona timely basis, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our planned development programsand otherwise limit or cease our operations.     The lack of profitable operations and the need to continue to raise funds raise substantialdoubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The report of the independent registered public accountingfirm relating to our 2014 audited financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph referring to an uncertainty that raisesdoubt about the our ability to continue as a going concern.     At December 31, 2014, we had an employmentagreement with one individual that is scheduled to expire in September 2015, subject to automatic renewal for one-year periods.Pursuant to this agreement, in case of early termination under certain circumstances, our commitment regarding cash severance benefitsaggregates $29,000 at December 31, 2014.
