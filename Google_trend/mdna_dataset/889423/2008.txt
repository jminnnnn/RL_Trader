Although we believe that these forward-looking statements reasonably reflect our plans, intentions and expectations, our actual results could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements under the heading "Risk Factors" under Item 1A above that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report speak only as of the date of this report. Subsequent events or circumstances occurring after such date may render these statements incomplete or out of date. We undertake no obligation and expressly disclaim any duty to update such statements.     Recent Developments             On October 19, 2007, we entered into an Offer to Sell Notes with all of the holders of our then outstanding senior secured convertible notes (the "Convertible Notes"). Under the terms of the offer, at anytime prior to November 9, 2007, we had the right to purchase the Convertible Notes for an amount equal to 120% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. In exchange for the holders' agreement to keep the offer open until November 9, 2007, we issued an aggregate of 749,999 shares of our common stock to the holders. We recorded a charge to operations of approximately $0.9 million in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007 related to such issuance.             On October 19, 2007, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with Rockport Capital Partners II, L.P. and NGP Energy Technology Partners, L.P. (the "Investors") to lend us up to $10.0 million to provide funds to repurchase the Convertible Notes, among other things. Pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, on November 7, 2007, the Investors purchased from us promissory notes (the "New Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million. The New Notes bore interest at 17% per annum. All unpaid principal, together with accrued but unpaid interest, was due and payable in full on February 19, 2008, unless prepaid earlier. The New Notes were paid off in full on December 20, 2007.             On November 7, 2007, we used approximately $8.5 million of the proceeds from the sale of the New Notes to retire the Convertible Notes, which represented 120% of the then outstanding amount due under the Convertible Notes. We recorded a charge to operations in the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2007 of approximately $1.4 million, which represents the 20% prepayment penalty under the Convertible Notes. Upon the retirement of the Convertible Notes, the New Notes became immediately secured by all of our assets, including our ownership interest in the capital stock of our subsidiaries.            On November 8, 2007, we entered into a Stock and Warrant Purchase agreement with the Investors. Under this purchase agreement, the Investors agreed to purchase in a private placement up to 25,000 shares of our newly created Series C convertible preferred stock (the "Series C Preferred Stock") and warrants to purchase up to 19,711,539 shares of common stock, for an aggregate gross purchase price of $25.0 million. Each share of Series C Preferred Stock initially converts into common stock at a price equal to $1.04 per share, subject to adjustment.    32                  This private placement occurred in two closings. The first closing occurred on November 8, 2007. At the first closing, we issued 10,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock at $1,000 per share for an aggregate gross purchase price of $10.0 million. These shares are currently convertible into 9,615,384 shares of common stock. We also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 15,262,072 shares of common stock. These warrants had an initial exercise price of $1.44 per share and may not be exercised until May 8, 2008. As a result of stockholder approval of the second closing and related matters on December 20, 2007, as described below, the exercise price of these warrants was reduced to $1.25 per share.            At the second closing, which occurred on December 20, 2007 following stockholder approval, we issued 15,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for an aggregate gross purchase price of $15.0 million, of which $10.0 million was paid through the cancellation of short-term notes previously issued to the Investors on November 7, 2007. These shares are currently convertible into 14,423,076 shares of common stock. At this closing, we also issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 4,449,467 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share. These warrants are exercisable immediately.            In the purchase agreement, we also agreed to issue the Investors additional warrants in the event that the holders of certain existing warrants (none of whom are affiliated with the Investors) exercise those warrants in the future. Upon such exercises, we will issue to the Investors additional warrants to purchase common stock equal to one-half of the number of shares of common stock issued upon exercise of these existing warrants. The exercise price of these warrants will be $1.25 per share. As of February 28, 2008, if all of these existing warrants are exercised, we would need to issue warrants to purchase an additional 3,455,258 shares of common stock to the Investors.            As a result of our sale of Series C Preferred Stock and warrants, the holders of our Warrant As and Warrant Cs had a limited period of time (45 days after each issuance), at their election, to require us to redeem those warrants based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model on the date of notification. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we paid approximately $2.1 million to redeem Warrant As representing 1,242,426 shares of Common Stock and Warrant Cs representing 621,215 shares of Common Stock. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we paid approximately $0.6 million to redeem Warrant As representing 303,031 shares of Common Stock and Warrant Cs representing 151,516 shares of Common Stock. Following these redemptions, as of February 28, 2008, Warrant As representing 2,090,911 shares of Common Stock and Warrant Cs representing 1,045,456 shares of Common Stock remain outstanding. The redemption periods under the Warrant As and Warrant Cs associated with our sale of Series C Preferred Stock and related warrants have expired.            On February 26, 2008, we entered into a New Loan and Security Agreement (the "New Loan Agreement") with the Silicon Valley Bank (the "Bank"). Under the terms of the Loan Agreement, the Bank agreed to provide us with a credit line up to $10.0 million. The New Loan Agreement is secured by most of our assets and advances under the Loan Agreement are limited to 80% of eligible receivables and the lesser of 25% of the value of our eligible inventory, as defined, or $1.0 million. Interest on outstanding borrowings accrues at a rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate plus the Prime Rate Margin, as defined, or the LIBOR Rate plus the LIBOR Rate Margin, as defined. The New Loan Agreement contains certain financial covenants relating to tangible net worth, as defined, which we must satisfy in order to borrow under the agreement. In addition we agreed to pay to the Bank a collateral monitoring fee of $750 per month and agreed to the following additional terms: (i) $50,000 commitment fee, $25,000 to be paid at signing of the New Loan Agreement and $25,000 to be paid on the one year anniversary of the New Loan Agreement; (ii) an unused line fee in the amount of 0.5% per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line; and (iii) an early termination fee of 0.5% of the total credit line if we terminates the New Loan Agreement prior to 12 months from the New Loan Agreement's effective date. The New Loan Agreement, if not terminated sooner in accordance with its terms, expires on February 25, 2010.    33          Overview             We design and manufacture enabling technologies and products for electrical power conversion and control for high-performance, high-efficiency applications in large, growth markets such as alternative energy, hybrid electric vehicles, distributed power generation, power quality, semiconductor fabrication capital equipment, industrial motors and drives, and high reliability defense electronics.    Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates             Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, receivable reserves, inventory reserves, goodwill and intangible assets, contract losses and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates were discussed with our Audit Committee.             The significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:    Revenue Recognition             We recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition . Product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable. Title to the product passes upon shipment of the product, as the products are typically shipped FOB shipping point, except for certain foreign shipments. If the product requires installation to be performed by us, all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation. If the product requires specific customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse, unless we can objectively and reliably demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied. When appropriate, we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized. If a contract involves the provisions of multiple elements and the elements qualify for separation under EITF 00-21  Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables , total estimated contact revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element provided. The amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future. Revenue is recognized on each element as described above.            We perform funded research and development and product development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and, in some situations, the payment of a fee. These contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how costs compare with a budget. On fixed-price contracts, revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. Revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed. In each type of contract, we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon    34           reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts. All payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Adjustments are recognized in the period made. The Defense Contract Audit Agency has agreed-upon the final indirect cost rates for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. When the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for product development contracts indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, we have accrued approximately $1.3 million and $0, respectively, for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts.            Cost of product revenue includes material, labor and overhead. Costs incurred in connection with funded research and development and other revenue arrangements are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses.            Deferred revenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed, product shipped or installation completed.            Unbilled contract costs and fees represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed due to contractual provisions or deferred costs that have not yet been recognized as revenue or billed to the customer.    Accounts Receivable             Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to be adequate, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.    Inventory             We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and/or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, as well as based on historical usage. Due to the custom and specific nature of certain of our products, demand and usage for products and materials can fluctuate significantly. A significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short-term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development, and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.     Goodwill and Intangible Assets             Purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed. We have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. Values were assigned to goodwill and intangible assets based on third-party independent valuations, as well as management's forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenue and cash flows generated from the acquired assets.            We have adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . This statement affects our treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The statement requires    35           impairment tests be periodically repeated and on an interim basis, if certain conditions exist, with impaired assets written down to fair value. Additionally, existing goodwill and intangible assets must be assessed and classified within the statement's criteria. Intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over those periods. Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminable lives ceased.            We determine the fair value of each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow income approach. The income approach indicates the fair value of a business enterprise based on the discounted value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future. This analysis is largely based upon projections prepared by us and data from sources of publicly available information available at the time of preparation. These projections are based on management's best estimate of future results. In making these projections, we consider the markets we are addressing, the competitive environment and our advantages. There will usually be differences between estimated and actual results as events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and those differences may be material. In addition, we perform a macro assessment of the overall likelihood that we would achieve the projected cash flows and performed sensitivity analysis using historical data as the basis for projected cash flows.    Long-Lived Assets             We have adopted SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets , which supersedes SFAS No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of , and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The statement requires that long-lived assets be reviewed for possible impairment, if certain conditions exist, with impaired assets written down to fair value.            We determine the fair value of certain of the long-lived assets based on a discounted cash flow income approach. The income approach indicates the fair value of a long-lived assets based on the discounted value of the cash flows that the long-lived asset can be expected to generate in the future over the life of the long-lived asset. This analysis is based upon projections prepared by us. These projections represent management's best estimate of future results. In making these projections, we consider the markets we are addressing, the competitive environment and our advantages. There will usually be differences between estimated and actual results as events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and those differences may be material. In addition, we perform a macro assessment of the overall likelihood that we would achieve the projected cash flows and performed sensitivity analysis using historical data as the basis for projected cash flows.    Convertible Debt Instruments and Warrant Liabilities             We accounted for our senior secured convertible notes (the "Convertible Notes"), which were paid off on November 7, 2007, and associated warrants in accordance with SFAS No. 133,  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.  The Convertible Notes included features that qualify as embedded derivatives, such as (i) the holders' conversion option, (ii) our option to settle the Convertible Notes at the scheduled dates in cash or shares of our common stock and (iii) premiums and penalties we would be liable to pay in the event of default. As permitted under SFAS 155, we irrevocably elected, as of January 1, 2007, to measure the Convertible Notes in their entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either gain or loss. Subsequent to the pay-off of the Convertible Notes, we will continue to account for the associated warrants as described above.            We recorded interest expense under the Convertible Notes based on the greater of (i) 7% or (ii) the six-month LIBOR, in effect at the time plus 350 basis points, as well as the amortization of the debt discount, which we computed using the effective interest method. The debt discount represents the    36           difference between our gross proceeds of $12.0 million and the fair value of the convertible debt upon issuance, after separately valuing the investor warrants, the placement agent warrants and the Convertible Notes on a relative fair value basis. By amortizing the debt discount to interest expense, rather than recognizing it as a change in fair value of the Convertible debt instrument and warrants, which is a separate line item in our statement of operations, we believe our interest expense line item more appropriately reflects the cost of the debt associated with our Convertible Notes.            We determined the fair values of the Convertible Notes, investor warrants and placement agent warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate. Our stock price has the most significant influence on the fair value of the Convertible Notes and related warrants. An increase in our common stock price would cause the fair values of both the Convertible Notes and warrants to increase, because the conversion and exercise prices, respectively, of such instruments are fixed at $1.65 and $1.815 per share, respectively, and result in a charge to our statement of operations. A decrease in our stock price would likewise cause the fair value of the Convertible Notes and the warrants to decrease and result in a credit to our statement of operations. If the price of our common stock were to decline significantly, however, the decrease in the fair value of the Convertible Notes would be limited by the instrument's debt characteristics. Under such circumstances, our estimated cost of capital would become another significant variable affecting the fair value of the Convertible Notes.    Income Taxes             The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those outside the United States, which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. The income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.            Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately $51.9 million and $47.4 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.     Convertible Series C Preferred Stock             We account for our Convertible Series C Preferred Stock (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), and associated warrants in accordance with in accordance with EITF 00-27,  Application of Issue No. 98-5 to Certain Convertible Instruments,  allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible Series C Preferred Stock and the warrants issued to the Investors, and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities. We determined the initial value of the Series C Preferred Stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate.            The re-pricing of the exercise price of the first tranche warrants from $1.44 to $1.25, as described above, was treated as a cancellation of the original warrants issued on November 8, 2007 and a re-issuance or new warrants on December 21, 2007. The difference in fair value of the warrant was    37           included in the allocation of net proceeds associated with the second closing of the Series C Preferred Stock on December 21, 2007. We treated this as a deemed dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2007 we recorded $11,947,881 as a deemed dividend to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, which included the beneficial conversion feature of $11,762,887 and $184,994 related to the accretion of the Series C Preferred Stock to its redemption value through the date that the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock may first exercise their redemption right. We are using the effective interest method to accrete the carrying value of the Series C Preferred stock through November 8, 2011, at which time the value of the Series C Preferred Stock would be $30.0 million, 120% of its face value.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             See Note F of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.    Results of Operations        Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2007 ("2007") Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006 ("2006").               Product Revenue.     Product revenue increased by $18.8 million, or 65%, from $28.8 million in 2006 to $47.6 million in 2007. Product revenue by segment for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 is as follows:             December 31,                         Year Ended       Division       2007     2006     $ Change     % Change             (in thousands)         Power Systems, US     $  4,962     $  4,361     $  601     14  %    Power Systems, Canada        33,033        14,164        18,869     133  %    Electronics        9,582        10,241        (659  )  -6  %                            Total product revenue     $  47,577     $  28,766     $  18,810     65  %                                       The increase of $18.8 million in revenue in 2007 in the Power Systems, Canada division, as compared to 2006, was largely due to an increase in Solar Inverter line revenue of $12.4 million, an increase in Industrial Power Supply revenue of $4.8 million, an increase in Frequency Converter line revenue of approximately $0.8 million, an increase in Fuel Cell Inverter product line revenue of approximately $0.4 million, an increase in Plasma product line revenue of approximately $0.3 million and an increase in other product revenue of approximately $0.8 million.            Power Systems, US, which currently focuses on Motors and Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) components, saw revenues increase from approximately $4.4 million in 2006 to approximately $5.0 million in 2007. The increase in product revenue related to our Power Systems, US product lines was mainly due to an increase in HEV product line revenue of approximately $0.9 million, an increase in Motor product line revenue of approximately $0.2 million and an increase in other revenue of approximately $0.1 million. These increases were offset by an overall decrease in our legacy product line revenue, which include our Test and Measurement and MagLev product line, of approximately $0.5 million.             Revenues in the Electronics division decreased approximately $0.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales to government customers of approximately $1.0 million offset by an overall increase in sales to commercial non-government customers of approximately $0.3 million.            Funded research and development and other revenue.     Funded research and development and other revenue increased $4.0 million, or 80%, from $5.0 million in 2006 to $9.0 million in 2007. The increase in revenue is due to the delivery of two Stationary Rotary UPS ride through units which accounted for approximately $3.0 million of the increase and an overall increase in revenue from our government contracts of $1.0 million.    38        NAME="page_dm44801_1_39">                         Cost of product revenue.     Cost of product revenue increased $17.1 million, or 61%, from $27.8 million in 2006 to $44.9 million in 2007. Cost of product revenue by division is broken out below.             Year Ended             December 31,                   Division             % Change          2007     2006     $ Change             (in thousands)         Power Systems, US     $  4,113     $  5,765     $  (1,652  )  (29  )%    Power Systems, Canada        33,074        13,545        19,529     144  %    Electronics        7,689        8,514        (825  )  (10  )%                            Total cost of product revenue     $  44,876     $  27,823     $  17,052     61  %                                       The increase was primarily attributable the mix of products sold during 2007 and higher revenues compared to 2006 in our Power Systems, Canada and US divisions. This increase was offset, in part, by a decrease in overhead costs during the period in our Power Systems, US division and, in part, by a decrease in the cost of product revenue due to a decrease in revenue and lower material and overhead costs during the period in our Electronics division. In our Power Systems, US division, a majority of the costs associated with a three phase StareSine unit, for which revenue was recognized in 2007 had been written-down in prior periods resulting in the better than planned margins in our Power Systems, US division. In our Power Systems, Canada division, the increase in costs is mainly due to the 133% increase in revenues from 2006 to 2007, along with increased material component cost, labor costs and the effects of the increase in the Canadian dollar over the past year. In addition, the increase includes the write-off of approximately $1.3 million related to cost overruns in the production of several prototype units for the Navy, for which we are seeking some economic relief due to design changes, increases in major component costs and increases in anticipated exchange rates; we have not booked any benefit for such relief as of December 31, 2007.             Gross Margin.     Gross margins on product revenue improved from 3% in 2006 to approximately 6% in 2007. Gross margin by division is broken out below.             Twelve Months Ended  December 31,       Division            2007     2006       Power Systems, US     17  %  (32  )%    Power Systems, Canada     0  %  4  %    Electronics     20  %  17  %                    Total gross margin %     6  %  3  %                               In our Power Systems, US division, the increase in gross margin by 49% is a direct result of the reduced costs of the three phase StarSine unit recognized during 2007 and the results of restructuring and streamlining the operating facility in 2006. Our Power Systems, Canada division had a decrease in gross margin of 4% partially due increased materials costs, increased overtime, for which a premium is paid, the effect of the increase of the Canadian dollar over the past year and a one-time charge related to prototype costs that were in excess of the realizable amount of approximately $1.3 million in 2007. The increase in gross margin of 3% in our Electronics division is primarily due to mix of products sold resulting in lower material costs.             Funded research and development and other revenue expenses.     Funded research and development and other revenue expenses increased by approximately $2.7 million, or 68%, from $4.0 million in 2006 to $6.7 million in 2007. The gross margin on funded research and other revenue increased from 19% in 2006 to 25% in 2007. This increase is a due to the sale of two Stationary Ride Through UPS systems    39           during 2007, which have better margins than our traditional engineering services and continued increased efficiency in our engineering labor pool.             Unfunded research and development expenses.     We expended approximately $3.2 million on unfunded research and development in 2007 compared with approximately $2.0 million spent in 2006. The spending in 2007 and 2006 was related primarily to unfunded engineering in our Electronics and Power Systems US and Canada divisions for the development of new products and technologies.            Selling, general and administrative expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $0.6 million, or 5.0%, from $13.0 million in 2006 to $12.4 million in 2007. Approximately $0.3 million of the decrease is directly attributable to compensation costs related to the issuance of stock options to our employees and directors charged to operations during 2007 and 2006 pursuant to SFAS 123(R). Approximately $0.9 million of the decrease was associated with reduced corporate costs and approximately $1.2 million of the decrease was due to the restructuring of our Power Systems, US division at the end of 2006, offset by higher sales and marketing and general and administrative costs in our Power Systems, Canada division in 2007 of $1.1 million and our Applied Technology Division of approximately $0.3 million.            Amortization of intangibles.     Amortization of intangibles decreased approximately $0.1 million due to some items becoming fully amortized during 2007.            Gain on sale of assets.     In 2006, we received approximately $0.4 million related to our 2004 sale of our SPLC technology. There are no further amounts due related to this sale.            Restructuring costs.     During 2006 we commenced a restructuring plan designed to streamline our manufacturing and production base, improve efficiency and enhance our competitiveness and recorded a restructuring charge of approximately $1.6 million. These charges are comprised employee severance and benefits costs and the write-down in carrying value of assets along with the settlement of the Worcester facility lease. (See Note T. Restructuring Costs). The total pre-tax charges included employee severance and benefits costs of approximately $0.2 million, the write down in carrying value of assets (of which approximately $0.2 million were recorded in the period ended December 31, 2006) and facility exit costs of approximately $1.1 million, for which we issued 850,000 shares of common stock to the landlord on January 3, 2007 as consideration for the early termination of the lease. We incurred approximately $0.1 million in additional costs associated with our restructuring in 2007.            Change in fair value of the Convertible Notes and related warrants.     There was an increase in the fair value related to the Convertible Notes and related warrants during 2007, resulting in an expense of approximately $2.3 million. One factor that contributes to the change in fair value of the Convertible Notes and related warrants is our stock price. The Convertible Notes were paid off in November 2007. (See Note G Convertible Debt Instrument and Warrant Liabilities )            Other Income (expense).     Other expense was approximately $1.0 million for 2007 compared to other income of approximately $0.1 million for 2006. Other expense for 2007 consists primarily of consulting services related to the valuation of our Convertible Note financing transaction as well as other expenses not related to ongoing operations offset by approximately $0.1 million in foreign exchange gains from Power Systems Canada related to inter-company balances. Other income for 2006 consists primarily of payments received for miscellaneous items sold during the period that had previously been charged off in prior periods.            Interest income.     Interest income decreased slightly from approximately $0.4 million in 2006 to approximately $0.3 million in 2007. The decrease is directly attributable to our cash on hand.    40                  Interest expense.     Interest expense for 2007 was approximately $3.8 million, which is comprised primarily of the following:       $0.7 million in non-cash interest related to the Convertible Notes, which was paid in shares of common stock,  $0.1 million in cash interest paid related to the Convertible Notes,  $0.2 million paid related to the New Notes, which were repaid in full on December 20, 2007,  $2.1 million in amortization of the debt discount related to the valuation of the Convertible Notes,  $0.3 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which we paid in shares of common stock, and  $0.5 million related to the change in the Series B Preferred Stock conversion price as a result of subsequent issuances of equity-based securities due to its anti-dilution provision.             In 2006 interest expense was approximately $1.4 million and was comprised of the following:       Approximately $0.5 million in interest related to the Convertible Notes, which was paid in shares of common stock,  $0.5 million in amortization of the debt discount related to the valuation of the Convertible Notes,  $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which were paid in shares of common stock,  approximately $0.1 million related to change in the Series B Preferred Stock conversion price as a result of the Convertible Note financing transaction due to its anti-dilution provisions, and  $0.1 million in interest charges related to our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, which was terminated on July 19, 2006.             Deferred Revenue.     Deferred revenue was $8.1 million at December 31, 2007, an increase of $2.3 million from the $5.8 million balance at December 31, 2006. During 2007 we recognized previously deferred revenue in our Applied Technology division of approximately $1.2 million and approximately $5.3 million related to the sale of an industrial power supply in our Power Systems, Canada division. We record deferred revenue (i) when a customer pays in advance or (ii) when provisions for revenue recognition on items shipped have not been achieved or the items have not yet been received by the customer due to shipping terms such as FOB destination. Currently deferred revenue is composed of approximately $2.6 million Rotary UPS units that have been shipped to the customer site and are awaiting customer installation and final on-site acceptance testing, which is scheduled to occur in the later stages of 2008, $1.7 million in our Applied Technology division related to the second stage of a Flywheel Generation Set order for which the customer has paid a significant portion of the sales price in advance of delivery, which is expected to occur in the beginning of 2008, and approximately $3.4 million in our Power Systems, Canada division related to pre-payments received on orders currently being manufactured.    41        NAME="page_do44801_1_42">                   Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)             The following table presents unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2007.

In the long run, we expect to fund our working capital needs and other commitments primarily through our operating cash flow, which we expect to improve as we improve our operating margins and grow our business. We also expect to rely on our credit facility to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments.            Our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted if we fail to realize our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses or if we fail to remain in compliance with the covenants of our bank line. If either of those events occur, we may need to raise additional funds in order to sustain operations by selling equity or taking other actions to conserve our cash position, which could include selling of certain assets, delaying capital expenditures and incurring additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions in the preferred stock financing with the investors and in the new credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. Such actions would likely require the consent of the Investors and/or Silicon Valley Bank, and there can be no assurance that such consents would be given. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds if they are required.            If additional funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders will experience additional dilution. The terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility. There can be no assurance that additional financing of any kind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially, adversely affect our results of operations.            As a result of the preferred stock financing, the holders of certain outstanding warrants had the right for a limited period of time (45 days after each closing) to seek redemption of those warrants at their Black-Scholes value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, we paid approximately $2.1 million to redeem Warrant As representing 1,242,426 shares of common stock and Warrant Cs representing 621,215 shares of common stock. During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, we paid approximately $0.6 million to redeem Warrant As representing 303,031 shares of common stock and Warrant Cs representing 151,516 shares of common stock. Following these redemptions, as of February 28, 2008, Warrant As representing 2,090,911 shares of common stock and Warrant Cs representing 1,045,456 shares of common stock remain outstanding. The redemption periods under these warrants associated with our preferred stock financing have expired. If these redemption rights are triggered again in the future as a result of subsequent equity issuances below $1.65 per share, our liquidity position would be adversely impacted.            We have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products. These costs have exceeded total revenue. As a result, we have incurred losses in each of the past five years. As of December 31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $176.8 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through the sale of private equity securities and convertible debt, public security offerings, borrowings under our previous line of credit and capital equipment leases.            As of December 31, 2007, our cash and cash equivalents were $12.7 million, including restricted cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million; this represents increase in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately $4.4 million from the $8.3 million on hand at December 31, 2006. Cash used in    43           operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $10.3 million as compared to $9.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily attributable to the net loss of approximately $17.8 million offset by non-cash items such as the change in the fair value of the Convertible Notes and placement agent fees, depreciation and amortization, deferred revenue, increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory, non-cash compensation and consulting expense, non-cash interest expense and decreases in working capital.             Cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2007 was $1.3 million as compared to $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, was a result of capital expenditures during each of the respective periods. In addition, during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 we recorded approximately $0.4 million related to the sale of our SPLC technology.            Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $17.9 million as compared to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2007 includes net proceeds from the sale of Series C Preferred Stock of approximately $23.9 million, approximately $4.7 million in net proceeds related to cash received upon the exercise of the Warrant Bs in July 2007 and $1.0 million decrease in restricted cash, offset by approximately $9.5 million related to monthly principal payments and final settlement of our Convertible Notes and approximately $2.1 million related to payments to certain Warrant A and Warrant C holders that exercised their redemption rights under these warrants. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2006 includes $11.0 million of net proceeds from the Convertible Note private placement, $1.0 million designated as restricted cash, and approximately $0.3 million received from the exercise of incentive stock options and warrants to purchase common stock, offset in part by approximately $0.2 million related to payments on our capital lease obligations and $2.0 million related to payments on our bank line of credit.    Payments Due Under Contractual Obligations             The following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods:       Calendar Years Ending December 31,       Capital Leases     Operating Leases    2008     $       $  1,442,770    2009             $  1,058,346    2010             $  523,797    2011             $  159,408    2012                    Thereafter                                 Total     $       $  3,184,321                            We lease equipment and office space under non-cancelable capital and operating leases. The future minimum rental payments, as of December 31, 2007, under the capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms are included in the table above.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements             We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are    44           not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources.     Effects of Inflation             We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations.
