Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND                RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information             This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statement by our use of the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "may," "will," "intends," "estimates," and similar expressions, whether in the negative or in the affirmative. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements reasonably reflect our plans, intentions and expectations, our actual results could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. These factors also include, without limitation, those set forth in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K, which are expressly incorporated by reference herein. We do not intend to update information contained in any forward-looking statements we make.    Recent Developments             We need an immediate infusion of equity capital to sustain our operations. We anticipate that our existing cash and cash resources will enable us to fund our operations through only approximately January 15, 2003. We are operating under a forbearance agreement with Silicon Valley Bank which is currently enabling us to borrow minimal levels of working capital from Silicon Valley Bank. On December 13, 2002, we executed a term sheet with an institutional investor to raise between $5 and $7 million of equity capital. The term sheet contemplates that $3 to $5 million of the equity investment will be funded during the week of January 6, 2003 and the remaining $2 million will be funded promptly after the registration statement we are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission is declared effective registering all of the underlying equity securities in this financing.            If Silicon Valley Bank decides to discontinue lending to us or we are unable to close an equity financing with the institutional investor or other investors prior to January 15, 2003, we will be forced to furlough or permanently lay off a significant portion of our work force. This will have a material adverse effect on us. Under these circumstances, we may not be able to continue our operations. Further, without additional cash resources, we may not be able to keep all or a significant portion of our operations going for a sufficient period of time to enable us to sell all or portions of our assets or operations at other than distressed sale prices. Even if we are able to consummate the financing with the institutional investor prior to January 15, 2003 and retain a credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, we may still require additional cash resources in the future to fund our anticipated operating losses, to grow, to develop new or enhance existing products and services and to respond to competitive pressures. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources" below.            Under the proposed terms of the term sheet with the institutional investor, we would issue shares of convertible preferred stock for $15,000 per share and warrants to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock for each share of convertible preferred stock issued. The preferred stock will be convertible into a number of shares of common stock equal to 15,000 divided by the conversion price of the stock (which will initially be $1.50). The convertible preferred stock will accrue dividends of 8% per annum, increasing to 12% on January 1, 2004. Under the proposed terms of the term sheet with the institutional investor, we may opt to pay the dividends in cash or in kind. Nevertheless, our current credit facility prohibits, and future credit facilities will likely prohibit, the payment of any cash dividend. The dividend for the first year will be paid at the closing in shares of common stock, valued based on the conversion price of the preferred stock, and thereafter will be paid on a quarterly basis. The warrants will be exercisable for a five-year term and will have an exercise price of $2.00 per share.    24                 As mentioned above, the term sheet with the institutional investor contemplates that we will issue between $3 million and $5 million of the convertible preferred stock at a first closing during the week of January 6, 2003. The remaining $2 million will be funded promptly after the registration statement we are required to file to register the common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible preferred stock and exercise of the warrants is declared effective. We are required to file the registration statement within 30 days after the first closing and use our best efforts to have the registration statement declared effective within 90 days after the first closing. If the registration statement is not declared effective within 120 days of the first closing, we will be obligated to pay to the investors liquidated damages equal to 1.5% of the amount invested for each 30-day period, beginning 90 days after the first closing, that the registration statement is not effective.            If we issue shares of common stock at a purchase price below the conversion price of the convertible preferred stock or the exercise price of the warrants, the conversion price and the exercise price, as applicable, will be adjusted on a weighted average basis.            If we consummate any private equity or equity-linked financing within 12 months after the first closing, the investors in our convertible preferred stock will have a right of first offer to purchase all or part of that financing. In addition, if we enter into a private equity or equity-linked financing within 24 months after the first closing, the investors will have the rights to exchange their shares of convertible preferred stock at the stated value of the securities issued in that financing.            To date, the documentation relating to the financing with the institutional investor has been produced by counsel to the institutional investor but has not been finalized. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to secure financing with the institutional investor on these or any other terms, or that we will be able to successfully close this financing and raise the $5 million to $7 million contemplated by the term sheet.            Any securities offered to the institutional investor will not be or have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.    Overview             SatCon was organized as a Massachusetts corporation in 1985 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1992. We are developing enabling technologies for the emerging critical power marketplace where power quality and uninterruptible power are important. We design, develop and manufacture high-efficiency high power electronics and a variety of standard and custom high-performance machines for specific applications. Our critical power products convert, store and manage electricity for businesses and consumers, the U.S. Government and the military that require high-reliability electronics and controls and high-quality, uninterruptible power. We are utilizing our engineering and manufacturing expertise to develop products we believe will be integral components of distributed power generation and power quality systems. Our specialty motors are typically designed and manufactured for unique customer requirements such as high power-to-size requirements or high efficiency.            We have expanded our business and capabilities through the following acquisitions:       K&D Magmotor Corp.a manufacturer of custom and standard electric motors, acquired in January 1997.   Film Microelectronics, Inc.a manufacturer of thin film substrates and hybrid microelectronics, acquired in April 1997.   Inductive Components, Inc.a value-added supplier of customized electric motors, acquired in January 1999.    25             Lighthouse Software, Inc.a supplier of control software for machine tools, acquired in January 1999.   HyComp, Inc.a manufacturer of hybrid microelectronics, acquired in April 1999.   Ling Electronics, Inc.a manufacturer of shaker vibration test systems, power converters, amplifiers and controllers, acquired in October 1999.   Inverpower Controls Ltd.a manufacturer of power electronics modules and advanced high-speed digital controls, acquired in July 2001.             In addition, in November 1999, we acquired intellectual property, tooling and other assets from Northrop Grumman Corporation enabling us to manufacture and sell electric drivetrains and, in September 2002, we acquired certain intellectual property, equipment and other assets from Sipex Corporation to expand our high-reliability data conversion product line. See Note R to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our acquisitions.    Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates             Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, receivable reserves, inventory reserves, investment in Beacon Power Corporation, goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.     Revenue Recognition             The significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:            We recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101,  Revenue Recognition . Product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable. Title to the product generally passes upon shipment of the product, as the products are shipped FOB shipping point, except for certain foreign shipments. If the product requires installation to be performed by us, all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation. We provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized.            We perform funded research and development and product development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and, in some situations, the payment of a fee. These contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how costs compare with a budget. On fixed-price contracts, revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. Revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed. In each type of contract, we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon    26          reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts. All payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Adjustments are recognized in the period made. When the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for commercial product development contracts indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded. Any losses incurred in performing funded research and development projects are recognized as funded research and development expenses as incurred. As of September 30, 2002 and 2001, we have accrued $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, revenue from commercial contracts, which represents other revenue, is included in funded research and development and other revenue and amounted to $0.2 million and $0.7 million, respectively.            Cost of product revenue includes cost of product revenue including material, labor and overhead. Costs incurred in connection with funded research and development and other revenue arrangements and other revenue are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, costs and expenses from commercial contracts, which represents other revenue expenses, are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses and amounted to $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively.            Deferred revenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed, product shipped or installation completed.            Unbilled contract costs and fees represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed due to contractual provisions or deferred costs that have not yet been recognized as revenue or billed to the customer. These amounts included retained fee and unliquidated costs totaling $0.1 and $0.2 million at September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively.    Accounts Receivable             Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to be adequate, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.    Inventory             We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory. We periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and/or obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand, as well as based on historical usage. Due to the custom and specific nature of certain of our products, demand and usage for products and materials can fluctuate significantly. A significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short-term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development, and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.     Investment in Beacon Power Corporation             During substantially all of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, we accounted for our investment in Beacon Power Corporation under the equity method of accounting and recorded $5.1 million of losses from Beacon Power. On September 28, 2001, we distributed 5,000,000 shares of    27          Beacon Power common stock to our stockholders. Upon the distribution of the 5,000,000 shares, we recorded the distribution of the 5,000,000 shares as a reduction of additional paid-in capital based on the book value per share prior to the distribution, or $0.59 per share. After the distribution, we owned 4,705,910 shares, or approximately 11.0%, of Beacon Power's outstanding voting stock. Additionally, we have determined that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Beacon Power and, therefore, now account for our investment in Beacon Power using the fair value method as set forth in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 115,  Accounting for Certain Debt and Equity Securities.  We are no longer required to record our share of any losses from Beacon Power and the investment is carried at fair value and designated as available for sale and any unrealized holding gains or losses are to be included in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). As of September 30, 2002, the shares of Beacon Power common stock held by us had a fair value of $0.8 million and we recorded an unrealized loss of $6.4 million in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. As of September 30, 2002, the fair market value of Beacon Power's common stock was $0.17 per share. Our cost basis in our investment in Beacon Power's common stock was $0.59 per share. As of September 30, 2002, we believe the decline in market value represents an other than temporary decline because, among other things, the market value has been less than cost since March 2002 and there is some uncertainty of the financial condition and near-term prospects of Beacon Power and, accordingly, have recorded an other than temporary write-down of our investment in Beacon Power of $1.4 million. Additionally, we have a warrant to purchase 173,704 shares of Beacon Power's common stock that has an exercise price of $1.25 per share and expires in 2005. We account for this warrant in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, record the warrant at its fair value and record any changes in value in our statement of operations. As of September 30, 2002, the warrant to purchase Beacon Power common stock had a fair value of $14,365 and is included in warrants to purchase common stock on the accompanying balance sheet.    Goodwill and Intangible Assets             Purchase accounting requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets purchased and liabilities assumed. We have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. Values were assigned to goodwill and intangible assets based on third-party independent valuations, as well as management's forecasts and projections that include assumptions related to future revenue and cash flows generated from the acquired assets.            Effective October 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets . This statement affects our treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets. The statements require that goodwill existing at the date of adoption be reviewed for possible impairment and that impairment tests be periodically repeated, with impaired assets written down to fair value. Additionally, existing goodwill and intangible assets must be assessed and classified within the statement's criteria. Intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over those periods. Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminable lives will cease.            We completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test based on the amount of goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year 2002, as required by SFAS No. 142. We utilized a third party independent valuation to determine the fair value of each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow income approach. Based on the results of the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test, we have determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts and, therefore, no goodwill impairment existed as of October 1, 2001. As a result, the second step of the transitional goodwill impairment test was not required to be completed. We performed a goodwill impairment test on the amount of goodwill as of the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 2002, as required by SFAS No. 142 on an annual basis. We again utilized a third party    28          independent valuation to determine the fair value of each of the reporting units based on a discounted cash flow income approach. The income approach indicates the fair value of a business enterprise based on the discounted value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future. This analysis is based upon projections prepared by us and data from sources of publicly available information available at the time of preparation. There will usually be differences between estimated and actual results as events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and those differences may be material. Based on the results of the first step of the annual goodwill impairment test, we have determined that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts and, therefore, no goodwill impairment existed as of the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 2002. As a result, the second step of the annual goodwill impairment test was not required to be completed. We will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis.            We did not record expense related to the amortization of goodwill during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002. We recorded expense related to the amortization of goodwill of $0.6 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001. We have determined that all of our intangible assets have finite lives and, therefore, we have continued to amortize our intangible assets. We recorded expense related to the amortization of our intangible assets of $0.6 million and $0.7 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 and 2001, respectively.    Accounting for Income Taxes             The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those outside the United States, which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. The income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.            Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of $29.1 million as of September 30, 2002, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.     Results of Operations        Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2002 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2001       Product Revenue.             Product revenue remained flat at $30.8 million. Power Systems was down 1% from $20.2 million in 2001 to $19.9 million in 2002. This was offset by an increase in the Electronics Division from $10.6 million in 2001 to $10.9 million in 2002.            Within Power Systems, revenue from magnetic levitation and high performance motor products declined 35% from $7.2 million in 2001 to $4.7 million in 2002. This decrease was due in large part to the decline in revenue from magnetic levitation products due to the weak semiconductor industry. In addition, revenue from vibration test equipment ("Shaker") was down 39% from $12.2 million in 2001 to $7.5 million in 2002. This reduction in Shaker revenue was due in part to the disruption caused by the relocation of the business from Anaheim, CA to Worcester, MA during the last half of 2002. These    29          decreases were more than offset by an increase in revenue from power conversion products from $0.8 million in 2001 to $7.7 million in 2002. This increase was due largely to the fact that Inverpower was acquired in July 2001 and, as a result, represented less than three months of business in 2001. The increase in 2002 was due, in addition to having a full year of business, to the up tick in the power conversion products.            Despite the weak telecom and semiconductor industries, the Electronics Division was able to increase revenue by 3% from $10.6 million in 2001 to $10.9 million in 2002. The increase was due to an increase in revenue from the defense sector, which during 2002 represented approximately 69% of the total Electronics Division revenue. This compared with approximately 63% in 2001. In addition, on September 27, 2002, we acquired the hybrid product line from Sipex Corp. and were able to ship $0.2 million of product during 2002.    Funded research and development and other revenue.             Funded research and development and other revenue decreased by $0.1 million, or 1% from $10.9 million to $10.8 million. The largest change was the increase of $1.7 million in funded research and development revenue from a program to develop high power converter assemblies for the U.S. Navy's next generation of modern "all-electric" ships offset by decreases of $0.6 million from a Department of Energy program to develop low-cost power conversion modules for electric and hybrid-electric vehicles and $0.6 million from the U.S. Navy's electric missile air launch system program.    Cost of product revenue.             Cost of product revenue increased by $1.8 million, or 7%, from $27.8 million to $29.6 million. The increase was attributable to $3.8 million of increased cost of product revenue from Power Systems from $17.6 million to $21.4 million. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in the Electronics Division of $2.0 million from $10.1 million in 2001 to $8.1 million in 2002.             Within Power Systems, power products accounted for $6.1 million of the increase due primarily to the full year effect of the Inverpower acquisition. This increase was offset by a decrease of $2.3 million in the Shaker, magnetic levitation and high performance motors cost of product revenue, which all experienced volume reductions in 2002. Inventory obsolescence charges for Power Systems products totaled $1.9 million in 2002 compared with $0.2 million in 2001. These charges in 2002 represented $1.0 million in power conversion products, $0.6 million in Shakers and $0.3 million in other products.            The Electronics Division was able to realize a decrease in its cost of product revenue despite a 3% increase in revenue. This decrease was primarily due to lower spending resulting from its restructuring program, and, to a lesser extent, lower material costs as a percentage of revenue. Charges for inventory obsolescence were $0.4 million in each year.    Funded research and development and other revenue expenses.             Funded research and development and other revenue expenses decreased by $0.3 million, or 4%, from $7.4 million in 2001 to $7.2 million in 2002. The largest change was the increase of $1.2 million in funded research and development revenue expenses from a program to develop high power converter assemblies for the U.S. Navy's next generation of modern "all-electric" ships offset by a decrease of $0.4 million from the U.S. Navy's electric missile air launch system program. In addition, we provided an additional provision of $0.1 million for contract losses during 2002. Although revenue from the Department of Energy program to develop low-cost power conversion modules for electric and hybrid- electric vehicles decreased by $0.6 million, there was no corresponding reduction in costs as that revenue was derived from costs incurred in 2000.    30       NAME="page_dg2962_1_31">      Unfunded research and development expenses.             Unfunded research and development expenses decreased by $0.4 million, or 6%, from $6.2 million in 2001 to $5.9 million in 2002. The decrease is due to the near completion of the internally funded research and development projects including the power inverter for an on-site power generation system and our 250 kilowatt and 2.2 megawatt rotary UPS and power quality systems.    Selling, general and administrative expenses.             Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.3 million, or 17%, from $13.6 million in 2001 to $15.9 million in 2002. The increase was primarily due to the full-year inclusion of Inverpower for 2002 and to a lesser extent the increase in business development costs, primarily in the Applied Technology Division.    Write-off of public offering costs.             On April 25, 2001, we converted our registration statement initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2000 to a shelf registration statement. We expensed during 2001 $1.4 million of equity financing costs incurred in connection with this initial registration statement.    Amortization of goodwill and intangibles.             Amortization of goodwill and intangibles decreased by $774,000, or 57%, from $1.4 million in 2001 to $0.6 million in 2002. The decrease is a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , and of no longer being required to amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminable lives. During the year ended September 30, 2001, amortization of goodwill amounted to $0.6 million. In addition, during 2001 we wrote-off an impaired intangible asset with a net book value of $0.1 million and annual amortization of $0.1 million. These decreases were partially offset by the amortization of intangible assets acquired from Inverpower in July 2001.    Restructuring costs.             During April 2002, we commenced a restructuring plan designed to streamline our production base, improve efficiency and enhance our competitiveness and recorded a restructuring charge of $1.5 million. The restructuring charge includes approximately $0.6 million for severance costs associated with the reduction of approximately 60 employees, or 17% of the work force. The reductions occurred in the following business segments: Applied Technology9: Corporate2; Electronics16; and Power Systems33. On a functional basis, the reductions were: manufacturing45; research and development4; and selling, general and administrative11. As of September 30, 2002, 56 employees have been terminated and the remaining 4 are expected to be terminated by March 2003. In addition, as of September 30, 2002, $0.5 of the severance has been paid and the remaining severance will be paid by March 2003. The balance of the restructuring charge relates to the closing of the Anaheim, CA facility. These costs include approximately $0.3 million of cash charges primarily related to rent, real estate taxes and operating costs to be paid through the remainder of the lease and an estimated $0.3 million of other cash charges for restoration and clean-up. In addition, approximately $0.2 million of the restructuring charge relates to non-cash charges on assets to be disposed of. We anticipate the Anaheim, CA manufacturing facility will be closed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2003.    Net unrealized loss on warrants to purchase common stock.             Net unrealized loss on warrants to purchase common stock decreased by $1.0 million, or 65%, from $1.5 million in 2001 to $0.5 million in 2002. We account for our warrants to purchase Mechanical Technology Incorporated's common stock and to purchase Beacon Power's common stock in accordance with SFAS No. 133,    Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , and, therefore, we have    31           recorded these warrants at their fair value at September 30, 2002 and recorded and unrealized loss of $0.5 million during 2002.     Write-down of investment in Beacon Power Corporation.             Effective September 28, 2001, we account for our investment in Beacon Power using the fair value method as set forth in SFAS No. 115,    Accounting for Certain Debt and Equity Securities . At September 30, 2002, the fair market value of Beacon Power's common stock was $0.17 per share. Our cost basis in our investment in Beacon Power's common stock was $0.59 per share. As of September 30, 2002, we believe the decline in market value represents an other than temporary decline because, among other things, the market value has been less than cost since March 2002 and there is some uncertainty of the financial condition and near-term prospects of Beacon Power and, accordingly, we have recorded an other than temporary write-down of our investment in Beacon Power of $1.4 million.    Other income.             Other income decreased by $0.5 million, or 79%, from $0.6 million in 2001 to $0.1 million in 2002. The decrease is primarily the result of $0.4 million decrease in interest income, which is directly related to the decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.     Loss from Beacon Power Corporation.             Effective September 28, 2001, we account for our investment in Beacon Power using the fair value method as set forth in SFAS No. 115,    Accounting for Certain Debt and Equity Securities . We are no longer required to record our share of any losses from Beacon Power and the investment is carried at fair value and is designated as available for sale, and any unrealized holding gains and losses are to be included in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).     Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.             On October 1, 2000, we began accounting for our warrants to purchase Mechanical Technology Incorporated common stock in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, recorded a cumulative unrealized loss of $1.0 million as of October 1, 2000. On June 30, 2001, we began accounting for warrants to purchase our common stock that are designated as a liability in accordance with EITF 00-19, " Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock ", and, therefore, recorded a cumulative unrealized gain of $1.0 million as of June 30, 2001 to record the warrants at fair value.       Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2001 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2000       Product Revenue.             Product revenue increased by $8.4 million, or 37%, from $22.4 million in 2000 to $30.8 million in 2001. The increase was attributable to $6.1 million of increased revenue from Power Systems, of which Ling Electronics accounted for $4.9 million, magnetic levitation products and high-performance motors accounted for $0.7 million and power products accounted for $0.5 million, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Inverpower. $2.3 million of increased revenue was attributable to the Electronics Division.    Funded research and development and other revenue.             Funded research and development and other revenue increased by $2.3 million, or 26%, from $8.6 million in 2000 to $10.9 million in 2001. This increase was primarily attributable to $2.7 million in funded research and development revenue from a new program to develop high power converter    32           assemblies for the U.S. Navy's next generation of modern "all-electric" ships offset by a reduction of $0.4 million in funded research and development revenue from a Department of Energy program to develop low-cost power conversion modules for electric and hybrid-electric vehicles.    Cost of product revenue.             Cost of product revenue increased by $8.8 million, or 46%, from $19.1 million in 2000 to $27.8 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in product revenue. In addition, for 2001, we provided a $1.2 million reserve for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to $0.7 million for 2000. Gross margin from product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased from 15% in 2000 to 10% in 2001.    Funded research and development and other revenue expenses.             Funded research and development and other revenue expenses increased by $598,000, or 9 %,  from $6.8 million in 2000 to $7.4 million in 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to $1.9 million in funded research and development expenses from the U.S. Navy program offset by the reduction of $1.0 million of research and development expenses related to the Department of Energy program.    Unfunded research and development expenses.             Unfunded research and development expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 80%, from $3.5 million in 2000 to $6.2 million in 2001. The increase is due to increased focus on internally funded research and development projects including the power inverter for an on-site power generation system and our 250 kilowatt and 2.2 megawatt rotary UPS and power quality systems.    Selling, general and administrative expenses.             Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3.6 million, or 36%, from $10.0 million in 2000 to $13.6 million in 2001. The increase was primarily due to an increase in selling expenses associated with the $10.6 million increase in total revenue and the inclusion of Ling Electronics for the entire fiscal year 2001 and Inverpower from July 13, 2001 to September 30, 2001. During 2001, we provided a $0.5 million reserve for doubtful accounts as compared to $0.3 million in 2000. In addition, we recorded charges of $0.2 million, $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million in settlement of litigation, consolidation of facilities, write-off of impaired assets and for acceleration of a stock option award-vesting schedule, respectively, during 2001.    Write-off of public offering costs.             On April 25, 2001, we converted our registration statement initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2000 to a shelf registration statement. We expensed $1.4 million of equity financing costs incurred in connection with this initial registration statement.     Amortization of intangibles.             Amortization of intangibles increased by $0.1 million, or 12%, from $1.2 million to $1.4 million. The increase was the result of amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Ling Electronics in October 1999, certain intellectual property and other intangible assets from Northrop Grumman in November 1999 and certain intangible assets from Inverpower Controls Ltd. in July 2001. In addition, during 2001 we wrote-off an impaired intangible asset with a net book value of $0.1 million.     Net unrealized loss on warrants to purchase common stock.             During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, we began accounting for our warrants to purchase Mechanical Technology Incorporated's common stock and the warrant to purchase Beacon Power's common stock in accordance with SFAS No. 133, and, therefore, we have recorded these warrants at their fair value at September 30, 2001 and recorded an unrealized loss of $1.5 million during 2001.    33       NAME="page_di2962_1_34">      Other income (loss).             Other income increased $0.1 million, or 27%, from $0.5 million in 2000 to $0.6 million in 2001. The increase is the result of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities being maintained in interest bearing accounts offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the increase in debt.     Loss from Beacon Power Corporation.             Loss from Beacon Power Corporation increased by $4.2 million from $0.9 million in 2000 to $5.1 million in 2001. In connection with Beacon Power's initial public offering in November 2000, our investment in Beacon Power and additional paid-in-capital was written up to reflect our beneficial interest in the book value of the stockholders' equity of Beacon Power, which was approximately $16.6 million, less losses previously recorded in connection with the put right obligation in the amount of $5.8 million for a net gain of $10.7 million. After the write-up of our investment in Beacon Power, we continued to account for our investment in Beacon Power under the equity method of accounting and recorded our share of losses of $5.1 million from Beacon Power for 2001.    Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.             On October 1, 2000, we began accounting for our warrants to purchase Mechanical Technology Incorporated common stock in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, recorded a cumulative unrealized loss of $1.0 million as of October 1, 2000. On June 30, 2001, we began accounting for warrants to purchase our common stock that are designated as a liability in accordance with EITF 00-19,  Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock , and, therefore, recorded a cumulative unrealized gain of $0.9 million as of June 30, 2001 to record the warrants at fair value.    Quarterly Results of Operations             The following table presents unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended September 30, 2002. This data has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This data includes all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, that we believe necessary for a fair presentation of this information. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. In fiscal year 2002, we changed the reporting periods for operational purposes for the first three quarters of our fiscal year to the 13-week periods ending on the last Saturday of the last month of each quarter. We believe that due to this fact there is no material difference between the 2002 and 2001 quarterly statement of operations data and that the results of all periods presented are comparable.            The fourth quarter of 2002 includes a provision of $1.3 million for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2001. The fourth quarter of 2002 provision includes $0.8 million for inventory related to residential fuel cell and battery UPS products. Based on our strategic business plan to focus our efforts on our rotary UPS systems, we deemed it appropriate during the fourth quarter to establish these reserves.    34                  Three Months

            Liquidity and Capital Resources             We need an immediate infusion of equity capital to sustain our operations. We anticipate that our existing cash and cash resources will enable us to fund our operations through only approximately January 15, 2003. As more fully discussed below, if Silicon Valley Bank, our senior lender, decides to discontinue lending to us, which it has the right to do, or we are unable to raise additional equity by January 15, 2003, we will be forced to furlough or permanently lay off a significant portion of our work force which will have a material adverse impact on us. Under these circumstances, we may not be able    35          to continue our operations. Further, without additional cash resources, we may not be able to keep all or significant portions of our operations going for a sufficient period of time to enable us to sell all or portions of our assets or operations at other than distressed sale prices.            We have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products. These costs have exceeded total revenue. As a result, we have incurred losses in each of the past five years. As of September 30, 2002, we had an accumulated deficit of $85.2 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, we incurred a loss of $20.8 million and a reduction in our cash from $20.9 million to $2.1 million. Due to restructuring activities, we were able to slow our cash burn rate from $7.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2002 to $5.2 million, $3.5 million and $2.1 million in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2002, respectively.            However, we need to achieve quarterly revenue of approximately $15 million in order to reach a breakeven cash run rate based on today's cost structure and expected incremental margins on the additional revenue. Our highest quarterly revenue for fiscal year 2002 were $11.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2002. Given our current operating plan, we do not expect to achieve $15 million of quarterly revenue until the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003 at the earliest. As a result, because we had only $2.1 million in cash at the end of fiscal year 2002, we will need at least $9 million to $10 million in borrowing capacity and additional capital, in the aggregate, in order to fund our current business plan for the next 12 months. We may also need additional future funds in order to fund unanticipated operating losses, to grow, to develop new or enhance existing products and services and to respond to competitive pressures.            At September 30, 2002, we had a line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank which enabled us to borrow up to $5 million based on eligible receivables, and none of the credit line had been used as of that date. The credit line included various financial covenants which needed to be satisfied in order for us to retain our right to borrow. One of these covenants required us to raise $4 million of new equity or subordinated debt by December 1, 2002. We did not raise these funds as of December 1, 2002 and, as a result, are in default under the credit line and from December 1, 2002 through December 18, 2002, were not permitted to borrow against the credit line. As of December 1, 2002, the loan balance was $2.1 million and all receipts from our Electronics and Power Systems divisions were required to be used to reduce this loan. Although Silicon Valley Bank is not required to do so while we are in default under our loan agreement, it has permitted us to use receivables collected from our Applied Technology division. As a result, from December 1, 2002 through December 18, 2002, we were limited to available cash and receipts from our Applied Technology division to fund our business until the Silicon Valley Bank loan was repaid. This level of resources is insufficient to sustain our ongoing operations as our Applied Technology division generates less than $1 million of cash receipts in an average month.            On December 19, 2002, we entered into a forebearance agreement with Silicon Valley Bank pursuant to which Silicon Valley Bank agreed that, unless other defaults occurred under our credit facility, Silicon Valley Bank would not exercise its rights as creditor under our loan agreement with them until January 15, 2003. We hope that Silicon Valley Bank's forbearance will enable us sufficient time to raise $4 million of equity capital or subordinated debt by January 15, 2003. We acknowledged to Silicon Valley Bank in the forebearance agreement that we were in material default of our credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. The forebearance agreement required us to obtain a signed term sheet by December 19, 2002 for a transaction structured to raise at least $3 million and, as more fully described below, we believe we have met this requirement.            On December 19, 2002, we owed Silicon Valley Bank approximately $886,000 and had a cash balance of approximately $1 million. As a result of executing the forbearance agreement, we are now able to return to borrowing from the bank, but are limited to the lesser of 75% of eligible receivables or $2 million. In addition, all collections can now be used by us to fund operations or pay down the loan, as they had been prior to the default on December 1, 2002. Although the line of credit was up to    36          $5 million prior to our default, it was limited to 75% of eligible receivables which typically permitted borrowing in the October to November period of from approximately $2.2 million to $2.8 million outstanding at any one time. However, at anytime prior to January 15, 2003, Silicon Valley Bank may discontinue lending funds to us if, in its business judgment, it decides to do so.            We intend to work with Silicon Valley Bank in an effort to amend the existing credit facility before January 15, 2003. The existing credit facility is scheduled to expire in September, 2003. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving an amended credit facility by January 15, 2003. We believe that we will need to raise at least $3 million of new equity or subordinated debt, acceptable to Silicon Valley Bank, by January 15, 2003, or we will be unable to borrow funds or use new collections to fund our business after January 15, 2003. If we are unable to raise these additional funds, we may not be able to amend our existing credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank which would permit us to borrow any additional amounts under the credit facility.            On December 13, 2002, we executed a term sheet with an institutional investor to raise between $5 and $7 million of equity capital. The term sheet contemplates that $3 to $5 million of the equity investment will be funded during the week of January 6, 2003 and the remaining $2 million will be funded promptly after the registration statement we are required to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission is declared effective registering all of the underlying equity securities in this financing. We expect it will take a minimum of 90 days to file a registration statement and obtain its effectiveness. We will be unable to file a registration statement until after we have an initial closing with the institutional investor. To date, the documentation relating to this financing has been produced by counsel to the institutional investor but has not been finalized. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully close this financing and raise the $5 to $7 million on the terms contemplated by the term sheet or on any other terms.            We have agreed with the institutional investor that we will not solicit or negotiate any additional equity or debt financings through January 14, 2003. Upon consummation of a financing with the institutional investor, the institutional investor would have rights of first refusal and exchange rights which would generally be triggered upon future financings we may seek to consummate. The right of first refusal would allow the institutional investor to purchase future securities issued by us for a period of 12 months following the initial closing of the financing. For a period of 24 months following the initial closing, the exchange right would allow the institutional investor to exchange any shares of preferred stock held by it into future securities that we may issue at the preferred stock's liquidation preference. Each of these factors may adversely affect our ability to raise additional funds from third parties on terms acceptable to us, or at all.            The financing with the institutional investor would also require that we seek the approval of our stockholders, which we will attempt to obtain at our 2003 annual meeting of stockholders. In the event that we do not obtain the approval of our stockholders, we would be required to redeem all or a portion of the investment by the institutional investor in cash, which would have a material adverse effect on us and our operations. The exercise by the institutional investor of any rights of first refusal or exchange rights may require us to seek additional approvals of our stockholders, which may not be required if these rights were not exercised. This may also hinder or delay our ability to obtain equity funding in the future.            Any securities offered to the institutional investor will not be or have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.            If Silicon Valley Bank does not continue to lend money to us through January 15, 2003 or we are unable to close an equity financing with the institutional investor prior to January 15, 2003, we will be forced to furlough or permanently lay off a significant portion of our work force. This will have a material adverse effect on us. Under these circumstances, we may not be able to continue our operations. Further, without additional cash resources, we may not be able to keep all or a significant    37           portion of our operations going for a sufficient period of time to enable us to sell all or portions of our assets or operations at other than distressed sale prices.            Our financial statements for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2002, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contain an audit report from Grant Thornton LLP. The audit report contains a going concern qualification which raises substantial doubt with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. The receipt of a going concern qualification may adversely affect our ability to manage our accounts payable and cause some of our suppliers to deal with us on a cash-on-delivery basis only. If this were to occur, this would adversely affect our operations by increasing our immediate need for additional capital.            If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders may experience additional dilution. The terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility. There can be no assurance that additional financing of any kind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially, adversely affect our results of operations.             Since inception, we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through the sale of private equity securities, public security offerings, borrowings on our expired line of credit and capital equipment leases.            As of September 30, 2002, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $2.1 million, a decrease of $18.8 million from September 30, 2001. Cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was $15.3 million as compared to $11.0 million in 2001. Cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was primarily attributable to our net loss offset by non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory, realized gain on sale of marketable securities, net unrealized loss from warrants to purchase common stock, write-off of impaired assets, write-down of investment in Beacon Power Corporation, non-cash compensation expense and changes in working capital.            Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was $3.1 million, excluding the sale of marketable securities of $9.9 million, as compared to $2.0 million excluding the purchase of marketable securities of $9.9 million, in 2001. Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 included capital expenditures of $3.1 million primarily at Power Systems to expand our capacity to manufacture our power conversion products.             Cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 was $0.3 million as compared to $25.1 million provided by financing activities in 2001. Net cash used by financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2002 represents the repayment of long-term debt.    38                  We lease equipment and office space under non-cancelable capital and operating leases. Future minimum rental payments, as of September 30, 2002, under the capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms are as follows:       Year Ended September 30,       Capital Leases     Operating Leases    2003     $  366,733     $  2,214,846    2004        341,786        739,570    2005        236,456        501,108    2006        316,762        262,367    2007                264,000    Thereafter                904,000                 Total (Operating lease commitments not reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $177,116)     $  1,261,737     $  4,885,891                    Factors Affecting Future Results             Our future results remain difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. These factors include business conditions within the distributed power, power quality, aerospace, transportation, industrial, utility, telecommunications, silicon wafer manufacturing, factory automation, aircraft and automotive industries and the world economies as a whole, and competitive pressures that may impact research and development spending. Our revenue growth is dependent on technology developments and contract research and development for both the government and commercial sectors and no assurance can be given that these investments will continue or that we will be able to obtain such funds. In addition, our growth opportunities are dependent on the introduction of new products that must penetrate distributed power, power quality, aerospace, transportation, industrial, utility, telecommunications, silicon wafer manufacturing, factory automation, aircraft and automotive markets. No assurance can be given that new products can be developed, or if developed, will be successful; that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us; or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these or any new markets. Because of these and other factors, past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance. Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the market price of our common stock experiences significant volatility.    Effects of Inflation             We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements             In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets,  which supersedes SFAS No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of , and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30. SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing this statement to determine its effect on our consolidated financial statements.            In April, 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,  Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections . SFAS No. 145 rescinds SFAS No. 4,  Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt , and an amendment of that statement, SFAS    39          No. 44,  Accounting for Intangible Assets of Motor Carriers , and SFAS No. 64,  Extinguishment of Debt Made to Satisfy Sinking-Fund Requirements . This statement amends SFAS No. 13,  Accounting for Leases , to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale-leaseback transactions. This statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions and is effective for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. We are currently reviewing this statement to determine its effect on our consolidated financial statements.            In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,  Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities . SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94-3,    Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) . This statement is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. We are currently reviewing this statement to determine its effect on our consolidated financial statements.            In November 2001, the EITF issued Topic No. D-103 (Topic D-103) relating to the accounting for reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses. In accordance with Topic D-103, reimbursements received for out-of-pocket expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the statement of operations. Our arrangements have historically included reimbursement for expenses as part of the overall fee charged. As a result, we have historically accounted for these reimbursements as revenue and recorded the associated costs as either cost of product revenue or funded research and development and other revenue expenses. As a result, our adoption of Topic D-103 had no impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.    Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.             We develop products in the United States and sell them worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. Since our sales are currently priced in U.S. dollars and are translated to local currency amounts, a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets. Interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly since our investments are in short-term instruments. Based on the nature and current levels of our investments, however, we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure.    40       NAME="page_fa2962_1_41">        Item 8.  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
