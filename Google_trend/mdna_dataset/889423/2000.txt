ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS          OF OPERATIONS      On four separate occasions since January 1, 1999, we have restated our financial results. These restatements, announced on January 13, 1999, August 16, 1999, August 8, 2000 and September 12, 2000, affected various reporting periods during our fiscal years ended September 30, 1996 through 1999 and our nine-month period ended June 30, 2000. The restatements primarily related to the accounting for our investment in Beacon Power, and other various accounting matters including accounting for stock options and warrants, providing additional reserves for accounts receivable, inventory, warranty and sales returns and writing off certain property and equipment. On September 18, 2000, the SEC's enforcement division requested that we meet with them to explain the circumstances surrounding the restatements announced on August 8, 2000 and September 12, 2000. On September 22, 2000, David B. Eisenhaure and Sean F. Moran, our President and Chief Financial Officer, respectively, along with our independent public accountants and outside counsel, met with various representatives of the SEC in response to their inquiry. We explained the circumstances surrounding our August 2000 and September 2000 restatements and responded to the SEC's questions. We expect that the SEC will have additional questions. The SEC may seek to meet with individuals, which may include our employees as well as representatives of Beacon Power and our former and current independent accountants. We will cooperate fully with any further SEC inquiry.      The following discussion reflects the restatement of our financial statements for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. For a discussion of the restatements, see our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  OVERVIEW      We are developing enabling technologies for the emerging distributed power generation and power quality markets. We manufacture power and energy management products that convert, condition, store and manage electricity for businesses and consumers that require high-quality, uninterruptible power. We are utilizing our engineering and manufacturing expertise to develop products to serve the distributed power generation and power quality markets, including products for fuel cell and microturbine power generation systems, hybrid-electric vehicles and flywheel energy storage systems. We believe the family of products we are developing will be integral components of distributed power generation and power quality systems.      In the past three years, we have expanded our business and capabilities through the following acquisitions:      - K&D Magmotor Corp.--a manufacturer of custom and standard electric motors,       acquired in January 1997.      - Film Microelectronics, Inc.--a manufacturer of thin film substrates and       hybrid microelectronics, acquired in April 1997.      - Inductive Components, Inc.--a value-added supplier of customized electric       motors, acquired in January 1999.      - Lighthouse Software, Inc.--a supplier of control software for machine       tools, acquired in January 1999.      - HyComp, Inc.--a manufacturer of hybrid microelectronics, acquired in       April 1999.      - Ling Electronics, Inc.--a manufacturer of shaker vibration test systems,       power converters, amplifiers and controllers, acquired in October 1999.  All of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. In addition, in November 1999, we acquired intellectual property, tooling and other assets from Northrop Grumman                                         26  Corporation enabling us to manufacture and sell electric drivetrains. See Note O to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our acquisitions.      In May 1997, we formed Beacon Power Corporation to develop stationary, terrestrial flywheel energy storage systems for commercial applications. On October 23, 1998, Beacon Power completed a $4.8 million private placement of its class D redeemable preferred stock and warrants to third-party investors, and we relinquished significant control of Beacon Power. As of October 23, 1998, we owned 0.1% of Beacon Power's voting stock and 67.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding capital stock. From June 1999 through March 31, 2000, Beacon Power was financed through the issuance of approximately $4.7 million of bridge notes and warrants to its investors, including $1.0 million from us. On April 7, 2000, Beacon Power issued 1,226,141 shares of its class E redeemable preferred stock and warrants to purchase 306,535 shares of its class E preferred stock in exchange for the conversion of all of its outstanding bridge notes of which we received 347,407 shares of Beacon Power's class E redeemable preferred stock and a warrant to purchase 86,852 shares of its class E preferred stock. As of April 7, 2000, we owned 11.0% of Beacon Power's voting stock and 61.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding capital stock. On April 21, 2000, Beacon Power raised an additional $4.1 million through the sale of additional bridge notes and warrants to purchase 41,000 shares of Beacon Power's common stock. We did not participate in this financing. On May 23, 2000, Beacon Power issued 6,785,711 shares of its class F preferred stock and additional warrants to purchase shares of Beacon Power's common stock. The shares of class F preferred stock and the additional warrants were issued in consideration for the cancellation of $5.2 million in bridge notes and an additional $23.3 million cash investment by existing and new investors. We did not participate in this financing either. As of May 23, 2000, we owned 3.5% of Beacon Power's voting stock and 33.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding capital stock. As of September 30, 2000, we owned approximately 3.5% of the outstanding voting stock of Beacon Power and 32.1% of the capital stock of Beacon Power on a common equivalent basis after taking all dividend accruals into account.      The results of our operations include a $3.1 million loss of Beacon Power from May 8, 1997 to December 24, 1997 under the consolidation method of accounting. On December 24, 1997, we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 30/Topic 5.E. (SAB) "Accounting for Divesture of a Subsidiary or Other Business Operation" and have included 100% of Beacon Power's $7.1 million loss for the period from December 25, 1997 through May 1999 in a manner similar to the equity method of accounting, at which time, our initial investment of $1.9 million, the $30,000 additional investment and the additional deemed investment of $4.8 million and accrued dividends of $410,000 had been written down to zero. In June 1999, we committed up to $1.0 million of additional financing to Beacon Power, representing a minority share of a funding commitment received by Beacon Power and we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power under the equity method of accounting and have included in our results through September 30, 2000 our share of Beacon Power's losses of $1.9 million. As of September 30, 2000, our additional investment in Beacon Power had been reduced to zero and our contingent obligation to Beacon Power's class D preferred stockholders was $5.8 million. We will continue to record additional losses from Beacon Power to the extent of additional dividends accrued on the contingent obligation to the class D preferred stockholders of Beacon Power.      In November 2000, Beacon Power completed an initial public offering of its common stock and issued 8,000,000 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share. Upon the closing of Beacon Power's initial public offering, we owned approximately 25% of Beacon Power's voting stock. In connection with the closing of the initial public offering, the put right, as described in Note E to our financial statements, was terminated and the contingent obligation to class D preferred stockholders of Beacon Power will be reclassified as additional paid in capital. In addition, our preferred stock in Beacon Power was converted into 9,694,812 shares of Beacon Power's common stock. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, our investment and additional paid in capital will be written up during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 to reflect our beneficial interest in the book value of the stockholders' equity of Beacon Power, which                                         27  we estimate to be approximately $15.0 million. After the write-up of our investment in Beacon Power, we will continue to account for our investment in Beacon Power under the equity method of accounting and record our share of losses from Beacon Power on a one-quarter trailing basis until our investment in Beacon Power has been reduced to zero. If in the future, our ownership interest in Beacon Power's outstanding capital stock is reduced to below 20% and we determine that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Beacon Power, our investment in Beacon Power will be accounted for using the fair value method as set forth in SFAS No. 115 based upon the carrying value of our investment in Beacon Power at the time our interest is reduced to below 20%. At that time, we will no longer be required to record our share of any losses from Beacon Power. Under the fair value method, the value of the investment will be carried at fair market value with any unrealized holding gains or losses to be included in stockholders' equity as a component of other accumulated comprehensive income.      We recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 "Revenue Recognition." Product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, delivery of the product to the customer has occurred, at which time title generally is passed to the customer, and we have determined that collection of a fixed fee is probable, all of which occur upon shipment of the product. If the product requires installation to be performed by us, all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation. We provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized.      We perform funded research and development and product development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and, in some situations, the payment of a fee. These contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how costs compare with budget. On fixed-price contracts, revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. Revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed. In each type of contract, we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon reaching interim milestones. All payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Adjustments are recognized in the period made. When the current estimates of total contract revenue for commercial product development contracts indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded. Any losses incurred in performing funded research and development projects are recognized as research and development expense as incurred.      Cost of revenue includes cost of product revenue, including materials, labor and overhead. Costs incurred in connection with funded research and development arrangements are included in research and development expenses.      We have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and products. These costs have exceeded total revenues. As a result, we have incurred net losses for the fiscal years ended 2000, 1999, 1998, 1997 and 1996. As of September 30, 2000, we had an accumulated deficit of $40.2 million. We intend to significantly increase our capital expenditures and operating expenses to rapidly expand our manufacturing capabilities and for general corporate purposes, including product development activities, sales and marketing and administrative activities. Because we expect to continue to invest in our business ahead of anticipated future revenues, we expect to incur operating losses at least through the next two years.  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION      This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains or incorporates forward-looking statements within the meaning of section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statement by our use of the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "may," "will," "intends," "estimates," and similar expressions, whether in the negative or in the                                         28  affirmative. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements reasonably reflect our plans, intentions and expectations, our actual results could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements below under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED     SEPTEMBER 30, 1999      PRODUCT REVENUE.  Product revenue increased by $13.3 million or 146% from $9.1 million to $22.4 million. This increase was attributable to $7.4 million in revenue from Ling Electronics, $2.3 million from increased volume in our microelectronics products, primarily from radio frequency amplifiers that are currently used in satellite uplink systems, satellite television and wireless Internet service, $2.3 million from increased volume in our magnetic levitation products and $1.3 million from increased volume from high performance motors.      FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REVENUE.  Funded research and development revenue increased by $2.3 million or 36% from $6.4 million to $8.6 million. This increase was attributable to an additional $2.4 million in funded research and development revenue from a Department of Energy program to develop low-cost power conversion modules for electric and hybrid-electric vehicles and was partially offset by our increased focus on internally funded research projects including the development of power conversion products for the distributed power generation market.      GROSS MARGIN.  Gross margin increased by $6.0 million or 101% from $6.0 million to $12.0 million. Gross margin from products increased by $3.7 million and funded research and development increased by $2.3 million. Gross margin from product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased to 15% from (4%). The improvement in gross margin from product revenue as a percentage of product revenue is due to improved plant utilization at MagMotor and Film Microelectronics and the inclusion of revenue and gross margin from Ling Electronics.      RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  Research and development expenses increased by $3.7 million or 57% from $6.6 million to $10.3 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an additional $2.9 million in funded research and development expenses related to the Department of Energy contract as well as our increased focus on internally funded research projects including the development of power conversion products for the distributed power generation market.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.2 million or 13% from $8.8 million to $10.0 million. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of $2.9 million of costs from Ling Electronics, $800,000 of costs for facilities and staffing in an effort to meet expected growth and demand for our products and the inclusion of a full year of expenses related to Inductive Components and Lighthouse Software which were acquired in January 1999 and HyComp which was acquired in April 1999. These increases were offset by the recording of $2.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options and warrants to consultants and $1.0 million of additional reserves for unbilled contract costs and fees and accounts receivable in 1999. Based on the facts and circumstances during 1999, we established a reserve of $521,000 for unbilled contract costs and fees related to a contract with the Department of the Air Force which was terminable by the Department of the Air Force if it determined that we were in default under the contract. In addition, we provided $513,000 in reserve for unbilled contract costs and fees and accounts receivable to properly reflect the reserve requirements.                                         29      AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES.  Amortization of intangibles increased $846,000 or 228% from $371,000 to $1.2 million. This increase was the result of amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Inductive Components and Lighthouse Software in January 1999, Ling Electronics in October 1999 and certain intellectual property and other intangible assets from Northrop Grumman in November 1999.      OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.  Other income, net increased to $460,000 from $224,000 of other expense, net. The increase was the result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents being maintained in interest-bearing accounts and a decrease of interest expense associated with our line of credit.      LOSS FROM BEACON POWER CORPORATION.  Loss from Beacon Power decreased by $3.4 million or 79% from $4.3 million to $899,000. During the year ended September 30, 2000, we recorded our share of Beacon Power's losses of $899,000, under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 1999, our investment in Beacon Power had been reduced to zero, however, we continued to record losses from Beacon Power to the extent of additional interest accrued on the contingent obligation to the class D preferred stockholders of Beacon Power. During the year ended September 30, 1999, we recorded 100% of Beacon Power's losses of $3.6 million in accordance with SAB Topic 5.E., in a manner similar to the equity method of accounting through May 1999 and in June 1999, we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power under the equity method of accounting and recorded our share of Beacon Power's losses of $734,000 from June 1999 to September 1999.      FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED     SEPTEMBER 30, 1998      PRODUCT REVENUE.  Product revenue increased $1.6 million or 21% from $7.5 million to $9.1 million. This increase was attributable to $1.0 million from the introduction of our magnetic levitation products and $396,000 from increased volume in our microelectronics products, primarily from radio frequency amplifiers that are currently used in satellite uplink systems, satellite television and wireless Internet service and $202,000 from increased volume from high performance motors.      FUNDED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT REVENUE.  Funded research and development revenue decreased by $1.7 million or 21% from $8.0 million to $6.4 million. During the year ended September 30, 1999, we devoted more resources to internally funded research and development programs including the development of power conversion products for the distributed power generation market.      GROSS MARGIN.  Gross margin decreased by $4.1 million from $10.1 million to $6.0 million. Gross margin from products decreased by $2.4 million and funded research and development revenue decreased by $1.7 million. Gross margin from product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to (4)% of product revenue in 1999 from 27% in the prior year. Gross margin from product sales as a percentage of product revenue decreased due to increased costs incurred in developing new products and for additional staffing and facility costs. In addition, we also recorded a $900,000 provision for obsolete and slow moving inventory.      RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.  Research and development expenses decreased $240,000 or 4% from $6.8 million to $6.6 million. The decrease was the result of accounting for our investment in Beacon Power as of December 24, 1997 in accordance with SAB 30 and thus no longer including Beacon Power's research and development expenses in our results. In 1998, we included $1.2 million of Beacon Power's research and development expenses in our results through December 24, 1997, at which time we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power in accordance with SAB 30. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our effort to develop distributed power conversion systems and other internal research and development programs.      SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.  Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $4.3 million or 95% from $4.5 million to $8.8 million. This increase was primarily due to $2.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options and warrants to                                         30  consultants in 1999, $1.0 million of additional reserves for unbilled contract costs and fees and accounts receivable and $800,000 in costs for facilities and staffing in an effort to meet expected growth and demand for our products. Based on the facts and circumstances during 1999, we established a reserve against $521,000 of unbilled contract costs and fees related to a contract with the Department of the Air Force which was terminable by the Department of the Air Force if it determined that we were in default under the contract. In addition, we provided $513,000 in reserves for unbilled contract costs and fees and accounts receivable to properly reflect the reserve requirements.      AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLES.  Amortization of intangibles increased $80,000 or 27% from $291,000 to $371,000. This increase was the result of the acquisition of Inductive Components and Lighthouse Software in January 1999.      OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.  Other expense, net increased to $224,000 from $170,000 of other income, net as a result of increased interest expense and decreased interest income.      LOSS FROM BEACON POWER CORPORATION.  Loss from Beacon Power increased $868,000 or 25% from $3.5 million to $4.3 million. As of December 24, 1997, we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power in accordance with SAB Topic 5.E. and we have included 100% of Beacon Power's net loss of $3.5 million in our results during the year ended September 30, 1998 in a manner similar to the equity method of accounting. During 1999, we continued to account for our investment in Beacon Power in accordance with SAB Topic 5.E. until May 1999 and have included $3.6 million of Beacon Power's net loss in our results during that period. In June 1999, we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power under the equity method of accounting and have recorded an additional $734,000 of our share of losses from Beacon Power during June 1999 to September 1999.  QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS      The following table presents unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended September 30, 2000. This data has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This data includes all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, that we believe necessary for a fair presentation of this                                         31  information. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period.

As of September 30, 2000, our cash and cash equivalents were $8.8 million, an increase of $6.3 million from September 30, 1999. Cash used in operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $5.5 million as compared to $5.6 million in 1999. Cash used in operating activities during the year ended September 30, 2000 was primarily attributable to our net loss and an increase in accounts receivable and inventory partially offset by non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, loss from Beacon Power and compensation expense related to issuance of stock options and warrants to non-employees.      Cash used in investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2000 was $2.9 million as compared to $1.4 million in 1999. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended September 30, 2000 included capital expenditures of $2.5 million and an investment in Beacon Power of $333,000. We estimate that we will spend an additional $9.6 million on capital expenditures through fiscal year 2001 primarily at our Advanced Fuel Cell Power Products division to expand our capacity to manufacture our power conversion products. We expect these additions will be financed principally from lease financing and, to a lesser extent, cash on hand. If we are unable to obtain lease financing, our capital expenditures would be expected to be approximately $1.0 million.      Cash provided by financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2000 was $14.7 million as compared to $8.4 million in 1999. Net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended                                         32  September 30, 2000 includes net proceeds of $7.0 million from the sale of our common stock and $8.4 million from the exercise of common stock options and warrants.      On October 23, 1998, we granted the purchasers of Beacon Power's class D redeemable preferred stock the right to cause us under certain circumstances to purchase all of Beacon Power's shares of class D redeemable preferred stock issued to those purchasers and upon exercise of this put right, we must pay $4.8 million plus cumulative dividends at 12.5% per year since October 23, 1998 through May 22, 2000, and 6% per year thereafter, in our common stock. We have recorded as of September 30, 2000, the face value of the put right of $4.8 million plus cumulative dividends of $1.0 million as a liability. If the put right is exercised, we would reclassify the value of the contingent obligation to the class D preferred stockholders of Beacon Power to common stock and additional paid-in capital.      In November 2000, Beacon Power completed an initial public offering of its common stock and issued 8,000,000 shares of common stock at $6.00 per share. In connection with the initial public offering, the put right was terminated and the contingent obligation to class D preferred stockholders of Beacon Power will be reclassified as additional paid in capital. In addition, our preferred stock in Beacon Power was converted into 9,694,812 shares of Beacon Power's common stock. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, our investment and additional paid in capital will be written up during the first quarter of fiscal 2001 to reflect our beneficial interest in the book value of the stockholders' equity of Beacon Power, which we estimate to be approximately $15.0 million.      We anticipate that the existing $8.8 million in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2000 will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financings within this time frame or that any additional financing, if needed, will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS      Our future results remain difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. These factors include business conditions within the distributed power, power quality, aerospace, transportation, industrial, utility, telecommunications, silicon wafer manufacturing, factory automation, aircraft and automotive industries and the world economies as a whole, and competitive pressures that may impact research and development spending. Our revenue growth is dependent on technology developments and contract research and development for both the government and commercial sectors and no assurance can be given that these investments will continue or that we will be able to obtain such funds. In addition, our growth opportunities are dependent on the introduction of new products that must penetrate distributed power, power quality, aerospace, transportation, industrial, utility, telecommunications, silicon wafer manufacturing, factory automation, aircraft and automotive markets. No assurance can be given that new products can be developed, or if developed, will be successful; that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us; or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these or any new markets. Because of these and other factors, past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance. Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the market price of our common stock experiences significant volatility.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION      We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations.                                         33  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS      In June 1999, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 137 (SFAS No. 137), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities-Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," which defers the effective date of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (SFAS No. 133), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" to all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. SFAS No. 133 establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. It requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure these instruments at fair value. We will adopt SFAS No. 133 beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 133, we will be required to record an unrealized loss on the fair value of the warrants to purchase shares of Mechanical Technology Incorporated's common stock, of $1.0 million in our results of operations as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, and we will record future unrealized gains and losses on the fair value of these warrants in our results of operations.      In September 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140 (SFAS 140), "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities." SFAS No. 140 provides accounting and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. Under SFAS No. 140, after a transfer of financial assets, an entity recognizes the financial and servicing assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred, derecognizes financial assets when control has been surrendered, and derecognizes liabilities when extinguished. SFAS No. 140 also provides standards for distinguishing transfers of financial assets that are sales from transfers that are secured borrowings. SFAS No. 140 is effective for certain transactions occurring after March 31, 2001 and certain disclosures for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2001. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 140 on our financial statements and related disclosures, but do not expect that any impact will be material.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.      We develop products in the United States and sell them worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. Since our sales are currently priced in U.S. dollars and are translated to local currency amounts, a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets. Interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly since our investments are in short-term instruments. Based on the nature and current levels of our investments, however, we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure.                                         34  ITEM 8.
