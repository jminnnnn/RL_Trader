You can identify these forward-looking statements by our use of the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects," "may," "will," "intends," "estimates," and similar expressions, whether in the negative or in the affirmative. Although we believe that these forward-looking statements reasonably reflect our plans, intentions and expectations, our actual results could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements under the heading "Risk Factors" under Item 1A above that we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report speak only as of the date of this report. Subsequent events or circumstances occurring after such date may render these statements incomplete or out of date. We undertake no obligation and expressly disclaim any duty to update such statements.     Overview             We are a world leading technology provider of utility grade power conversion solutions for the renewable energy market. Our products feature the widest range of power ratings in the industry, and are utilized by businesses and utility companies to efficiently convert renewable energy sources into stable and reliable electrical power.            Our suite of photovoltaic and fuel cell power inverters offer rugged and reliable solutions that enhance the total output and power production of a solar installation. We also offer system design services and solutions for management, monitoring, and performance measurement to maximize capital investment and improve overall quality and performance over the entire lifespan of an installation.     Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates             Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, receivable reserves, inventory reserves, goodwill and intangible assets, contract losses and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates were discussed with our Audit Committee.             The significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:     Revenue Recognition             We recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,    Revenue Recognition . Product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an    25             arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable. Title to the product passes upon shipment of the product, as the products are typically shipped FOB shipping point, except for certain foreign shipments. If the product requires installation to be performed by us, all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation. If the product requires specific customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse, unless we can objectively and reliably demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied. When appropriate, we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized. If a contract involves the provisions of multiple elements and the elements qualify for separation, total estimated contact revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element provided. The amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future. Revenue is recognized on each element as described above.            We perform funded research and development and product development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts through our discontinued Applied Technology division and through our engineering group. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and, in some situations, the payment of a fee. These contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how costs compare with a budget. On fixed-price contracts, revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. Revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed. In each type of contract, we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts. All payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Adjustments are recognized in the period made. The Defense Contract Audit Agency has agreed-upon the final indirect cost rates for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004. When the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for product development contracts indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we have accrued approximately $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2009 there have been no provisions for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts. With the sale of Applied Technology subsidiary we expect revenue from the percentage of completion type contracts or from cost reimbursement contracts in future periods to be nominal.             Cost of product revenue includes material, labor and overhead. Costs incurred in connection with funded research and development and other revenue arrangements are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses.            Deferred revenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed, product shipped or installation completed. When an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties.            Unbilled contract costs and fees represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed due to contractual provisions or deferred costs that have not yet been recognized as revenue or billed to the customer.     Accounts Receivable             Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis    26             of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to be adequate, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.      Inventory             We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory, and costs are determined based on the first-in, first-out method of accounting and include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. We periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and/or obsolete inventory within cost of sales based primarily on our historical usage, as well as based on estimated forecast of product demand. A significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short-term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development, and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.     Warranty             We offer warranty coverage for our products for periods typically ranging from 1 to 5 years after shipment. We estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates. The assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are reevaluated quarterly, at a minimum, in light of actual experience and, when appropriate, the accruals or the accrual percentage is adjusted based on specific estimates of project repair costs and quantity of product returns. Our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates of the percentage of units affected and the repair costs. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product, and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.      Convertible Debt Instruments and Warrant Liabilities             We accounted for our senior secured convertible notes (the "Convertible Notes"), which were paid off on November 7, 2007, and associated warrants as a hybrid instrument. The Convertible Notes included features that qualify as embedded derivatives, such as (i) the holders' conversion option, (ii) our option to settle the Convertible Notes at the scheduled dates in cash or shares of our common stock and (iii) premiums and penalties we would be liable to pay in the event of default. We irrevocably elected, as of January 1, 2007, to measure the Convertible Notes in their entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either gain or loss. Subsequent to the pay-off of the Convertible Notes, we will continue to account for the associated warrants as described above.             We recorded interest expense under the Convertible Notes based on the greater of (i) 7% or (ii) the six-month LIBOR, in effect at the time plus 350 basis points, as well as the amortization of the debt discount, which we computed using the effective interest method. The debt discount represents the difference between our gross proceeds of $12.0 million and the fair value of the convertible debt upon issuance, after separately valuing the investor warrants, the placement agent warrants and the Convertible Notes on a relative fair value basis. By amortizing the debt discount to interest expense, rather than recognizing it as a change in fair value of the Convertible debt instrument and warrants, which is a separate line item in our statement of operations, we believe our interest expense line item more appropriately reflects the cost of the debt associated with the Convertible Notes.    27                   We determined the fair values of the Convertible Notes, investor warrants and placement agent warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate. Our stock price has the most significant influence on the fair value of the Convertible Notes and related warrants. An increase in our common stock price would cause the fair values of both the Convertible Notes and warrants to increase, because the conversion and exercise prices, respectively, of such instruments are fixed at $1.65 and $1.815 per share, respectively, and result in a charge to our statement of operations. A decrease in our stock price would likewise cause the fair value of the Convertible Notes and the warrants to decrease and result in a credit to our statement of operations. If the price of our common stock were to decline significantly, however, the decrease in the fair value of the Convertible Notes would be limited by the instrument's debt characteristics. Under such circumstances, our estimated cost of capital would become another significant variable affecting the fair value of the Convertible Notes.     Income Taxes             The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those outside the United States, which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. The income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.            Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately $57.4 million as of December 31, 2009, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.            We account for income taxes utilizing asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. In addition, we are required to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.             The tax years 1994 through 2009 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject, which are primarily in the United States, as carry forward attributes generated in years past may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities if they are or will be used in a future period. We are currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other jurisdiction for any tax years. We did not recognize any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements. We would record any such interest and penalties as a component of interest expense. We do not expect any material changes to the unrecognized benefits within 12 months of the reporting date.     Redeemable Convertible Series B Preferred Stock             We initially accounted for our Series B Preferred Stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible Series B Preferred Stock and the warrants issued to the investors, and then to any beneficial conversion    28              rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities. We determined the initial value of the Series B Preferred Stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate. The Series B Preferred Stock is classified within the liability section of our balance sheet. To the extent that the Series B Preferred Stock is subject to a remeasurement event, or is otherwise modified, the Series B Preferred Stock will be reclassified to temporary equity.     Redeemable Convertible Series C Preferred Stock             We initially accounted for our issuance of Series C Preferred Stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible Series C Preferred Stock and the warrants issued to the investors, and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities and classifying the Series C Preferred Stock as temporary equity on the balance sheet between the captions for liabilities and permanent shareholder's equity. We determined the initial value of the Series C Preferred Stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate.            The re-pricing of the exercise price of the first tranche warrants from $1.44 to $1.25, as described in the footnotes to the financial statements, was treated as a cancellation of the original warrants issued on November 8, 2007 and a re-issuance or new warrants on December 21, 2007. The difference in fair value of the warrant was included in the allocation of net proceeds associated with the second closing of the Series C Preferred Stock on December 21, 2007. We treated this as a deemed dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2007 we recorded $11,947,881 as a deemed dividend to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, which included the beneficial conversion feature of $11,762,887 and $184,994 related to the accretion of the Series C Preferred Stock to its redemption value through the date that the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock may first exercise their redemption right. We are using the effective interest method to accrete the carrying value of the Series C Preferred stock through November 8, 2011, at which time the value of the Series C Preferred Stock would be $30.0 million, 120% of its face value.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements             See Note U of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.     Results of Operations             All data set forth below has been adjusted to reflect the sale of our Electronics and Power Systems US business units, which were finalized in the third quarter of 2008. In addition, the results set forth below have been adjusted to reflect the classification of our Applied Technology business unit as "held for sale" and the ultimate sale on January 11, 2010. The results of operations for the Applied Technology, the Electronics and the Power Systems US business units were captured in "Loss from discontinued operations." See Note D (Discontinued Operations) to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    29            Year Ended December 31, 2009 ("2009") Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 ("2008").              Revenue.     Total Company revenue decreased $1.8 million, or 3%, from $54.3 million in 2008 to $52.5 million in 2009.                                         Year Ended  December 31,                    (Amounts in Millions)          2009      2008      Change $      % Change          Product Revenue                                             Alternative Energy Products     $  47.7     $  52.2     $  (4.5  )     (9  )%      Other Legacy        4.8        2.1        2.7        129  %                                      Total Revenue     $  52.5     $  54.3     $  (1.8  )     (3  )%                                                  Alternative Energy Product revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 9%, from $52.2 million in 2008 to $47.7 million in 2009. This decrease was driven by the challenging macroeconomic market conditions and tough credit markets which affect our customers' ability to fund large scale renewable energy projects. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our legacy power products offerings of $2.7 million, or 129%, due to the recognition of revenue on previously delivered legacy products in the early part of 2009. We expect legacy product revenue to decline as we continue to focus efforts on our renewable energy solutions.             Gross Margin.     Total Company gross margin decreased from 15.6% in 2008 to 6.1% in 2009 due to lower volumes during the period and transition costs associated with expanding our manufacturing and supply chain internationally while maintaining existing capacity in North America. This global capacity expansion and low cost supply chain are crucial to our long term competitiveness, and were partially offset by material cost reductions and labor efficiency improvements in both factories. In addition, the $4.2 million of deferred frequency converter revenues recognized during 2009 had no gross margin as the amount recognized as revenue equaled the related costs recognized for the period.             Research and development expenses.     We expended approximately $8.4 million on research and development in 2009 compared with $5.1 million spent in 2008. The increase in spending during 2009 was driven by a planned increase in costs associated with certification of our new products and continued new product development, including increases in our technical staffing. These additional resources are developing the new products, features and customer solutions which we believe will allow us to take advantage of both short-term and long-term market opportunities. This investment in research and development is critical to both our current and future success and we anticipate this level of investment to continue.             Selling, general and administrative expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $3.6 million from $14.6 million in 2008 to $18.2 million in 2009. Approximately $0.9 million of the increase is directly attributable to compensation costs related to the issuance of stock options to our employees and directors charged to operations. Approximately $3.3 million of the increase was due to the higher sales and marketing costs related to international business development expansion into Europe and Asia, company re-branding and our increased outbound marketing efforts in 2009 compared to 2008. This was partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in general corporate costs.             Restructuring costs.     In August 2009, we eliminated certain positions within our operations and sales organizations in accordance with a plan of reorganization approved by the Board of Directors. As a result of the 2009 restructuring we recorded approximately $0.3 million in payroll and related costs for 2009. As of December 31, 2009 approximately $38,000 remains to be paid to the terminated employees. None of the terminated employees were required to provide any services subsequent to their receiving notification.    30                   In 2008, we initiated and completed the sale of the Electronics and Power Systems US operating divisions and formalized the release of personnel. As a result of these changes and the sale of the divisions in 2008, we accrued approximately $0.5 million in salary-related costs, costs associated with the modification of existing options held by certain of the severed employees and relocation costs.            Other costs associated with the restructuring that are related to the Electronics and Power Systems US divisions were recorded in their respective divisions and are included in the loss from discontinued operations for the periods presented, as discussed below, in loss from discontinued operations.             Change in fair value of warrant liabilities.     The change in fair value of the warrants for 2009 was a charge of approximately $5.7 million. Approximately $2.5 million related to the change in valuation of our Warrant As, Warrant Cs and placement agent warrants. The remaining $3.2 million charge related to our Series C Preferred Stock warrants and their change in fair value which was due to our adoption during the period of ASC 815-40-15. As a result of this adoption, warrants to purchase 19,799,022 shares of our common stock, originally classified as equity, were reclassified to warrant liabilities and were required to be fair valued moving forward. The change in fair value of the warrants for 2008 was a credit of approximately $0.3 million related solely to the Warrant As and Warrant Cs. In July 2009 warrants to purchase 19,799,022 shares of our common stock were modified resulting in these warrants being classified as equity and therefore not requiring any fair value adjustments in the future. See Note C.  Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of PresentationWarrant Liabilities  for a description of the modifications made to such warrants. The most significant factor that contributes to the change in fair value of the warrants is our stock price (See Note G Convertible Debt Instrument and Warrant Liabilities ).             Other Income (expense).     Other expense was approximately $0.3 million for 2009 compared to other income of approximately $0.7 million for 2008. Other expense for 2009 consists primarily of approximately $0.5 million related to the issuance of warrants to purchase 380,000 shares of common stock to holders of our Series C Preferred Stock for modifying the anti-dilution provisions of their existing warrants along with $0.1 million in fees paid related to consulting services for the valuation of our warrant instruments as well as other expenses not related to ongoing operations, offset by approximately $0.5 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances. Other income, net for 2008 consists primarily of approximately $0.7 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances.             Interest income.     Interest income decreased from approximately $0.2 million in 2008 to approximately $0 million in 2009. The decrease is directly attributable to our cash on hand and interest rates.            Interest expense.     Interest expense for 2009 was approximately $0.3 million, which is comprised primarily of the following:       $0.2 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility and       $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which were paid in shares of common stock.             In 2008 interest expense was approximately $0.3 million and was comprised of the following:       $0.2 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility and       $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which were paid in shares of common stock.    31            NAME="page_dk73701_1_32">                                                     Income (loss) from discontinued operations.     Loss from discontinued operations represents the results of operations of our Applied Technology, Power Systems US and Electronics divisions. Our Applied Technology division was sold in January 2010 and our Electronics and Power Systems US divisions were sold during the third quarter of 2008. The income from discontinued operations for 2009 was approximately $0.1 million as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of approximately $1.9 million in 2008. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" for more information related to the sale of these divisions.             Gain on sale of discontinued operations.     As a result of the sale of the Power Systems US and Electronics divisions in 2008, we recorded income of approximately $0.3 million. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" for more information related to the sale of these divisions and the composition of the net gain calculated for each division. The gain on the sale of our Applied Technology division will be recorded during our first quarter ended March 31, 2010 and is anticipated to be a gain of approximately $0.5 million.             Deferred Revenue.     Total deferred revenue was $6.0 million at December 31, 2009, comprised of $0.5 million of current deferred revenue and $5.5 million of long-term deferred revenue, a decrease of $0.7 million from the $6.7 million balance at December 31, 2008. We record deferred revenue (i) when a customer pays in advance or (ii) when provisions for revenue recognition on items shipped have not been achieved or the items have not yet been received by the customer due to shipping terms such as FOB destination. When an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties. Currently deferred revenue is composed of approximately $6.0 million, $0.4 million related to pre-payments on orders currently being manufactured and $5.6 million on deferred revenue related to extended warranties sold to customers that purchased our products.     Year Ended December 31, 2008 ("2008") Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2007 ("2007").              Revenue.     Total Company revenue increased $21.3 million, or 65%, from $33.0 million in 2007 to $54.3 million in 2008.                                         Year Ended  December 31,                    (Amounts in Millions)          2008      2007      Change $      % Change          Product Revenue                                             Alternative Energy Products     $  52.2     $  25.4     $  26.8        106  %      Other Legacy        2.1        7.6     $  (5.5  )      (72  )%                                      Total Revenue     $  54.3     $  33.0     $  21.3        65  %                                                  Product revenue increased by $21.3 million, or 65%, from $33.0 million in 2007 to $54.3 million in 2008. This was driven by the commercial adoption of our utility grade inverters, resulting in an annual increase of $26.8 million, or 106%. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our legacy power products offerings of $5.5 million, or 72%, as we continue to focus efforts on our renewable energy solutions.            Gross Margin.     Gross margins increased from (1.3)% in 2007 to approximately 15.6% in 2008 due to material cost reduction programs, increased labor efficiency and increased photovoltaic inverter unit volumes. In 2007, gross margins included an additional $1.3 million in cost overruns on a Navy project, for which we are seeking some economic relief due to design changes, increases in major component costs and increases in anticipated exchange rates; we have not booked any benefit for such relief as of December 31, 2008 or 2007.    32                    Research and development expenses.     We expended approximately $5.1 million on research and development in 2008 compared with $2.3 million spent in 2007. The increase in spending during 2008 was driven by an increase in technical staffing. These additional resources are developing the new products, features and customer solutions which we believe will allow us to take advantage of both short-term and long-term market opportunities. This investment in research and development is critical to both our current and future success and we anticipate this level of investment to continue.             Selling, general and administrative expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $6.6 million from $8.0 million in 2007 to $14.6 million in 2008. Approximately $1.1 million of the increase is directly attributable to compensation costs related to the issuance of stock options to our employees and directors charged to operations during 2008. Approximately $2.3 million of the increase was associated with increased corporate costs and approximately $3.2 million of the increase was due to the higher sales and marketing costs directly related to the increase in product revenue, international business development, company re-branding and our increased outbound marketing efforts in 2008 compared to 2007.             Restructuring costs.     In 2008 we successfully executed a restructuring of our company. In connection with the restructuring, we eliminated the positions of the presidents of the Applied Technology and Renewable Energy Solutions divisions, formalized the release of our Vice President of Finance and former Chief Executive Officer. In addition, we completed the sale of our Electronics and Power Systems US divisions. As a result of these significant changes in 2008, we recorded a charge of approximately $1.4 million in salary-related costs and costs associated with the modification of existing options held by certain of the severed employees. The cash component of this severance will be paid out over the next 12 months. Other costs associated with the restructuring that were related to the Electronics and Power Systems US divisions were recorded in the respective divisions and are included in the loss from discontinued operations for the periods presented, as discussed below. During 2007 we recorded approximately $0.1 million in restructuring costs associated with the 2006 restructuring of one of our business units.             Change in fair value of the convertible notes and related warrants.     The change in fair value of the convertible Notes and warrants for 2008 was a credit of approximately $0.3 million. The change in fair value of the convertible notes and warrants for 2007 was a charge of approximately $2.3 million. The most significant factor that contributes to the change in fair value of the convertible notes and related warrants is our stock price. The convertible notes were paid off in November 2007. (See Note G Convertible Debt Instrument and Warrant Liabilities )             Other Income (expense).     Other income was approximately $0.7 million for 2008 compared to other expense of approximately $0.5 million for 2007. Other income, net for 2008 consists primarily of approximately $0.7 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances. Other expense for 2007 consists primarily of a gain of approximately $0.4 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances and $0.1 million in consulting services related to the valuation of our Convertible Notes and other expenses not related to ongoing operations.             Interest income.     Interest income decreased slightly from approximately $0.3 million in 2007 to approximately $0.2 million in 2008. The decrease is directly attributable to our cash on hand.             Interest expense.     Interest expense for 2008 was approximately $0.3 million, which is comprised primarily of the following:       $0.2 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility and       $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which were paid in shares of common stock.    33                   In 2007 interest expense was approximately $3.8 million and was comprised of the following:       $0.7 million in non-cash interest related to the Convertible Notes, which was paid in shares of common stock,       $0.1 million in cash interest paid related to the Convertible Notes,       $0.2 million paid related to the short-term notes issued in November 2007, which were repaid in full on December 20, 2007,       $2.1 million in amortization of the debt discount related to the valuation of the Convertible Notes,      $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which were paid in shares of common stock, and       $0.6 million related to the change in the Series B Preferred Stock conversion price as a result of subsequent issuances of equity-based securities due to its anti-dilution provisions.              Loss from discontinued operations.     Loss from discontinued operations represents the results of operations of our Applied Technology, Power Systems US and Electronics divisions. The loss from discontinued operations for 2008 was approximately $1.9 million as compared to approximately $0.8 million in 2007. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" for more information related to the sale of these divisions.             Gain on sale of discontinued operations.     As a result of the sale of the Power Systems US and Electronics divisions in 2008, we recorded income of approximately $0.3 million. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" for more information related to the sale of these divisions and the composition of the net gain calculated for each division.            Deferred Revenue.     Total deferred revenue was $6.7 million at December 31, 2008, comprised of $4.2 million of current deferred revenue and $2.5 million of long-term deferred revenue, a decrease of $1.0 million from the $7.7 million balance at December 31, 2007. We record deferred revenue (i) when a customer pays in advance or (ii) when provisions for revenue recognition on items shipped have not been achieved or the items have not yet been received by the customer due to shipping terms such as FOB destination. When an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties. Deferred revenue as of December 31, 2008 is composed of approximately $3.4 million related to pre-payments received on an order which has been shipped but not recognized, $0.8 million related to pre-payments on orders currently being manufactured and $2.5 million on deferred revenue related to extended warranties sold to customers that purchased our products.     Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)             The following table presents unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2009. This data has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This data includes all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments, which we believe necessary for a fair presentation of this information. The operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period. In addition, all data set forth below has been adjusted to reflect the sale of our Applied Technology business unit in January 2010, and the sale of our Electronics and Power Systems US business units, which were finalized in the third quarter of 2008. The results of operations for the Applied Technology, Electronics and Power Systems US business units    34             are captured in the line item "Loss from discontinued operations" below.

As of December 31, 2009, $3.0 million is outstanding under our line of credit.             Based upon our current working capital position, current operating plans and expected business conditions, we believe that our current cash, as well as the availability from our line of credit with Silicon Valley Bank, will be adequate to fund our operations through December 31, 2010. Beyond 2010, we expect to fund our working capital needs and other commitments primarily through our operating cash flow, which we expect to improve as our product costs continue to decrease and as our unit volumes grow. We also expect to rely on our credit facility to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments. We have availability under our line of credit of $5.7 million as of January 31, 2010.             Our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted if we fail to realize our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses, or if we fail to remain in compliance with the covenants of our bank line. If either of those events occur, we may need to raise additional funds in order to sustain operations by selling equity or taking other actions to conserve our cash position, which could include selling of certain assets, delaying capital expenditures and incurring additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions in the 2007 preferred stock financing and in the credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. Such actions would likely require the consent of the Investors and/or Silicon Valley Bank, and there can be no assurance that such consents would be given. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds if they are required.            If additional funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders will experience additional dilution. The terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility. There can be no assurance that additional financing of any kind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially, adversely affect our results of operations.             We have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products. These costs have exceeded total revenue. As a result, we have incurred losses in each of the past five years. As of December 31, 2009, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $231.7 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through the sale of private equity securities and convertible debt, public security offerings, borrowings under our lines of credit and capital equipment leases.            As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents were $13.4 million, including restricted cash and cash equivalents of $34,000; this represents an increase in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately $3.4 million from the $10.0 million on hand at December 31, 2008. Cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $14.7 million as compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2009 was primarily attributable to the net loss from continuing operations of approximately $29.9 million offset by non-cash items such as the change in the fair value of our warrants, depreciation and amortization, deferred revenue, increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory, non-cash compensation and consulting expense, non-cash interest expense and decreases in working capital.             Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.8 million as compared to cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 was a result of capital expenditures of $3.8 million. Cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 was a    36             result of net proceeds from the sale of two of our divisions of $5.1 million offset by capital expenditures of $1.4 million.            Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $21.8 million as compared to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during 2009 includes approximately $21.5 million related to the sale of common stock and approximately $0.2 million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during 2008 includes borrowings under our line of credit of $3.0 million and approximately $1.7 million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants to purchase common stock, offset by approximately $0.6 million related to payments to certain Warrant A and Warrant C holders that exercised their redemption rights under these warrants.            Cash provided by discontinued operations was $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to cash used in discontinued operations of $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations was $0.6 million in 2009 compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.7 million in 2008. Net cash used in investing activities from discontinued operations was $0.1 million in 2009 compared to $0.2 million in 2008. Net cash used in financing activities from discontinued operations was $0 in 2009 and 2008.     Payments Due Under Contractual Obligations             The following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods:                              Calendar Years Ending December 31,          Capital Leases      Operating Leases          2010             $  1,246,183         2011                907,089         2012                386,949         2014                243,525         2015                251,643         Thereafter                411,287                             Total     $       $  3,446,676                                         We lease equipment and office space under non-cancelable capital and operating leases. The future minimum rental payments, as of December 31, 2009, under the capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms are included in the table above.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements             We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources.     Effects of Inflation             We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations.    37             NAME="dm73701_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">         Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                 The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.     Interest Rate Risk             We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities. In addition, our ability to fund working capital requirements may be impacted if we are not able to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates.            Our investing strategy, to manage interest rate exposure, is to invest in short-term, highly liquid investments. Our investment policy also requires investment in approved instruments with an initial maximum allowable maturity of twelve months. Currently, our short-term investments are in money market funds with original maturities of 90 days or less. At December 31, 2009, our short-term investments approximated market value.            At December 31, 2009 we had a revolving line-of-credit available to us of up to $10.0 million, of which $3.0 million was outstanding. Our revolving line-of-credit bears an interest rate of the Bank's prime rate plus 1%, which resulted in a rate of 5% at December 31, 2009.             The effect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2009 over the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows:                                 Interest Expense  Increase          Interest rates increase by 100 basis points     $  30,000         Interest rates increase by 200 basis points     $  60,000              Foreign Currency Risk             We face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates whenever we, or any of our subsidiaries, enter into transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than ours, or its, functional currency. Intercompany transactions between entities that use different functional currencies also expose us to foreign currency risk. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the net impact of foreign currency changes on transactions was a gain of $0.3 million. We do not use derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge such economic exposures.    38                   In addition, because a substantial portion of our earnings is generated by our foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. Dollar (in which we report our consolidated financial results), our earnings could be materially impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly that of the Canadian Dollar, upon the translation of the earnings of such subsidiaries into the U.S. Dollar. Mitigating this risk is the fact that a majority of our sales in our Canadian subsidiary are denominated in US dollars and therefore not subject to any movements in the exchange rate. If the U.S. Dollar had been uniformly stronger by 1%, 5% or 10%, compared to the actual average exchange rates used to translate the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries, our net product sales revenue would not have been materially impacted. Since a majority of operating costs in our Canadian subsidiary are incurred in their local currency movement in the exchange rate could impact our net income would have been impacted by approximately the following amounts:                                 Approximate  decrease in  net loss          If, during the year ended December 31, 2009, the U.S. dollar was stronger by:                  1%     $  541,000         5%     $  2,604,000         10%     $  4,970,000             39        NAME="page_fa73701_1_40">                                              NAME="fa73701_item_8._consolidated_financial__ite02490">      Item 8.    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
