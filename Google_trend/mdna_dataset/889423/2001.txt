Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS     Overview         We are developing enabling technologies for the emerging digital power marketplace which includes UPS systems, distributed power generation and power quality products. We manufacture power and energy management products that convert, store and manage electricity for businesses and consumers that require high-quality, uninterruptible power. We are utilizing our engineering and manufacturing expertise to develop products that serve the digital power marketplace, including UPS systems, power generation and power quantity products, industrial automation motors and controls, power electronics and controls, components for fuel cell and microturbine power generation systems, hybrid-electric vehicles and flywheel energy storage systems. We believe the family of products we are developing will be integral components of distributed power generation and power quality systems.         We have expanded our business and capabilities through the following acquisitions:       K&D Magmotor Corp.a manufacturer of custom and standard electric motors, acquired in January 1997.  Film Microelectronics, Inc.a manufacturer of thin film substrates and hybrid microelectronics, acquired in April 1997.  Inductive Components, Inc.a value-added supplier of customized electric motors, acquired in January 1999.  Lighthouse Software, Inc.a supplier of control software for machine tools, acquired in January 1999.  HyComp, Inc.a manufacturer of hybrid microelectronics, acquired in April 1999.  Ling Electronics, Inc.a manufacturer of shaker vibration test systems, power converters, amplifiers and controllers, acquired in October 1999.  Inverpower Controls Ltd.a manufacturer of power electronics modules and advanced high-speed digital controls, acquired in July 2001.         All of these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. In addition, in November 1999, we acquired intellectual property, tooling and other assets from Northrop Grumman Corporation. See Note O to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our acquisitions.        In May 1997, we formed Beacon Power Corporation ("Beacon Power") to develop stationary, terrestrial flywheel energy storage systems for commercial applications. On October 23, 1998, Beacon Power completed a $4.8 million private placement of its class D preferred stock and warrants to third-party investors, and we relinquished significant control of Beacon Power. As of October 23, 1998, we owned 0.1% of Beacon Power's voting stock and 67.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding capital stock. From June 1999 through March 31, 2000, Beacon Power was financed through the issuance of approximately $4.7 million of bridge notes and warrants to its investors, including $1.0 million from us. On April 7, 2000, Beacon Power issued 1,226,141 shares of its class E redeemable preferred stock and warrants to purchase 306,535 shares of its class class E preferred stock in exchange for the conversion of all of its outstanding bridge notes of which we received 347,407 shares of Beacon Power's Class E preferred stock and a warrant to purchase 86,852 shares of its class E preferred stock. As of April 7, 2000, we owned 11.0% of Beacon Power's voting stock and 61.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding capital stock. On April 21, 2000, Beacon Power raised an additional $4.1 million through the sale of additional bridge notes and warrants to purchase 82,000 shares of Beacon Power's common stock. We did not participate in this financing. On May 23, 2000, Beacon Power issued 6,785,711 shares of its    25          class F preferred stock and additional warrants to purchase shares of Beacon Power's common stock. The shares of class F preferred stock and the additional warrants were issued in consideration for the cancellation of $5.2 million in bridge notes and an additional $23.3 million cash investment by existing and new investors. We did not participate in this financing either. As of May 23, 2000, we owned 3.5% of Beacon Power's voting stock and 33.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding capital stock. As of September 30, 2000, we owned 3.5% of Beacon Power's voting stock and 32.1% of Beacon Power's outstanding capital stock on a common equivalent basis after taking all dividend accruals into account. On November 22, 2000, Beacon Power completed an initial public offering of its common stock and issued 8,000,000 shares of its common stock at $6.00 per share. Upon the closing of Beacon Power's initial public offering, each share of Beacon Power's class A, C, D, E and F preferred stock was converted into two shares of Beacon Power's common stock, or 29,359,530 shares of common stock, of which we received 9,691,440 shares of Beacon Power's common stock. In addition, upon the closing of Beacon Power's initial public offering, Beacon Power issued 873,794 shares of common stock in payment for consulting fees and accrued dividends on Beacon Power's class D and E preferred stock, of which we received 11,098 shares of Beacon Power's common stock. After these events, we owned approximately 25.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding voting stock. On December 19, 2000, Beacon Power issued an additional 1,200,000 shares of its common stock at $6.00 per share to cover over-allotments. As of December 19, 2000, we owned approximately 24.2% of Beacon Power's outstanding voting stock. On December 20, 2000, Beacon Power issued 985,507 shares of Beacon Power's common stock in connection with the cashless exercise of warrants to purchase common stock. As of December 20, 2000, we owned approximately 23.7% of Beacon Power's outstanding voting stock. On December 22, 2000, Beacon Power issued 997,369 shares of Beacon Power's common stock in connection with the cashless exercise of warrants to purchase common stock. As of December 22, 2000, we owned approximately 23.1% of Beacon Power's outstanding voting stock. On September 28, 2001, we distributed 5,000,000 shares of Beacon Power common stock to our stockholders. After the distribution, we owned approximately 11.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding voting stock. As of September 30, 2001, the Beacon Power common stock held by us had a fair value of $7,152,983.        The results of our operations include a $3.1 million loss of Beacon Power from May 8, 1997 to December 24, 1997 under the consolidation method of accounting. On December 24, 1997, we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 30/Topic 5.E (SAB 30), "Accounting for Divestiture of a Subsidiary or Other Business Operation," and have included 100% of Beacon Power's $7.1 million loss for the period from December 25, 1997 through May 1999 in a manner similar to the equity method of accounting, at which time, our initial investment of $1.9 million, the $30,000 additional investment and the additional deemed investment of $4.8 million and accrued dividends of $410,000 had been written down to zero. In June 1999, we committed up to $1.0 million of additional financing to Beacon Power, representing a minority share of a funding commitment received by Beacon Power, and we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power under the equity method of accounting and have included in our results through November 16, 2000 our share of Beacon Power's losses of $1.7 million. As of November 16, 2000, our additional investment in Beacon Power had been reduced to zero and our contingent obligation to Beacon Power's Class D preferred stockholders was $5.8 million. On November 17, 2000, Beacon Power listed its common stock on the Nasdaq National Market. In connection with the listing, the put right granted to the Class D preferred stockholders of Beacon Power was terminated and the contingent obligation to Class D preferred stockholders of Beacon Power was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. On November 22, 2000, Beacon Power completed an initial public offering of its common stock. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 51, our investment in Beacon Power and additional paid-in capital was written up to reflect our beneficial interest in the book value of the stockholders' equity of Beacon Power on November 22, 2000, which was approximately $15.0 million, less losses previously recorded in connection with the put right obligation in the amount of $5.8 million, for a net gain of $9.1 million. On December 19, 2000, Beacon Power issued an    26          additional 1,200,000 shares of its common stock at $6.00 per share to cover over-allotments. Our investment and additional paid-in capital was written up by $1.6 million in accordance with SAB No. 51 to reflect our beneficial interest in the increase in book value of the stockholders' equity of Beacon Power at December 19, 2000. After the write-up of our investment in Beacon Power, we continued to account for our investment in Beacon Power through September 28, 2001 under the equity method of accounting and recorded our share of losses of $5.1 million from Beacon Power.        Upon the distribution of the 5,000,000 shares, we recorded the distribution of the 5,000,000 shares as a reduction of additional paid-in-capital based on the book value per share prior to the distribution, or $0.59 per share. After the distribution, we owned approximately 11.0% of Beacon Power's outstanding voting stock. Additionally, we have determined that we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Beacon Power and, therefore, now account for our investment in Beacon Power using the fair value method as set forth in SFAS No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Debt and Equity Securities". We are no longer required to record our share of any losses from Beacon Power and the investment is carried at fair value and designated as available for sale and any unrealized holding gains or losses to be included in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). As of September 30, 2001, the Beacon Power common stock had a fair value of $7,152,983 and we recorded an unrealized gain of $4,364,035 in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). Additionally, we have a warrant to purchase 173,704 shares of Beacon Power's common stock that has an exercise price of $1.25 per share and expires in 2005. We account for this warrant in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, record the warrant at its fair value. As of September 30, 2001, the warrant to purchase Beacon Power common stock had a fair value of $201,436 and is included in warrants to purchase common stock on the accompanying balance sheet.        We recognize revenue from product sales in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition." Product revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable. Title to the product generally passes upon shipment of the product as the products are shipped FOB shipping point, except for certain foreign shipments. If the product requires installation to be performed by us, all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation. We provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized.        We perform funded research and development and product development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and, in some situations, the payment of a fee. These contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how costs compare with a budget. On fixed-price contracts, revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. Revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed. In each type of contract, we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts. All payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Adjustments are recognized in the period made. When the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for commercial product development contracts indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded. Any losses incurred in performing funded research and development projects are recognized as funded research and development expenses as incurred.         Cost of product revenue includes cost of product revenue including material, labor and overhead. Costs incurred in connection with funded research and development and other revenue arrangements and other revenue are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses.    27              We have incurred significant costs to develop our technology and products. These costs have exceeded total revenue. As a result, we have incurred net losses in each of the past five years. As of September 30, 2001, we had an accumulated deficit of $64.5 million. We intend to increase our capital expenditures and operating expenses to expand our manufacturing capabilities and for general corporate purposes, including product development activities, sales and marketing and administrative activities. Because we expect to continue to invest in our business ahead of anticipated future revenue, we expect to incur operating losses for at least the next two years.

Results of Operations        Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2001 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2000           Product Revenue.   Product revenue increased by $8.4 million or 37% from $22.4 million to $30.8 million. The increase was attributable to $6.1 million of increased revenue from Power Systems, of which Ling Electronics accounted for $4.9 million, magnetic levitation products and high-performance motors accounted for $666,000 and power products accounted for $521,000, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Inverpower. $2.3 million of increased revenue was attributable to Semiconductor Products.        Funded research and development and other revenue.   Funded research and development and other revenue increased by $2.3 million or 26% from $8.6 million to $10.9 million. This increase was primarily attributable to $2.7 million in funded research and development revenue from a new program to develop high power converter assemblies for the U.S. Navy's next generation of modern "all-electric" ships offset by a reduction of $400,000 in funded research and development revenue from a Department of Energy program to develop low-cost power conversion modules for electric and hybrid-electric vehicles. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, revenue from commercial contracts, which represents other revenue, is included in funded research and development and other revenue and amounted to $663,000 and $763,000, respectively.        Cost of product revenue.   Cost of product revenue increased by $8.8 million or 46% from $19.1 million to $27.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in product revenue. In addition, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, we provided a $1.2 million reserve for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to $659,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000. Gross margin from product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased from 15% to 10%.        Funded research and development and other revenue expenses.   Funded research and development and other revenue expenses increased by $598,000 or 9 %  from $6.8 million to $7.4 million. The    28          increase was primarily attributable to $1.9 million in funded research and development expenses from the U.S. Navy program offset by the reduction of $1.0 million of research and development expenses related to the Department of Energy program. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2001 and 2000, costs and expenses from commercial contracts, which represents other revenue expenses, are included in funded research and development and other revenue and amounted to $485,000 and $398,000, respectively.         Unfunded research and development expenses.   Unfunded research and development expenses increased by $2.8 million or 80% from $3.5 million to $6.2 million. The increase is due to increased focus on internally funded research and development projects including the power inverter for an on-site power generation system and our 250 kilowatt and 2.0 megawatt UPS and power quality systems.        Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3.6 million or 36% from $10.0 million to $13.6 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in selling expenses associated with the $10.6 million increase in total revenue and the inclusion of Ling Electronics for the entire fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 and Inverpower from July 13, 2001 to September 30, 2001. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, we provided a $541,000 reserve for doubtful accounts as compared to $266,000 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000. In addition, we recorded charges of $223,000, $175,000, $150,000 and $111,000 in settlement of litigation, consolidation of facilities, write-off of impaired assets and for acceleration of a stock option award vesting schedule, respectively, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.        Write-off of public offering costs.   On April 25, 2001, we converted our registration statement we initially filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 30, 2000 to a shelf registration statement. We have expensed $1.4 million of equity financing costs incurred in connection with the registration statements.        Amortization of intangibles.   Amortization of intangibles increased by $145,000 or 12% from $1.2 million to $1.4 million. The increase was the result of amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Ling Electronics in October 1999, certain intellectual property and other intangible assets from Northrop Grumman in November 1999 and certain intangible assets from Inverpower Controls Ltd. in July 2001. In addition, during 2001, we wrote-off an impaired intangible asset with a net book value of $61,000.        Net unrealized loss on warrants to purchase common stock.   During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001, we began accounting for our warrants to purchase Mechanical Technology Incorporated's common stock and the warrant to purchase Beacon Power's common stock in accordance with SFAS No. 133, and, therefore, we have recorded these warrants at their fair value at September 30, 2001 and recorded an unrealized loss of $1.5 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.        Other income (loss).   Other income increased to $584,000 or 27% from $460,000. The increase is the result of cash and cash equivalents being maintained in interest bearing accounts offset by an increase in interest expense associated with the increase in debt.        Loss from Beacon Power Corporation.   Loss from Beacon Power Corporation increased by $4.2 million from $899,000 to $5.1 million. In connection with Beacon Power's initial public offering in November 2000, our investment in Beacon Power and additional paid-in-capital was written up to reflect our beneficial interest in the book value of the stockholders' equity of Beacon Power, which was approximately $16.6 million, less losses previously recorded in connection with the put right obligation in the amount of $5.8 million for a net gain of $10.7 million. After the write-up of our investment in Beacon Power, we continued to account for our investment in Beacon Power under the equity method    29          of accounting and recorded our share of losses of $5.1 million from Beacon Power for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001.        Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.   On October 1, 2000, we began accounting for our warrants to purchase Mechanical Technology Incorporated common stock in accordance with SFAS No. 133 and, therefore, recorded a cumulative unrealized loss of $1.0 million as of October 1, 2000. On June 30, 2001, we began accounting for warrants to purchase our common stock that are designated as a liability in accordance with EITF 00-19, "Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own Stock", and, therefore, recorded a cumulative unrealized gain of $854,000 as of June 30, 2001 to record the warrants at fair value.       Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 2000 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended September 30, 1999           Product revenue.   Product revenue increased by $13.3 million or 146% from $9.1 million to $22.4 million. The increase was attributable to $11.3 million of increased revenue from Power Systems, of which Ling Electronics accounted for $7.4 million, magnetic levitation products accounted for $2.3 million, high-performance motors accounted for $1.3 million and power products accounted for $287,000. $2.0 million of increased revenue was attributable to Semiconductor Products.        Funded research and development and other revenue.   Funded research and development and other revenue increased by $2.3 million or 36% from $6.4 million to $8.6 million. This increase was attributable to an additional $2.4 million in funded research and development revenue from a Department of Energy program to develop low-cost power conversion modules for electric and hybrid-electric vehicles and was partially offset by our increased focus on internally funded research projects including the development of power conversion products for the distributed power generation market. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, revenue from commercial contracts, which represents other revenue, is included in funded research and development and other revenue and amounted to $763,000 and $768,000, respectively.        Cost of product revenue.   Cost of product revenue increased by $9.6 million or 100.5% from $9.5 million to $19.1 million. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in product revenue offset by improved plant utilization at MagMotor and Film Microelectronics. Gross margin from product revenue as a percentage of product revenue increased to 15% from (4%).        Funded research and development and other revenue expenses.   Funded research and development and other revenue expenses increased by $1.0 million or 17.5% from $5.8 million to $6.8 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an additional $1.8 million in funded research and development expenses related to the Department of Energy program. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2000 and 1999, costs and expenses from commercial contracts, which represents other revenue expenses, are included in funded research and development and other revenue expenses and amounted to $398,000 and $704,000, respectively.        Unfunded research and development expenses.   Unfunded research and development expenses increased by $2.7 million or 375.5% from $726,000 to $3.5 million. The increase was primarily attributable to an additional $1.1 million in unfunded research and development expenses related to the Department of Energy program.        Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.2 million or 13% from $8.8 million to $10.0 million. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of $2.9 million of costs from Ling Electronics, $800,000 of costs for facilities and staffing in an effort to meet expected growth and demand for our products and the inclusion of a full year of expenses related to Inductive Components and Lighthouse Software which were acquired in January 1999 and HyComp which was acquired in April 1999. These increases were offset by the    30          recording of $2.2 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options and warrants to consultants and $1.0 million of additional reserves for unbilled contract costs and fees and accounts receivable in 1999. Based on the facts and circumstances during 1999, we established a reserve of $521,000 for unbilled contract costs and fees related to a contract with the Department of the Air Force which was terminable by the Department of the Air Force if it determined that we were in default under the contract as discussed in Note H to our financial statements. In addition during 1999, we provided $513,000 in reserve for unbilled contract costs and fees and accounts receivable to properly reflect the reserve requirements.        Amortization of intangibles.   Amortization of intangibles increased $846,000 or 228% from $371,000 to $1.2 million. This increase was the result of amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisitions of Inductive Components and Lighthouse Software in January 1999, Ling Electronics in October 1999 and certain intellectual property and other intangible assets from Northrop Grumman in November 1999.        Other income (loss).   Other income increased to $460,000 from $224,000 of other loss. The increase was the result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents being maintained in interest-bearing accounts and a decrease of interest expense associated with our line of credit.        Loss from Beacon Power Corporation.   Loss from Beacon Power decreased by $3.4 million or 79% from $4.3 million to $899,000. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000, we recorded our share of Beacon Power's losses of $899,000, under the equity method of accounting. As of December 31, 1999, our investment in Beacon Power had been reduced to zero, however, we continued to record losses from Beacon Power to the extent of additional interest accrued on the contingent obligation to the class D preferred stockholders of Beacon Power. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999, we recorded 100% of Beacon Power's losses of $3.6 million in accordance with SAB Topic 5.E., in a manner similar to the equity method of accounting through May 1999 and in June 1999, we began accounting for our investment in Beacon Power under the equity method of accounting and recorded our share of Beacon Power's losses of $734,000 from June 1999 to September 1999.    31       NAME="page_dg3745_1_32">      Quarterly Results of Operations         The following table presents unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended September 30, 2001.

           32       NAME="page_dk3745_1_33">      Liquidity and Capital Resources         Since inception, we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through the sale of private equity securities, public security offerings, borrowings on our expired line of credit and capital equipment leases.        As of September 30, 2001, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $20.9 million, an increase of $12.1 million from September 30, 2000. Cash used in operating activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 was $11.0 million as compared to $5.5 million in 2000. Cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 was primarily attributable to our net loss offset by non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory, loss from Beacon Power, net unrealized loss from warrants to purchase common stock, write-off of impaired assets, amortization of prepaid consulting costs, non-cash compensation expense, common stock issued in connection with a settlement agreement, cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles and changes in working capital.        Cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 was $11.8 million as compared to $2.9 million in 2000. Net cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 included purchases of marketable securities of $9.8 million and capital expenditures of $2.2 million. We estimate that we will spend an additional $2.0 million on capital expenditures through fiscal year 2002 primarily at our Power Systems Division to expand our capacity to manufacture our power conversion products. We expect these additions will be financed principally from lease financing and, to a lesser extent, cash on hand.        Cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 was $25.1 million as compared to $14.7 million in 2000. Net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2001 includes $17.1 million of proceeds from the sale of common stock, $7.0 million from the exercise of common stock options and warrants and $1.5 million of proceeds from lease financing offset by $446,000 of repayment of long-term debt. In December 2000, we completed financing under an agreement for the lease of certain production equipment in the amount of $1.5 million previously entered into in August 2000. Payments are due in monthly installments of $40,000 from October 2001 through January 2002 and $19,705 from February 2002 through November 2005.        We anticipate that the existing $20.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund operations for at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financings within this time frame or that any additional financing, if needed, will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, if at all.    Factors Affecting Future Results         Our future results remain difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. These factors include business conditions within the distributed power, power quality, aerospace, transportation, industrial, utility, telecommunications, silicon wafer manufacturing, factory automation, aircraft and automotive industries and the world economies as a whole, and competitive pressures that may impact research and development spending. Our revenue growth is dependent on technology developments and contract research and development for both the government and commercial sectors and no assurance can be given that these investments will continue or that we will be able to obtain such funds. In addition, our growth opportunities are dependent on the introduction of new products that must penetrate distributed power, power quality, aerospace, transportation, industrial, utility, telecommunications, silicon wafer manufacturing, factory automation, aircraft and automotive markets. No assurance can be given that new products can be developed, or if developed, will be successful; that    33          competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from us; or that we can achieve or maintain profits in these or any new markets. Because of these and other factors, past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance. Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the market price of our common stock experiences significant volatility.    Effects of Inflation         We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements         In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 141, "Accounting for Business Combinations", and Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." These statements modify accounting for business combinations after June 30, 2001 and will affect our treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets at the start of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002; however, business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 should apply the new accounting guidelines. The statements require that goodwill existing at the date of adoption be reviewed for possible impairment and that impairment tests be periodically repeated, with impaired assets written down to fair value. Additionally, existing goodwill and intangible assets must be assessed and classified within the Statement's criteria. Intangible assets with estimated useful lives will continue to be amortized over those periods. Amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indeterminable lives will cease. At this time, we have not determined the complete impact of SFAS No. 142.        In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets, which supersedes SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed of, and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, SFAS No. 144 addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently reviewing this statement to determine its effect on our financial statements.    Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.         We develop products in the United States and sell them worldwide. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. Since our sales are currently priced in U.S. dollars and are translated to local currency amounts, a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets. Interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates, particularly since our investments are in short-term instruments. Based on the nature and current levels of our investments, however, we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure.    34       NAME="page_fa3745_1_35">        Item 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
