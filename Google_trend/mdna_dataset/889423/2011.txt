Overview             Satcon Technology Corporation ("Satcon" or "Company") is a leading clean energy technology provider of utility-grade power conversion solutions for the renewable energy market. We design and deliver advanced power conversion solutions that enable large-scale producers of renewable energy to convert clean energy into grid-connected, efficient and reliable electrical power.            Our power conversion solutions boost total system power production through systems intelligence, advanced command and control capabilities, industrial-grade engineering and total lifecycle performance optimization. Our power conversion solutions feature the widest range of power ratings in the industry. We also offer system design services and solutions for management, monitoring, and performance measurement to maximize capital investment and improve overall quality and performance over the entire lifespan of an installation     Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates             Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, receivable reserves, inventory reserves, intangible assets, contract losses, warranty reserves and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates were discussed with our Audit Committee.    25                   The significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:     Revenue Recognition             We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery of the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable. Title to the product passes upon shipment of the product, as the products are typically shipped FOB shipping point, except for certain foreign shipments. If the product requires installation to be performed by us, all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon the completion of the installation. If the product requires specific customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse, unless we can objectively and reliably demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied. When appropriate, we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized. If a contract involves the provision of multiple elements and the elements qualify for separation, total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element provided. The amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future. Revenue is recognized on each element as described above.            On occasion we enter into fixed-price contracts for which; revenue is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. Revenue from reimbursement contracts is recognized as services are performed. In each type of contract, we receive periodic progress payments or payment upon reaching interim milestones and retain the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts. All payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. Adjustments are recognized in the period made. When the current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs for product development contracts indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 there have been no provisions for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts. We expect revenue from the percentage of completion type contracts or from cost reimbursement contracts in future periods to be nominal.            Cost of product revenue includes material, labor and overhead.            Deferred revenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed, product shipped or installation completed. When an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties.            Unbilled contract costs and fees represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed due to contractual provisions or deferred costs that have not yet been recognized as revenue or billed to the customer.     Accounts Receivable             Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to be adequate, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.    26            Inventory             We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory, and costs are determined based on the first-in, first-out method of accounting and include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. We periodically review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and/or obsolete inventory within cost of product revenue based primarily on our historical usage, as well as based on estimated forecast of product demand. A significant decrease in demand for our products could result in a short-term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product development, and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Therefore, although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results.     Warranty             We offer warranty coverage for our products for period of 5 years after shipment. We estimate the anticipated costs of repairing products under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates. The assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are re-evaluated quarterly, at a minimum, in light of actual experience and, when appropriate, the accruals or the accrual percentage is adjusted based on specific estimates of project repair costs and quantity of product returns. Our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates of the percentage of units affected and the repair costs. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale of the related product, and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.      Warrant Liabilities             We determined the fair values of the investor warrants and placement agent warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate. Our stock price has the most significant influence on the fair value of the warrants. An increase in our common stock price would cause the fair values of warrants to increase, because the exercise prices of such instruments are fixed at $1.815 per share, and result in a charge to our statement of operations. A decrease in our stock price would likewise cause the fair value of the warrants to decrease and result in a credit to our statement of operations.      Income Taxes             The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including those outside the United States, which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. The income tax accounting process involves estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.            Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately $59.8 million as of December 31, 2010, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate    27            and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.            We account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. In addition, we are required to establish a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.            The tax years 1996 through 2010 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject, which are primarily in the United States, as carry forward attributes generated in years past may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities if they are or will be used in a future period. We are currently not under examination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other jurisdiction for any tax years. We did not recognize any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying financial statements. We would record any such interest and penalties as a component of interest expense. We do not expect any material changes to the unrecognized benefits within 12 months of the reporting date.     Redeemable Convertible Series B Preferred Stock             We initially accounted for our Series B Preferred Stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible Series B Preferred Stock and the warrants issued to the investors, and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities. We determined the initial value of the Series B Preferred Stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate. Prior to its conversion in October 2010, the Series B Preferred Stock had been classified within the liability section of our balance sheet.     Redeemable Convertible Series C Preferred Stock             Prior to the conversion of all the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock in October 2010, we initially accounted for the issuance of our Series C Preferred Stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible Series C Preferred Stock and the warrants issued to the investors, and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities and classifying the Series C Preferred Stock as temporary equity on the balance sheet between the captions for liabilities and permanent shareholder's equity. We determined the initial value of the Series C Preferred Stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate.            The re-pricing of the exercise price of the warrants issued in the first closing of the Series C Preferred Stock financing from $1.44 to $1.25, as described in Note I to our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, was treated as a cancellation of the original warrants issued on November 8, 2007 and a re-issuance or new warrants on December 21, 2007. The difference in fair value of the warrant was included in the allocation of net proceeds associated with the second closing of the Series C Preferred Stock on December 21, 2007. We treated this as a deemed dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2007 we recorded $11,947,881 as a deemed dividend to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, which included the beneficial conversion feature of $11,762,887 and $184,994 related to the accretion of the Series C Preferred Stock to its redemption value through the date that the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock may first exercise their redemption right. Prior to the conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock in October 2010, we were using the effective interest method to accrete the carrying value of the    28             Series C Preferred stock through November 8, 2011, at which time the value of the Series C Preferred Stock would have been $30.0 million, 120% of its face value.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements              See Note U of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.     Results of Operations             All data set forth below have been adjusted to reflect the sale of our Electronics, Power Systems US, and Applied Technology business units. The results of these were captured in "Loss from discontinued operations." See Note D (Discontinued Operations) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Year Ended December 31, 2010 ("2010") Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 ("2009").              Revenue.     Total Company revenue increased $120.8 million, or 230%, from $52.5 million in 2009 to $173.3 million in 2010.                                         Year Ended  December 31,                    (Amounts in Millions)          2010      2009      Change $      % Change          Product Revenue                                             Renewable Energy Solutions     $  173.3     $  47.7     $  125.6        263  %      Other Legacy                4.8        (4.8  )      (100  )%                                      Total Revenue     $  173.3     $  52.5     $  120.8        230  %                                                  Renewable Energy Solutions revenue increased by $125.6 million, or 263%, from $47.7 million in 2009 to $173.3 million in 2010. This increase was due to the broad market acceptance of our products domestically and overseas. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our legacy power products offerings of $4.8 million, or 100%, due to the recognition of revenue on previously delivered legacy products in the early part of 2009.            Gross Margin.     Total Company gross margin increased from 6.1% in 2009 to 25.4% in 2010 due to increased volumes during the period, lower material costs on many of our core products, as compared to prior years and the continued expansion of our manufacturing capacity and international supply chain. In addition we continue to see continuous improvements in our labor efficiency across our manufacturing facilities. In addition, approximately $4.2 million of deferred frequency converter revenues recognized during 2009 had no gross margin as the amount recognized as revenue equaled the related costs recognized for the period.             Research and development expenses.     We expended approximately $15.7 million on research and development in 2010 compared with $8.4 million spent in 2009. The increase in spending during 2010 was driven by a planned increase in costs associated with certification of our new products and continued new product development, including increases in our technical staffing. These additional resources are developing the new products, features and customer solutions which we believe will allow us to take advantage of both short-term and long-term market opportunities. This investment in research and development is critical to both our current and future success and we anticipate continued investment in this area.            Selling, general and administrative expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $16.4 million from $18.2 million in 2009 to $34.6 million in 2010. Approximately    29             $11.3 million of the increase was due to the higher sales and marketing costs related to international business development expansion into Europe and Asia, company re-branding and our increased marketing efforts in 2010 compared to 2009. Approximately $4.3 million of the increase was due to higher corporate costs. Approximately $0.8 million of the increase is directly attributable to compensation costs related to the issuance of stock options to our employees and directors.             Restructuring costs.     In August 2009, we eliminated certain positions within our operations and sales organizations in accordance with a plan of reorganization approved by the Board of Directors. As a result of the 2009 restructuring we recorded approximately $0.3 million in payroll and related costs for 2009. During 2010, in accordance with the plan of reorganization approved by the Board of Directors, we recorded approximately $0.8 million in payroll and related costs for 2010. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009 approximately $49,000 and $38,000, respectively, remained to be paid to the terminated employees. None of the terminated employees were required to provide any services subsequent to their receiving notification.             Change in fair value of warrant liabilities.     The change in fair value of the warrants for 2010 was a charge of approximately $3.2 million and was related solely to the change in valuation of our Warrant As, Warrant Cs and placement agent warrants. The change in fair value of the warrants for 2009 was a charge of approximately $5.7 million. In 2009, approximately $2.5 million related to the change in valuation of our Warrant As, Warrant Cs and placement agent warrants, and the remaining $3.2 million charge related to our Series C Preferred Stock warrants and their change in fair value which was due to our adoption of ASC 815-40-15 during the period. As a result of this adoption, warrants to purchase 19,799,023 shares of our common stock, originally classified as equity, were reclassified to warrant liabilities and were required to be fair valued moving forward. In July 2009 warrants to purchase 19,799,023 shares of our common stock were modified resulting in these warrants being classified as equity and therefore not requiring any fair value adjustments in the future. See Note C.  Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of PresentationWarrant Liabilities  for a description of the modifications made to such warrants. The most significant factor that contributes to the change in fair value of the warrants is our stock price (See Note G Warrant Liabilities ).             Other Income (expense).     Other expense was approximately $0.7 million for 2010 compared to other expense of approximately $0.3 million for 2009. Other expense for 2010 consisted primarily of approximately $0.6 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances and approximately $0.1 million related to the other expenses not related to ongoing operations. Other expense for 2009 consists primarily of approximately $0.5 million related to the issuance of warrants to purchase 380,000 shares of common stock to holders of our Series C Preferred Stock for modifying the anti-dilution provisions of their existing warrants along with $0.1 million in fees and other expenses not related to ongoing operations, offset by approximately $0.5 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances.             Interest income.     Interest income was approximately $0 million in 2010 and 2009.             Interest expense.     Interest expense for 2010 was approximately $1.5 million, which is comprised primarily of the following:       $0.8 million in cash interest relating to our subordinated debt agreement and $0.3 million in non-cash accretion on our subordinated debt agreement and       $0.4 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility             In 2009 interest expense was approximately $0.3 million and was comprised of the following:       $0.2 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility and    30               $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which were paid in shares of common stock.              Income (loss) from discontinued operations.     Income (loss) from discontinued operations represents the results of operations of our Applied Technology, Power Systems US and Electronics divisions. Our Applied Technology division was sold in January 2010 and our Electronics and Power Systems US divisions were sold during the third quarter of 2008. The income from discontinued operations for 2010 was approximately $30,000 and for 2009 was approximately $0.1 million. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to the sale of these divisions.             Gain on sale of discontinued operations.     As a result of the sale of our Applied Technology division in 2010, we recorded a gain of approximately $0.5 million. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to the sale of the Applied Technology division and the composition of the net gain calculated.             Deferred Revenue.     Total deferred revenue was $19.7 million at December 31, 2010, comprised of $8.1 million of current deferred revenue and $11.6 million of long-term deferred revenue, an increase of $13.7 million from the $6.0 million balance at December 31, 2009. We record deferred revenue (i) when a customer pays in advance or (ii) when provisions for revenue recognition on items shipped have not been achieved or the items have not yet been received by the customer due to shipping terms such as FOB destination. When an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties. Currently deferred revenue is composed of approximately $8.1 million related to pre-payments on orders currently being manufactured and $11.6 million on deferred revenue related to extended warranties sold to customers that purchased our products.     Year Ended December 31, 2009 ("2009") Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2008 ("2008").              Revenue.     Total Company revenue decreased $1.8 million, or 3%, from $54.3 million in 2008 to $52.5 million in 2009.                                         Year Ended  December 31,                    (Amounts in Millions)          2009      2008      Change $      % Change          Product Revenue                                             Renewable Energy Solutions     $  47.7     $  52.2     $  (4.5  )      (9  )%      Other Legacy        4.8        2.1        2.7        129  %                                      Total Revenue     $  52.5     $  54.3     $  (1.8  )      (3  )%                                                  Renewable Energy Solutions revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 9%, from $52.2 million in 2008 to $47.7 million in 2009. This decrease was driven by the challenging macroeconomic market conditions and tough credit markets which affect our customers' ability to fund large scale renewable energy projects. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our legacy power products offerings of $2.7 million, or 129%, due to the recognition of revenue on previously delivered legacy products in the early part of 2009. We expect legacy product revenue to decline as we continue to focus efforts on our renewable energy solutions.             Gross Margin.     Total Company gross margin decreased from 15.6% in 2008 to 6.1% in 2009 due to lower volumes during the period and transition costs associated with expanding our manufacturing and supply chain internationally while maintaining existing capacity in North America. This global capacity    31             expansion and low cost supply chain are crucial to our long term competitiveness, and were partially offset by material cost reductions and labor efficiency improvements in both factories. In addition, the $4.2 million of deferred frequency converter revenues recognized during 2009 had no gross margin as the amount recognized as revenue equaled the related costs recognized for the period.             Research and development expenses.     We expended approximately $8.4 million on research and development in 2009 compared with $5.1 million spent in 2008. The increase in spending during 2009 was driven by a planned increase in costs associated with certification of our new products and continued new product development, including increases in our technical staffing. These additional resources are developing the new products, features and customer solutions which we believe will allow us to take advantage of both short-term and long-term market opportunities. This investment in research and development is critical to both our current and future success and we anticipate this level of investment to continue.             Selling, general and administrative expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $3.6 million from $14.6 million in 2008 to $18.2 million in 2009. Approximately $0.9 million of the increase is directly attributable to compensation costs related to the issuance of stock options to our employees and directors charged to operations. Approximately $3.3 million of the increase was due to the higher sales and marketing costs related to international business development expansion into Europe and Asia, company re-branding and our increased outbound marketing efforts in 2009 compared to 2008. This was partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in general corporate costs.             Restructuring costs.     In August 2009, we eliminated certain positions within our operations and sales organizations in accordance with a plan of reorganization approved by the Board of Directors. As a result of the 2009 restructuring we recorded approximately $0.3 million in payroll and related costs for 2009. As of December 31, 2009 approximately $38,000 remained to be paid to the terminated employees. None of the terminated employees were required to provide any services subsequent to their receiving notification.            In 2008, we initiated and completed the sale of the Electronics and Power Systems US operating divisions and formalized the release of personnel. As a result of these changes and the sale of the divisions in 2008, we accrued approximately $0.5 million in salary-related costs, costs associated with the modification of existing options held by certain of the severed employees and relocation costs. Other costs associated with the restructuring that are related to the Electronics and Power Systems US divisions were recorded in their respective divisions and are included in the loss from discontinued operations for the periods presented, as discussed below, in loss from discontinued operations.             Change in fair value of warrant liabilities.     The change in fair value of the warrants for 2009 was a charge of approximately $5.7 million. Approximately $2.5 million related to the change in valuation of our Warrant As, Warrant Cs and placement agent warrants. The remaining $3.2 million charge related to our Series C Preferred Stock warrants and their change in fair value which was due to our adoption of ASC 815-40-15 during the period. As a result of this adoption, warrants to purchase 19,799,023 shares of our common stock, originally classified as equity, were reclassified to warrant liabilities and were required to be fair valued moving forward. The change in fair value of the warrants for 2008 was a credit of approximately $0.3 million related solely to the Warrant As and Warrant Cs. In July 2009 warrants to purchase 19,799,023 shares of our common stock were modified resulting in these warrants being classified as equity and therefore not requiring any fair value adjustments in the future. See Note C.  Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of PresentationWarrant Liabilities  for a description of the modifications made to such warrants. The most significant factor that contributes to the change in fair value of the warrants is our stock price (See Note G Warrant Liabilities ).             Other Income (expense).     Other expense was approximately $0.3 million for 2009 compared to other income of approximately $0.7 million for 2008. Other expense for 2009 consists primarily of    32             approximately $0.5 million related to the issuance of warrants to purchase 380,000 shares of common stock to holders of our Series C Preferred Stock for modifying the anti-dilution provisions of their existing warrants along with $0.1 million in fees paid related to consulting services for the valuation of our warrant instruments as well as other expenses not related to ongoing operations, offset by approximately $0.5 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances. Other income, net for 2008 consists primarily of approximately $0.7 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances.             Interest income.     Interest income decreased from approximately $0.2 million in 2008 to approximately $0 in 2009. The decrease is directly attributable to our cash on hand and interest rates.            Interest expense.     Interest expense for 2009 was approximately $0.3 million, which is comprised primarily of the following:       $0.2 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility and       $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which were paid in shares of common stock.             In 2008 interest expense was approximately $0.3 million and was comprised of the following:       $0.2 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility and       $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock, which were paid in shares of common stock.             Income (loss) from discontinued operations.     Loss from discontinued operations represents the results of operations of our Applied Technology, Power Systems US and Electronics divisions. Our Applied Technology division was sold in January 2010 and our Electronics and Power Systems US divisions were sold during the third quarter of 2008. The income from discontinued operations for 2009 was approximately $0.1 million as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of approximately $1.9 million in 2008. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to the sale of these divisions.             Gain on sale of discontinued operations.     As a result of the sale of the Power Systems US and Electronics divisions in 2008, we recorded income of approximately $0.3 million. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" for more information related to the sale of these divisions and the composition of the net gain calculated for each division. The gain on the sale of our Applied Technology division will be recorded during our first quarter ended March 31, 2010.             Deferred Revenue.     Total deferred revenue was $6.0 million at December 31, 2009, comprised of $0.5 million of current deferred revenue and $5.5 million of long-term deferred revenue, a decrease of $0.7 million from the $6.7 million balance at December 31, 2008. We record deferred revenue (i) when a customer pays in advance or (ii) when provisions for revenue recognition on items shipped have not been achieved or the items have not yet been received by the customer due to shipping terms such as FOB destination. When an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties. Currently deferred revenue is composed of approximately $6.0 million, $0.4 million related to pre-payments on orders currently being manufactured and $5.6 million on deferred revenue related to extended warranties sold to customers that purchased our products.    33        NAME="page_dm11901_1_34">                                                  Quarterly Results of Operations (Unaudited)             The following table presents unaudited quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2010.

As of December 31, 2010, $15.0 million was outstanding under our line of credit.            Based upon our current working capital position, current operating plans and expected business conditions, we believe that our current cash, and our asset based financing options, will be adequate to fund our operations through December 31, 2011. Beyond 2011, we expect to fund our working capital needs and other commitments primarily through our operating cash flow, which we expect to improve as our product costs continue to decrease and as our unit volumes continue to grow. We also expect to use our credit facility to fund a portion of our capital needs and other commitments. Subsequent to year end we repaid all amounts outstanding on the line of credit. We have availability under our line of credit of $15.0 million as of March 1, 2011.            Our funding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted if we fail to realize our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses, or if we fail to remain in compliance with the covenants of our bank line and subordinated debt. If either of those events occur, we may need to raise additional funds in order to sustain operations by selling equity or taking other actions to conserve our cash position, which could include selling of certain assets, delaying capital expenditures and incurring additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions in the credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. Such actions would likely require the consent of Silicon Valley Bank and/or the lender of our subordinated debt, and there can be no assurance that such consents would be given. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such funds if they are required.            If additional funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and our stockholders will experience additional dilution. The terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility. There can be no assurance that additional financing of any kind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially, adversely affect our results of operations.             We have incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products. These costs have exceeded total revenue. As a result, we have incurred losses in each of the past five years. As of December 31, 2010, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $243.5 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through the sale of private equity securities and convertible debt, public security offerings, borrowings under our lines of credit and capital equipment leases.            As of December 31, 2010, our cash and cash equivalents were $30.1 million; this represents an increase in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately $16.7 million from the $13.4 million on hand at December 31, 2009. Cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $46.9 million as compared to $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2010 was primarily attributable to the net loss from continuing operations of approximately $11.8 million offset by non-cash items such as the change in the fair value of our warrants, depreciation and amortization, deferred revenue, increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory, non-cash compensation and consulting expense, non-cash interest expense and decreases in working capital.             Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2010 was $4.1 million as compared to cash used in investing activities from continuing operations of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 was a result of capital expenditures.    35                    Cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $67.1 million as compared to $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during 2010 includes approximately $37.5 million related to the sale of common stock, $4.7 million related to the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock, $2.0 million related to the exercise of employee stock options, $12.0 million in borrowings under our line of credit, $11.8 million in proceeds from our subordinated debt agreement, offset by a $1.3 million payment to our Series C Preferred shareholders. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during 2009 includes approximately $21.5 million related to the sale of common stock and approximately $0.2 million received from the exercise of stock options and warrants.            Cash provided by discontinued operations was $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to cash provided by discontinued operations of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations was $0.1 million in 2010 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $0.6 million in 2009. Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was $0.7 million in 2010 compared to cash used in investing activities of $0.1 million in 2009. Net cash used in financing activities from discontinued operations was $0 in 2010 and 2009.     Payments Due Under Contractual Obligations             The following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods:                                    Calendar Years Ending December 31,          Capital  Leases      Principal  Payments on  Subordinated  Debt      Interest  Payments on  Subordinated  Debt      Operating  Leases          2011     $       $  2,541,720     $  1,417,799     $  1,414,392         2012                4,233,192        951,287        901,115         2013                4,797,531        386,947        716,768         2014                427,557        4,482        449,554         2015                                413,610         Thereafter                                151,527                                         Total     $       $  12,000,000     $  2,760,515     $  4,046,966                                                     We lease equipment and office space under non-cancelable capital and operating leases. In addition, in June 2010 we entered into a $12 million subordinated debt agreement. The future minimum principal and interest payments under the subordinated debt agreement and the future minimum rental payments as of December 31, 2010 are included in the table above.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements             We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources.     Effects of Inflation              We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on our income from continuing operations.    36             NAME="dm11901_item_7a._quantitative_and_qual__ite02669">         Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                  The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.     Interest Rate Risk             We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities. In addition, our ability to fund working capital requirements may be impacted if we are not able to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates.             To manage interest rage exposure our strategy is to invest in short-term, highly liquid investments. Our investment policy also requires investment in approved instruments with an initial maximum allowable maturity of twelve months. Currently, our short-term investments are in money market funds with original maturities of 90 days or less. At December 31, 2010, our short-term investments approximated market value.            At December 31, 2010 we had a revolving line-of-credit available to us of up to $15.0 million, of which $15.0 million was outstanding. Our revolving line-of-credit bears an interest rate of the Bank's prime rate plus 0.5% per annum, which resulted in a rate of 4.5% at December 31, 2010.             The effect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2010 over the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows:                                 Interest Expense  Increase          Interest rates increase by 100 basis points     $  150,000         Interest rates increase by 200 basis points     $  300,000              Foreign Currency Risk             We face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates whenever we, or any of our subsidiaries, enter into transactions with third parties that are denominated in currencies other than ours, or its, functional currency. Intercompany transactions between entities that use different functional currencies also expose us to foreign currency risk. During the year ended December 31, 2010, the net impact of foreign currency changes on transactions was a loss of $0.6 million. We have not historically used derivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge such economic exposures.            In addition, because a substantial portion of our earnings is generated by sales to foreign customers, which in many instances are denominated in the customers local currency, our earnings could be materially impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly that of the European Union and to a lesser extent the Canadian Dollar, upon the translation of the earnings into the U.S. Dollar. If the U.S. Dollar had been uniformly stronger by 1%, 5% or 10%, compared to the actual average exchange rates used to translate the financial results of our foreign sales, our net product sales revenue would not have been materially impacted, as depicted by the table below:                                 Approximate decrease  in net Revenue              (in millions)         If, during the year ended December 31, 2010, the U.S. dollar was stronger by:                  1%     $  0.8         5%     $  3.8         10%     $  7.7                   * During 2010 the reporting currency of our Canadian division was determined to be the U.S. Dollar.        37        NAME="page_fa11901_1_38">                                                 NAME="fa11901_item_8._consolidated_financial__ite02490">      Item 8.    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
