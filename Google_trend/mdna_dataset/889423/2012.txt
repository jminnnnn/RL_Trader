Overview            Satcon Technology Corporation ("Satcon" or "Company") is a leading clean energy technology provider of utility-grade power conversionsolutions for the renewable energy market. We design and deliver advanced power conversion solutions that enable large-scale producers of renewable energy to convert clean energy intogrid-connected, efficient and reliable electrical power.           Ourpower conversion solutions boost total system power production through systems intelligence, advanced command and control capabilities, industrial-grade engineering and totallifecycle performance optimization. Our power conversion solutions feature the widest range of power ratings in the industry. We also offer system design services and solutions for management,monitoring, and performance measurement to maximize capital investment and improve overall quality and performance over the entire lifespan of an installation    Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates            Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financialstatements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requiresmanagement to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financialstatements and the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition,receivable reserves, inventory reserves, contract losses, warranty reserves, long lived assets, and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factorsthat are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparentfrom other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates were discussed with our Audit Committee.   30                Thesignificant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:    Revenue Recognition            We recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, deliveryof the product to the customer has occurred and we have determined that collection of the fee is probable. Title to the product passes upon shipment of the product, as the products are typicallyshipped FOB shipping point, except for certain foreign shipments. If the product requires installation to be performed by us, all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon thecompletion of the installation. If the product requires specific customer acceptance, revenue is deferred until customer acceptance occurs or the acceptance provisions lapse, unless we can objectivelyand reliably demonstrate that the criteria specified in the acceptance provisions are satisfied. When appropriate, we provide for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized. If acontract involves the provision of multiple elements and the elements qualify for separation, total estimated contract revenue is allocated to each element based on the relative selling price of eachelement provided. The amount of revenue allocated to each element is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another element in the future. Revenue is recognized on eachelement as described above.           Costof product revenue includes material, labor and overhead.           Deferredrevenue consists of payments received from customers in advance of services performed, product shipped or installation completed. When an item is deferred for revenuerecognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recorded as a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consistsof cash received for extended product warranties.    Contract Losses            When the current estimates of total contract revenue for a customer order indicates a loss, a provision for the entire loss on thecontract is recorded. For the year ended December 31, 2011, we recorded a contract loss on a customer order of approximately $5.1 million. At December 31, 2011, there were noamounts accrued related to contract losses. The excess costs over projected revenues are recorded as a component of both cost of sales and research and development expense. For the years endedDecember 31, 2010 and 2009 there have been no provisions for anticipated contract losses on commercial contracts.    Accounts Receivable            Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance foruncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to beadequate, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required.    Inventory            We value our inventory at the lower of actual cost to purchase and/or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market valueof the inventory, and costs are determined based on the first-in, first-out method of accounting and include material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs. We periodicallyreview inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and/or obsolete inventory within cost of product revenue based primarily on our historical usage, as well as based on estimatedforecast of product demand. A significant decrease in demand for our products could result   31        ina short-term increase in the cost of inventory purchases and an increase of excess inventory quantities on hand. In addition, our industry is characterized by rapid technologicalchange, frequent new product development, and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand. Therefore, although we make everyeffort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand, any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value ofour inventory and our reported operating results.    Warranty            We offer warranty coverage for our products for period of 5 years after shipment. We estimate the anticipated costs of repairingproducts under warranty based on the historical or expected cost of the repairs and expected failure rates. The assumptions used to estimate warranty accruals are re-evaluated quarterly,at a minimum, in light of actual experience and, when appropriate, the accruals or the accrual percentage is adjusted based on specific estimates of project repair costs and quantity of productreturns. Our determination of the appropriate level of warranty accrual is based on estimates of the percentage of units affected and the repair costs. Estimated warranty costs are recorded at thetime of sale of the related product, and are recorded within cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.    Fair Value of Financial Instruments            Our financial instruments consist of cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled contract costs and fees, warrants to purchaseshares of common stock, accounts payable, subordinated notes payable, subordinated convertible notes and the line of credit. The estimated fair values have been determined through information obtainedfrom market sources and management estimates. Our warrant liability and subordinated convertible notes are recorded at fair value. The carrying value of the subordinated notes payable, as ofDecember 31, 2011, is not materially different from the fair value of the notes. The estimated fair values of the remaining financial instruments approximate their carrying values atDecember 31, 2011 and 2010.    Warrant Liabilities            We determined the fair values of the investor warrants and placement agent warrants using valuation models we consider to beappropriate. Our stock price has the most significant influence on the fair value of the warrants. An increase in our common stock price would cause the fair values of warrants to increase, becausethe exercise prices of such instruments are fixed at $1.815 per share, and result in a charge to our statement of operations. A decrease in our stock price would likewise cause the fair value of thewarrants to decrease and result in a credit to our statement of operations.    Income Taxes            The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in whichwe operate, including those outside the United States, which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the United States. The income tax accounting process involvesestimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as deferred revenue, for tax and accounting purposes. Thesedifferences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not tobe realized.           Significantmanagement judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferredtax assets. We   32        haverecorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately $86.4 million as of December 31, 2011, due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilizethese assets. The valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable. In theevent that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial positionand results of operations.           Weaccount for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method for accounting and reporting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilitiesare recognized based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. In addition, we are required to establish avaluation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.           Thetax years 1996 through 2011 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions to which we are subject, which are primarily in the United States, as carry forward attributesgenerated in years past may still be adjusted upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities if they are or will be used in a future period. We are currently not underexamination by the Internal Revenue Service or any other jurisdiction for any tax years. We did not recognize any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanyingfinancial statements. We would record any such interest and penalties as a component of interest expense. We do not expect any material changes to the unrecognized benefits within 12 months ofthe reporting date.    Subordinated Convertible Notes            The subordinated convertible notes include features that qualify as embedded derivatives, such as (i) the holder's right toconvert, (ii) our option to force conversion into shares of common stock of the Company, and (iii) the holder's prepayment options. We have elected to measure the subordinatedconvertible notes and the embedded derivatives in their entirety at fair value with changes in fair value recognized as either a gain or loss recorded in the statement of operations. This election wasmade by us after concluding that several of the derivatives cannot be reliably measured nor reliably associated with another derivative that can be reliably measured and determining that the aggregatefair value of the notes to be more meaningful in the context of our financial statements than if separate fair values were assigned to each of the multiple embedded instruments contained such notes.    Redeemable Convertible Series B Preferred Stock            We initially accounted for our Series B Preferred Stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net oftransaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemable convertible Series B Preferred Stock and the warrants issued to the investors, and then to any beneficial conversion rightscontained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities. We determined the initial value of the Series B Preferred Stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to beappropriate. Prior to its conversion in October 2010, the Series B Preferred Stock had been classified within the liability section of our balance sheet.    Redeemable Convertible Series C Preferred Stock            Prior to the conversion of all the outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock in October 2010, we initially accountedfor the issuance of our Series C Preferred Stock and associated warrants by allocating the proceeds received net of transaction costs based on the relative fair value of the redeemableconvertible Series C Preferred Stock and the warrants issued to the investors, and then to any beneficial conversion rights contained in the convertible redeemable preferred securities andclassifying the Series C Preferred Stock as temporary equity on the balance sheet between the captions   33        forliabilities and permanent shareholder's equity. We determined the initial value of the Series C Preferred Stock and investor warrants using valuation models we consider to be appropriate.           There-pricing of the exercise price of the warrants issued in the first closing of the Series C Preferred Stock financing from $1.44 to $1.25, as described inNote I to our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, was treated as a cancellation of the original warrants issued onNovember 8, 2007 and a re-issuance or new warrants on December 21, 2007. The difference in fair value of the warrant was included in the allocation of net proceeds associatedwith the second closing of the Series C Preferred Stock on December 21, 2007. We treated this as a deemed dividend on the Series C Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2007we recorded $11,947,881 as a deemed dividend to the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock, which included the beneficial conversion feature of $11,762,887 and $184,994 related to theaccretion of the Series C Preferred Stock to its redemption value through the date that the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock may first exercise their redemption right. Prior tothe conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock in October 2010, we were using the effective interest method to accrete the carrying value of the Series C Preferred stock throughNovember 8, 2011, at which time the value of the Series C Preferred Stock would have been $30.0 million, 120% of its face value.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements            See Note U of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K forinformation regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.    Results of Operations            All data set forth below have been adjusted to reflect the sale of our Applied Technology business units. The results of thediscontinued operation were captured in "Gain from discontinued operations." See Note D (Discontinued Operations) to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report onForm 10-K.    Year Ended December 31, 2011 ("2011") Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2010 ("2010").            Revenue.     Total Company revenue increased $15.3 million, or 8.8%, from $173.3 million in 2010 to $188.6 million in 2011.                              Year Ended December 31,                    (Amounts in Millions)      2011      2010      Change $      % Change          Product Revenue                                             Renewable Energy Solutions     $  188.6     $  173.3     $  15.3        8.8  %                                      Total Revenue     $  188.6     $  173.3     $  15.3        8.8  %                                              RenewableEnergy Solutions revenue increased by approximately $15.3 million, or 8.8%, from approximately $173.3 million in 2010 to approximately $188.6 million in2011. The increase in Renewable Energy Solutions revenue was primarily attributable to sales in the United States. Sales in the United States accounted for approximately $138.2 million, or 73%of our product revenue for the period compared to approximately $76.1 million, or 44% for the same period in 2010. International product revenues declined from approximately$97.2 million, or 56% in 2010 to approximately $50.3 million, or 27% in 2011. The decline in international product revenues is a direct result of macroeconomic conditions in Europe,offset by modest revenue growth in Asia.            Gross margin.     Total Company gross margin decreased from 25.4% in 2010 to less than one percent in 2011. The decline in gross margin wasprimarily dueto the continued reduction in market   34        pricing,cost overruns related to a significant project, the mix of products sold as compared to 2010 approximately $17.2 million in charges for excess inventories and $8.2 million incharges related to non-cancellable purchase commitments as of December 31, 2011. This decrease is partially offset by our continued material cost reduction programs, and thecontinued transfer of a significant portion of our inverter manufacturing to our contract manufacturer in China.            Research and development expenses.     We expended approximately $26.8 million on research and development in 2011 compared with$15.7 million spent in 2010. Approximately $4.1 million of the increase was attributable to one-time expense for research and development charges associated with a newproduct line. The balance of the increase in spending during 2011 was driven by a planned increase in costs associated with certification of our new products and continued new product development,including increases in our technical staffing. These additional resources are developing the new products, features and customer solutions which we believe will allow us to take advantage of bothshort-term and long-term market opportunities. This investment in research and development is critical to both our current and future success and we anticipate continuedinvestment in this area.           Selling, general and administrative expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $12.9 millionfrom$34.6 million in 2010 to $47.5 million in 2011. Approximately $4.4 million of the increase was due to the higher legal and general corporate costs in 2011 compared to 2010.Approximately $4.3 million of the increase was due to higher sales and marketing costs directly related to international business development in both Europe and Asia. Approximately$1.7 million related to the increase in the provision of uncollectable accounts. In addition, approximately $1.3 million of the increase is directly attributable to compensation costsrelated to the issuance of stock options to our employees and directors.           Restructuring charges.     In 2011, we eliminated certain positions across the organization in accordance with plans of reorganizationapproved bymanagement. As a result we recorded approximately $3.0 million in payroll and related costs for 2011. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $1.5 million remains outstanding to bepaid. None of the terminated employees were required to provide services subsequent to their receiving notification of termination. During 2010, in accordance with the plan of reorganization approvedby the Board of Directors, we recorded approximately $0.8 million in payroll and related costs for 2010. As of December 31, 2010 approximately $49,000 remained to be paid to theterminated employees. None of the terminated employees were required to provide any services subsequent to their receiving notification.            Change in fair value of note and warrants.     The change in fair value of note and warrants for 2011 was a credit of approximately$1.8 million.The change in fair value of the note and warrants consists primarily of a credit related to the change in valuation of our Warrant As, Warrant Cs and placement agent warrants of$2.5 million and a charge of $0.7 million related to our Subordinated Convertible Notes. The change in fair value of the warrants for 2010 was a charge of approximately$3.2 million related to the change in valuation of our Warrant As and Warrant Cs and placement agent warrants in 2010. See Note C.  SignificantAccounting Policies and Basis of PresentationWarrant Liabilities and Subordinated Convertible Note . The most significant factor that contributes to the change infair value of the note and warrants is our stock price (See Note G Warrant Liabilities and Note HDebtInstruments ).            Loss on extinguishment of debt.     Loss on extinguishment of debt for 2011 was approximately $2.8 million. The loss was the result ofamodification to the terms of the Subordinated Convertible Notes on December 1, 2011. (see Note HDebt Instruments).           Other expense.     Other expense was approximately $1.5 million for 2011 compared to other expense of approximately $0.7 millionfor 2010.Other expense for 2011 consisted primarily of approximately $1.6 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and the translation of inter-company   35        balancesand approximately $0.1 million related to other income not related to ongoing operations. Other expense for 2010 consisted primarily of approximately $0.6 million related toforeign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances and approximately $0.1 million related to the other expenses not related to ongoing operations.            Interest income.     Interest income was approximately $0.4 million in 2011 compared to $0 in 2010. Interest income in 2011 representsaccruedinterest on a note receivable for which the balance was outstanding at December 31, 2011.            Interest expense.     Interest expense for 2011 was approximately $4.7 million, which is comprised primarily of thefollowing:     $1.4 million in cash interest relating to our subordinated debt agreement and $0.5 million innon-cash accretion on our subordinated debt agreement and    $1.7 million in cash interest relating to our Subordinated Convertible Note      $1.1 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility            In2010 interest expense was approximately $1.5 million and was comprised of the following:     0.8 million in cash interest relating to our subordinated note and $0.3 million in non-cashaccretion on our subordinated note and    $0.4 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility             Provision for income taxes.     Provision for income taxes was approximately $0.3 million for 2011 as compared to $0 for 2010. Theprovision forincome taxes relates to taxes for both China and California.           Income (loss) from discontinued operations.     Income (loss) from discontinued operations represents theresults of operations of our Applied Technology division. Our Applied Technology division was sold in January 2010. The income from discontinued operations for 2011 and 2010 was approximately $0 and$30,000. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to the sale ofthis division.            Gain on sale of discontinued operations.     As a result of the sale of our Applied Technology division in 2010, we recorded a gain ofapproximately$0.5 million. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related tothe sale of the Applied Technology division and the composition of the net gain calculated.            Deferred Revenue.     Total deferred revenue was $31.5 million at December 31, 2011, comprised of $6.0 million of currentdeferredrevenue and $25.5 million of long-term deferred revenue, an increase of $12.8 million from the $18.7 million balance at December 31, 2010. We record deferredrevenue (i) when a customer pays in advance or (ii) when provisions for revenue recognition on items shipped have not been achieved or the items have not yet been received by thecustomer due to shipping terms such as FOB destination. When an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recordedas a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties. Currently deferred revenue is composed of approximately$5.2 million related to pre-payments on orders currently being manufactured and $26.3 million on deferred revenue related to extended warranties sold to customers thatpurchased our products.   36                        Year Ended December 31, 2010 ("2010") Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2009 ("2009").            Revenue.     Total Company revenue increased $120.8 million, or 230%, from $52.5 million in 2009 to $173.3 million in 2010.                              Year Ended December 31,                    (Amounts in Millions)      2010      2009      Change $      % Change          Product Revenue                                             Renewable Energy Solutions     $  173.3     $  47.7     $  125.6        263  %      Other Legacy                4.8        (4.8  )      (100  )%                                      Total Revenue     $  173.3     $  52.5     $  120.8        230  %                                              RenewableEnergy Solutions revenue increased by $125.6 million, or 263%, from $47.7 million in 2009 to $173.3 million in 2010. This increase was due to the broadmarket acceptance of our products domestically and overseas. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our legacy power products offerings of $4.8 million, or 100%, due to therecognition of revenue on previously delivered legacy products in the early part of 2009.           Gross margin.     Total Company gross margin increased from 6.1% in 2009 to 25.4% in 2010 due to increased volumes during the period, lowermaterialcosts on many of our core products, as compared to prior years and the continued expansion of our manufacturing capacity and international supply chain. In addition we continue to see continuousimprovements in our labor efficiency across our manufacturing facilities. In addition, approximately $4.2 million of deferred frequency converter revenues recognized during 2009 had no grossmargin as the amount recognized as revenue equaled the related costs recognized for the period.           Research and development expenses.     We expended approximately $15.7 million on research and development in 2010 compared with$8.4 million spent in 2009. The increase in spending during 2010 was driven by a planned increase in costs associated with certification of our new products and continued new productdevelopment, including increases in our technical staffing. These additional resources are developing the new products, features and customer solutions which we believe will allow us to take advantageof both short-term and long-term market opportunities. This investment in research and development is critical to both our current and future success and we anticipatecontinued investment in this area.           Selling, general and administrative expenses.     Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $16.4 millionfrom$18.2 million in 2009 to $34.6 million in 2010. Approximately $11.3 million of the increase was due to the higher sales and marketing costs related to international businessdevelopment expansion into Europe and Asia, company re-branding and our increased marketing efforts in 2010 compared to 2009. Approximately $4.3 million of the increase was due tohigher corporate costs. Approximately $0.8 million of the increase is directly attributable to compensation costs related to the issuance of stock options to our employees and directors.           Restructuring costs.     In August 2009, we eliminated certain positions within our operations and sales organizations in accordancewith a planof reorganization approved by the Board of Directors. As a result of the 2009 restructuring we recorded approximately $0.3 million in payroll and related costs for 2009. During 2010, inaccordance with the plan of reorganization approved by the Board of Directors, we recorded approximately $0.8 million in payroll and related costs for 2010. As of December 31, 2010 and2009 approximately $49,000 and $38,000, respectively, remained to be paid to the terminated employees. None of the terminated employees were required to provide any services subsequent to theirreceiving notification.   37                 Change in fair value of warrants.     The change in fair value of the warrants for 2010 was a charge of approximately $3.2 million andwas relatedsolely to the change in valuation of our Warrant As, Warrant Cs and placement agent warrants. The change in fair value of the warrants for 2009 was a charge of approximately$5.7 million. In 2009, approximately $2.5 million related to the change in valuation of our Warrant As, Warrant Cs and placement agent warrants, and the remaining$3.2 million charge related to our Series C Preferred Stock warrants and their change in fair value which was due to our adoption of ASC 815-40-15 duringthe period. As a result of this adoption, warrants to purchase 19,799,023 shares of our common stock, originally classified as equity, were reclassified to warrant liabilities and were required to befair valued moving forward. In July 2009 warrants to purchase 19,799,023 shares of our common stock were modified resulting in these warrants being classified as equity and therefore notrequiring any fair value adjustments in the future. See Note C.  Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of PresentationWarrantLiabilities  for a description of the modifications made to such warrants. The most significant factor that contributes to the change in fair value of the warrants is our stockprice (See Note G Warrant Liabilities ).            Other Income (expense).     Other expense was approximately $0.7 million for 2010 compared to other expense of approximately$0.3 millionfor 2009. Other expense for 2010 consisted primarily of approximately $0.6 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation of inter-company balances and approximately$0.1 million related to the other expenses not related to ongoing operations. Other expense for 2009 consists primarily of approximately $0.5 million related to the issuance of warrantsto purchase 380,000 shares of common stock to holders of our Series C Preferred Stock for modifying the anti-dilution provisions of their existing warrants along with$0.1 million in fees and other expenses not related to ongoing operations, offset by approximately $0.5 million related to foreign exchange impact of operations and translation ofinter-company balances.            Interest income.     Interest income was approximately $0 million in 2010 and 2009.           Interest expense.     Interest expense for 2010 was approximately $1.5 million, which is comprised primarily of thefollowing:     $0.8 million in cash interest relating to our subordinated debt agreement and $0.3 million innon-cash accretion on our subordinated debt agreement and    $0.4 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility            In2009 interest expense was approximately $0.3 million and was comprised of the following:     $0.2 million in cash interest relating to our credit facility and      $0.1 million of non-cash interest associated with dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock,which were paid in shares of common stock.             Income (loss) from discontinued operations.     Income (loss) from discontinued operations represents the results of operations of ourAppliedTechnology, Power Systems US and Electronics divisions. Our Applied Technology division was sold in January 2010 and our Electronics and Power Systems US divisions were sold during the thirdquarter of 2008. The income from discontinued operations for 2010 was approximately $30,000 and for 2009 was approximately $0.1 million. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" of ourConsolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to the sale of these divisions.            Gain on sale of discontinued operations.     As a result of the sale of our Applied Technology division in 2010, we recorded a gain ofapproximately$0.5 million. See Note D "Discontinued Operations" of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related tothe sale of the Applied Technology division and the composition of the net gain calculated.   38                 Deferred Revenue.     Total deferred revenue was $19.7 million at December 31, 2010, comprised of $8.1 million of currentdeferredrevenue and $11.6 million of long-term deferred revenue, an increase of $13.7 million from the $6.0 million balance at December 31, 2009. We record deferredrevenue (i) when a customer pays in advance or (ii) when provisions for revenue recognition on items shipped have not been achieved or the items have not yet been received by thecustomer due to shipping terms such as FOB destination. When an item is deferred for revenue recognition purposes, the deferred revenue is recorded as a liability and the deferred costs are recordedas a component of inventory in our consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue also consists of cash received for extended product warranties. Currently deferred revenue is composed of approximately$8.1 million related to pre-payments on orders currently being manufactured and $11.6 million on deferred revenue related to extended warranties sold to customers thatpurchased our products.

As of December 31, 2011,$34.7 million was outstanding under our line of credit.           Basedupon our current working capital position, current operating plans and expected business conditions, we believe that our current cash and our asset based financing options will beadequate to fund our operations through March 31, 2013. Beyond 2012, we expect to fund our working capital   40        needsand other commitments primarily through our operating cash flow, which we expect to improve as the impact of our December 2011 restructuring take effect, significantly lowering ouroperating costs from those in prior years, the continued decrease in our product costs and the continued growth of our unit volumes. We also expect to use our credit facility to fund a portion of ourcapital needs and other commitments.           Ourfunding plans for our working capital needs and other commitments may be adversely impacted if we fail to realize our underlying assumed levels of revenues and expenses, or if wefail to remain in compliance with the covenants of our bank line (minimum liquidity, defined as cash on hand and availability under the line in excess of $15.0 million at any time),subordinated debt or subordinated convertible notes. If any of these events were to occur, we may need to raise additional funds in order to sustain operations by selling equity or taking otheractions to conserve our cash position, which could include selling of certain assets, delaying capital expenditures and incurring additional indebtedness, subject to the restrictions in the creditfacility with Silicon Valley Bank, our subordinated debt and the subordinated convertible notes. Such actions would likely require the consent of Silicon Valley Bank, the lender of our subordinateddebt and/or the holder of our subordinated convertible notes, and there can be no assurance that such consents would be given. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise suchfunds if they are required.           Ifadditional funds are raised in the future through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and ourstockholders will experience additional dilution. The terms of additional funding may also limit our operating and financial flexibility. There can be no assurance that additional financing of anykind will be available to us on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Failure to obtain future funding when needed or on acceptable terms would materially, adversely affect our results of operations.           Wehave incurred significant costs to develop our technologies and products. These costs have exceeded total revenue. As a result, we have incurred losses in each of the past five years.As of December 31, 2011, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $326.9 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirementsprimarily through the sale of private equity securities and convertible debt, public security offerings, borrowings under our lines of credit and capital equipment leases.           Asof December 31, 2011, our cash and cash equivalents were $21.6 million; this represents a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents of approximately $8.5 millionfrom the $30.1 million on hand at December 31, 2010. Cash used in operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $38.3 million ascompared to $46.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2011 was primarilyattributable to the net loss from continuing operations of approximately $83.4 million offset by non-cash items such as the change in the fair value of our warrants, depreciationand amortization, deferred revenue, increases in allowances for uncollectible accounts and excess and obsolete inventory, non-cash compensation and consulting expense, non-cashinterest expense and decreases in working capital.           Cashused in investing activities from continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2011 was $5.7 million as compared to cash used in investing activities fromcontinuing operations of $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended December 31,2011 and 2010 was a result of capital expenditures.           Cashprovided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $35.5 million as compared to $67.1 million for the yearended December 31, 2010. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during 2011 includes approximately $16.0 million ($14.9 million including cost ofissuance) related to the subordinated convertible notes   41        issuedin June 2011, $1.9 million related to the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock, $0.6 million related to the exercise of employee stock options,$19.7 million in borrowings under our line of credit and $1.0 million related to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Net cashprovided by financing activities from continuing operations during 2010 includes approximately includes approximately $37.5 million related to the sale of common stock, $4.7 millionrelated to the exercise of warrants to purchase common stock, $2.0 million related to the exercise of employee stock options, $12.0 million in borrowings under our line of credit,$11.8 million in proceeds from our subordinated debt agreement, offset by a $1.3 million payment to our Series C Preferred shareholders.           Cashprovided by discontinued operations was $0 and $0.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities fromdiscontinued operations was $0 and $0.1 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations was $0 and $0.7 million in 2011 and2010, respectively. Net cash used in financing activities from discontinued operations was $0 in 2011 and 2010.    Payments Due Under Contractual Obligations            The following table summarizes the payments due under our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011, and the effect suchobligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods:                            Calendar Years Ending December 31,      Principal and Interest Payments on Subordinated Note Payable      Operating Leases      Principal and Interest Payments on Subordinated Convertible Note      Non-Cancellable Purchase Orders      Total          2012     $  5,184,479     $  2,697,135     $  10,791,013        28,613,000     $  47,285,627         2013        5,184,478        2,237,841        4,909,365                12,331,684         2014        432,039        2,234,471                        2,666,510         2015                1,680,105                        1,680,105         2016                1,526,255                        1,526,255         Thereafter                890,315                        890,315                                               Total     $  10,800,996     $  11,266,122     $  15,700,378        28,613,000     $  66,380,496                                                       Welease furniture, equipment and office space under non-cancellable operating leases. In addition, in June 2010 we entered into a $12.0 million subordinatednote payable and in June 2011 we entered into a $16.0 million subordinated convertible note agreement. The future minimum principal and interest payments under the subordinated notepayable, the subordinated convertible note and the future minimum rental payments as of December 31, 2011 are included in the table above. Our non-cancellable purchase orders arefor the purchase of materials form several of our key vendors.    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements            We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raisingcapital, incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are notconsolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources.    Effects of Inflation            We believe that inflation and changing prices over the past three years have not had a significant impact on our net revenue or on ourincome from continuing operations.   42                  Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK                The following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materiallyfrom those discussed in the forward-looking statements. See "Forward-Looking Statements" above in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We are exposedto market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.    Interest Rate Risk            We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily through our investing and financing activities. In addition, ourability to fund working capital requirements may be impacted if we are not able to obtain appropriate financing at acceptable rates.           Tomanage interest rage exposure our strategy is to invest in short-term, highly liquid investments. Our investment policy also requires investment in approved instrumentswith an initial maximum allowable maturity of twelve months. Currently, we have no short-term investments.           AtDecember 31, 2011 we had a revolving line-of-credit available to us of up to $35.0 million, reduced by outstanding letters of credit of$0.3 million as of December 31, 2011, of which $34.7 million was outstanding. Our revolving line-of-credit bears an interest rate of the Bank's prime rateplus 0.5% per annum, which resulted in a rate of 4.5% at December 31, 2011.           Theeffect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2011 over the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows:                      Interest Expense Increase          Interest rates increase by 100 basis points     $  350,000         Interest rates increase by 200 basis points     $  700,000          Foreign Currency Risk            We face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates whenever we, or any of our subsidiaries, enter into transactions withthird parties that are denominated in currencies other than ours, or its, functional currency. Intercompany transactions between entities that use different functional currencies also expose us toforeign currency risk. During the year ended December 31, 2011, the net impact of foreign currency changes on transactions was a loss of $1.6 million. We have not historically usedderivative financial instruments or other financial instruments to hedge such economic exposures.           Onoccasion, we use foreign currency contracts to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables. Weprimarily hedge foreign currency exposure to the Euro. We do not engage in trading, market making or speculative activities in the derivatives markets. The foreign currency contracts utilized by us donot qualify for hedge accounting treatment, and as a result, any fluctuations in the value of these foreign currency contracts are recognized in other loss (income) in our consolidated statements ofoperations as incurred. The fluctuations in the value of these foreign currency contracts do, however, largely offset the impact of changes in the value of the underlying risk that they are intendedto economically hedge. In April 2011, we entered into a foreign currency hedge with a bank with a notational amount of approximately $1.6 million, which matured in July 2011.There were no foreign currency hedges outstanding at December 31, 2011.   43                             Item 8.    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA
