ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND            RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    INTRODUCTION    SatCon Technology Corporation (the "Company" or "SatCon") was organized as a   Massachusetts corporation in February 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in   1992. SatCon designs, develops, and manufactures intelligent, electro-   mechanical products for aerospace, transportation, industrial, and utility   applications. SatCon's electro-mechanical products are being developed for a   wide variety of U.S. government and commercial markets. For the government,   SatCon's electro-mechanical systems provide low vibration and high power for   applications ranging from satellite attitude control to high speed drives for   shipboard systems. In the transportation segment, SatCon is developing   electric and hybrid electric drive components, auxiliary power units, and   advanced steering, suspension, and braking systems. SatCon is working with   major equipment producers to develop process equipment drives, high speed and   precision machine tools, manipulators, and machinery isolation equipment.   SatCon's electro-mechanical systems may offer to the utility industry   advantages in power generation, energy storage, and power quality. In the   consumer market, SatCon is developing freon-free compressors for   refrigerators, variable speed motors, and other long-life, high-efficiency   machinery.    It is the Company's strategy to accelerate leading edge developments by   continuing to expand its externally funded contract research and development   from both government and commercial sources. The Company can then leverage   this funding to develop products which the Company believes can both be sold   to government agencies and transition into high volume commercial products.   Recent changes in the Small Business Innovative Research program provide a new   mechanism to pursue government Phase III pre-production programs on a sole   source non-competitive basis. In most instances, individual components have   multiple applications across these markets.    This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. For this   purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical   fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the   foregoing, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects" and   similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. There   are a number of important factors that could cause the Company's actual   results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking   statements. These factors include, without limitation, those set forth below   under the caption "Factors Affecting Future Results."    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Percentage of   Revenues for certain items in the Company's Statement of Operations for each   period:                                                     YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,                                               ------------------------------                                                  1996     1995     1994                                               --------- -------- -----------               Revenues................................   100.0%   100.0%     100.0%      Cost of sales...........................    42.0     56.8       62.6      Selling, general and administrative       expenses...............................    85.5     47.8       25.8      Research and development expenses.......     9.5     16.9        2.6      Total operating expenses (excluding       cost of sales).........................    95.0     64.7       28.4      Operating income/(loss).................

The Company's revenues decreased $2,090,839, or 18.2%, from 1995 to   1996. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in revenue of approximately   $3,945,253 from contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of   drive train components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  During   the year, Chrysler Corporation announced the cancellation of the Patriot   Hybrid Vehicle Program. Chrysler has announced that it intends to transition   technologies utilized in the Patriot Program to their Hybrid Electric Vehicle   (HEV) program being sponsored by the U.S. Government's Super Car Initiative.   The Company expects involvement with Chrysler in this effort; however as of   December 20, 1996, no contractual agreement has been entered between SatCon   and Chrysler Corporation relating to the HEV program.  The Company can give no   assurance that it will receive additional work related to the HEV program.   The Company has not to date recorded any revenues associated with the Chrysler   HEV Program. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by increased   revenues of approximately $2,355,000 related to work on various government   development contracts.    Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales decreased $2,582,094, or 39.5%, from 1995 to   1996.  The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in work during 1996 on   contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of drive train   components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  As a percentage of   revenue, cost of sales decreased from 56.8% for 1995 to 42.0.% for 1996. The   decrease in cost of sales, as a percent of revenue, was primarily due to a   decrease in direct material and subcontract costs and an increase in direct   labor costs directly related to the shift from work on the Chrysler Patriot   Program, which had high material costs, as a percentage of revenue, to work on   several labor intensive research and development contracts funded by the U.S   Government which typically have higher margins.    Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative   expenses increased $2,540,247, or 46.3%, from 1995 to 1996, a change as a   percentage of revenue from 47.8% in 1995 to 85.5% in 1996. Approximately   $500,000 is attributable to the establishment of the Company's Space Division   in Tucson, Arizona. Approximately $600,000 was expensed in establishing the   Company's Flywheel Energy Storage Division. Cambridge facilities expense   increased approximately $277,000 due to the exercise of an option in the   Company's lease for additional space. The Company now occupies the entire   building at 161 First Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Depreciation expense   increased approximately $373,000 due to purchases of computer, laboratory,   inspection, test, and manufacturing equipment during fiscal 1995 and 1996.   Marketing expenses increased approximately $500,000 in efforts to broaden the   customer base in anticipation of the cancellation of the Patriot Program.    Research and Development.  Research and development expenses decreased   $1,043,613, or 53.9% from 1995 to 1996.  As a percentage of revenue, internal   research and development decreased from 16.9% in 1995 to 9.5% in 1996.  The   decrease in research and development spending is primarily the result of a   reallocation of engineering resources from internally funded research and   development to construction of a pre-production flywheel, additional marketing   efforts and development efforts on contracts from the U.S. Government and   commercial contracts.  Virtually all of 1996 revenues were for sponsored   research and development.  As a small business under government contracts,   SatCon retains commercial rights to work developed.  For commercial contracts,   intellectual property is negotiated on a case-by-case basis.    Net Income/(Loss).  As a result of decreased revenues and increased investment   in marketing, facilities, and associated fringe costs,  the Company realized a   net loss of $2,864,836 in 1996 versus a net loss of $1,210,045 in 1995.     YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1994    Revenues.  The Company's revenues decreased $6,541,560, or 36.3%, from 1994 to   1995. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in revenue of approximately   $5,700,000 from contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of   drive train components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  During   the year, performance testing began of first generation drive train components   to identify possible design improvements to be incorporated in subsequent   units.  This testing resulted in a delay in revenue from                                         12      the Patriot Program. At the close of the fiscal year the Company continued to   support Chrysler in these test and design improvement efforts on a time and   materials basis. In addition, the company realized a decrease in revenue of   approximately $2,700,000, due to the completion of a contract with Itek   Optical Systems for design work for a U.S. Government program. These decreases   in revenue were partially offset by increased revenues of approximately   $1,800,000 related to work on various commercial and government development   contracts.    Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales decreased $4,758,471, or 42.2%, from 1994 to   1995.  The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in work during 1995 on   contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of drive train   components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  As a percentage of   revenue, cost of sales decreased from 62.6% for 1994 to 56.8% for 1995. The   decrease in cost of sales as a percent of revenue was primarily due to a   decrease in direct material and subcontract costs as a percentage of cost of   sales related to a shift in efforts on the Patriot Program from material   procurement and subcontract production to assembly and test of first   generation drive train components.  This decrease is partially offset by an   increase in material procurement and subcontract production cost for long lead   time parts for second generation drive train components for the Patriot   Program.    Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative   expenses increased $827,425, or 17.8%, from 1994 to 1995, a change as a   percentage of revenue from 25.8% in 1994 to 47.8% in 1995.  This increase is   primarily the result of the addition of business support personnel (marketing,   engineering, and administrative) added to support the Company's transition to   a supplier of products to commercial markets.  This increase was partially   offset by a decrease in costs related to contract employees and consultants   replaced by permanent employees.  In addition, depreciation expense increased   primarily due to the purchases of computer, laboratory, inspection and test,   and manufacturing equipment during fiscal year 1994 and 1995.    Research and Development.  Research and development expenses increased   $1,476,173, or 320.2% from 1994 to 1995.  As a percentage of revenue, internal   research and development increased from 2.6% in 1994 to 16.9% in 1995.  The   increase in expenditures is primarily associated with projects to develop   technology for products for the automotive and other commercial markets. The   majority of the increase is associated with projects related to the develop of   three pre-production prototype systems.  The systems developed and built   include a flywheel energy storage system aimed at stationary uninterruptable   power supply markets, an advanced replacement alternator for automotive   applications, and an advanced actuation system for semiconductor processing   equipment. The Company continues to increase efforts in the pursuit of   commercial product opportunities capitalizing on the Company's Active Motion   Control technology base.    Net Income/(Loss).  As a result of decreased revenues and increased selling,   general and administrative and research and development expenses, the Company   realized a net loss of $1,210,045 in 1995 versus a net income of $1,224,892 in   1994.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    The Company's cash and cash equivalents was $3,770,925 as of September 30,   1996, an increase of $1,582,938 from September 30, 1995.  Cash used in   operating activities was $3,072,434 during 1996, as compared to cash provided   by operating activities of $5,751,991 during 1995. The cash used in operations   was primarily the result of a net increase of approximately $972,675 in   accounts receivable and unbilled contract costs due primarily to extended   billing and payment terms with two commercial customers.  The remainder of the   cash used by operating activities is primarily a result of an increase in   other assets, a decrease in prepaid expenses, an increase in accrued expenses   and payroll, and the net loss net of income tax benefit for the period.    Cash provided by investing activities as of September 30, 1996, was   $4,450,724. The cash provided relates primarily to the sale and maturity of   approximately $8,407,185 of marketable securities to fund operations prior to   collection of outstanding invoices.  The cash provided was partially offset by   purchases of marketable securities of approximately $1,450,000  and capital   expenditures of approximately $2,293,305.  The capital expenditures primarily   relate to the purchase of inspection equipment, furniture and fixtures,   leasehold improvements, computer equipment, and sales and demonstration   equipment.                                           13      The Company has a $3,000,000 bank line of credit. Borrowings under the line   will be unsecured and charged interest at prime rate.  The line of credit   expires January 31, 1997.  The Company has entered into negotiations to   replace this line of credit.  No funds have as yet been advanced under this   facility.  The Company is required to maintain certain covenants including   certain financial ratios as described in the line of credit agreement.    The Company anticipates that its existing cash resources, cash flow from   operations and the continued availability of its bank line of credit will be   sufficient to fund its operations through September 30, 1997, provided it   meets its operating plan and remains in compliance with its credit agreement,   although no funds have as yet been advanced.  The Company is currently in   default of its line of credit facility with the bank. However, the Company has   received a written waiver of this default for the year ended September 30,   1996. The Company's ability to finance its operations will be dependent on its   ability to renegotiate its bank line of credit for a continued availability of   borrowing thereunder. There can be no assurance that the Company will be   successful in renegotiating its line of credit. To the extent cash flow from   operations is insufficient to fund the Company's activities, it may be   necessary to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. The   Company's ability to generate cash from operations depends upon, among other   things, revenue growth, its credit and payments terms with vendors, and   collections of accounts receivable. The Company's ability to borrow under this   facility is dependent upon satisfying certain financial covenants, among other   things, and there can be no assurances that the Company will remain in   compliance. If such sources of cash prove insufficient, the Company will be   required to make changes in its operations or to seek additional debt or   equity financing. There can be no assurances that cash generated from   operations and borrowings under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet   its operating requirements, or if required, that additional debt or equity   financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.    FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS    The Company's future results remain difficult to predict and may be affected   by a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially   from the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form   10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. These factors   include business conditions within the automotive, telecommunications,   industrial machinery and semiconductor industries and the world economies as a   whole, and competitive pressures that may impact research and development   spending. The Company's revenue growth is dependent on technology developments   and contract research and development for both the government and commercial   sectors and no assurance can be given that such investments will continue or   that the Company can successfully obtain such funds. In addition, the   Company's future growth opportunities are dependent on the introduction on new   products that must penetrate automotive, telecommunications, industrial, and   computer market segments. No assurance can be given that new products can be   developed, or if developed, will be successful; that competitors will not   force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from the   Company; or that the Company can achieve or maintain profits in these markets.   Because of these and other factors, past financial performances should not be   considered an indicator of future performance. Investors should not use   historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the   Company's stock price frequently experiences significant volatility.                                         14      EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123,   "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," which encourages companies to   recognize compensation expense in the income statement based on the fair value   of the underlying common stock at the date the awards are granted .  However,   it will permit continued accounting under APB Opinion 25, "Accounting for   Stock Issued to Employees," accompanied by a disclosure of the pro forma   effects on net income and earnings per share had the new accounting rules been   applied. The statement is effective for Fiscal 1997. The Company plans to   account for stock based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion 25.     EFFECTS OF INFLATION    The Company believes that inflation over the past three years has not had a   significant impact on the Company's sales or operating results.                                         15   ITEM 8.
