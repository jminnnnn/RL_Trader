ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND         RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  INTRODUCTION    SatCon Technology Corporation (the "Company" or "SatCon") was organized as a Massachusetts corporation in February 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1992. SatCon itself and through its subsidiaries, designs, develops and manufactures and sells hardware and software systems relating to energy storage, energy conservation and power management with an emphasis on environmentally friendly approaches    It is the Company's strategy to accelerate its technological developments by continuing to expand its externally funded contract research and development from both government and commercial sources. The Company can then leverage this funding to develop products that the Company believes can both be sold to government agencies and transition into high volume commercial products. Recent changes in the SBIR program provide a new mechanism to pursue government Phase III pre-production programs on a sole-source, non-competitive basis. In most instances, individual components have multiple applications across these markets.    This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. There are a number of important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, those set forth below under the caption "Factors Affecting Future Results."  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    During fiscal year 1998 the Company initiated several actions to advance the development and market introduction of new products, to establish a product manufacturing base capable of supplying key components of SatCon's products, and to improve the future profitability of the Company. These actions include the production of the ISAM system and the introduction of a standard product line of linear regulators. In addition, during a recapitalization of Beacon in December 1997, the Company converted a significant portion of its ownership of Beacon to preferred stock. The Company retained approximately 19.9% of Beacon's outstanding voting stock. Although the Company owned less than 20% of the outstanding voting stock of Beacon, based on other factors there was a presumption that the Company had the ability to exercise significant influence, and the equity method was required for the fair presentation subsequent to this recapitalization. The Company's share of losses from Beacon is shown as a single amount in the statement of operations, "Loss from Investment in Beacon Power Corporation." The effects of these actions on the Company's financial performance during fiscal year 1998 are discussed below.    The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage of revenue for certain items in the Company's Statement of Operations for each period:                                    FOR THE YEARS                                      ENDED                                  SEPTEMBER 30,                                -------------------                                1998   1997   1996                                -----  -----  -----               Revenue.................  100.0% 100.0% 100.0%      Cost of revenue.........   71.0   80.8   68.1      Selling, general and ad-       ministrative expenses..   30.9   49.7   59.4      Research and development       expenses...............    2.2   20.0    9.5      Goodwill amortization...    1.9    1.0    --      Total operating expenses       (excluding cost of rev-       enue)..................   35.0   70.7   68.9      Operating loss..........

The Company's revenue increased by approximately $3,020,000 or 24.2% from 1997 to 1998. The increase is due to the increase of revenue from the sale of manufactured products offset by a decrease in revenue on research and development contracts. During 1997, the Company acquired K&D MagMotor Corporation ("MagMotor") and Film Microelectronics, Inc. ("FMI") as wholly- owned subsidiaries which provided for additional revenue of approximately $476,000 and $3,316,000, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 1998. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of approximately $232,000 related to research and development contracts.    Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased approximately $920,000 or 9.1% from 1997 to 1998. The increase is primarily due to the addition of cost of revenue associated with MagMotor and FMI of approximately $656,000 and $2,135,000, respectively. These increases in cost of revenue were offset by a decrease in cost of revenue on research and development contracts of approximately $961,000.    Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately $1,411,000 or 22.8% from 1997 to 1998. The decrease is the result of consolidating the Tucson Space Division into the Technology Center, the recapitalization of Beacon and the continued management of selling, general and administrative costs. During 1997, the Company established a reserve of approximately $498,000 for expenses, primarily lease cancellation costs relating to consolidating the Tucson Space Division into the Technology Center. At September 30, 1998, the Company had a reserve of $100,000, primarily relating to the lease cancellation costs. During 1997, the Company formed Beacon, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to continue the work of its Energy Systems Division. During a recapitalization of Beacon in December 1997, the Company converted a significant portion of its ownership of Beacon to convertible preferred stock. The Company retained approximately 19.9% of Beacon's outstanding voting stock. Although the Company owned less than 20% of the outstanding voting stock of Beacon, based on other factors, there was a presumption that the Company had the ability to exercise significant influence, and the equity method was required for the fair presentation subsequent to this recapitalization. The Company's share of losses from Beacon is shown as a single amount in the statement of operations, "Loss from Investment in Beacon Power Corporation." These decreases were partially offset by increases of approximately $225,000 and $813,000 of expenses related to MagMotor and FMI, respectively.    Research and development. Internally funded research and development expenses decreased approximately $2,143,000 or 86.1% from 1997 to 1998. During 1997, the Company recognized certain capitalized product development costs, in the amount of approximately $2,593,000, rather than amortizing these costs over future years' revenue based on the uncertainty of future revenue. These costs related primarily to Beacon's 20C1000 Cable/Telecom Flywheel system development efforts and the ISAM product. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in cost due to the continued development of the flywheel energy storage system incurred by Beacon for the period from October 1, 1997 to December 24, 1997.    Goodwill amortization. Goodwill amortization increased approximately $170,000 or 141.5% from 1997 to 1998. The increase is the result of a full year of goodwill amortization related to goodwill in connection with the acquisitions of MagMotor and FMI completed in 1997.    Loss from Investment in Beacon Power Corporation. On May 20, 1997, the Company formed its subsidiary, Beacon, through a strategic partnership with Duquesne Enterprises, a subsidiary of DOE, Inc., to manufacture and distribute the Company's flywheel energy storage systems. Duquesne Enterprises made an initial investment totaling $5,000,000 in the Company to fund flywheel product development. Beacon assumed the activities of the Company's Energy Systems Division which was formed in October 1995 to focus on the product development and marketing of flywheel "Inertial Battery" systems for such markets as utilities, cable television and telecommunications, where uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) are critical to maintaining services. In December 1997, Beacon obtained equity financing from private investors and the Company converted a significant portion of its ownership of Beacon to convertible preferred stock. The Company retained approximately 19.9% of Beacon's outstanding voting stock. On October 23, 1998, Beacon completed a $4,750,000 private placement of equity securities with Perseus Capital L.L.C., Duquesne Enterprises and Micro                                        12   Generation Technology Fund, L.L.C. Beacon will utilize the proceeds from the private placement toward the completion of the commercialization of the 20C1000 Cable/Telecom Flywheel System. Beacon's focus is limited to providing flywheel energy storage products for stationary terrestrial applications.    As set forth in Note J to the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 1997, upon converting the majority of its equity ownership interest in Beacon to convertible preferred stock in December 1997, the Company believed that the appropriate accounting treatment for its investment in Beacon was to account for the investment on the cost basis and to treat Beacon as a non-consolidated entity. The Company has reported its financial results since the second quarter of 1998 without reflecting Beacon's losses in its results of operations and showing its investment in Beacon at cost on its balance sheet.    In auditing the Company's financial statements for the year ended September 30, 1998, the Company's independent accountants advised the Company that the treatment of Beacon as a non-consolidated entity was inappropriate for the period subsequent to December 1997 and prior to the October 1998 financing. Consequently, the Company will be required to amend its financial results for the second and third quarters of fiscal year 1998 and has included approximately $3,542,000 of loss from its investment in Beacon since December 1997 in the financial statements for the year ended September 30, 1998. This resulted in a net loss of approximately $4,306,000 (or $.48 per share) for the year ended September 30, 1998. The balance sheet reflects a corresponding increase in retained earnings/(deficit). The loss reported in connection with Beacon has not affected the business prospects or cash position of either the Company or Beacon and the Company has no further funding commitments to Beacon.    The Company has been advised by its independent accountants that they concur with the Company's view that the Company is neither required to consolidate nor reflect its pro-rata share of Beacon's losses for any period subsequent to the third-party financing Beacon obtained in October 1998. Consequently, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 1999, the Company will carry its investment in Beacon at its remaining cost of approximately $1,458,000 and will not be consolidating or otherwise reflecting Beacon's results of operations in its financial statements.    The Company will continue to review its investment in Beacon. While the Company continues to be optimistic regarding the long term prospects for Beacon and the flywheel technology, Beacon has not yet successfully introduced a flywheel product and will need substantial additional financing to continue its operations. If in the future the Company determines that its investment in Beacon does not have any remaining value, the Company would take appropriate actions to write-off the remaining cost of its investment.    Interest income, net. Interest income, net decreased approximately $100,000 or 37.0% from 1997 to 1998. The decrease is primarily the result of the decrease in marketable securities of approximately $1,319,000 or 66.7% from 1997 to 1998.   YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996    Revenue. The Company's revenue increased approximately $3,082,000 or 32.8% from 1996 to 1997. The increase is due to the introduction of revenue from the sale of manufactured products as well as an increase in revenue on research and development contracts. During 1997, the Company acquired MagMotor and FMI as wholly-owned subsidiaries which provided for incremental revenue of approximately $1,135,000 and $2,595,000, respectively. Revenue from the Company's new ISAM product contributed approximately $540,000 of additional revenue. Approximately $1,295,000 of the increase in revenue related to an increase in revenue on research and development contracts. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue of approximately $3,410,000 from contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of drive train components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program. During 1996, Chrysler Corporation announced the cancellation of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program. Chrysler also announced that it intends to transition technologies utilized in the Patriot Program to their Hybrid-Electric Vehicle program being sponsored by the U.S. Government's Super Car Initiative.                                        13     Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased approximately $3,676,000 or 57.5% from 1996 to 1997. The increase is primarily due to the addition of cost of revenue associated with MagMotor and FMI of approximately $797,000 and $1,886,000, respectively, and increased cost of revenue on research and development contracts accounting for an additional $696,000. In addition, the Company established a reserve of approximately $910,000 in connection with the cost to complete a number of commercial development contracts. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in cost of revenue on contracts with Chrysler Corporation.    Selling, general and administrative. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased approximately $629,000 or 11.3% from 1996 to 1997. Approximately $250,000 and $570,000 of the increase is due to selling, general and administrative expenses related to MagMotor and FMI, respectively. In addition, the Company established a reserve of approximately $498,000 for expenses, primarily lease cancellation costs relating to consolidating the Tucson Space Division into the Technology Center. These increases are offset by a decrease of approximately $800,000 primarily due to the management of travel and other selling and administrative costs.    Research and development. Internally funded research and development expenses increased approximately $1,596,000 or 178.6% from 1996 to 1997. Approximately $2,593,000 of the increase is related to the Company's decision to recognize certain capitalized product development costs in fiscal year 1997 rather than amortizing the costs over future years' revenue based on the uncertainty of future sales. These costs related primarily to Beacon's 20C1000 Cable/Telecom Flywheel system development efforts and the ISAM product. These costs are partially offset by the reversal of a reserve for a fiscal year 1996 dispute over contractual terms. Management believes that the reserve is no longer necessary and that the financial statements properly reflect the ultimate impact of this matter.    Goodwill amortization. The Company recognized approximately $120,000 of goodwill amortization in 1997 related to goodwill in connection with the acquisition of MagMotor and FMI.    Interest income, net. Interest income, net decreased approximately $195,000 or 37.0% from 1996 to 1997. The decrease is primarily the result of the decrease in marketable securities of approximately $1,459,000 or 42.5% from 1996 to 1997.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    As of September 30, 1998, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1,202,000, a decrease of approximately $3,055,000 from September 30, 1997. Cash used in operating activities during 1998 was approximately $2,383,000 as compared to cash used in operating activities of approximately $3,482,000 during fiscal year 1997. This was primarily the result of an increase in inventory related to the introduction of new standard products.    Cash used in investing activities, as of September 30, 1998, was approximately $2,261,000. This relates primarily to the investment in Beacon and capital expenditures of manufacturing and inspection equipment. This was partially offset by the sale and maturity of approximately $1,341,000 of marketable securities.    Cash provided by financing activities as of September 30, 1998, was approximately $1,590,000. This relates primarily to proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase common stock.    On December 16, 1998, the Company obtained a $2,000,000 discretionary demand line of credit (the "Line of Credit"), bearing interest at the bank's prime rate of interest plus 1 1/2%. Available borrowings are based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable and inventory and will be used for capital expenditures, working capital and general corporate purposes.    The Company anticipates that existing cash resources, cash flow from operations and the Line of Credit will be sufficient to fund its operations at least through September 30, 1999 and to repurchase up to 5 percent of the Company's outstanding shares under a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program") provided that                                        14   the Company meets its operating plan. Under the Repurchase Program, the Company plans to purchase shares of its Common Stock on the open market from time to time, depending on market conditions. To the extent cash flow from operations is insufficient to fund the Company's activities, it may be necessary to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. The Company's ability to generate cash from operations depends upon, among other things, revenue growth, its credit and payment terms with vendors and collections of accounts receivable. If such sources of cash prove insufficient, the Company will be required to make changes in its operations or to seek additional debt or equity financing. There can be no assurances that cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements or that additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or at all.  FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS    The Company's future results remain difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. These factors include business conditions within the automotive, telecommunications, industrial machinery and semiconductor industries and the world economies as a whole and competitive pressures that may impact research and development spending. The Company's revenue growth is dependent on technology developments and contract research and development for both the government and commercial sectors and no assurance can be given that such investments will continue or that the Company can successfully obtain such funds. In addition, the Company's future growth opportunities are dependent on the introduction of new products that must penetrate automotive, telecommunications, industrial and computer market segments. No assurance can be given that new products can be developed, or if developed, will be successful, that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from the Company or that the Company can achieve or maintain profits in these markets. Because of these and other factors, past financial performances should not be considered an indicator of future performance. Investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the Company's stock price frequently experiences significant volatility.    On October 23, 1998, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement, by and among Beacon Power Corporation ("Beacon"), Perseus Capital L.L.C. ("Perseus"), Duquesne Enterprises ("Duquesne") Micro Generation Technology Fund, L.L.C. ("Micro", and together with Perseus and Duquesne the "Purchasers") and the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, (i) the Purchasers purchased from Beacon and Beacon issued, sold and delivered to the Purchasers 1,900,000 shares (the "Shares") of Beacon's Class D Preferred Stock, $.01 par value per share; (ii) the Purchasers have the right to receive certain warrants to purchase shares of Beacon's common stock, $.01 par value per share (Beacon's Common Stock"); (iii) the Company granted the Purchasers the right (the "Put Right") to cause the Company, in circumstances described below, to purchase all of the Shares and all of Beacon's Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Shares; and (iv) upon exercise of the Put Right pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company must pay the consideration contemplated by the agreement in shares of the Company's Common Stock, valued at the average fair value for the fifteen trading days before and after notice of exercise of the Put Right. The aggregate consideration received by Beacon was $4,750,000. The Put Right is exercisable within sixty days of the second, third, forth and fifth anniversary of the closing date of the transaction, upon certain events of bankruptcy of Beacon and upon the occurrence of certain going private transactions involving the Company. If the Put Right were to be exercised, the Company would most likely recognize a loss equal to the value of the Company's shares issued upon exercise of the Put Right.  EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 130 ("SFAS 130"), "Reporting Comprehensive Income." SFAS 130 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997 and requires that changes in comprehensive income be shown in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other financial statements. The Company will adopt SFAS 130 beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999.                                        15     In June 1997, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 131 ("SFAS 131"), "Disclosure about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1997 and establishes annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments and related disclosures about its products and services, geographical areas and major customers. The Company will adopt SFAS 131 beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999.    In June 1998, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 ("SFAS 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." SFAS 133 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999 and establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. The Company will adopt SFAS 133 beginning in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending September 30, 2000.    Adoption of SFAS 130, SFAS 131 and SFAS 133 are not expected to have a material impact to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and any effect will be limited to the form and content of its disclosures.  EFFECTS OF INFLATION    The Company believes that inflation over the past three years has not had a significant impact on the Company's revenue or operating results.  EFFECTS OF YEAR 2000    The year 2000 ("Y2K") issue is the result of computer programs being written using two digits rather than four digits to define the applicable year. Certain computer programs that have date-sensitive software and use two digits only may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.    The Company recognizes the need to ensure its operations will not be adversely impacted by the Y2K software failures and has established a project team to address the Y2K risks. The project team has coordinated the identification of, and will coordinate the implementation of, changes to computer hardware and software applications that will attempt to ensure availability and integrity of the Company's information systems and the reliability of its operational systems and manufacturing processes. The Company is also assessing the potential overall impact of Y2K on its business, results of operations and financial position.    The Company has reviewed its information and operational systems and manufacturing processes in order to identify those products, services or systems that are not Y2K compliant. As a result of this review, the Company has determined that it will be required to modify or replace certain information and operational systems so that they will be Y2K compliant. These modifications and replacements are being, and will continue to be, made in conjunction with the Company's overall system initiatives. The total cost of these Y2K compliance measures has not been, and is not anticipated to be, material to the Company's financial position or its results of operations. The Company expects to complete its Y2K project during fiscal year 1999. Based on available information, the Company does not believe any material exposure to significant business interruption exists as a result of Y2K compliance issues. Accordingly, the Company has not adopted any formal contingency plan in the event its Y2K project is not completed in a timely manner. These costs and the timing in which the Company plans to complete its Y2K modifications and testing processes are based on management's best estimates. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will timely identify and remediate all significant Y2K problems, that remedial efforts will not involve significant time and expense or that such problems will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations or financial position.    The Company also faces risks to the extent that suppliers of products, services and systems purchased by the Company and others with whom the Company transacts business do not comply with the Y2K requirements. The Company is identifying significant suppliers and customers to determine the extent to which the Company is vulnerable to these third parties' failure to remediate their own Y2K issues. In the event any such third party                                        16   cannot provide the Company the products, services or systems that meet the Y2K requirements on a timely basis, the Company's results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. To the extent Y2K issues cause significant delays in, or cancellation of, decisions to purchase the Company's products or services, the Company's business, results of operations or financial position would be materially adversely affected.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE RISK    The Company maintains an investment portfolio consisting of debt securities of various issuers, types and maturities. These securities are classified as available for sale, and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at market value, with the unrealized gain or loss recorded through the equity section. These instruments are not leveraged, and are not held for purposes of trading.    The following table summarizes derivative financial instruments included in marketable securities held by the Company at September 30, 1998, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates:                             FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,                          ------------------------------------------                                                                                   TOTAL    TOTAL                                                                                    FACE     FAIR DESCRIPTION               1999     2000     2001     2002     2003    THEREAFTER  VALUE    VALUE - -----------              ------   ------   ------   ------   ------   ---------- -------- --------                  Floater.................                                               $350,000  $350,000 $325,500   Average Interest Rate.    5.7%     5.7%     5.7%     5.7%     5.7%        5.7% CMO.....................                                               $ 70,614  $ 70,614 $ 73,492   Average Interest Rate.    5.4%     5.4%     5.4%     5.4%     5.4%        5.4% Structured Notes........                                               $250,000  $250,000 $258,439   Average Interest Rate.    6.0%     6.0%     6.0%     6.0%     6.0%        6.0%                                          17   ITEM 8.
