ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    INTRODUCTION    SatCon Technology Corporation (the "Company" or "SatCon") was organized as a   Massachusetts corporation in February 1985 and reincorporated in Delaware in   1992.  SatCon designs, develops and manufactures "Active Motion Control"    Systems including advanced electro-mechanical products for aerospace,   transportation, industrial, and utility applications.  SatCon's electro-   mechanical products are being developed for a wide variety of U.S. Government   and commercial markets.  For the Government, SatCon's electro-mechanical   systems provide low vibration and high power for applications ranging from   satellite attitude control to high speed drives for shipboard systems.  In the   transportation segment SatCon is developing electric and hybrid electric drive   components, auxiliary power units, and advanced steering, suspension, and   braking systems.  SatCon is working with major equipment producers to develop   process equipment drives, high speed and precision machine tools,   manipulators, and machinery isolation equipment.  SatCon's electro-mechanical   systems may offer to the utility industry advantages in power generation,   energy storage, and power quality.  In the consumer market SatCon is   developing freon-free compressors for refrigerators, variable speed motors,   and other long-life, high-efficiency machinery.    It is the Company's strategy to accelerate leading edge developments by   continuing to expand its externally funded contract research and development   from both government and commercial sources.  The Company can then leverage   this funding to develop products that the Company believes can both be sold to   government agencies and transition into high volume commercial products.   Recent changes in the Small Business Innovative Research program provide a new   mechanism to pursue government Phase III pre-production programs on a sole   source non-competitive basis.  In most instances, individual components have   multiple applications across these markets.    This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements.  For this   purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical   fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements.  Without limiting the   foregoing, the words "believes," "anticipates," "plans," "expects" and similar   expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  There are a   number of important factors that could cause the Company's actual results to   differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements.   These factors include, without limitation, those set forth below under the   caption "Factors Affecting Future Results."    RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    During 1997 the Company initiated several actions to advance the development   and market introduction of new products, to establish a product manufacturing   base capable of supplying key components of SatCon's products, and to improve   the future profitability of the Company.  These actions include the   introduction of the ISAM and PowerSmart products, the formation of Beacon   Power Corporation, the acquisition of K&D and FMI, the recognition of certain   product development costs in the current year rather than amortizing them over   future years sales, and the recognition of costs associated with the Company's   plan to consolidate the Tucson Space Division into the Technology Division.   The effects of these actions on the Company's financial performance during   1997 are discussed below.                                         12     The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the Percentage of   Revenues for certain items in the Company's Statement of Operations for each   period:                                                            YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,                                                      --------------------------------                                                         1997         1996       1995                                                      ---------    ---------    ------                  Revenues..................................    100.0%      100.0%      100.0%           Cost of sales.............................     62.0        42.0        56.8           Selling, general and administrative              expenses................................     68.5        85.5        47.8           Research and development..................     20.0         9.5        16.9            expenses.................................

(49.3)      (30.6)      (10.6)      YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1997 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996    Revenues.  The Company's revenues increased $3,081,747 or 32.8% from 1996 to   1997.  The increase is due to the introduction of revenue from the sale of   manufactured products as well as an increase in effort on government   development contracts.  During 1997 the Company acquired K&D and FMI as wholly   owned subsidiaries which provided for incremental revenue of approximately   $1,135,000 and $2,595,000, respectively.  Sales of the Company's new ISAM   product contributed approximately $540,000 of the additional revenue.   Approximately $1,295,000 of the increase in revenue related to an increase in   effort on government development contracts.  These increases were partially   offset by a decrease in revenue of approximately $3,410,000 from contracts   with Chrysler Corporation for the development of drive train components as   part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  During 1996, Chrysler Corporation   announced the cancellation of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program. Chrysler   announced that it intends to transition technologies utilized in the Patriot   Program to their Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) program being sponsored by the   U.S. Government's Super Car Initiative.    Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales increased $3,789,992, or 96.2%, from 1996 to   1997.  The increase is primarily due to the addition of cost of sales   associated with K&D and FMI of approximately $797,000 and $1,886,000,   respectively and increased effort on government development contracts   accounting for an additional $696,000.  In addition, the Company established a   reserve of approximately $910,000 in connection with the cost to complete a   number of commercial development contracts.  These increases were partially   offset by a decrease in effort on contracts with Chrysler Corporation.    Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative   expenses increased $514,994 or 6.4% from 1996 to 1997. Approximately $250,000   and $570,000 of the increase is due to selling, general and administrative   expenses related to K&D and FMI, respectively. In addition, the Company   established a reserve of $498,000 for expenses, primarily lease cancellation   costs relating to consolidating the Tucson Space Division into the Technology   Division. These increases are offset by a decrease of approximately $800,000   primarily due to the management of travel and other selling and administrative   costs.    Research and Development.  Internally funded research and development expenses   increased $1,595,579 from 1996 to 1997.  Approximately $2,593,000 of the   increase is related to the Company's decision to recognize certain capitalized   product development cost in the current year rather than amortizing the costs   over future year's sales based on the uncertainty of future sales.  These   product development cost related primarily to Beacon Power Corporation's   Flywheel UPS product development efforts and the ISAM product.  These costs   are partially offset by the reversal of a reserve for a fiscal year 1996   dispute over                                         13     contractual terms. Management believes that the reserve is no longer necessary   and that the financial statements properly reflect the ultimate impact of this   matter.    Goodwill Amortization.  The Company recognized $120,467 of goodwill   amortization in 1997 related to goodwill in connection with the acquisition of   K&D and FMI.    Net Loss.  As a result of an increase in revenues being offset by the   Company's decision to recognize certain product development costs in the   current year rather than amortizing the costs over future periods sales, and   the establishment of contingency reserves associated with consolidating the   Tucson Space Division into the Technology Division, the Company realized a net   loss of $6,143,242 in 1997 compared to a net loss of $2,864,836 in 1996.    YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1996 COMPARED TO THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1995    Revenues.  The Company's revenues decreased $2,090,839, or 18.2%, from 1995 to   1996. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenue of approximately   $3,945,253 from contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of   drive train components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  During   1996, Chrysler Corporation announced the cancellation of the Patriot Hybrid   Vehicle Program. Chrysler announced that it intends to transition technologies   utilized in the Patriot Program to their Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) program   being sponsored by the U.S. Government's Super Car Initiative.  To date the   Company has not recorded any revenues associated with the Chrysler HEV   Program. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by increased revenues   of approximately $2,355,000 related to work on various government development   contracts.    Cost of Sales.  Cost of sales decreased $2,582,094, or 39.5%, from 1995 to   1996.  The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in work during 1996 on   contracts with Chrysler Corporation for the development of drive train   components as part of the Patriot Hybrid Vehicle Program.  As a percentage of   revenue, cost of sales decreased from 56.8% for 1995 to 42.0% for 1996. The   decrease in cost of sales, as a percent of revenue, was primarily due to a   decrease in direct material and subcontract costs and an increase in direct   labor costs directly related to the shift from work on the Chrysler Patriot   Program, which had high material costs as a percentage of revenue, to work on   several labor intensive research and development contracts funded by the U.S.   Government which typically have higher margins.    Selling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative   expenses increased $2,540,247, or 46.3%, from 1995 to 1996, a change as a   percentage of revenue from 47.8% in 1995 to 85.5% in 1996. Approximately   $500,000 is attributable to the establishment of the Space Division in Tucson,   Arizona. Approximately $600,000 was expensed in establishing the Flywheel   Energy Storage Division. Cambridge facilities expense increased approximately   $277,000 due to the exercise of an option in the Company's lease for   additional space. During 1996 the Company occupied the entire building at 161   First Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Depreciation expense increased   approximately $373,000 due to purchases of computer, laboratory, inspection,   test, and manufacturing equipment during fiscal 1995 and 1996. Marketing   expenses increased approximately $500,000 in efforts to broaden the customer   base in anticipation of the cancellation of the Patriot Program.    Research and Development.  Research and development expenses decreased   $1,043,613, or 53.9% from 1995 to 1996.  As a percentage of revenue, internal   research and development decreased from 16.9% in 1995 to 9.5% in 1996.  The   decrease in research and development spending was primarily the result of a   reallocation of engineering resources from internally funded research and   development to construction of a pre-production flywheel, and additional   marketing efforts and development efforts on contracts from the U.S.   Government and commercial customers.  Virtually all of 1996 revenues were for   sponsored research and development.    Net Income/(Loss).  As a result of decreased revenues and increased investment   in marketing, facilities, and associated fringe costs, the Company realized a   net loss of $2,864,836 in 1996 versus a net loss of $1,210,045 in 1995.                                         14     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    As of September 30, 1997, the Company's cash and cash equivalents were   $4,256,504 an increase of $485,579 from September 30, 1996.  Cash used in   operating activities during 1997 was $6,075,232 as compared to cash used in   operating activities of $3,481,674 during 1996. The cash used in operations   was primarily the result of a net loss of $3,072,434 during 1997.  The effect   of the net loss was partially offset by an increase of $535,797 in accounts   receivable and an increase in reserve balances.    Cash used in investing activities, as of September 30, 1997, was $1,224,869.   The cash provided relates primarily to the sale and maturity of approximately   $2,079,000 of marketable securities to fund operations prior to collection of   outstanding invoices. The cash provided was partially offset by purchases of   marketable securities of approximately $600,000, capital expenditures of   $2,496,726, and the acquisitions of K&D and FMI of $112,986. The capital   expenditures primarily relate to the purchase of manufacturing and inspection   equipment, furniture and fixtures, leasehold improvements, computer equipment,   and sales and demonstration equipment.    Cash provided by financing activities as of September 30, 1997, was   $5,192,122.  The cash provided relates primarily to the proceeds from the   Securities Purchase Agreement, dated May 28, 1997, by and among the Company,   Beacon Power Corporation, and Duquesne Enterprises.  The aggregate   consideration received by the Company was $4,817,232 net of financing   expenses.    The Company's $3,000,000 bank line of credit expired January 31, 1997.  No   funds were advanced under the facility.  The Company intends to seek a   replacement line of credit from its new primary bank during 1998.    The Company anticipates that its existing cash resources, cash flow from   operations, and availability of a replacement line of credit will be   sufficient to fund its operations through September 30, 1998, provided it   meets its operating plan.  The Company's ability to finance its operations may   be dependent on its ability to negotiate a replacement bank line of credit.   There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in negotiating a   replacement line of credit.  To the extent cash flow from operations is   insufficient to fund the Company's activities, it may be necessary to raise   additional funds through equity or debt financing.  The Company's ability to   generate cash from operations depends upon, among other things, revenue   growth, its credit and payment terms with vendors, and collections of accounts   receivable.  If such sources of cash prove insufficient, the Company will be   required to make changes in its operations or to seek additional debt or   equity financing.  There can be no assurances that cash generated from   operations will be sufficient to meet its operating requirements, or if   required, that additional debt or equity financing will be available on terms   acceptable to the Company.    FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESULTS    The Company's future results remain difficult to predict and may be affected   by a number of factors which could cause actual results to differ materially   from the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form   10-K and presented elsewhere by management from time to time.  These factors   include business conditions within the automotive, telecommunications,   industrial machinery and semiconductor industries and the world economies as a   whole, and competitive pressures that may impact research and development   spending.  The Company's revenue growth is dependent on technology   developments and contract research and development for both the government and   commercial sectors and no assurance can be given that such investments will   continue or that the Company can successfully obtain such funds.  In addition,   the Company's future growth opportunities are dependent on the introduction of   new products that must penetrate automotive, telecommunications, industrial,   and computer market segments.  No assurance can be given that new products can   be developed, or if developed, will be successful; that competitors will not   force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from the   Company; or that the Company can achieve or maintain profits in these markets.   Because of these and other factors, past financial performance should not be   considered an indicator of future performance.  Investors should not use   historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the   Company's stock price frequently experiences significant volatility.                                         15     EFFECT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    In February 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of   Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings per share."  The   statement is effective for financial statements issued for periods ending   after December 15, 1997 and changes the method in which earnings per share   will be determined.  Adoption of this statement by the Company is not expected   to have a material impact on earnings per share.    In June 1997 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of   Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive   Income."  The statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December   15, 1997 and requires that an enterprise disclose, by major components and as   a single total, the change in its net assets during the period from "non-   owner" sources.    Also in June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement   of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 131, "Disclosure about Segments of   an Enterprise and Related Information."  The statement is effective for   periods beginning after December 15, 1997 and establishes annual and interim   reporting standards for an enterprise's operating segments and related   disclosures about its products and services, geographic areas and major   customers.    Adoption of SFAS No. 130 and No. 131 is not expected to have a material impact   to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations or   cash flows and any effect will be limited to the form and content of its   disclosures.    EFFECTS OF INFLATION    The Company believes that inflation over the past three years has not had a   significant impact on the Company's sales or operating results.                                         16   ITEM 8.
