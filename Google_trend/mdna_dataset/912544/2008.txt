Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation .                 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hollywood Medias Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.   Overview               Hollywood Media is a provider of information, news and other content, and ticketing to consumers and businesses covering the entertainment, Internet and media industries. We own and operate a number of business units focused on the entertainment and media industries. Hollywood Media derives a diverse stream of revenues from this array of business units, including revenue from Broadway, Off-Broadway and Londons West End ticket sales to both individuals and groups, advertising, and book development license fees and royalties. Our Broadway Ticketing business includes Broadway.com, 1-800-Broadway, Theatre Direct and Theatre.com. Hollywood Medias businesses also include an intellectual property business, Hollywood.com, the U.K.-based CinemasOnline companies and a minority interest in MovieTickets.com. In addition, Hollywood Media owns and operates the free VOD cable television network, Hollywood.com Television.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                Year ended December 31, 2007 (fiscal 2007) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006) and year ended December 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005).    Composition of our business segments are as follows:                         Broadway Ticketing   sells tickets and related hotel and restaurant packages via Broadway.com, 1-800-BROADWAY and TDI to live theater events on Broadway, Off-Broadway and Londons West End, to individual consumers, groups and domestic and international travel professionals, including travel agencies, tour operators, and educational institutions. Beginning in late September 2007, sales for events in Londons West End are fulfilled through a partnership arrangement between Theatre.com and an unrelated London-based ticket agency. This segment also generates revenue from the sale of sponsorships on Broadway.com.                           Ad Sales   sells advertising on Hollywood.com and MovieTickets.com, and includes CinemasOnline which sells advertising on cinema and live theater websites in the U.K. Hollywood.com receives commissions on the ads it sells on MovieTickets.com.                           Intellectual Properties   owns or controls the exclusive rights to certain intellectual properties created by best-selling authors and media celebrities, which it licenses for book and other media. This segment includes a 51% interest in Tekno Books, and a book development business, and this segment does not include our 50% interest in NetCo Partners.      22                              Cable TV   comprised of Hollywood.com Television and Broadway.com Television, free VOD channels that offer interactive entertainment information with on-demand video content to subscribers in certain cable TV systems.                           Other   is comprised of payroll and benefits for corporate and administrative personnel as well as other corporate-wide expenses, such as audit fees, proxy costs, insurance, centralized information technology, and includes consulting and other fees and costs relating to compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that require Hollywood Media to assess and report on internal control over financial reporting, and related development of controls.       Results of Discontinued Operations                Sale of Showtimes Business Unit to West World Media                On August 24, 2007, Hollywood Media Corp. entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive asset purchase agreement with West World Media and its principal, a former employee, pursuant to which Hollywood Media sold to West World Media substantially all of the assets of its Showtimes business for a cash purchase price of $23,000,000, subject to a working capital post-closing adjustment. The working capital post-closing adjustment was a price reduction of $114,454, which was paid by Hollywood Media to West World Media in January 2008.              Sale of Baseline/StudioSystems Business Unit to The New York Times Company              On August 25, 2006, Hollywood Media sold the Baseline/StudioSystems business to The New York Times for a cash purchase price of $35,000,000. As per the purchase agreement, $3,500,000 of the purchase price was held in escrow for twelve months following the closing to cover potential indemnification claims, if any, made by The New York Times. During 2007, Hollywood Media received $2,800,000, representing the full amount of the escrow, net of costs of $700,000 for certain contractual bonuses due to the former division heads.             Following are components of the net results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Impact of Broadway Strike          Results of continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2007 were negatively impacted by the Broadway stagehand strike that ended on November 28, 2007 and caused 19 days of cancelled Broadway performances. We received refunds or credits from the show box offices on virtually all tickets purchased by the Broadway Ticketing division for cancelled performances. We worked with customers to address orders placed for these cancelled performances, and refunds or exchanges were provided at the election of the customer. Any orders not refunded or exchanged by the end of the year were included in Customer deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   Net Revenues          Total net revenues for fiscal 2007 were $123,881,223 compared to $109,416,982 and $84,995,808 for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively. Revenues increased $14,464,241, or 13%, in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 and increased $24,421,174, or 29%, in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The increase in net revenues for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily the result of increases in Broadway ticketing revenue of $13,628,437, Ad Sales revenue of $981,521 and Cable TV revenue of $22,291, offset in part by a decrease in Intellectual Properties revenue of $168,008. In fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, net revenues were derived 90% from Broadway Ticketing, 9% from Ad Sales and 1% from Intellectual Properties. In fiscal 2005, Broadway Ticketing represented 93% of all revenues, Ad Sales represented 5% and Intellectual Properties represented 2%.        Broadway Ticketing net revenue for fiscal 2007 was $111,731,398 as compared to $98,102,961 for fiscal 2006, and $78,890,718 for fiscal 2005. Broadway Ticketing net revenue increased $13,628,437, or 14%, for fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 and increased $19,212,243, or 24%, for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The increase in Broadway Ticketing net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 is the result of an increase in sales to consumers, the purchase of the Showtix business in February 2007, ticket price increases by theaters, increases in service fees on individual ticket sales and increases in number of tickets sold. The increase in Broadway Ticketing net revenue in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is the result of an increase in sales to consumers, hotel package sales and changes in our marketing and advertising strategies. Ticketing revenue is generated from the sales of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and Londons West End both online via Broadway.com and offline via 1-800-BROADWAY to domestic and international travel professionals, tourists and New York area theater patrons. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, sales for events in Londons West End are fulfilled through a partnership agreement between Theatre.com and an unrelated London-based ticket agency. Ticketing revenue is recognized on the date of performance of the show. Ticket revenue received for performances yet to take place is recorded as Deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets.        Ad Sales net revenue was $10,891,517 for fiscal 2007 as compared to $9,909,996 for fiscal 2006 and $4,513,676 for fiscal 2005. Ad Sales net revenue increased $981,521 or 10% for fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 and increased $5,396,320, or 120%, for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The increase in Ad Sales from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 is primarily due to increased commission revenue due to higher ad sales on MovieTickets.com, and growth of the plasma sales business in CinemasOnline, offset in part by a decrease in ad sales on Broadway.com due to changes in its advertising model to reduce banner ad sales and increase sponsorships from    25           theater producers. The increase in ad sales revenue from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the acquisition of CinemasOnline in November 2005 and growth of ad sales on Hollywood.com and Broadway.com, as well as increased commission revenue from ad sales on MovieTickets.com. CinemasOnline contributed $4,158,393 to the increase in revenue from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006. Ad Sales revenue is generated from the sale of advertising and sponsorships on Hollywood.com as well as advertising sales by CinemasOnline. Hollywood Media also earns commissions on ad sales which Hollywood Media sells for placement on MovieTickets.com.              Intellectual Properties net revenues were $1,061,118 for fiscal 2007, compared to $1,229,126 for fiscal 2006 and $1,550,580 for fiscal 2005. Net revenues generated from Intellectual Properties decreased $168,008, or 14%, in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 and decreased $321,454, or 21%, in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The decrease in revenues from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007, as well as from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was attributable to the timing of the delivery of manuscripts as fewer manuscripts were delivered in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 and to sluggishness in the publishing industry. The Intellectual Properties division generates revenues from several different activities including book development and licensing, and intellectual property licensing. Revenues vary quarter to quarter depending on the timing of delivery of manuscripts to the publishers. Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete and ultimate collection of such revenues is no longer subject to contingencies. This division does not include NetCo Partners, which is reported separately; see Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees below.    Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees               Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees consists of the following:                                                                                      For the years ended December 31,                     2007              2006              2005              NetCo Partners (a)         $    4,747              $    12,227              $    533,228           MovieTickets.com (b)                                                                                                                             $    4,747              $    12,227              $    533,228                                                                           (a) NetCo Partners              NetCo Partners owns  Tom Clancys NetForce  and is primarily engaged in the development and licensing of  Tom Clancys NetForce . NetCo Partners recognizes revenues when the earnings process has been completed based on the terms of the various agreements, generally upon the delivery of the manuscript to the publisher and at the point where ultimate collection is substantially assured. When advances are received prior to completion of the earnings process, NetCo Partners defers recognition of revenue until the earnings process has been completed. Hollywood Media owns 50% of NetCo Partners and accounts for its investment under the equity method. Hollywood Medias 50% share of earnings of NetCo Partners was $4,747 for fiscal 2007 a decrease of 61% or $7,480 as compared to $12,227 for fiscal 2006. Our 50% share of earnings was $533,228 for fiscal 2005. Revenues decreased for fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 and 2005 primarily due to fewer manuscripts delivered. Revenues vary year to year dependent on the timing of deliveries of manuscripts to the publisher. Costs related to the acquisition, development and sales of the intellectual properties and their licensed products are expensed in proportion to the revenues that have been recognized.              (b) MovieTickets.com              Hollywood Media owns 26.2% of the total equity in the MovieTickets.com, Inc. joint venture. Hollywood Media records its investment in MovieTickets.com under the equity method of accounting, recognizing its percentage interest in MovieTickets.coms income or loss as equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees. Under applicable accounting principles, Hollywood Media has not recorded income from its investment in MovieTickets.com for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 because accumulated losses from fiscal 2005 and prior years exceed MovieTickets.coms accumulated net income in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006. The   26          MovieTickets.com web site generates revenues from service fees charged to users for the purchase of movie tickets online and the sale of advertising.              MovieTickets.com is a leading destination for the purchase of movie tickets through the Internet. Hollywood Media launched the MovieTickets.com website in May 2000 with several major movie theater exhibitors. The MovieTickets.com website allows users to purchase movie tickets and retrieve them at will call windows or kiosks at theaters or the user can print at home for theatres with that capacity. The website generates revenues from service fees charged to users for the purchase of tickets and the sale of advertising. Service fees on ticket sales were introduced in November 2000. MovieTickets.coms participating exhibitors operate theaters located in all of the top twenty markets and approximately 70% of the top 50 and top 100 markets in the United States and Canada and represent approximately 50% of the top 50 and top 100 grossing theaters in North America. Additionally, MovieTickets.com operates in the United Kingdom. See Item 1  Business, and Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about MovieTickets.com.    Operating Expenses                Cost of Revenues  Ticketing.  Cost of revenues  ticketing was $93,367,536 for fiscal 2007 compared to $81,928,952 for fiscal 2006 and $67,515,534 for fiscal 2005. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of tickets and credit card fees for the Broadway Ticketing segment, partially offset by rebates received from certain producers based on exceeding certain ticketing sales goals. As a percentage of ticketing revenues, cost of revenues  ticketing was 84%, 84% and 86% for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The reduction in cost of revenue as percentage of ticketing revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due in large part to a greater proportion of higher margin consumer ticket sales in 2006 as compared to 2005.              We have increased ticket pricing flexibility following the adoption of legislation in New York during 2007 that eliminated price caps on service fees on event tickets. We continue adjusting and evaluating our pricing models on our consumer sales with the goal of expanding margins on tickets. As a result, our overall margin percentage on consumer ticket sales increased during 2007 as compared to 2006. The overall Broadway Ticketing segments gross margin percentage on ticket sales is influenced by the mix of consumer ticket sales and group sales, because group sales typically generate lower margin than consumer sales, and the consumer-to-group ratio varies from period to period.               Editorial, Production, Development and Technology.  Editorial, production, development and technology costs include payroll and related expenses for the editorial and production staff responsible for (i) creating content and supporting Ad Sales on Hollywood Medias websites, including Hollywood.com and Broadway.com, and (ii) supporting Ad Sales on the MovieTickets.com website. These expenses also include Internet access and computer related expenses for the support and delivery of these services, and fees and royalties paid to authors and co-editors for the Intellectual Properties segment. Editorial, production, development and technology costs for fiscal 2007 were $6,286,130 as compared to $5,331,498 for fiscal 2006 and $2,991,091 for fiscal 2005. As a percentage of aggregate net revenues from our Ad Sales and Intellectual Properties segments, these costs were 52%, 47% and 49% for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 increase in Editorial, Production, Development and Technology as a percentage of revenue was mainly due to increased investment in the Ad Sales segment in terms of further development of our web sites and new hires in our production and editorial staff, as well as increased commission payments in our U.K. subsidiaries. The decrease in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 in Editorial, Production, Development and Technology costs as a percentage of revenue is due in part to lower incremental costs associated with the increased revenues in the Ad Sales segment.               Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist of occupancy costs, professional and consulting service fees, telecommunications costs, provision for doubtful accounts receivable, general insurance costs, selling and marketing costs (such as advertising, marketing, promotional, business development, public relations, and commissions due to advertising agencies, advertising representative firms and other parties). The SG&A expenses for fiscal 2007 were $16,321,373 compared to    27           $14,884,268 for fiscal 2006, for an increase of $1,437,105, or 10%, and $10,818,088 for fiscal 2005, for an increase in fiscal 2006 of $4,066,180 or 38% as compared to fiscal 2005. As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expenses were 13% for fiscal 2007, 14% for fiscal 2006 and 13% for fiscal 2005. The increase in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was due in large part to the following: (i) increased occupancy expense of $821,155, of which approximately $625,390 is temporary redundant lease expense for our Broadway Ticketing division while we moved our New York office to new consolidated space nearby, and (ii) an increase of approximately $481,190 in advertising expenses for our Broadway Ticketing division. The increase in SG&A in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 (excluding the impact of the CinemasOnline acquisition in November 2005) was due primarily to an increase of $1,778,000 in advertising expense in the Broadway Ticketing segment, an increase of $1,295,000 in consulting expense mainly due to our outsourcing of technology to third party providers in India and to cover our staffing needs at one of our subsidiaries while we changed our organizational structure, an increase in bad debt expense of $282,000, and an increase in travel and entertainment of $117,000, offset in part by decreases in Sarbanes Oxley consulting fees of $513,000 and accounting fees of $146,000. In addition, the acquisition of CinemasOnline in November 2005 increased SG&A expense in fiscal 2006 by $884,000 as compared to fiscal 2005.               Payroll and Benefits.               Payroll and benefits expenses consist of payroll and benefits including any other types of compensation benefits as well as human resources and administrative functions.              Payroll and benefits expenses for fiscal 2007 were $16,072,400 as compared to $14,117,379 for fiscal 2006, an increase of $1,955,021, or 14%, and $13,586,986 for fiscal 2005. Payroll and benefits expenses increased $530,393, or 4%, in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. As a percentage of net revenues, payroll and benefits expenses were approximately 13% in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and 16% in fiscal 2005.              The increase in payroll and benefits in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was due in large part to the following factors: (i) an increase of approximately $751,000 in expenses relating to the hiring of additional salespersons for the ad sales division, and the addition of a new President of Hollywood.com, (ii) approximately $367,000 in additional payroll and benefits expenses resulting from the acquisition of the Showtix business in February 2007, (iii) an increase of $495,000 in additional payroll and benefits in our ticketing segment due to the hiring of additional accounting, managerial and other staff, and (iv) an increase in health insurance expense of approximately $139,000.              The increase in costs from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 relating to payroll and benefits was due in large part to the following factors: the acquisition of CinemasOnline in the fourth quarter of 2005 which added $746,298 of additional payroll costs to fiscal year 2006; $787,513 in additional share-based compensation (see Stock Option Plans; Warrants; and Employee Stock Based Compensation in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); our growing ticket volume on Broadway.com in fiscal 2006 required increases in technology and customer service personnel resources. These increases in expenses were offset in part by decreases in expenses resulting from outsourcing of information technology services to India.               Depreciation and Amortization.               Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of property and equipment, furniture and fixtures, web site development, leasehold improvements, equipment under capital leases and amortization of intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,847,171 for fiscal 2007 as compared to $1,702,427 for fiscal 2006 and $1,269,146 for fiscal 2005. Depreciation and amortization increased $144,744 or 9% in fiscal 2007 compared to an increase of $433,281, or 34%, in fiscal 2006. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 is primarily due to an increase in investments in our Ad Sales segment. The increase in depreciation and amortization from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles and a full year of expenses related to the CinemasOnline acquisition in November 2005.    28                       Interest, net.               Interest, net was income of $199,437 for fiscal 2007 as compared to an expense of $1,787,735 for fiscal 2006 and an expense of $545,597 for fiscal 2005. The decrease of $1,987,172 or 111% in interest, net in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to the payoff of $7,000,000 principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes in May 2007, accretion of debt discount and increased income from interest bearing accounts. The increase of $1,242,138, or 228%, in interest, net in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily attributable to the issuance of $7,000,000 in Senior Unsecured Notes on November 23, 2005, resulting in higher interest expense in fiscal 2006.               Change in derivative liability.               Change in derivative liability was $0 for fiscal 2007 as compared to a positive amount of $640,536 for fiscal 2006 and $87,037 for fiscal 2005. The change in derivative liability to zero in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was due to a change in accounting principle from the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement effective as of January 1, 2007, which eliminated the derivative liability through shareholders equity. See Note 11  Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K report. The increase in gain of $553,499 or 636% in change in derivative liability in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 was due to a decrease in the fair value of the derivative, resulting from a reduction in the Companys share price.               Net Income (Loss).               Hollywood Medias net income for fiscal 2007 was $1,734,609 as compared to a net income for fiscal 2006 of $9,522,513 and a net loss of $8,913,182 for fiscal 2005. The net income decreased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 by $7,778,904, or 82%, primarily due to the gain on sale of the Showtimes business in 2007 being smaller than the gain on the sale of Baseline/StudioSystems business in 2006. The net income increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 by $18,435,695, primarily due to the gain on sale of the Baseline/StudioSystems business and growth in our Broadway Ticketing and Ad Sales segments, offset by decreasing operating income in our Intellectual Properties segment.    LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Cash Balance at Year End; Sources and Uses of Cash               Hollywood Medias cash and cash equivalents were $26,758,550 at December 31, 2007 as compared to $27,448,649 at December 31, 2006. Our net working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $20,161,486 at December 31, 2007 as compared to $16,380,362 at December 31, 2006.              Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2007 was $9,606,933, which cash usage was primarily attributable to the loss from continuing operations. Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during 2006 was $6,622,395.              Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2007 was $18,836,591, which net cash included, among other things, $25,418,361 in cash proceeds from the sale of assets (including sale of the Showtimes business, discussed below), and cash outlays which included, among other things, $3,763,247 for capital expenditures (including $2,511,424 for leasehold improvements for the new Broadway offices in New York City) and $2,690,659 for the acquisition of the Showtix business. Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2006 was $23,803,922, which net cash included, among other things, $25,159,520 in cash proceeds from the sale of assets (including sale of the Baseline/StudioSystems business, discussed below), and cash outlays of $1,117,060 for capital expenditures.    29                      Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2007 was $11,845,959, which cash usage included, among other things, $7 million for repayment in full of all outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes (discussed below), and approximately $5.1 million for the repurchase of common stock of Hollywood Media under the previously announced stock repurchase program (discussed below). Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2006 was $341,419.    Sale of Showtimes Business Unit to West World Media LLC               On August 24, 2007, Hollywood Media and its wholly-owned subsidiary Showtimes, entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive asset purchase agreement with Brett West and West World Media, pursuant to which Hollywood Media sold substantially all of the assets of the Showtimes business to West World Media for a cash purchase price of $23,000,000 paid to Hollywood Media on the closing date. The Showtimes business included the CinemaSource, EventSource and ExhibitorAds operations and constituted the remainder of Hollywood Medias Data Business Division, which previously included the Baseline/StudioSystems business unit until it was sold to The New York Times on August 25, 2006. West World Media is controlled by Brett West, who founded the Showtimes business in 1995 and sold the business to Hollywood Media in 1999. Mr. West served as president of Hollywood Medias Showtimes business. The purchase price was determined in an arms length negotiation between Hollywood Media and West World Media. The purchase price decreased due to a post-closing adjustment of $114,454 paid by Hollywood Media to West World Media in January 2008. Hollywood Medias expenditures relating to the sale include approximately $553,000 in estimated state and federal income taxes and approximately $1.7 million in fees and expenses payable to Hollywood Medias financial and legal advisors. For additional information about this transaction, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K Report.    Acquisition of Showtix Business               On February 1, 2007, TDI invested approximately $2.7 million in cash to consummate its acquisition of the Broadway ticketing business of Showtix. See Note 5 Acquisitions and Other Capital Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K report.    Sale of Baseline StudioSystems Business Unit to The New York Times Company               On August 25, 2006, Hollywood Media entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with The New York Times, pursuant to which The New York Times purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of Hollywood Medias wholly-owned subsidiary, Baseline Acquisitions Corp. (BAC), for a cash purchase price of $35,000,000. BAC was the subsidiary of Hollywood Media that owned Hollywood Medias Baseline business unit. Baseline constituted a portion of Hollywood Medias Data Business division. This sale to The New York Times did not include the other components of Hollywood Medias Data Business division (e.g., CinemaSource, EventSource and ExhibitorAds). $3.5 million of the purchase price was held in escrow for twelve months following the closing to cover potential indemnification claims by The New York Times under the terms of the Purchase Agreement. As of September 30, 2007, Hollywood Media received the full amount of the escrow net of $700,000 for payment of previously expensed bonuses due the former division heads under preexisting agreements. The net amount of $2,800,000 of escrow, and accumulated interest, was received during the three months ended September 30, 2007. For additional information about this transaction, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K Report.    2004 Private Placement               In February 2004, Hollywood Media completed a private placement of common stock, which included the issuance of 5,773,355 shares of common stock to investors and five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,732,006 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $2.84 per share. Hollywood Medias net cash proceeds from the private placement were approximately $15.1 million after deduction of expenses in   30          connection with the transaction. Hollywood Media received $188,803 and $803,664 net of placement agent commission, from the exercise of a portion of these warrants during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005, respectively.    Senior Unsecured Notes Issued in 2005               On November 23, 2005, Hollywood Media issued and sold $7,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior Unsecured Notes (the Senior Notes) for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $7,000,000. In May 2007, Hollywood Media paid off the Senior Notes in full, including the $7,000,000 in principal plus accrued interest, in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes, and there is no outstanding balance remaining on the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes carried an 8% interest rate and an initial 12 month term, on which interest was payable in quarterly installments commencing December 31, 2005. Hollywood Medias net cash proceeds from the issuance, net of issuance costs, were $6,595,690. The holders of the Senior Notes also received warrants to purchase 700,000 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock at an exercise price of $4.29 per share. In March 2006, Hollywood Media exercised its option under the terms of the Senior Notes, to extend the maturity date of the Senior Notes to May 23, 2007 in exchange for the delivery of additional five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock with exercise price per share at $4.29. The Senior Notes were not convertible at the option of the holders.    Capital Expenditures               Our capital expenditures during 2007 (excluding discontinued operations) were $3,763,247. We currently anticipate capital expenditures in 2008 of approximately $1.5 million, including various systems and equipment upgrades. These anticipated 2008 capital expenditures do not include any estimates for potential business acquisitions.    Outlook               Our cash and cash equivalents generated from the sales of our Baseline/StudioSystems and Showtimes businesses in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, respectively, have provided substantial additional working capital for Hollywood Media, and we have utilized portions of such working capital for various corporate purposes and business activities including, among other things, the repayment of debt and the purchase of the Showtix business referenced above, improvements and investments in various aspects of our Broadway Ticketing and Hollywood.com divisions, and for the repurchase of shares of Hollywood Medias common stock pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program (discussed below). Our businesses have required substantial financing, and may require additional capital to fund our growth plans and for working capital, which capital requirements we contemplate will be satisfied from our cash and cash equivalents on hand. Based on our current plans and assumptions for operations and investment and financing activities, we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and investment requirements at least through December 31, 2008. If our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek further financing or curtail our growth and/or operations. We believe that our long-term financial success ultimately depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to more than offset operating expenses.              While we continue to develop our businesses, we have resumed our strategic review process which may help us realize the full value of our assets in the interest of our shareholders. In prior years, our strategic review process resulted in the sales of our Baseline/StudioSystems and Showtimes businesses in 2006 and 2007, respectively. We continue to explore opportunities for generating returns for Hollywood Medias shareholders, and such activities currently include working with JPMorgan as our financial advisor to consider opportunities including potential dispositions or other strategic transactions. Prior to resuming our strategic review process, we had, as stated in our press release dated October 1, 2007, temporarily suspended such process when our Board of Directors approved the stock repurchase program referenced below. We cannot make assurances as to the timing or occurrence of any future strategic transactions or further stock repurchases.    31            Authorization of Stock Repurchase Program               Hollywood Media previously reported in its current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 4, 2007, that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which Hollywood Media may use up to $10 million of its cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock. See Part II, Item 5, of this Form 10-K report for information about stock repurchases by Hollywood Media during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.              Pursuant to the repurchase program, Hollywood Media is authorized to purchase shares of its common stock from time to time on the open market or in negotiated transactions. The purchases are to be funded from available cash and cash equivalents, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by Hollywood Medias management based on its evaluation of financial and market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time, and there is no guarantee as to the number of shares or the amount of cash to be utilized for repurchases. Repurchased shares will become authorized but unissued shares of Hollywood Medias common stock.    Contractual Obligations               The following table sets forth information regarding certain types of our contractual obligations specified below as of December 31, 2007, in accordance with SEC rules requiring this disclosure.                                                                                                                              Payments Due by Period           Contractual                             Less than              Years              Years              After           Obligations         Total              1 Year              1-3              4-5              5 Years              Capital lease obligations (1)         $    474,413              $    186,300              $    283,330              $    4,783              $               Operating lease obligations (2)              9,876,931                   1,304,161                   3,619,004                   2,072,715                   2,881,051                                                                                                                                                                                                        Total contractual obligations         $    10,351,344              $    1,490,461              $    3,902,334              $    2,077,498              $    2,881,051                                                                                                                   (1)         Capital lease obligations are future lease payments under capital leases inclusive of interest.           (2)         Operating lease obligations include leases pertaining to various leased offices and facilities and those classified as operating leases for financial statement purposes. Certain leases provide for payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance, insurance, and certain other expenses. Lease terms expire at various dates through the year 2017. Also, certain equipment used in Hollywood Medias operations is leased under operating leases.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements               At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 of SEC Regulation S-K. As such, management believes that we currently do not have any disclosures to make of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 regarding off-balance sheet arrangements.    Critical Accounting Policies               In response to the SECs Release Number 33-8040 Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies and SEC Release Number 33-8056, Commission Statement about Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity     32           with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to asset impairment, accruals for compensation and related benefits, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, and contingencies and litigation. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For additional information about our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.               Allowance for Doubtful Accounts               Hollywood Media maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Companys accounting for doubtful accounts contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectibility of these accounts. When preparing these estimates, management considers a number of factors, including the aging of a customers account, past transactions with customers, creditworthiness of specific customers, historical trends and other information. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,166,425 and $1,159,503 at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The allowance is primarily attributable to receivables due from customers of CinemasOnline. Although the Company believes its allowance is sufficient, if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to unexpectedly deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion across many different geographic regions.               Ticketing Revenue Recognition               Ticket revenue is derived from the sale of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and London shows to individuals, groups, travel agencies, tour groups and educational organizations. Proceeds from these sales received in advance of the corresponding performance activity are included in Deferred Revenue in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue in the period the performance of the show occurs.              Gift certificate revenue is derived from the sale of gift certificates for Broadway, off-Broadway, London shows and Dinner and Show sales to individuals, groups, travel agencies, tour groups and corporate programs. Proceeds from these sales are included in Deferred Revenue in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, at the time of receipt, and if redeemed, are recognized as revenue in the period in which the performance of the show occurs, or upon expiration of the unredeemed gift certificate. Gift certificates issued after March 22, 2007 do not expire. Prior to March 22, 2007, gift certificates were issued with a one-year expiration from the date of issuance.              Hotel package revenue is derived from the sale of exclusive allocation rooms provided by New York City hotels to individuals and groups. Proceeds from these sales are recorded on a net basis and are included in Customer Deposits in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue on the day of departure from the hotel.              Dinner voucher revenue is derived from the sale of dinner vouchers for meals at upscale restaurants in New York City to individuals and groups. Proceeds from these sales are recorded on a net basis and are included in Customer Deposits in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue on the date the voucher is presented, or upon expiration of the voucher.              In July 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) of the FASB reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 99-19,  Reporting Revenue Gross as a Principal versus Net as an Agent.  This consensus provides     33           guidance concerning under what circumstances a company should report revenue based on (a) the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services or (b) the net amount retained (that is, the amount billed to the customer less the amount paid to a supplier) because it has earned a commission or fee. Hollywood Medias existing accounting policies conform to the EITF consensus. Ticket revenue and cost of revenue-ticketing are recorded on a gross basis in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Hotel revenues packages and vouchers sold for New York restaurants are reported on a net basis in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.               Stock Based Compensation               As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transaction and Disclosure  an amendment of FAS 123 (SFAS No. 148), which amended Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), we chose to account for our stock plans under the intrinsic value method as allowed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25) and related interpretations through December 31, 2005. Under APB No. 25, because the exercise price of our employee stock options typically equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense was recorded upon grant. SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of our employee stock options granted and pro forma financial information assuming compensation expense was recorded using these fair values. Determining the fair value of stock options requires the Company to make assumptions regarding the key variables of a stock option pricing model which includes expected volatility, estimated life and dividend yield. These estimates are sensitive to changes in several factors including market conditions.              In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaces SFAS No. 123 and supercedes APB No. 25. SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In March 2005, the Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) which expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the application of SFAS No. 123R. SAB 107 provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the SEC staffs views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. In April 2005, the Commission amended compliance dates for SFAS No. 123R to allow companies to implement SFAS No. 123R at the beginning of their next fiscal year, instead of the next fiscal reporting period that began after June 15, 2005. The Company was required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006, at which time the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The proforma effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the Black-Scholes pricing model on diluted earnings per common share for fiscal 2005 is disclosed in Note 3  Stock Option Plans; Warrants; and Employee Stock Based Compensation in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company has adopted the provisions of the statement as of January 1, 2006. Application of the standard may have a material impact on the results of operations in future periods.               Impairment of Long-Lived Assets               Effective December 31, 2001, Hollywood Media adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). SFAS No. 144 superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of (SFAS No. 121) and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations  Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, (APB No. 30) for the disposal of a segment of a business. Consistent with SFAS No. 121, SFAS No. 144 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount.    34                      We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them annually as of October 1. If and at the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. We estimate fair value based on an analysis of the net present value of estimated future cash flows. Based on these evaluations, there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets during fiscal 2007, 2006, or 2005.              In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001 are no longer subject to amortization. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to June 30, 2001 ceased to be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, SFAS 142 changed the way we evaluated goodwill and intangibles for impairment. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized; however, they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test. The fair value based test is a two-step test. The first step involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we are required to proceed to the second step. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets (including unrecognized intangibles) and liabilities of the reporting unit, with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value.              As prescribed by SFAS No. 142, we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of fiscal 2002 which did not result in an impairment charge. Additionally, Hollywood Media established October 1, as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 and there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets. As of December 31, 2007, we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of Hollywood Medias goodwill for impairment. Future changes in estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including revenue projections or market values could cause the analysis to indicate that Hollywood Medias goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write-off of a portion or all of the goodwill. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease did not result in the impairment of goodwill of any reporting unit.    Inflation and Seasonality               Although we cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation, we do not believe inflation has a material effect on revenue or results of operations. We consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our Tekno Books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi-annually. The Broadway Ticketing Business is also influenced by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the Tony Awards ©  and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holiday period. In addition, although not seasonal, our Intellectual Properties division and NetCo Partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams, earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements. The recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis.       Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK .              Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in our assets or liabilities that might occur due to changes in market rates and prices, such as interest or foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other relevant market rate or price changes.    35                      Interest rates charged on Hollywood Medias debt instruments are primarily fixed in nature. We therefore do not believe that the risk of loss relating to the effect of changes in market interest rates is material.              We have investments in subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and sell our services into this foreign market. Our foreign net asset/exposures (defined as assets denominated in foreign currency less liabilities denominated in foreign currency) for the United Kingdom at December 31, 2007 of U.S. dollar equivalents was a net liability of $1,420,089.              Our United Kingdom subsidiaries sell services and pay for products and services in British pounds. A decrease in the British foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely impact our margins. An assumed 10% depreciation of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of fiscal 2007 (i.e., in addition to actual exchange experience) would have resulted in a translation reduction of our revenue by $892,548 for fiscal 2007.              As the assets, liabilities and transactions of our United Kingdom subsidiaries are denominated in British pounds, the results and financial condition are subject to translation adjustments upon their conversion into U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes. A 10% decline in this foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of 2007 (i.e., in addition to actual exchange experience) would have resulted in a translation reduction of our net income of $119,787 for fiscal 2007.    36               Item 8.
