Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation .          The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hollywood Medias Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.   Overview          Hollywood Medias continuing operations are of various businesses focusing primarily on online ticket sales, deriving revenue primarily from Broadway, Off-Broadway and Londons West End ticket sales to individuals and groups, as well as advertising and book development license fees and royalties. Our Broadway Ticketing business includes Broadway.com, 1-800-BROADWAY, Theatre Direct and Theatre.com. Hollywood Medias businesses also include an intellectual property business, the U.K. based CinemasOnline companies and a minority interest in MovieTickets.com.   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           Year ended December 31, 2008 (fiscal 2008) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 (fiscal 2007) and year ended December 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006).    Composition of our business segments are as follows:                         Broadway Ticketing   sells tickets and related hotel and restaurant packages via Broadway.com, 1-800-BROADWAY and TDI to live theater events on Broadway, Off-Broadway and Londons West End, to individual consumers, groups and domestic and international travel professionals, including travel agencies, tour operators, and educational institutions. Beginning in late September 2007, sales for events in Londons West End are fulfilled through a partnership arrangement between Theatre.com and an unrelated London-based ticket agency. This segment also generates revenue from the sale of sponsorships and advertisements on Broadway.com.                           Ad Sales   includes CinemasOnline which sells advertising on cinema and theater websites in the U.K. and plasma TV displays throughout the U.K. and Ireland and holds Hollywood Medias investment in MovieTickets.com.                           Intellectual Properties   owns or controls the exclusive rights to certain intellectual properties created by best-selling authors and media celebrities, which it licenses for book and other media. This segment includes a 51% interest in Tekno Books, and a book development business, and this segment does not include our 50% interest in NetCo Partners.                           Other   is comprised of payroll and benefits for corporate and administrative personnel as well as other corporate-wide expenses, such as legal fees, audit fees, proxy costs, insurance, centralized information technology, and includes consulting and other fees and costs relating to compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that require Hollywood Media to assess and report on internal control over financial reporting, and related development of controls.       Results of Discontinued Operations           Sale of Hollywood.com Business Unit to R&S Investments, LLC          On August 21, 2008, Hollywood Media entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive purchase agreement with R&S Investments, LLC, pursuant to which R&S Investments acquired the Hollywood.com Business for a potential purchase price of $10.0 million, which includes $1.0 million in cash that was paid to Hollywood Media at closing and potential earn-out payments of up to $9.0 million. The Hollywood.com Business includes the Hollywood.com website and related URLs and celebrity fan websites and Hollywood.com Television, a free video on demand service distributed pursuant to annual affiliation agreements with certain   21        cable operators. R&S Investments is owned by Mitchell Rubenstein, Hollywood Medias Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Board, and Laurie S. Silvers, Hollywood Medias President and Vice-Chairperson of the Board. The purchase price was determined by an arms-length negotiation between a Special Committee of independent and disinterested directors of Hollywood Media on the one hand and R&S Investments on the other hand.         Beginning in September 2009, R&S Investments will be contractually obligated to make periodic earn-out payments equal to the greater of (i) 10 percent of gross revenue and (ii) 90 percent of EBITDA (as defined in the purchase agreement) for the Hollywood.com Business until the full earn-out is paid. If a change of control of Hollywood.com occurs before the earn-out is fully paid, the remaining portion of the earn-out would be payable immediately upon such a change of control, up to the amount of consideration received by R&S Investments less related expenses. If the consideration in such a change of control is less than the remaining balance of the earn-out, then the subsequent buyer will be obligated to pay the difference in accordance with the same earn-out terms. In addition, if Hollywood.com is resold within three years, Hollywood Media will also receive 5 percent of any proceeds above $10.0 million. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Hollywood Media was required to place $2.6 million into an escrow account to fund any negative EBITDA of the Hollywood.com Business up to a maximum of $2.6 million through August 21, 2010.        For additional information about this transaction, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K Report.         Sale of Showtimes Business Unit to West World Media          On August 24, 2007, Hollywood Media Corp. entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive asset purchase agreement with West World Media and its principal, a former employee, pursuant to which Hollywood Media sold to West World Media substantially all of the assets of its Showtimes business for a cash purchase price of $23.0 million subject to a working capital post-closing adjustment. The working capital post-closing adjustment was a price reduction of $0.1 million, which was paid by Hollywood Media to West World Media in January 2008.         Sale of Baseline/StudioSystems Business Unit to The New York Times Company          On August 25, 2006, Hollywood Media sold the Baseline/StudioSystems business to The New York Times for a cash purchase price of $35.0 million. As per the purchase agreement, $3.5 million of the purchase price was held in escrow for twelve months following the closing to cover potential indemnification claims, if any, made by The New York Times. During 2007, Hollywood Media received $2.8 million, representing the full amount of the escrow, net of costs of $0.7 million for certain contractual bonuses due to the former division heads.        Following are components of the net results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The results for fiscal 2008, 2007 and fiscal 2006 in the table below include the results of the sold businesses for only the periods up to the date on which the Hollywood.com Business and the Showtimes and Baseline/StudioSystems businesses were sold (August 21, 2008, August 24, 2007 and August 25, 2006, respectively).                                                                                                                                         2008              2007              2006                     (in millions)              (in millions)              (in millions)              Operating revenue         $    3.9              $    10.0              $    15.1                                                               Gain (loss) on sale of discontinued operations net of income taxes of $0.6 million and $0.5 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively              (4.7    )              10.2                   16.3           Income (loss) from discontinued operations              (1.6    )              (0.2    )              2.2                                                               Income (loss) from discontinued operations         $    (6.3    )         $    10.0              $    18.5                                                                 22          Results of Continuing Operations          The following tables summarize changes in Hollywood Medias revenue and operating expense from continuing operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

the year ended December 31, 2007 were negatively impacted by the Broadway stagehand strike that ended on November 28, 2007 and caused 19 days of cancelled Broadway performances. We received refunds or credits from the shows box offices on virtually all tickets purchased by the Broadway Ticketing division for cancelled performances. We worked with customers to address orders placed for these cancelled performances, and refunds or exchanges were provided at the election of the customer. Any orders not refunded or exchanged by the end of fiscal 2007 were included in Customer deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.   Note Regarding Known Material Trends, Uncertainties and Opportunities Impacting Hollywood Media          Hollywood Media expects to have continuing losses in the near term. Notwithstanding these losses, as described below under Liquidity and Capital Resources, Hollywood Media expects that it will be able to satisfy its near term liquidity obligations. Other than the normal seasonal variance described under Inflation and Seasonality, Hollywood Media does not expect that there will be a significant variance in its earnings or its cash flows near term and accordingly does not expect its trend of losses to accelerate.        Known material trends, uncertainties and other factors that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on Hollywood Medias revenues, earnings and liquidity include the following:                  the United States and global economic downturn, which can adversely affect business and personal discretionary spending for entertainment-related items such as theater tickets, and has resulted in a reduction in tickets sold and in net revenue;                      increases in Broadway ticket prices, which can positively affect Hollywood Medias revenues as the ticket service fees Hollywood Media earns are based on a percentage of ticket prices, but which can also result in a lower of volume of tickets being sold and could adversely affect Hollywood Medias revenues and, accordingly, its earnings and cash flow; and                      New York States repeal of caps on ticket service fees, which has given Hollywood Media greater flexibility to charge increased service fees on tickets for high demand shows, such as Wicked and Jersey Boys.            Hollywood Media is also exploring market opportunities which could have a material impact on its revenues, earnings and liquidity, including expansion into discount ticketing markets. Such expansion would allow Hollywood Media to sell tickets at variable price points, which Hollywood Media expects would attract a greater variety of customers. There is no assurance, however, that Hollywood Media will ultimately pursue these opportunities or if it does, that they will be successful.   24         Net Revenues          Total net revenues for fiscal 2008 were $117.1 million compared to $118.2 million and $104.5 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006, respectively. Revenues decreased $1.1 million, or 1%, in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 and increased $13.7 million, or 13%, in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily the result of decreases in Broadway ticketing revenue of $0.9 million and Ad Sales revenue of $0.5 million, offset in part by an increase in Intellectual Properties revenue of $0.3 million. The increase in net revenues for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily the result of increases in Broadway ticketing revenue of $13.1 million and Ad Sales revenue of $0.7 million, offset in part by a decrease in Intellectual Properties revenue of $0.1 million. In fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, net revenues were derived 95% from Broadway Ticketing, 4% from Ad Sales and 1% from Intellectual Properties. In fiscal 2006, net revenues were derived 94% from Broadway Ticketing, 5% from Ad Sales and 1% from Intellectual Properties.        Broadway Ticketing net revenue for fiscal 2008 was $110.9 million as compared to $111.8 million for fiscal 2007, and $98.7 million for fiscal 2006. Broadway Ticketing net revenue decreased $0.9 million, or 1%, for fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 and increased $13.1 million, or 13%, for fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The decrease in Broadway Ticketing net revenue in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue of $3.6 million from Theatre.com primarily as a result of shifting from Theatre.com handling its own sales to an arrangement with a third party ticket agency in September 2007. As a result of this arrangement, Theatre.com now recognizes revenue based on net commissions instead of gross ticket price. Such decreased revenue was offset by an increase in revenues to consumers of $2.3 million, which includes: ticket price increases by theaters of $3.9 million, an increase in service fees on individual ticket sales of $2.0 million, offset by a decrease in revenues of $1.7 million from a decrease in quantity of tickets sold, a decrease in hotel package sales of $0.9 million, decrease in gift certificate revenue of $0.6 million due to a change in expiration policy and a decrease in sales of cancellation insurance of $0.4 million. The decline in Broadway Ticketing net revenue was further offset by an increase in sponsorship sales of $0.4 million. The increase in Broadway Ticketing net revenue in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily attributable to the result of an increase in sales to consumers of $11.1 million, which includes: increases in number of tickets sold of $5.6 million; ticket price increases by theaters of $4.3 million; and increases in service fees on individual ticket sales of $1.2 million. In addition, the purchase of the Showtix business in February 2007 contributed $2.1 million of revenue, offset by a reduction in banner advertising sales of $0.5 million.        Ad Sales net revenue was $4.8 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to $5.3 million for fiscal 2007 and $4.6 million for fiscal 2006. Ad Sales net revenue decreased $0.5 million, or 9%, for fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 and increased $0.7 million, or 15%, for fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The decrease in Ad Sales from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 is directly attributable to a decrease in UK advertising sales of $0.5 million, which includes: decreases in the brochure and web advertising revenues of $1.1 million, offset in part by an increase in growth of the plasma business of $0.6 million. The increase in Ad Sales from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 is directly attributable to an increase in UK advertising sales of $0.7 million, which includes: increases in the plasma business and the brochure advertising business of $0.6 million and $0.1 million, respectively.        Intellectual Properties net revenues were $1.4 million for fiscal 2008, compared to $1.0 million for fiscal 2007 and $1.2 million for fiscal 2006. Net revenues generated from Intellectual Properties increased $0.3 million, or 27%, in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 and decreased $0.1 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The increase in revenues from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2007, as well as the decrease from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was attributable to the timing of the delivery of manuscripts. The Intellectual Properties division generates revenues from several different activities including book development and licensing, and intellectual property licensing. Revenues vary quarter to quarter depending on the timing of delivery of manuscripts to the publishers. Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete and ultimate collection of such revenues is no longer subject to contingencies. This division does not include NetCo Partners, which is reported separately; see Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees below.   25         Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees          Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees consists of the following:                                                                                     For the years ended December 31,                     2008              2007              2006                     (in millions)              (in millions)              (in millions)              NetCo Partners (a)         $    (0.1    )         $                  $               MovieTickets.com (b)              1.3                                                                                                               $    1.2              $                  $                                                                                              (a) NetCo Partners                NetCo Partners owns  Tom Clancys NetForce  and is primarily engaged in the development and licensing of  Tom Clancys NetForce . NetCo Partners recognizes revenues when the earnings process has been completed based on the terms of the various agreements, generally upon the delivery of the manuscript to the publisher and at the point where ultimate collection is substantially assured. When advances are received prior to completion of the earnings process, NetCo Partners defers recognition of revenue until the earnings process has been completed. Hollywood Media owns 50% of NetCo Partners and accounts for its investment under the equity method. Hollywood Medias 50% share of loss of NetCo Partners was $0.1 million for fiscal 2008 a decrease of 100% or $0.1 million as compared to a de minimis amount for fiscal 2007. Our 50% share of earnings was de minimis for fiscal 2006. The decrease in earnings for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily because all accounts receivables that were over six months were fully reserved during fiscal 2008. Revenues decreased for fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to fewer manuscripts delivered. Revenues vary year to year dependent on the timing of deliveries of manuscripts to the publisher. Costs related to the acquisition, development and sales of the intellectual properties and their licensed products are expensed in proportion to the revenues that have been recognized.                              (b) MovieTickets.com               Hollywood Media owns 26.2% of the total equity in the MovieTickets.com joint venture. Hollywood Media records its investment in MovieTickets.com under the equity method of accounting, recognizing its percentage interest in MovieTickets.coms income or loss as equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees. Under applicable accounting principles, Hollywood Media has not recorded income from its investment in MovieTickets.com for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 because accumulated losses from fiscal 2006 and prior years exceed MovieTickets.coms accumulated net income in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. The MovieTickets.com web site generates revenues from service fees charged to users for the purchase of movie tickets online and the sale of advertising. The results above include $1.3 million in dividends received by Hollywood Media in 2008.             MovieTickets.com is a leading destination for the purchase of movie tickets through the Internet. Hollywood Media launched the MovieTickets.com website in May 2000 with several major movie theater exhibitors. The MovieTickets.com website allows users to purchase movie tickets and retrieve them at will call windows or kiosks at theaters or the user can print at home for theatres with that capacity. The website generates revenues from service fees charged to users for the purchase of tickets, the sale of advertising and the sale of research data. Service fees on ticket sales were introduced in November 2000. MovieTickets.coms participating exhibitors operate theaters located in all of the top twenty markets and approximately 70% of the top 50 and top 100 markets in the United States and Canada and represent approximately 50% of the top 50 and top 100 grossing theaters in North America. Additionally, MovieTickets.com operates in the United Kingdom. See Item 1  Business, and Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about MovieTickets.com.   26         Operating Expenses           Cost of Revenues  Ticketing.  Cost of revenues  ticketing was $92.9 million for fiscal 2008 compared to $94.0 million for fiscal 2007 and $82.5 million for fiscal 2006. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of tickets and credit card fees for the Broadway Ticketing segment, partially offset by rebates received from certain producers based on exceeding certain ticketing sales goals and co-op advertising. Cost of Revenues  Ticketing decreased $1.1 million, or 1%, for fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 and increased $11.5 million, or 14%, for fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. As a percentage of ticketing revenues, cost of revenues  ticketing was 84% in each of fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006.        The decrease in Cost of Revenues  Ticketing in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 is primarily attributable to the result of a decrease in sales to consumers of $1.0 million, which includes decreases in number of tickets sold from Theatre.com of $3.0 million, primarily as a result of the change to a net revenue share business model described above, and a decrease in number of tickets sold in our domestic Broadway business of $1.2 million, offset by ticket price increases by theaters of $3.1 million. The increase in Cost of Revenues  Ticketing in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily attributable to the result of an increase in sales to consumers of $9.6 million, which includes increases in number of tickets sold of $6.0 million and ticket price increases by theaters of $3.6 million. In addition, the purchase of the Showtix business in February 2007 contributed $1.8 million of cost of revenues  ticketing directly attributable to Showtix.         Editorial, Production, Development and Technology.  Editorial, production, development and technology costs include commissions, royalties, media buying, production services and internet access for CinemasOnline and fees and royalties paid to authors and co-editors for the Intellectual Properties segment. Editorial, production, development and technology costs for fiscal 2008 were $3.3 million as compared to $3.6 million for fiscal 2007 and $3.2 million for fiscal 2006. Editorial, production, development and technology costs decreased $0.3 million or 8% from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 and increased $0.4 million or 13% from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007. As a percentage of aggregate net revenues from our Ad Sales and Intellectual Properties segments, these costs were 54% and 56% for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, and 54% for fiscal 2006.        The fiscal 2008 decrease from fiscal 2007 was mainly due to a $0.1 million increase in payments to writer/co-editors along with an approximate $0.3 million decrease in the Ad Sales segment. The decrease in the Ad Sales segment was primarily due to an approximately $0.1 million decrease in each of production services, media buying and commissions. The fiscal 2007 increase over fiscal 2006 was primarily due to an approximately $0.5 million increase in costs in the Ad Sales segment offset by a minimal decrease in payments to writers/co-editors. The increase in the Ad Sales segment which was primarily due to a $0.2 million increase in royalties, a $0.2 million increase in commissions as well as a $0.1 million increase in media buying.         Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist of occupancy costs, professional and consulting service fees, telecommunications costs, provision for doubtful accounts receivable, general insurance costs, selling and marketing costs (such as advertising, marketing, promotional, business development, public relations, and commissions due to advertising agencies, advertising representative firms and other parties). The SG&A expenses for fiscal 2008 were $13.9 million compared to $14.3 million for fiscal 2007, for a decrease of $0.4 million or 3%, and $13.4 million for fiscal 2006, for an increase of $0.9 million, or 7%. As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expenses were 12% for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and 13% for fiscal 2006.        The decrease in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due in large part to increases in consulting fees of $0.3 million, and legal fees of $0.6 million, offset by a $0.6 million decrease in marketing expenses, $0.3 million reduction in bad debt expense and a $0.3 million decrease in accounting fees. The increase in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2007 over fiscal 2006 was due in large part to the following: (i) increased occupancy expense of $0.8 million, of which approximately $0.6 million is temporary redundant lease expense for our Broadway Ticketing division while we moved our New York office to new consolidated space nearby, (ii) an increase of approximately $0.5 million in advertising expenses for our Broadway Ticketing   27           division, and (iii) the increases were offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of $0.2 million.         Payroll and Benefits.          Payroll and benefits expenses consist of payroll and benefits including any other types of compensation benefits as well as human resources and administrative functions.        Payroll and benefits expenses for fiscal 2008 were $13.3 million as compared to $13.4 million for fiscal 2007, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 1%, and $12.1 million for fiscal 2006. Payroll and benefits expenses increased $1.3 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. As a percentage of net revenues, payroll and benefits expenses were approximately 11% in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 and 12% for fiscal 2006.        The decrease in payroll and benefits in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due to severance payments made following the divestment of the Hollywood.com Business of approximately $0.4 million for Hollywood Media employees at the Corporate headquarters, offset by reduction in costs in the Ad Sales segment of $0.2 million and the corporate office of $0.2 million, respectively.        The increase in payroll and benefits in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due in large part to the following factors: (i) an increase in the Ad Sales segment of $0.2 million, primarily due to bonus payments, (ii) approximately $0.4 million in additional payroll and benefits expenses resulting from the acquisition of the Showtix business in February 2007, (iii) an increase of $0.1 million in additional payroll and benefits in our ticketing segment due to the hiring of additional accounting, managerial and other staff, and (iv) an increase in health insurance expense of approximately $0.1 million.         Depreciation and Amortization.          Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of property and equipment, furniture and fixtures, web site development, leasehold improvements, equipment under capital leases and amortization of intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense was $2.2 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to $1.4 million for fiscal 2007 and $1.3 million for fiscal 2006. Depreciation and amortization increased $0.8 million or 57% in fiscal 2008 compared to an increase of $0.1 million, or 8%, in fiscal 2007. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 is primarily due to investments in computer equipment and new office space in New York City for our Broadway Ticketing segment as well as an increase in the amortization of intangible assets due to an external evaluation of the UK Ad Sales segment and also intangible assets purchased as part of the acquisition of Showtix. The increase in depreciation and amortization from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 is primarily due to an increase in investments in our UK Ad Sales segment.         Interest, net.          Interest, net was income of $0.4 million for fiscal 2008 as compared to income of $0.2 million for fiscal 2007 and an expense of $1.8 million for fiscal 2006. The increase of $0.2 million, or 100%, in interest, net in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to the payoff of $7.0 million principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes in May 2007, accretion of debit discount, and increased income from interest bearing accounts. The decrease of $2.0 million, or 111%, in interest, net in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was primarily attributable to the payoff of $7.0 million principal amount of Senior Unsecured Notes in May 2007, accretion of debt discount and increased income from interest bearing accounts.         Change in derivative liability.          There was no change in derivative liability for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Change in derivative liability was $0.6 million for fiscal 2006. The change in derivative liability to zero in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was due to a change in accounting principle from the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement effective as of January 1, 2007, which eliminated the derivative liability through shareholders equity. See Note 11  Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K report.   28               Net Income (Loss).          Hollywood Medias net loss for fiscal 2008 was $16.9 million as compared to a net income for fiscal 2007 of $1.7 million and a net income of $9.5 million for fiscal 2006. The net loss increased in fiscal 2008 as compared to the income in fiscal 2007 by $18.6 million, or 1094%, primarily due to the loss on sale of the Hollywood.com Business in 2008 and a non-cash one-time impairment charge of $3.5 million related to our Ad Sales and Intellectual Properties Segments, compared to the gain on the sale of the Showtimes business in 2007. The net income decreased in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 by $7.8 million, or 82%, primarily due to the gain on sale of the Showtimes business in 2007 being less than the gain on the sale of Baseline/StudioSystems business in 2006.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES     Cash Balance at Year End; Sources and Uses of Cash          Hollywood Medias cash and cash equivalents were $12.7 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $26.8 million at December 31, 2007. Our net working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $8.8 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to $20.2 million at December 31, 2007.        Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2008 was $4.5 million, which cash usage was primarily attributable to the loss from continuing operations, a change of 51% compared to net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations during 2007 of $9.2 million.        Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2008 was $1.4 million, which net cash was used to, among other things, purchase $1.3 million in capital expenditures. Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2007 was $19.4 million, which net cash included, among other things, $25.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale of assets (including sale of the Showtimes business, discussed below), and cash outlays which included, among other things, $3.4 million for capital expenditures (including $2.5 million for leasehold improvements for the new Broadway offices in New York City) and $2.7 million for the acquisition of the Showtix business.        Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2008 was $2.2 million, which cash usage included, among other things, $2.1 million to repurchase common stock. Net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations during fiscal 2007 was $11.8 million, which cash usage included, among other things, $7.0 million for repayment in full of all outstanding Senior Unsecured Notes (discussed below), and approximately $5.1 million for the repurchase of common stock of Hollywood Media under the previously announced stock repurchase program (discussed below).   Sale of Hollywood.com Business Unit to R&S Investments LLC          On August 21, 2008, Hollywood Media entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive purchase agreement with R&S Investments, LLC, pursuant to which R&S Investments acquired the Hollywood.com Business for a potential purchase price of $10.0 million, which includes $1.0 million in cash that was paid to Hollywood Media at closing and potential earn-out payments of up to $9.0 million. The Hollywood.com Business includes the Hollywood.com website and related URLs and celebrity fan websites and Hollywood.com Television, a free video on demand service distributed pursuant to annual affiliation agreements with certain cable operators. R&S Investments is owned by Mitchell Rubenstein, Hollywood Medias Chief Executive Officer and Chairperson of the Board, and Laurie S. Silvers, Hollywood Medias President and Vice-Chairperson of the Board. The purchase price was determined by an arms-length negotiation between a Special Committee of independent and disinterested directors of Hollywood Media on the one hand and R&S Investments on the other hand.   29                   Beginning in September 2009, R&S Investments will be contractually obligated to make periodic earn-out payments equal to the greater of (i) 10 percent of gross revenue and (ii) 90 percent of EBITDA (as defined in the purchase agreement) for the Hollywood.com Business until the full earn-out is paid. If a change of control of Hollywood.com occurs before the earn-out is fully paid, the remaining portion of the earn-out would be payable immediately upon such a change of control, up to the amount of consideration received by R&S Investments less related expenses. If the consideration in such a change of control is less than the remaining balance of the earn-out, then the subsequent buyer will be obligated to pay the difference in accordance with the same earn-out terms. In addition, if Hollywood.com is resold within three years, Hollywood Media will also receive 5 percent of any proceeds above $10.0 million. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Hollywood Media was required to place $2.6 million into an escrow account to fund any negative EBITDA of the Hollywood.com Business through August 21, 2010.             For additional information about this transaction, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K Report.   Sale of Showtimes Business Unit to West World Media LLC               On August 24, 2007, Hollywood Media and its wholly-owned subsidiary Showtimes, entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive asset purchase agreement with Brett West and West World Media, pursuant to which Hollywood Media sold substantially all of the assets of the Showtimes business to West World Media for a cash purchase price of $23.0 million paid to Hollywood Media on the closing date. The Showtimes business included the CinemaSource, EventSource and ExhibitorAds operations and constituted the remainder of Hollywood Medias Data Business Division, which previously included the Baseline/StudioSystems business unit until it was sold to The New York Times on August 25, 2006. West World Media is controlled by Brett West, who founded the Showtimes business in 1995 and sold the business to Hollywood Media in 1999. Mr. West served as president of Hollywood Medias Showtimes business. The purchase price was determined in an arms length negotiation between Hollywood Media and West World Media. The purchase price decreased due to a post-closing adjustment of $0.1 million paid by Hollywood Media to West World Media in January 2008. Hollywood Medias expenditures relating to the sale include approximately $0.6 million in estimated state and federal income taxes and approximately $1.7 million in fees and expenses payable to Hollywood Medias financial and legal advisors. For additional information about this transaction, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K Report.   Acquisition of Showtix Business               On February 1, 2007, TDI paid approximately $2.7 million in cash to consummate its acquisition of the Broadway ticketing business of Showtix. See Note 5 Acquisitions and Other Capital Transactions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K report.   Sale of Baseline StudioSystems Business Unit to The New York Times Company               On August 25, 2006, Hollywood Media entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with The New York Times, pursuant to which The New York Times purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of Hollywood Medias wholly-owned subsidiary, Baseline Acquisitions Corp. (BAC), for a cash purchase price of $35.0 million. BAC was the subsidiary of Hollywood Media that owned Hollywood Medias Baseline business unit. Baseline constituted a portion of Hollywood Medias Data Business division. This sale to The New York Times did not include the other components of Hollywood Medias Data Business division (e.g., CinemaSource, EventSource and ExhibitorAds). $3.5 million of the purchase price was held in escrow for twelve months following the closing to cover potential indemnification claims by The New York Times under the terms of the Purchase Agreement. As of September 30, 2007, Hollywood Media received the full amount of the escrow net of $0.7 million for payment of previously expensed bonuses due the former division heads under preexisting agreements. The net amount of $2.8 million of escrow, and accumulated interest, was received during the three months ended September 30, 2007. For additional information about this transaction, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to   30           the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K Report.   Senior Unsecured Notes Issued in 2005               On November 23, 2005, Hollywood Media issued and sold $7.0 million aggregate principal amount of its Senior Unsecured Notes (the Senior Notes) for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $7.0 million. In May 2007, Hollywood Media paid off the Senior Notes in full, including the $7.0 million in principal plus accrued interest, in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes, and there is no outstanding balance remaining on the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes carried an 8% interest rate and an initial 12 month term, on which interest was payable in quarterly installments commencing December 31, 2005. Hollywood Medias net cash proceeds from the issuance, net of issuance costs, were $6.6 million. The holders of the Senior Notes also received warrants to purchase 700,000 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock at an exercise price of $4.29 per share. In March 2006, Hollywood Media exercised its option under the terms of the Senior Notes, to extend the maturity date of the Senior Notes to May 23, 2007 in exchange for the delivery of additional five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock with exercise price per share at $4.29. The Senior Notes were not convertible at the option of the holders.   Capital Expenditures               Our capital expenditures during 2008 (excluding discontinued operations) were $1.3 million. We currently anticipate capital expenditures in 2009 of approximately $1.0 million, including various systems and equipment upgrades. These anticipated 2009 capital expenditures do not include any estimates for potential business acquisitions.   Outlook               Our cash and cash equivalents generated from the sales of our Baseline/StudioSystems and Showtimes businesses in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, respectively, have provided substantial additional working capital for Hollywood Media, and we have utilized portions of such working capital for various corporate purposes and business activities including, among other things, the repayment of debt and the purchase of the Showtix business referenced above, improvements and investments in various aspects of our Broadway Ticketing division, and for the repurchase of shares of Hollywood Medias common stock pursuant to our previously announced stock repurchase program (discussed below). Our businesses have required substantial financing, and may require additional capital to fund our growth plans and for working capital, which capital requirements we contemplate will be satisfied from our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand. Based on our current plans and assumptions for operations and investment and financing activities, we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and investment requirements at least through December 31, 2009. If our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek further financing or curtail our growth and/or operations. We believe that our long-term financial success ultimately depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to more than offset operating expenses.             While we continue to develop our businesses, we have resumed our strategic review process which may help us realize the full value of our assets in the interest of our shareholders. In prior years, our strategic review process resulted in the sales of our Baseline/StudioSystems and Showtimes businesses in fiscal 2006 and 2007, respectively. We continue to explore opportunities for generating returns for Hollywood Medias shareholders, including potential dispositions or other strategic transactions. Prior to resuming our strategic review process, we had, as stated in our press release dated October 1, 2007, temporarily suspended such process when our Board of Directors approved the stock repurchase program referenced below. We cannot make assurances as to the timing or occurrence of any future strategic transactions or further stock repurchases.    31           Authorization of Stock Repurchase Program              Hollywood Media previously reported in its current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 4, 2007, that its Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which Hollywood Media may use up to $10 million of its cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock. See Part II, Item 5, of this Form 10-K report for information about stock repurchases by Hollywood Media during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.             Pursuant to the repurchase program, Hollywood Media is authorized to purchase shares of its common stock from time to time on the open market or in negotiated transactions. The purchases are to be funded from available cash and cash equivalents, and the timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by Hollywood Medias management based on its evaluation of financial and market conditions, legal requirements and other factors. The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time, and there is no guarantee as to the number of shares or the amount of cash to be utilized for repurchases. Repurchased shares will become authorized but unissued shares of Hollywood Medias common stock.   Contractual Obligations              The following table sets forth information regarding certain types of our contractual obligations specified below as of December 31, 2008, in accordance with SEC rules requiring this disclosure.                                                                                                                             Payments Due by Period           Contractual                             Less than              Years              Years              After           Obligations         Total              1 Year              1-3              4-5              5 Years           (in millions)                                                                                                             Capital lease obligations (1)         $    0.4              $    0.2              $    0.2              $                  $               Operating lease obligations (2)              8.1                   1.1                   3.3                   1.7                   2.0                                                                                                    Total contractual obligations         $    8.5              $    1.3              $    3.5              $    1.7              $    2.0                                                                                                                      (1)         Capital lease obligations are future lease payments under capital leases inclusive of interest.           (2)         Operating lease obligations include leases pertaining to various leased offices and facilities and those classified as operating leases for financial statement purposes. Certain leases provide for payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance, insurance, and certain other expenses. Lease terms expire at various dates through the year 2017. Also, certain equipment used in Hollywood Medias operations is leased under operating leases.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements              As of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 of SEC Regulation S-K. As such, management believes that we currently do not have any disclosures to make of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 regarding off-balance sheet arrangements.   Critical Accounting Estimates              In response to the SECs Release Number 33-8040 Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies and SEC Release Number 33-8056, Commission Statement about Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of   32        our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to asset impairment, accruals for compensation and related benefits, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, and contingencies and litigation. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For additional information about our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.          Allowance for Doubtful Accounts              Hollywood Media maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Companys accounting for doubtful accounts contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectibility of these accounts. When preparing these estimates, management considers a number of factors, including the aging of a customers account, past transactions with customers, creditworthiness of specific customers, historical trends and other information. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $0.6 million and $1.1 million at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The allowance is primarily attributable to receivables due from customers of CinemasOnline. Although the Company believes its allowance is sufficient, if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to unexpectedly deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion across many different geographic regions.         Impairment of Goodwill              In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001 are no longer subject to amortization. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to June 30, 2001 ceased to be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, SFAS 142 changed the way we evaluated goodwill and intangibles for impairment. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized; however, they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test. The fair value based test is a two-step test. The first step involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we are required to proceed to the second step. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets (including unrecognized intangibles) and liabilities of the reporting unit, with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value.             As prescribed by SFAS No. 142, we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of fiscal 2002 which did not result in an impairment charge. Additionally, Hollywood Media established October 1, as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. As part of our fiscal 2008 annual impairment evaluation, the Company determined that the goodwill associated with its CinemasOnline business should be written off, and, accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $2.8 million. In addition, the Company recorded $0.7 million in additional impairment to goodwill recorded after our 2001 acquisition of Always Independent Entertainment Corp. and our Intellectual Properties segment. In December 2007 and 2006, there were no adjustments to long-lived assets. As of December 31, 2008, we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of Hollywood Medias goodwill for impairment further. The goodwill recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 was $25.2 million and $29.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007 goodwill represented 38% and 31%, respectively, of total assets. Future changes in estimates used to conduct the   33        impairment review, including revenue projections or market values could cause the analysis to indicate that Hollywood Medias goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write-off of a portion or all of the goodwill. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation, we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit.              As of December 31, 2008, the Companys market capitalization is less than the book value of its equity. The Company believes that the disparity between the book value of its assets as compared to the market capitalization of its business is in large part a consequence of current market conditions, including perceived risks in the debt markets, the Companys industry and the broader economy. While the Company believes that some of these risks are unique to specific companies, some represent global industry risks. The Company believes that there is no fundamental change in our underlying business model or prospects for our Company. We consider the decline in our market capitalization to be temporary and based on general economic conditions and a decline in general investor confidence throughout the market and not based on any events or conditions specific to us. The Company has evaluated the impairment of its goodwill, giving consideration to these risks, and their impact upon the respective reporting units fair values, and has reported impairments where it deems appropriate. The Company believes that the fair value of its remaining reporting units that contain goodwill at December 31, 2008 exceeds the book value of those units.   Inflation and Seasonality              Although we cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation, we do not believe inflation has a material effect on revenue or results of operations. We consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our Tekno Books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi-annually. The Broadway Ticketing Business is also influenced by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the Tony Awards ©  and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holiday period. In addition, although not seasonal, our Intellectual Properties division and NetCo Partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams, earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements. The recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis.      Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK .               Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in our assets or liabilities that might occur due to changes in market rates and prices, such as interest or foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other relevant market rate or price changes.             Interest rates charged on Hollywood Medias debt instruments are primarily fixed in nature. We therefore do not believe that the risk of loss relating to the effect of changes in market interest rates is material.             We have investments in subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and sell our services into this foreign market. Our foreign net asset/exposures (defined as assets denominated in foreign currency less liabilities denominated in foreign currency) for the United Kingdom at December 31, 2008 of U.S. dollar equivalents was a net liability of $1.8 million.             Our United Kingdom subsidiaries sell services and pay for products and services in British pounds. A decrease in the British foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely impact our margins. An assumed 10% depreciation of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of fiscal 2008 (i.e., in addition to actual exchange experience) would have resulted in a translation reduction of our revenue by $0.5 million for fiscal 2008.   34              As the assets, liabilities and transactions of our United Kingdom subsidiaries are denominated in British pounds, the results and financial condition are subject to translation adjustments upon their conversion into U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes. A 10% decline in this foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of 2008 (i.e., in addition to actual exchange experience) would have resulted in a translation increase in our net loss of $0.1 million for fiscal 2008.
