ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.          ----------------------------------------------------------------  OVERVIEW           Hollywood Media is a provider of entertainment-related information, content and ticketing services to consumers and businesses. We manage a number of integrated business units focused on Hollywood, Broadway and the entertainment industry. Hollywood Media has a diverse revenue stream from this array of business units, including revenue from retail and wholesale Broadway ticket sales, business to business content syndication, subscription fees, content licensing fees, advertising and book development. Due to a common focus on entertainment each of these business units supports the others, i.e. sharing content.           We were incorporated in 1993 and our business initially consisted of the development, licensing and publishing of intellectual properties, and the operation of entertainment-related retail stores. During 1997 we ceased the publishing part of our intellectual property business (we continue to develop and license intellectual property) and during 1998 and 1999 we phased out all of our retail stores in order to concentrate our resources on the development of a movie vertical focused on providing movie data to businesses and operating consumer sites. We expanded our organization further in 2000 by adding a ticketing vertical providing Broadway ticketing services to businesses and consumers. A vertical is multiple units which have complimentary operations in the same general type of business. We also continue to own an intellectual property business including Tekno Books (in which we own 51% and consolidate into our results of operations) and NetCo Partners (in which we own 50% and account for under the equity method of accounting).           Since 1998, we have significantly expanded our business through acquisitions of other entertainment-related businesses and the development of strategic relationships with major media companies.           o        On May 18, 1999, we purchased substantially all of the assets                   of CinemaSource, Inc., a business to business company that                   licenses movie showtimes and other movie-related information.           o        On May 20, 1999, we acquired hollywood.com, Inc., which owns                   and operates Hollywood.com, a leading movie web site.           o        On August 31, 1999, we purchased substantially all of the                   motion picture-related data assets of Paul Kagan Associates,                   Inc., including Baseline, a pay-per-use movie database web                   site, and several movie-related professional publications.           o        Effective January 3, 2000, we completed an agreement with CBS                   providing for the issuance to CBS of 6,672,031 shares of our                   common stock in exchange for $100 million of CBS advertising,                   promotion and content over seven years across its full range                   of media properties and $5.3 million in cash. On March                   28, 2000 CBS exercised a warrant to acquire 1,178,892 by                   delivering $5.5 million in cash plus $5.5 million in                   additional CBS advertising.                                         27            o        On May 1, 2000, we launched Broadway.com and we acquired                   substantially all the assets of BroadwayTheater.com, Inc.                   which sells theater tickets online predominately for Broadway,                   off-Broadway and London's West End. We simultaneously                   consolidated BroadwayTheater.com into Broadway.com.           o        On September 15, 2000, we acquired TDI, a ticketing wholesaler                   of Broadway, off-Broadway and London theater tickets to                   businesses, including travel agencies and tour operators,                   individuals, and educational institutions.           o        On July 27, 2001, we acquired the assets of Always Independent                   Entertainment Corp. ("AlwaysI"), which offers independent                   films to subscribers over the Internet and licenses films to                   third parties.           o        On October 19, 2001, we acquired 1-800-BROADWAY which we                   market in tandem with Broadway.com.           These changes to our business have affected our results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we generated revenues from our intellectual properties business and our entertainment retail operations. Following the closure of our retail stores by the end of 1999 and expansion of our business through acquisitions, we currently rely on our business to business syndication operations, Broadway and movie ticketing operations and advertising sales along with our existing intellectual properties business to generate revenues for the foreseeable future.           The growth of our syndication, ticketing and Internet ad sales operations has required substantial financing and we expect to continue to require additional financing to fund our growth plan and for working capital. Our operating plans and assumptions indicate that anticipated cash flows when combined with other potential sources of capital, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the year 2002. In the event that we require additional funding and cannot secure additional funding, Hollywood Media's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Hollywood Media's Vice Chairman and President, have indicated their intention to provide Hollywood Media, if required, with an amount not to exceed $5 million. The commitment will be reduced dollar for dollar as other financing is obtained, provided that such additional financing is not used to finance acquisitions. The commitment terminates on January 1, 2003. If plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek further financing or curtail our operations. Our long-term financial success depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to offset operating expenses. To the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations.           The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hollywood Media's Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.                                         28   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           Year ended December 31, 2001 ("fiscal 2001") as compared to the Year ended December 31, 2000 ("fiscal 2000") and year ended December 31, 1999 ("fiscal 1999").           The following table summarizes Hollywood Media's net revenues, cost of revenues, and gross margin by reportable segment for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively:                                                    INTERNET AD                                   BUSINESS TO    SALES AND   INTELLECTUAL      E-                     TICKETING      BUSINESS        OTHER    PROPERTIES (A)  COMMERCE        RETAIL          TOTAL                    -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------    ------------  FISCAL 2001 - -----------                 Net Revenues       $36,038,031   $ 5,843,764   $ 6,434,237   $ 1,823,270   $    15,499    $      --      $50,154,801 Cost of Revenues    30,686,557       288,976       303,884     1,006,781        25,895          8,556     32,320,649                    -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------    -----------    ----------- Gross Margin       $ 5,351,474   $ 5,554,788   $ 6,130,353   $   816,489   $   (10,396)   $    (8,556)   $17,834,152                    ===========   ===========   ===========   ===========   ===========    ===========    ===========   FISCAL 2000 - -----------  Net Revenues       $12,278,008   $ 5,442,309   $ 8,777,397   $ 1,998,091   $   987,181    $    34,519    $29,517,505 Cost of Revenues    10,936,025       270,806       791,770     1,125,815     1,146,007        265,691     14,536,114                    -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------    -----------    ----------- Gross Margin       $ 1,341,983   $ 5,171,503   $ 7,985,627   $   872,276   $  (158,826)   $  (231,172)   $14,981,391                    ===========   ===========   ===========   ===========   ===========    ===========    ===========   FISCAL 1999 - -----------  Net Revenues       $      --     $ 1,765,732   $ 3,950,931   $ 1,888,868   $   924,098    $ 1,576,482    $10,106,111 Cost of Revenues          --         122,496       435,940       826,355       677,509      1,510,532      3,572,832                    -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------   -----------    -----------    ----------- Gross Margin       $      --     $ 1,643,236   $ 3,514,991   $ 1,062,513   $   246,589    $    65,950    $ 6,533,279                    ===========   ===========   ===========   ===========   ===========    ===========    ===========    (A)      This does not include Hollywood Media's 50% interest in NetCo Partners          which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and is          reported as equity in earnings of investments.  COMPOSITION OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS:  o        TICKETING - Includes our TDI ticketing business as well as our          Broadway.com online ticketing operations and 1-800-BROADWAY. TDI and          BroadwayTheater.com were acquired on September 15, 2000 and May 1,          2000, respectively, therefore the numbers presented include ticketing          revenue and expense from the date of acquisition.  o        BUSINESS TO BUSINESS - Includes our CinemaSource, EventSource, and          Baseline syndication operations.  o        INTERNET AD SALES AND OTHER - Includes advertising sold on the web          sites Hollywood.com and Broadway.com, the AlwaysI subscription service          which offers films to subscribers over the Internet and barter revenues          derived from the collection and compilation of movie showtimes data and          the hosting of web sites for movie theaters in exchange for advertising          services from the theaters.                                         29   o        INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES - Includes our book development and book          licensing operation through our 51% owned subsidiary Tekno Books and          our 50.5% interest in Fedora, publisher of Mystery Scene Magazine. This          segment does not include our 50% interest in NetCo Partners.  o        E-COMMERCE - Hollywood Media exited the e-commerce business in January          2001.  o        RETAIL - This segment included Hollywood Media's brick and mortar          retail operations which were closed on December 31, 1999.  NET REVENUES           Total net revenues for fiscal 2001 were $50,154,801 compared to $29,517,505 and $10,106,111 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. Revenues increased $20,637,296 or 70% in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 and increased $19,411,394 or 192% in fiscal 2000 from fiscal 1999. The increase of revenues in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 is primarily the result of an increase in ticketing revenue of $23,760,023 offset by decreases in revenues from the Internet ad sales and other segment of $2,343,160 and e-commerce segment of $971,682. Our ticketing businesses, TDI and BroadwayTheater.com (now which is integrated into Broadway.com) were acquired on September 15, 2000 and May 1, 2000, respectively; therefore fiscal 2000 includes revenues from the date of acquisition and does not represent a full 12 months of revenues. The increase in revenues in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 is the result of having a full fiscal year of revenues from the business to business and Internet ad sales and other segments in fiscal 2000, the addition of revenues from ticketing businesses that were acquired during 2000, and growth in the ticketing business during 2001. We acquired our business to business and Internet ad sales businesses during 1999. We recorded $3,166,945, $3,937,931 and $2,613,390 in barter revenue in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Barter revenue as a percentage of total net revenue was 6%, 13% and 26% in fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. In fiscal 2001, net revenues were derived 71.9% from ticketing, 11.7% from business to business, 12.8% from Internet advertising sales and other and 3.6% from intellectual properties.           Ticketing revenue for fiscal 2001 was $36,038,031 as compared to $12,278,008 for fiscal 2000, an increase of $23,760,023 or 194%. Hollywood Media acquired TDI and BroadwayTheater.com on September 15, 2000 and May 1, 2000, respectively, therefore fiscal 2000 includes net revenues from the dates of acquisition. Ticketing revenue is generated from the sales of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and London's West End and Toronto both online (Broadway.com) and offline, to domestic and international travel professionals, traveling consumers and New York area theater patrons. Ticket revenue is recognized on the date of performance of the show. During 2001 our ticketing division was generating revenues over that of the prior year. Our revenue growth was impacted by the events of September 11, the effects of which were felt in September and October, primarily in our sales of Broadway tickets to groups. By concentrating our CBS advertising towards Broadway.com during the fourth quarter 2001, revenues increased in the latter part of November and December 2001.           Business to business net revenue (which includes CinemaSource, EventSource and Baseline) was $5,843,764 for fiscal 2001 compared to $5,442,309 for fiscal 2000, and $1,765,732 for fiscal 1999. Net business to business revenue increased $401,455 or 7% for fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to the growth in our EventSource division which launched on April 1, 2000 when we entered into a contract with AOL's Digital                                         30   City to provide event listings for up to 200 markets nationwide. Revenue for CinemaSource and EventSource is generated by the licensing of movie, event and theater showtimes and other information to other media outlets and Internet companies including newspapers such as The New York Times and The Washington Post, Internet companies including AOL's Digital City, Lycos, Yahoo!, and Ticketmaster/City Search, and wireless providers such as AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS and Verizon. Baseline operates a pay-per-use subscription web site geared towards professionals in the entertainment industry and generates revenues from the syndication of its data as well as subscription revenue. Hollywood Media acquired the business to business operations of CinemaSource and Baseline on May 18, 1999 and August 31, 1999, respectively. The net revenue increase in this segment of $3,676,577 or 208% for fiscal 2000 from fiscal 1999 is partially due to a full fiscal year of revenues in 2000.           Internet ad sales and other revenue was $6,434,237 for fiscal 2001 as compared to $8,777,397 for fiscal 2000 and $3,950,931 for fiscal 1999. The decrease in net Internet ad sales and other revenue in fiscal 2001 of $2,343,160 from fiscal 2000 is primarily attributable to a decrease of $770,986 of non-cash barter revenue recorded in 2000 and a $1,617,491 decrease in advertising sales recorded, offset by an increase of $45,317 in other internet revenues. Hollywood Media has entered into less barter transactions in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 in order to maximize its cash advertising revenue. The decrease of $1,617,491 of advertising sales for fiscal 2001 is the result of the softening of the online advertising market as a whole which has caused our normal levels of CPM (cost per thousand) charged to be reduced in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. Online and traditional advertising was soft in 2001 and we were not excluded from the effects. We saw an improvement in ad sales revenues in the latter part of fourth quarter 2001 which was due in part to an increasing trend in our Internet traffic to our web sites. Our Internet traffic levels have increased during 2001, growing from approximately 1.1 million unique monthly visitors at the end of 2000, to over 2.1 million unique monthly visitors at the end of 2001, continuing into 2002 as measured by Media Metrix. Net Internet ad sales and other revenues increased in fiscal 2000 by $4,826,466 or 122% from fiscal 1999. The acquisition of Hollywood.com occurred on May 20, 1999; therefore fiscal 1999 did not include a full year of revenues. Internet ad sales revenue is generated from the sale of banner advertisements and sponsorships on Hollywood.com and Broadway.com. Included in Internet ad sales and other are non-cash barter revenues of $3,166,945, $3,937,931 and $2,393,390 for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As a percentage of Internet ad sales and other, barter revenues comprised 49%, 45% and 61% of Internet ad sales and other for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively. Hollywood Media records two types of barter revenue related to Internet advertising as more fully described below:           Barter transactions that generate non-cash advertising revenue (included in Internet ad sales and other revenues), in which Hollywood Media received advertising in exchange for content advertising on its web site was $185,195, $956,181 and $480,100 for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Barter advertising transactions accounted for .4%, 3% and 5% of Hollywood Media's total net revenue for fiscal 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively, and 3%, 11% and 12% of total Internet ad sales and other revenue for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As further described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, commencing on January 20, 2000 Hollywood Media adopted a new Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") consensus relating to barter revenue and records barter revenue only in instances where the fair value of the advertising surrendered could be determined based on our historical practice of receiving cash for similar advertising. Management maximizes cash advertising revenue, although Hollywood Media will continue to enter into barter relationships when deemed appropriate as a cashless method for Hollywood Media to market its business.                                         31            Hollywood Media also records barter revenue and an equal amount of expense earned under a contract with the National Association of Theater Owners ("NATO"), which Hollywood Media acquired through its acquisition of hollywood.com, Inc. on May 20, 1999. This income is included in Internet ad sales and other revenue. Through the NATO contract, Hollywood Media promotes its web site to movie audiences by airing movie trailers about Hollywood.com, 40 out of 52 weeks per year, before feature films that play in most NATO-member theaters. In exchange, Hollywood Media hosts web sites for member theaters and collects and compiles movie showtimes for the exhibiting NATO members, as well as providing promotional materials and movie information and editorial content. Hollywood Media recorded $2,981,750, $2,981,750 and $1,913,290 in promotional non-cash revenue and non-cash expense included in selling and marketing expense under the NATO contract for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Barter revenue from the NATO contract accounted for 6%, 10% and 19% of Hollywood Media's total net revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively and also accounted for 46%, 34% and 48% of total Internet ad sales and other revenue for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.           Intellectual properties revenues were $1,823,270 for fiscal 2001, compared to $1,998,091 for fiscal 2000 and $1,888,868 for fiscal 1999. Net revenues generated from intellectual properties decreased $174,821 or 9% in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 and increased $109,223 or 6% in fiscal 2000 from fiscal 1999. The increases and decreases in revenue are primarily a reflection of the timing of revenue recognition under the various book licensing and packaging agreements. The intellectual properties division generates revenues from several different activities including book development and licensing, and intellectual property licensing. Revenues vary quarter to quarter depending on the timing of delivery of manuscripts to the publishers. Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete and ultimate collection of such revenues is no longer subject to contingencies.           E-commerce net revenues were $15,499 for fiscal 2001 compared to $987,181 for fiscal 2000 and $924,098 for fiscal 1999. The decrease in e-commerce revenues of $971,682 or 98% in fiscal 2001 from fiscal 2000 is attributable to the closure of our e-commerce operations in January 2001.           Net revenues generated from our retail operations were $34,519 and $1,576,482 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. Barter revenue included in net retail revenues were $220,000 for fiscal 1999. We began the process of closing our brick and mortar retail locations in 1998 and completed the closure of all retail operations in December 31, 1999, thus accounting for the decrease in revenues from 1999 to 2000 of $1,541,963.  COST OF REVENUE           Cost of revenue was $32,320,649 for fiscal 2001 compared to $14,536,114 for fiscal 2000 and $3,572,832 for fiscal 1999. As a percentage of net revenues, cost of revenues was 64%, 49%, and 35% for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in cost of revenues in fiscal 2001 of $17,784,535 from fiscal 2000 is primarily from the addition of ticketing cost to our cost of revenues following the acquisition of TDI on September 15, 2000 and BroadwayTheater.com on May 1, 2000, therefore ticket cost is included in reported numbers from the dates of acquisition. The ticketing segment accounts for 95% and 75% of the cost of revenues for fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. Cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of tickets and credit card fees for the ticketing segment; commissions due to advertising agencies, advertising rep firms and other third parties for revenue generated from the business to business and Internet ad sales and other segments, fees and royalties paid to authors and co-editors for the intellectual properties segment and cost of merchandise including shipping costs for the e-commerce and retail segments.                                         32   GROSS MARGIN           Gross margin for fiscal 2001 was $17,834,152 compared to $14,981,391 for fiscal 2000 and $6,533,279 for fiscal 1999. As a percentage of sales the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2001 was 36 % as compared to 51% in fiscal 2000 and 65% in fiscal 1999. The decreases in gross margin percentages is attributable to our ticketing businesses that were acquired during fiscal 2000. Our ticketing operation generates gross margin percentages of approximately 15% while our business to business and Internet ad sales operations (including barter) typically generate gross margin percentages greater than 90%. Ticketing revenue accounts for 72% of our net revenue for fiscal 2001; therefore the addition of ticketing revenue into our mix of revenue streams has reduced the overall gross margin percentage.  EQUITY IN EARNINGS OF INVESTMENTS           Equity in earnings of investments consists of the following:                                                                         December 31,                                               -----------------------------------------------------------                                                     2001                 2000                 1999                                               ------------------    ----------------    -----------------                 NetCo Partners (a)                    $  2,162,630          $ 2,300,418         $   1,188,142         MovieTickets.com (b)                      (453,358)            (394,286)                 --         Beach Wrestling LLC (c)                   (238,880)                --                    --                                               ------------------    ----------------    -----------------                                               $  1,470,392          $ 1,906,132         $   1,188,142                                               ==================    ================    =================             (a) NetCo Partners           NetCo Partners owns Tom Clancy's NetForce and is primarily engaged in the development and licensing of Tom Clancy's Net Force. NetCo Partners recognizes revenues when the earnings process has been completed based on the terms of the various agreements, generally upon the delivery of the manuscript to the publisher and at the point where ultimate collection is substantially assured. When advances are received prior to completion of the earnings process, NetCo Partners defers recognition of revenue until the earnings process has been completed. Hollywood Media owns 50% of NetCo Partners and accounts for its investment under the equity method. Hollywood Media's 50% share of earnings of NetCo Partners was $2,162,630 for fiscal 2001, a decrease of 6% or $137,788 as compared to $2,300,418 for fiscal 2000. Our 50% share of earnings were $1,188,142 for fiscal 1999. Revenues decreased for 2001 compared to 2000 because there were less manuscripts delivered to the publisher in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000. Costs related to the acquisition, development and sales of the intellectual properties and their licensed products are expensed in proportion to the revenues that have been recognized.           In April 1997, NetCo Partners entered into an agreement with The Berkley Publishing Group ("Berkley"), a division of Penguin Putnam Inc., which is part of the international media group Pearson plc, to publish a series of six original NetForce novels. The contract, with total maximum advances of $22 million, called for initial publication of the first book to coincide with the airing of the ABC mini-series (February 1999). All six books have been published beginning with the first publication in 1999 and ending in 2001 with the publication of the sixth novel. NetCo Partners receives advances under this contract based on specific milestones throughout the publication process for each of the six books. NetCo's obligations to the publisher are satisfied upon                                         33   delivery and acceptance of the completed manuscript. NetCo retains no performance obligations after acceptance and is entitled to all advances specified in the contract. This contract calls for royalties on paperback sales to be earned by NetCo Partners at 15% of the publisher's suggested retail price. Royalties are applied first to advances received by NetCo and then NetCo receives 15% of additional sales.           In December 2001, NetCo Partners entered into another agreement with Berkley to publish four more novels based on NetForce, which provide for advances to NetCo Partners of $2 million per book for the first two books against a percentage of the cover price. The advance amount for the second two books is to be negotiated at a later date.           In April 1997, NetCo Partners also entered into an additional agreement with Berkley to publish up to 18 young adult novels based on NetForce. The contract calls for total maximum advances of $900,000 in addition to royalties earned.           The Berkley contracts grant to Berkley only the North American publishing rights to publish NetForce books. NetCo Partners has also licensed the publication rights to NetForce in various countries throughout the world including the U.K. and in various foreign languages, as well as audio books.           (b) MovieTickets.com, Inc.           Hollywood Media entered into a joint venture agreement on February 29, 2000 with the movie theater chains AMC Entertainment Inc. ("AMC") and National Amusements, Inc. to form MovieTickets.com, Inc. ("MovieTickets.com"). Effective August 2000, the joint venture entered into an agreement with Viacom Inc. to acquire a five percent interest in the joint venture for $25 million of advertising over five years. In addition to the Viacom advertising and promotion, MovieTickets.com is promoted through on-screen advertising in each participating exhibitor's movie screens. In March 2001, America Online Inc. ("AOL") purchased a 3% convertible preferred equity interest in MovieTickets.com for $8.5 million in cash. In connection with this transaction, MovieTickets.com's ticket inventory is promoted throughout AOL's interactive properties and ticket inventory of AOL's Moviefone is featured on MovieTickets.com.           Hollywood Media owns 26.4% of the equity in MovieTickets.com, Inc. joint venture at December 31, 2001. Excluding AOL's 3% convertible preferred equity interest, Hollywood Media shares in 27.1% of the losses or income generated by the joint venture. Hollywood Media records its investment under the equity method of accounting, recognizing its percentage of ownership of MovieTickets.com income or loss as equity in earnings of investments. Hollywood Media recorded a loss of $453,358 and $394,286 in its investment in MovieTickets.com for fiscal 2001 and 2000, respectively. During fiscal 2000, Hollywood Media contributed $500,000 in cash to MovieTickets.com and issued warrants to AMC to acquire 90,573 shares of Hollywood Media common stock at an exercise price of $17.875 per share valued at $1,000,000. The fair market value of the warrant was recorded as additional investment and is being amortized over a period of ten years. During 2001, we loaned MovieTickets.com $100,000. All loans made to MovieTickets.com were repaid in cash with interest in March 2001.                                         34            MovieTickets.com is a leading destination for the purchase of movie tickets through the Internet. Hollywood Media launched the MovieTickets.com web site in May 2000 with several major theater exhibitors. The MovieTickets.com web site allows users to purchase movie tickets and retrieve them at "will call" windows or kiosks at theaters. The web site also features bar coded tickets that can be printed at home and presented directly to the ticket taker at the participating theaters. The web site contains movie content from Hollywood.com for all current and future release movies, movie reviews and synopses, digitized movie trailers and photos, and box office results. The web site generates revenues from service fees charged to users for the purchase of tickets and the sale of advertising which includes ads on the "print-at-home" ticket. Service fees on ticket sales were introduced in November 2000. MovieTickets.com's current participating exhibitors include AMC Entertainment Inc., National Amusements, Inc., Famous Players, Inc., Hoyts Cinemas, Marcus Theaters, and other regional exhibitors. These exhibitors operate theaters located in all of the top twenty markets and approximately 70% of the top 50 markets in the United States and Canada and represent approximately 50% of the top 100 grossing theaters in North America. AMC Entertainment Inc. is the largest movie theater operator in the United States based on box office sales and Famous Players, Inc. generates approximately half of all box office sales in Canada.           (c) Beach Wrestling LLC           On November 10, 2000, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hollywood Media entered into an agreement with Cisneros Television Group ("CTG") and Siegel Partners to form Beach Wrestling LLC, each having one-third ownership interest. Beach Wrestling LLC was formed to develop, market and distribute wrestling events via television and the Internet under the "Beach Wrestling" brand. This investment was recorded under the equity method of accounting. An indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Hollywood Media had loaned a total of $238,880 to Beach Wrestling LLC. This loan was written-off in December 2001. No further obligations remain by Hollywood Media Corp. to this joint venture.  OPERATING EXPENSES           GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE. General and administrative expenses consist of occupancy costs, production costs, human resources and administrative functions as well as professional and consulting service fees, telecommunications costs, provision for doubtful accounts receivable and general insurance costs. General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2001 were $7,241,687 as compared to $10,948,417 and $8,227,022 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. General and administrative expenses decreased $3,706,730 or 34% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 primarily due to cost savings and consolidation measures implemented company-wide, including the closure of our California office in January 2001, the closure of our e-commerce division in January 2001, the closure of our international sales division in October 2001, and savings in the areas of recruitment, consulting and freelance fees. The reductions in general and administrative expenses were offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses of $679,651 in our ticketing businesses as a result of the acquisitions made in fiscal 2000, which did not include a full twelve months of expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $2,721,395 or 33% in fiscal 2000 as compared to fiscal 1999 primarily because of the acquisitions that were completed in fiscal 2000 and 1999 for which a full fiscal year of expenses had not been recorded. As a percentage of net revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 14% for fiscal 2001 from 37% for fiscal 2000 and from 81% for fiscal 1999.           SELLING AND MARKETING. Selling and marketing expenses includes advertising, marketing, promotional, business development and public relations expenses and costs to produce movie trailers. Also included is the non-cash expense related to barter advertising. Selling and marketing expense for fiscal 2001 was $4,348,183 as compared to $9,593,871 and $5,074,568 for fiscal years 2000 and 1999, respectively. Non-cash barter expense included in selling and                                         35   marketing was $3,166,945, $3,937,931 and $2,613,390 for fiscal years 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Selling and marketing decreased $5,245,688 or 55% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 primarily due to reductions of on-line advertising and media production of $4,474,702 and reductions in non-cash barter advertising of $770,986. The increase of $4,519,303 from 1999 to 2000 is attributable to an increase of $1,324,541 of non-cash barter advertising expense and increased advertising on radio, television, outdoor and online for Hollywood Media's Internet ad sales divisions and additional advertising related to the launch of Broadway.com on May 1, 2000. In addition, in 2000, Hollywood Media incurred up-front production costs associated with advertising on CBS's media properties. Non-cash barter transactions accounted for approximately 73%, 41% and 51% of selling and marketing expense for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. As a percentage of net revenue, selling and marketing expenses decreased to 9% for fiscal 2001 from 33% for fiscal 2000 and 50% from fiscal 1999.           SALARIES AND BENEFITS. Salaries and benefits for fiscal 2001 were $12,534,524 as compared to $11,810,803 and $5,916,024 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. Salaries and benefits increased $723,721 or 6% in fiscal 2001 as compared to fiscal 2000 primarily due to fiscal 2001 containing a full 12 months of salaries and related benefits, or $1,824,743, associated with our ticketing businesses that were acquired in fiscal 2000. In addition salaries and benefits increased because of an increase in personnel at the corporate offices to support the growth and business unit consolidation of Hollywood Media during 2001. These increases were offset by a reduction in annual salaries of approximately $1.5 million from the consolidation of our technology and production departments from our California location into our South Florida location, the closure of our e-commerce division, and the closure of our international ad sales division. Salaries and benefits increased $5,894,779 in fiscal 2000 from fiscal 1999 primarily because of the five acquisitions that were completed in fiscal 2000 and 1999 for which a full fiscal year of expenses had not been recorded. Salaries and benefits were recorded from the date of acquisition. As a percentage of net revenue, salaries and benefits decreased to 25% for fiscal 2001 from 40% for fiscal 2000 and from 59% for fiscal 1999.           AMORTIZATION OF CBS ADVERTISING. Amortization of CBS advertising relating to the agreement with Viacom was $27,822,802 for fiscal 2001 compared to $24,244,647 and $2,344,950 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. Under the agreement with Viacom, Hollywood Media issued shares of common stock and warrants in exchange for cash and CBS's advertising and promotional efforts over seven years across its full range of media properties. The fair value of the common stock and warrants issued to Viacom have been recorded in the balance sheet as deferred advertising and is being amortized as the advertising is used each related contract year. The advertising contract year begins on October 1 and ends September 30.           DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION. Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of property and equipment, furniture and fixtures, web development, leasehold improvements, capital leases and amortization of goodwill and intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense was $8,886,350 for fiscal 2001 as compared to $11,098,537 and $5,331,067 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. For fiscal 2001 depreciation and amortization decreased $2,212,187 or 20% primarily due to the completion of amortization of an asset in fiscal 2000 of $3,233,762 offset by an increase in amortization of goodwill associated with our ticketing businesses acquired in 2002 and depreciation of fixed assets.                                         36            PROVISION FOR CLOSED STORES AND LEASE TERMINATION COSTS. Provision for closed stores and lease termination costs are $(247,657) for fiscal 2001 as compared to $233,763 and $4,551,094 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. In 1998, management approved a plan to close 29 unprofitable or marginally profitable retail locations. In 1999, management decided to exit the brick and mortar retail business altogether, and in December 1999 closed its six remaining in-line studio stores and all the remaining kiosks. As a result, we recorded an additional provision for closed stores of $4,551,094 comprised of the following: a $2,118,228 non-cash asset impairment charge to write-off the remaining assets of our brick and mortar retail business (such assets consisted primarily of the remaining carrying value of kiosks, leasehold improvements, computer systems and other furniture and equipment); $782,866 comprised of management's best estimate of future contractual lease payments for exited leases less, to the extent deemed probable, any reductions from early termination settlements reached with the lessors plus the estimated cost of negotiating such settlements; and $1,650,000 for a settlement reached with a franchisee.           In 2000, we recorded additional charges of $233,763 associated with exiting our brick and mortar retail business. These charges included approximately $53,034 in an upward revision to the estimated cost of lease obligations, $50,000 in additional estimated costs for settling the remaining lease obligations, and $130,729 of additional asset write-offs related to our retail business.           In 2001, we revised our estimate on lease exit cost as the result of favorable settlements related to outstanding lease obligations. As a result, we reversed $247,657 of previously recorded lease exit costs.           Liabilities recorded for the estimated cost of early lease terminations were $42,144 and $798,362 at December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The reserve for closed stores and lease termination costs at December 31, 2001 of $42,144 consists of an estimate of our obligation under one lease for a kiosk location that was abandoned. This matter is the subject of an outstanding dispute. Management expects this matter to be resolved within 2002.           See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the costs of exiting our brick and mortar retail business.  INTEREST EXPENSE           Interest expense was $260,220 for fiscal 2001, as compared to $430,377 and $673,292 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. The decreases in interest expense are primarily attributable to decreases in our outstanding obligations under capital leases.  INTEREST INCOME           Interest income was $115,931 for fiscal 2001, as compared to $90,855 and $109,383 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively.  NET LOSS AND LOSS PER SHARE           Hollywood Media's net loss for fiscal 2001 was $41,829,905 as compared to a net loss of $51,847,500 and $24,657,024 for fiscal 2000 and 1999, respectively. The net loss decreased in fiscal 2001 by $10,017,595 primarily because of an increase in gross margin and reductions in general and administrative and selling and marketing expenses and depreciation and amortization offset by an increase in amortization of CBS advertising. The net loss increased to $51,847,500 in 2000 from $24,657,024 in 1999 primarily because of an increase in                                         37   amortization of CBS advertising of $21,899,697, amortization of goodwill and intangibles of $3,071,195 and operating losses incurred by the e-commerce division which was closed in January 2001 of $2,521,911. Non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and amortization of CBS advertising were $36,709,152, $35,343,184 and $7,676,017 for fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Net loss per share for fiscal 2001 was $1.61 as compared to a net loss per share of $2.23 for fiscal 2000, representing an improvement of $.62 per share. The net loss per share for 1999 was $2.01. The per share impact of non- cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, and amortization of CBS advertising on the fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 loss per share is $1.41, $1.52 and $.62, respectively.           We have taken several steps to substantially reduce our cash losses by consolidating resources, the closure of unprofitable divisions, and increased controls on expenses. The benefits can be seen in our results for 2001 and we expect to see these savings continue into 2002. In mid 2000, we began a two step approach to consolidate the Hollywood.com web site technology and production into our corporate office in South Florida which was completed in January 2001. We eliminated duplication of resources, which together with tightened control over expenses, resulted in a total annual savings of approximately $8.2 million. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Hollywood Media, as part of its operational evaluation process, determined that profitability in the e-commerce business could not be reached due to tight margins and high fulfillment costs. This business, which incurred losses of approximately $2.5 million in 2000, was closed in January 2001. A similar evaluation of our international web site, Hollywood.com International resulted in closure of this business in October 2001, resulting in savings of over $200,000 on an annualized basis. During 2001, we continued with our efforts to reduce costs by further consolidation of activities and services, such as co-locations of web servers, consolidating connectivity, T-1 lines and employee resources.           We continue to focus our resources on the expansion of our business to business, ticketing and Internet ad sales units. Ticketing has become the most significant revenue source for Hollywood Media, most notably through the acquisition of Theater Direct International in September 2000, the launch of Broadway.com in May 2000 and 1-800-BROADWAY in November 2001. Expansion of our business to business and Internet ad sales is equally as important since we have stabilized the costs to run these operations and we believe the high gross margins generated from these business units will improve overall cash flow.           While Hollywood Media believes that the acquisitions made during 2000 together with the cost control measures, consolidation of resources and closure of unprofitable businesses will lead Hollywood Media to a positive operating cash flow in the future, there can be no assurances that the revenues generated will be sufficient to offset the associated expenses incurred.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES           At December 31, 2001, Hollywood Media has cash and cash equivalents of $1,980,966 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $1,911,224 at December 31, 2000. Working capital at December 31, 2001, which included $13,054,321 in deferred CBS advertising was $10,307,769 as compared to working capital of $14,871,414 at December 31, 2000 which included $19,131,714 in deferred CBS advertising. Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal 2001 was $5,414,855 primarily representing cash used to fund Hollywood Media's pre-tax loss, net of non-cash expenses which includes depreciation, amortization, and CBS advertising. Net cash used in investing activities was $696,808, primarily representing capital expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $6,181,405 during 2001, primarily representing proceeds from                                         38   issuance of common stock. The combined effect of the above was a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of $69,742 during 2001. In fiscal 2000 net cash used in operating activities was $13,017,504, net cash used in investing activities was $3,652,461 and net cash provided by financing activities was $16,105,844.           Hollywood Media's Board of Directors approved a plan for the repurchase of $4.0 million of Hollywood Media's common stock. Pursuant to the plan, during the year ended December 31, 2001, Hollywood Media repurchased 109,500 shares of common stock for an aggregate consideration of $453,700 and an average purchase price of $4.14 per share. Cumulatively, Hollywood Media has repurchased 527,000 shares of common stock for an aggregate consideration of $3,887,441 at an average purchase price of $7.38 per share.           During 2001, Hollywood Media issued 56,210 shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants for which Hollywood Media received $175,216 in cash exercise proceeds.           During 2001 Hollywood Media entered into an agreement with a third party whereby we monetized a certain portion of our accounts receivable. We are initially advanced 80% of the invoice amount with the remaining 20%, less fees, transferred to us upon payment by the customer to the third party. At December 31, 2001, we recorded a liability of $341,856 for advances that had been paid to Hollywood Media but remain payable by our customers to the third party.           The success of Hollywood Media's operations in future years is dependent on its ability to generate adequate revenue and cash flow to offset operating expenses. Unless otherwise noted, the proceeds from the financing transactions in 2001 and 2000 were used to complete the acquisitions made in 2000 and for working capital. Hollywood Media's management expects to require additional financing for the expansion of its businesses, and to support working capital requirements in future years. Hollywood Media is currently exploring additional financing alternatives, including a bank line of credit, for Hollywood Media although there can be no assurance that such financing alternatives will be available to Hollywood Media or can be obtained in terms favorable to Hollywood Media.           In the event that Hollywood Media requires additional funding and cannot secure additional funding, Hollywood Media's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and Hollywood Media's Vice Chairman and President, have indicated their intention to provide Hollywood Media, if required, with an amount not to exceed $5 million in order to enable Hollywood Media to meet its working capital requirements during 2002; provided, however, that the commitment will be reduced dollar for dollar to the extent that Hollywood Media raises financing from other sources and such additional financing is not used to finance acquisitions. The existing commitment will terminate on January 1, 2003.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES           The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Hollywood Media and all majority-owned subsidiaries. The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. As such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and                                         39   the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. The significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:           Ticketing Revenue Recognition           Ticket revenue is derived from the sale of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and London shows to individuals, groups, travel agencies, tour groups and educational facilities. Revenue recognition is deferred on ticket sales until performance has taken place. Ticket revenue and cost of revenue are recorded on a gross basis.           Hollywood Media changed its method of revenue recognition effective January 1, 2001, from recognition of revenue from ticket sales when collection was assured and delivery to the customer had taken place to the date of performance for all ticket sales. The impact of this change on the financial statements for the period prior to January 1, 2000 was not material. The impact on reported results of operations for 2000 would have been a reduction of recognized net revenues of approximately $350,000 or 1.2% and an increase in reported net loss of $46,000 or .09%.           Advertising Costs           Hollywood Media expenses the cost of advertising as incurred or when such advertising initially takes place. As further described in Note 11, in the first quarter of 2000, Hollywood Media issued common stock and warrants to CBS with a fair value of approximately $137 million in exchange for approximately $105 million of advertising on CBS properties to be received over a period of seven years. Hollywood Media is entitled to utilize a specified portion of this advertising each contract year. The deferred advertising is carried on Hollywood Media's balance sheet as a deferred asset and is being amortized over the contract period as the advertising is utilized. Advertising expense recorded related to CBS advertising for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $27,822,802, $24,244,647 and $2,344,950, respectively, and is separately reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations under the caption "Amortization of CBS advertising." These CBS advertising expenses are non-cash.           Barter Transactions           Hollywood Media records barter revenue and expense under the NATO contract, which Hollywood Media acquired through its acquisition of hollywood.com, Inc. in 1999. In connection with the NATO contract, Hollywood Media also acquired rights and obligations under ancillary agreements with individual theaters that participate in the NATO organization. Pursuant to these agreements, Hollywood Media collects and compiles movie showtimes data for NATO member theaters and hosts web sites for each of the theaters so as to display the movie showtimes and other information about the theater. In addition, Hollywood Media provides ongoing web site maintenance services for each of the theaters including providing promotional materials, movie and theater information, advertising and editorial content. In exchange, the theaters promote the hollywood.com web site to movie audiences by airing movie trailers about Hollywood.com, 40 out of 52 weeks per year, before feature films that play in most NATO-member theaters. Hollywood Media records revenue and expense from these activities measured at the fair value of the services exchanged in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion ("APB") No. 29, "Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions." In 2001, 2000 and 1999 we recorded $2,981,750, $2,981,750 and $1,913,290, respectively, in revenue and expense under the NATO contract. Additionally in 2001, 2000 and 1999 we recorded $185,195, $956,181, and $480,100, respectively in other non-cash Internet barter transactions.                                         40            Stock Based Compensation           Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," allows either adoption of a fair value method of accounting for stock-based compensation plans or continuation of accounting under APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations with supplemental disclosures. Hollywood Media has chosen to account for all stock-based arrangements under which employees receive shares of Hollywood Media's stock under APB 25 and make the related disclosures required by SFAS No. 123. Pro forma loss per share, as if the fair value method has been adopted, is presented in Note 12. Stock options and warrants granted to non-employees are accounted for under the fair value method prescribed by SFAS No. 123 and related interpretations.           Impairment of Long-Lived Assets           Hollywood Media applies the provisions of SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of." Under the provisions of this statement, Hollywood Media has evaluated its long-lived assets for financial impairment, and will continue to evaluate them as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.           Hollywood Media evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted cash flows associated with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. Hollywood Media determines fair value as the net present value of future cash flows. Based on these evaluations, there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets in 2001, 2000 or 1999.           In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001 were no longer subject to amortization. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to June 30, 2001 will cease to be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, SFAS 142 will change the way we evaluate goodwill and intangibles for impairment. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill and certain intangibles will no longer be amortized; however, they will be subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test. The fair value based test is a two-step test. The first step involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we will be required to proceed to the second step. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit will be allocated to the assets (including unrecognized intangibles) and liabilities of the reporting unit, with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss will be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value.           The initial impairment test will be performed as of January 1, 2002. However, the transition provisions of SFAS 142 allow until June 30, 2002 to complete step one of the test and, if required, until December 31, 2002 to complete step 2. Effective January 1, 2002, we will cease to amortize approximately $40.7 million of goodwill. Our annual goodwill amortization is approximately $5.3 million. We believe the provisions of SFAS 142 did not materially impact the results of operations.  INFLATION AND SEASONALITY           Although Hollywood Media cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation, it does not believe inflation has a material effect on sales or results of operations. Hollywood Media considers its business to be somewhat seasonal and expects net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for its Tekno Books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi-annually. The ticketing business is also effected by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the Tony Awards(C) and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holidays. In addition, although not seasonal, Hollywood Media's intellectual properties division and NetCo Partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams, earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements. The recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis.
