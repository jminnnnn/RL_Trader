Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and          ---------------------------------------------------------------          Results of Operations.          ---------------------  Overview           We are an entertainment-focused media and Internet company that offers widely recognized brands and a broad collection of entertainment content data and related information in the industry, which we license to media and other companies including the New York Times, AOL Time Warner, Yahoo!, Sprint, AT&T Wireless, Verizon and others. The Company owns an extensive ticketing network and is engaged in the development and licensing of intellectual properties and licensing of books. The Company generates revenues through the business-to-business syndication of entertainment-related content, the sale of live theater tickets, the sale of advertising, and from advances paid by publishers and royalties received from our library of book titles.           We were incorporated in 1993 and our business initially consisted of publishing comic books, the development and licensing of intellectual properties, and the operation of entertainment-related retail stores. During 1997 we stopped publishing comic books, and during 1998 and 1999 we phased out all of our retail stores in order to focus our resources on the launch of an Internet business. In January 2001, we closed our e-commerce division in order to focus on our profitable business segments.           Since 1998, we have significantly expanded our business through acquisitions of other entertainment-related businesses and the development of strategic relationships with major media companies to promote our businesses.  o        On May 18, 1999, we purchased substantially all of the assets of          CinemaSource, Inc., a business-to-business company that licenses movie          showtimes and other movie-related information to newspaper companies,          wireless companies, Internet sites and other media outlets.  o        On May 20, 1999, we acquired hollywood.com, Inc., which owns and          operates Hollywood.com.  o        On August 31, 1999, we purchased Baseline II which includes the          PKBaseline.com pay-per-use movie database web site and several          movie-related publications.  o        On January 3, 2000, we completed an agreement with Viacom Inc. (as          successor to CBS Corporation) providing for the issuance to Viacom of          6,672,031 shares of our common stock in exchange for $105.5 million of          CBS advertising and promotion over seven years across its full range of          media properties and $10.8 million in cash.  o        On May 1, 2000 we launched Broadway.com.  o        On May 1, 2000 we acquired substantially all the assets of          BroadwayTheater.com. BroadwayTheater.com sells theater tickets online          predominately for Broadway, off-Broadway and London theater. This          business was integrated within Broadway.com.  o        On September 15, 2000 we acquired Theatre Direct International (TDI), a          ticketing wholesaler of Broadway, off-Broadway and London theater          tickets to the travel industry (including travel agencies and tour          operators) and educational institutions.                                         23             These changes to our business have affected our results of operations and financial condition. Historically, we generated revenues from our intellectual properties business and our entertainment retail operations. Our intellectual properties business primarily consists of the licensing of complete stories and ideas for stories to book publishers and film and television studios and book development and book packaging activities. Our retail operations consisted of the sale of entertainment-related products and other merchandise at mall-based retail stores. As the result of the closing of all of our retail stores by the end of 1999, we will rely on our b2b syndication operations, Broadway and movie ticketing operations, advertising sales and our intellectual properties business to generate revenues for the foreseeable future.           The growth of our syndication, ticketing and Internet ad sales operations has required substantial financing and we expect to continue to require additional financing to fund our growth plan and for working capital. Our operating plans and assumptions indicate that anticipated cash flows when combined with other potential sources of capital, will be enough to meet our working capital requirements for the year 2000. If plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek further financing or curtail our operations. Our long-term financial success depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to offset operating expenses. To the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations.           The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto included in Item 8 of Part II of this Report.  Results of Operations           Year ended December 31, 2000 ("fiscal 2000") as compared to the Year ended December 31, 1999 ("fiscal 1999") and year ended December 31, 1998 ("fiscal 1998")           The following table summarizes the Company's revenues, cost of sales, and gross profit by division for fiscal, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively:                                           24                                                  Business to                                Internet      Business                    Intellectual        E-                                Ad Sales        (b2b)        Ticketing    Properties (a)   Commerce         Retail          Total                              -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------     -----------     -----------                Fiscal 2000   Net Revenues                 $ 8,777,397    $ 5,442,309    $12,278,008    $ 1,998,091    $   987,181     $    34,519     $29,517,505 Cost of Sales                    791,770        270,806     10,663,913      1,125,815      1,146,007         265,691      14,264,002                              -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------     -----------     ----------- Gross Profit                 $ 7,985,627    $ 5,171,503    $ 1,614,095    $   872,276    $  (158,826)    $  (231,172)    $15,253,503                              ===========    ===========    ===========    ===========    ===========     ===========     ===========   Fiscal 1999   Net Revenues                 $ 3,950,931    $ 1,765,732    $        --    $ 1,888,868    $   924,098     $ 1,576,482     $10,106,111 Cost of Sales                    435,940        122,496             --        826,355        677,509       1,510,532       3,572,832                              -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------     -----------     ----------- Gross Profit                 $ 3,514,991    $ 1,643,236    $        --    $ 1,062,513    $   246,589     $    65,950     $ 6,533,279                              ===========    ===========    ===========    ===========    ===========     ===========     ===========   Fiscal 1998   Net Revenues                 $        --    $        --    $        --    $ 2,337,019    $        --     $ 8,789,497     $11,126,516 Cost of Sales                         --             --             --      1,191,261             --       4,796,122       5,987,383                              -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------    -----------     -----------     ----------- Gross Profit                 $        --    $        --    $        --    $ 1,145,758    $        --     $ 3,993,375     $ 5,139,133                              ===========    ===========    ===========    ===========    ===========     ===========     ===========   (a)           This does not include the Company's 50% interest in NetCo               Partners which is accounted for under the equity method of               accounting and is reported as equity in earnings of investments.  Composition of our segments is as follows:  o        Internet ad sales - Includes advertising sold on the web sites          Hollywood.com, Broadway.com and the international versions of          Hollywood.com.  o        Business to Business (b2b) - Includes our CinemaSource, EventSource,          TheaterSource, ConcertSource and Baseline syndication operations.  o        Ticketing - Includes our TDI ticketing business as well as the online          ticketing operations generated through Broadway.com.  o        Intellectual Properties - Includes our book development and book          licensing operation through our 51% owned subsidiary Tekno Books and          our 50.5% interest in Fedora, publisher of Mystery Scene Magazine. Does          not include our 50% interest in NetCo Partners.  o        E-Commerce - The Company exited the e-commerce business in          January 2001.  o        Retail - This included the Company's brick and mortar retail operations          which were closed on December 31, 1999.                                         25   Net Revenues           Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $29,517,505 compared to $10,106,111 for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $11,126,516 for the year ended December 31, 1998. Revenues increased $19,411,394 or 192% in 2000 from 1999. This increase is attributable to having a complete fiscal year of operations in 2000 for the Company's business to business and ad sales divisions, the growth of EventSource (b2b unit), launch of Broadway.com in 2000 and also the acquisition of two businesses in 2000 that sell theater tickets. Revenues decreased $1,020,405 or 9% in 1999 as compared to 1998 because the Company began to phase-out of the retail business during 1999 and ultimately closed all its retail operations in December 1999. This decrease in retail revenues was offset from revenues generated in its business to business and advertising sales divisions which were acquired in 1999. In 2000, revenues are derived 42% from ticketing, 30% from advertising sales, 18% from business to business, 7% intellectual properties and 3% from e-commerce.  Internet ad sales revenue increased to $8,777,397 for 2000 from $3,950,931 for 1999, an increase of $4,826,466 or 122%. The Company began to generate Internet ad sales in May 1999 with the acquisition of Hollywood.com. Therefore, there was no Internet ad sales revenue recognized in 1998. Internet ad sales revenue is derived from the sale of banner advertisements and sponsorships on Hollywood.com, Broadway.com and the international versions of the Hollywood.com web site.  Barter transactions that generate non-cash advertising revenue (included in Internet as sales revenues), in which the Company received advertising or other services in exchange for content advertising on its web site was $956,181 for 2000 and $480,100 for 1999 and accounted for 3% and 5% of the Company's total net revenue for 2000 and 1999 respectively. The Company records barter revenue and an equal amount of expense based on the fair value of similar cash transactions that the company has entered into. In future periods, management intends to maximize cash advertising revenue, although the Company will continue to enter into barter relationships when deemed appropriate as a cashless method for the Company to market its business.  The Company also records barter revenue and an equal amount of expense earned under a contract with the National Association of Theater Owners ("NATO"), which the Company acquired through its acquisition of hollywood.com on May 20, 1999. This income is included in Internet ad sales revenue. Through the NATO contract, the Company promotes its web site to movie audiences by airing movie trailers about Hollywood.com, 40 out of 52 weeks per year, before the feature films that play in most NATO-member theaters. In exchange, the Company provides web site and movie showtimes for the exhibiting NATO members, promotional materials and movie information and editorial content. The Company recorded $2,981,750 and $1,913,290 in promotional non-cash revenue and non-cash expense included in selling and marketing expense under the NATO contract for 2000 and 1999 respectively. Barter revenue from NATO recorded accounted for 10% and 19% of the Company's total net revenue for 2000 and 1999 respectively.  Business to business (b2b) revenue increased to $5,442,309 for 2000 from $1,765,732 for 1999, an increase of $3,676,577 or 208%. Business to business revenue is generated by the licensing of movie, event and theater showtimes and other content information to other Internet and media outlets including newspapers such as The New York Times and Newsday, Internet companies including AOL's Digital City, Yahoo!, Lycos, Excite, Ticketmaster/City Search, NBCi, and wireless providers such as AT&T Wireless, Sprint PCS and Verizon. The Company acquired the business to business (b2b) operations of CinemaSource and Baseline on May 18, 1999 and August 31, 1999, respectively. Revenues have increased predominately from revenues generated from the EventSource division which launched in 2000 as an expansion of the CinemaSource business. EventSource entered into a contract with AOL's Digital City in April 2000 to provide event listing for up to 200 cities nationwide.                                          26   Ticketing revenue for 2000 was $12,278,008. Ticketing revenue is generated from the sales of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and London both online and offline to domestic and international travel professionals, traveling consumers and New York area theater patrons. The Company acquired BroadwayTheater.com on May 1, 2000 and TDI on September 15, 2000, respectively.  E-commerce revenue increased $63,083 or 7% from $924,098 for 1999 to $987,181 for 2000. Revenues were consistent in 2000 as compared to 1999. The Company exited the e-commerce business in January 2001.  Revenues from the Company's intellectual properties segment increased $109,223 or 6% to $1,998,091 for 2000 from $1,888,868 for 1999 and decreased $448,151 or 19% from $2,337,019 for 1998 to $1,888,868 for 1999. The increase in revenues is attributable to a greater number of manuscripts being delivered in 2000 as compared to 1999. The decrease in revenues from 1998 to 1999 is primarily a reflection of the timing of revenue recognition under the various book licensing and packaging agreements. The intellectual properties division generates revenues from several different activities including book development and licensing, intellectual property licensing and publishing Mystery Scene Magazine. Revenues vary quarter to quarter depending on the timing of delivery of manuscripts to the publishers. Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete and ultimate collection of such revenues is no longer subject to contingencies.  Gross Profit           Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $15,253,503 compared to $6,533,279 for the year ended December 31, 1999 and $5,139,133 for the year ended December 31, 1998. As a percentage of sales the gross profit percentage in 2000 was 52% as compared to 65% in 1999 and 46% in 1998. The variances in gross profits are attributable to changes in our revenue mix. From 1998 to 1999 we began to phase out of our retail operations which generally generated a gross profit of 45% and acquired an ad sales operation and business to business operation that generates gross profit percentages of 90%, thereby increasing the gross profit percentage from 46% in 1998 to 65% in 1999. In 2000, the Company acquired two ticketing businesses which comprised 42% of our revenues and generates gross profits of 13%, thus reducing the overall gross profit percentage in 2000 to 52% from 65% in 1999.  Equity in Earnings of  Investments           Equity in net earnings of investments consists of the Company's 50% interest in NetCo Partners and 31.67% in MovieTickets.com, Inc.                                                          2000                  1999                 1998                                                       ----                  ----                 ----                 NetCo Partners (a)                     $     2,300,418       $     1,188,142        $     877,549         MovieTickets.com(b)                           (394,286)                   --                   --                                                -----------------     ---------------        --------------                                                $     1,906,132       $     1,188,142        $     877,549                                                ===============        ==============        =============                                          27             (a)      NetCo Partners:           NetCo Partners recognizes revenues when the earnings process has been completed based on the terms of the various agreements and the manuscript has been delivered to the publisher. When advances are received prior to completion of the earnings process, NetCo Partners defers recognition of revenue until the earnings process has been completed. The Company's 50% share in the earnings of NetCo Partners amounted to $2,300,418 for 2000, an increase of 94% or $1,112,276 as compared to $1,188,142 for 1999. Revenues were $877,549 for 1998. Revenues increased from 1999 to 2000 because two adult novels were delivered to the publisher in 2000 as compared to only one adult novel being delivered in 1999. In addition, NetCo Partners received net royalties of $404,253 for the home video distribution of the ABC mini-series; as described more fully below. On book projects, revenues are typically recognized upon delivery of the manuscripts to the publishers. Costs related to acquisition, development and sales of the intellectual properties and their licensed products are expensed in proportion to the revenues that have been recognized.           The licensing arrangement between NetCo Partners and ABC was modified during 1998. The mini-series arrangement originally provided for a payment to NetCo Partners of $1.6 million should the NetForce mini-series not air by May 1999 and a minimum guaranteed license fee in excess of $1.6 million if it aired. NetCo Partners accrued the $1.6 million payment in 1997, as this represented the minimum amount to be received by NetCo Partners under the ABC mini-series agreement. Under the new arrangement with ABC, NetCo Partners receives a $400,000 rights' fee, which was collected in 1998, and a profit participation in the mini-series in lieu of the original license fee. The mini-series aired on ABC during February 1999. Accordingly, the previously accrued payment was reversed during 1998, the rights' fee was recorded as revenues, and any future revenues from the mini-series will be based on a profit-sharing arrangement with ABC.           In April 1997, NetCo Partners entered into an agreement with The Berkley Publishing Group ("Berkley"), a division of Penguin Putnam Inc., which is part of the international media group Pearson plc, to publish a series of six original NetForce novels. The contract, with total maximum advances of $22 million, calls for initial publication of the first book to coincide with the airing of the ABC mini-series referred to above. The first book and second book were published in 1999. Additional revenues under the Berkley Books contract will be recognized as manuscripts on the remaining four adult books are delivered and accepted by the publisher. NetCo Partners receives advances under this contract based on specific milestones throughout the publication process for each of the six books. This contract calls for royalties on paperback sales to be earned by NetCo Partners at 15% of the publisher's suggested retail price.           In April 1997, NetCo Partners also entered into a second agreement with Berkley to publish up to 18 young adult novels based on NetForce. The contract calls for total maximum advances of $900,000 in addition to royalties earned.           Both of the Berkley contracts grant to Berkley only the North American publishing rights to publish NetForce books. NetCo Partners has also licensed the publication rights to NetForce in various countries throughout the world in eight foreign languages. Acceptance of the manuscripts by Berkley, the North American publisher, is deemed acceptance of the manuscripts by the foreign publishers.                                          28            (b)      MovieTickets.com. Inc.           The Company entered into a joint venture agreement on February 29, 2000 with the movie theater chains AMC Entertainment Inc. and National Amusements, Inc. to form MovieTickets.com, Inc. ("MovieTickets.com"). In August 2000 the joint venture entered into an agreement with Viacom Inc. to acquire a five percent interest in the joint venture for $25 million of advertising over 5 years. The company owned 31.67% of the MovieTickets.com, Inc. joint venture at December 31, 2000. The Company records its investment under the equity method of accounting, recognizing 31.67% of MovieTickets.com income or loss as equity in net earnings - investments. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2000, the Company recorded a loss of $394,286 in its investment in MovieTickets.com. At December 31, 2000, the Company contributed $500,000 in cash to MovieTickets.com and issued warrants to acquire 90,573 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $17.875 per share valued at $1,000,000. The fair market value of the warrant was recorded as goodwill and is being amortized over a life of ten years.           The MovieTickets.com web site launched in May 2000. The MovieTickets.com web site allows users to purchase movie tickets and retrieve them at "will call" windows or kiosks at theaters. The web site also features movie content from Hollywood.com for all current and future release movies, movie reviews and synopses, digitized movie trailers and photos, and box office results. We expect the web site to generate revenues from service fees charged to users for the purchase of tickets and the sale of advertising. Service fees on ticket sales were introduced in November 2000. MovieTickets.com is promoted through on-screen advertising in each participating exhibitor's movie screens and through $25 million of Viacom advertising and promotion over the next five years. MovieTickets.com's current participating exhibitors include AMC Entertainment Inc., National Amusements, Inc, Famous Players, Inc., Marcus Theaters, Muvico Entertainment and several regional exhibitors. These exhibitors operate theaters located in all of the top twenty markets and approximately 70% of the top 50 markets in the United States and Canada and represent approximately 50% of the top 100 grossing theaters in North America. AMC Entertainment Inc. is the largest movie theater operator in the United States based on box office sales and Famous Players generates approximately half of all box office sales in Canada.           In early 2001, America Online, Inc. purchased a 3% equity interest in MovieTickets.com for $8.5 million in cash. In connection with the transaction, MovieTickets.com's ticket inventory will be promoted throughout America Online's interactive properties and ticket inventory of AOL Moviefone will be featured on MovieTickets.com.           Operating Expenses           General and administrative expenses consists of production costs, technical and customer support, human resources and administrative functions as well as professional and consulting service fees, telecommunications costs, general insurance costs and occupancy costs. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $11,220,529 as compared to $8,227,022 and $5,196,364 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase is attributable to the completion of five acquisitions between 1999 and 2000. A full fiscal year of general and administrative expenses is not recorded in both years with regard to the acquisition made.                                           29             Salaries and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $11,810,803 as compared to $5,916,024 and $4,151,725 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in salaries is primarily attributable to the acquisitions of two ticketing businesses in 2000 and the impact of an entire fiscal year of salaries in 2000 for the businesses acquired in 1999. In 1999 salaries and benefits for the Internet ad sales and syndication businesses acquired includes expenses only from the date of acquisition to the end of the year.           The consolidation of the Hollywood.com web site technology and production into its corporate offices in South Florida began in 2000 and was completed in January 2001 and resulted in the Company being able to eliminate considerable duplication of resources with savings to exceed $4.0 million in 2001 in the general and administrative and salaries and benefits areas. In addition, the company closed its e-commerce division in January 2001 which had generated operating losses of $2.5 million in 2000.           Selling and marketing expenses includes advertising, marketing, promotional, business development, public relations expenses and costs to produce movie trailers. Also included is the non-cash expense portion of barter advertising. Selling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $9,593,871 as compared to $5,074,568 and $2,566,702 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 respectively. Non-cash barter expense included in selling and marketing was $3,937,931, $2,613,390 and $2,130,112 for years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase of $4,519,303 from 1999 to 2000 is attributable to an increase of $1,324,541 of non-cash barter advertising expense and increased advertising on radio, television, online and outdoor for the Company's Internet ad sales divisions and additional advertising related to the launch of Broadway.com on May 1, 2000. In addition, in 2000 the Company incurred up front production costs associated with advertising on CBS's media properties.           Amortization of goodwill and intangibles for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $6,775,206 compared to $3,704,011 and $31,428 in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase of $3,071,195 from 1999 to 2000 is attributable to goodwill and intangibles recorded in accordance with various acquisitions during 1999 and 2000. (See note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.) In addition, a amortization expense in 2000 includes a full year of amortization on the companies acquired in 1999.           Depreciation expense, which consists of the depreciation of property and equipment, furniture and fixtures, web development, leasehold improvements and capital leases, for the year ended December 31, 2000 was $4,323,331 compared to $1,627,056 and $1,076,983 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The increase in depreciation expense from 1999 to 2000 is primarily attributable to the write-off in 2000 of the carrying value of the AOL Latin America Services agreement of $3.2 million in 2000. The increase in depreciation expense from 1998 to 1999 was primarily due to the acquisitions in 1999 and the additional equipment purchased to handle the increased traffic on Hollywood.com.           Provision for Closed Stores and Lease Termination Costs           Reserve for closed stores and lease termination costs are $233,763 for 2000 as compared to $4,551,094 and $1,121,028 in 1999 and 1998, respectively. The Company's retail operations were closed in December 1999. The remaining carrying value of the fixed assets, inventory and other assets related to retail operations were written off to provision for closed stores in 1999. A liability was recorded for estimated cost of early lease terminations of $798,362 and $2,366,432 at December 31, 2000 and 1999 respectively. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.                                          30            Interest Expense, Net           Net interest expense was $339,522 for the year ended December 31, 2000, as compared to $563,909 and $818,849 for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The decrease in interest expense from 2000 to 1999 is attributable to a decrease in our outstanding obligations under capital leases. The decrease from 1998 to 1999 is also attributable to a reduction in the inventory line of credit and a reduction in outstanding capital obligations, offset by an increase in interest income.           Deferred Tax Expense Benefit           During 1997, the Company recognized $1,407,600 of deferred tax benefit as the Company believed that realization of a portion of its net operating loss carryforward was likely to occur based on the Company's projections of taxable income that would have been generated upon consummation of a planned transaction. In 1998, the Company decided not to proceed with the transaction, and accordingly recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax benefit.            Net Loss           The Company's net loss for 2000 totaled $51,847,500 as compared to a net loss of $24,657,024 for fiscal 1999. The loss for fiscal 1998 was $10,658,089. The net loss increased by $27,190,476 for 2000 as compared to 1999 primarily because of an increase in amortization of CBS non-cash advertising of $21,899,697, amortization of goodwill and intangibles of $3,071,195 and operating losses incurred by the e-commerce division which was closed in January 2001 of $2,521,911. Net loss per share for fiscal 2000 was $2.23 as compared to a net loss of $2.01 for fiscal 1999, representing an increase of $.22 loss per share. The net loss per share for 1998 was $1.47. The per share impact of depreciation, CBS non-cash advertising, amortization of goodwill and intangibles on the 2000 and 1999 loss per share is $1.52 and $.62, respectively.           The net loss increased from $10,658,089 in 1998 to $24,657,024 in 1999 primarily because of the amortization of CBS non-cash advertising of $2,344,950, increase in provision for closed stores and lease termination costs of $3,430,066, amortization of goodwill and intangibles of $3,672,583, and operating losses incurred by the retail operations of approximately $3.0 million.           The Company has taken several steps to substantially cut its cash losses, the benefits of which are expected to materialize in 2001. During 2000, the Company began a two step approach to consolidate Hollywood.com web site technology and production into its corporate office in South Florida. Completed in January 2001, the Company eliminated considerable duplication of resource with savings expected to exceed $4,000,000 in 2001. Further, during the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company, as part of its operational evaluation process, determined that profitability in the e-commerce business could not be reached due to tight margins and high fulfillment costs. The Company closed this business in January 2001 which incurred a loss of $2,511,911 in 2000.           The Company continues to focus its resources on the expansion of its business to business, ticketing and Internet operations. Ticketing has become a significant revenue source for the Company, most notably through the acquisition of Theater Direct International in September 2000 and the launch of Broadway.com in May 2000.                                          31            While the Company believes that the acquisitions made during 2000 together with economies of scale introduced and closure of unprofitable business will lead the Company to a positive operating cash flow for the year 2001, there can be no assurances that the revenues generated will be sufficient to offset the associated expenses incurred.           Liquidity and Capital Resources           At December 31, 2000, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,911,224 compared to cash and cash equivalents of $2,475,345 at December 31, 1999. Working capital at December 31, 2000, which includes $19,131,714 in deferred advertising with CBS, was $14,871,414, as compared to a deficit of $4,817,879 at December 31, 1999. Net cash used in operating activities during fiscal 2000 was $13,017,504, primarily representing cash used to fund the Company's pre-tax loss, net of non-cash expenses including depreciation and amortization, reserve for closed stores and lease termination costs, CBS advertising and the inventory reserve. Net cash used in investing activities was $3,652,461, representing capital expenditures, acquisitions of web addresses and other investments, and distributions to minority interests. Net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $16,105,844 during 2000, primarily representing proceeds from issuance of common stock and proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants. The combined effect of the above was a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of $564,121 during 2000.           The Company's Board of Directors approved the repurchase of $4.0 million of the Company's common stock. Pursuant to the plan, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2000 the Company repurchased 335,150 shares of common stock for an aggregate consideration of $2,661,924, and an average purchase price of $7.94 per share. In the aggregate, the Company has repurchased 417,500 shares of common stock for an aggregate consideration of $3,433,618 at an average price of $8.22 per share.           During 2000 the Company issued 1,480,872 shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants for which the Company received $7,022,412 in cash exercise proceeds and $5,468,501 in additional promotional advertising from CBS.           The success of the Company's operations in future years is dependent on its ability to generate adequate revenue to offset operating expenses. Unless otherwise noted, the proceeds from the financing transactions in 2000 and 1999 were used to complete the acquisitions of five businesses in 2000 and 1999 and for general corporate purposes. The Company's management expects to require additional financing for the expansion of its businesses, and to support working capital requirements in future years.           The Company is currently exploring additional financing alternatives, including a bank line of credit to allow the Company to finance such expansion, although there can be no assurance that such financing alternatives will be available to the Company or can be obtained on terms favorable to the Company.           In the event that the Company requires additional funding and cannot secure additional funding, the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and the Company's Vice Chairman and President, have indicated their intention to provide the Company, if required, with an amount not to exceed $6 million in order to enable the Company to meet its working capital requirements during 2001; provided, however, that the commitment will terminate to the extent that the Company raises no less than $6 million from other sources and such additional funding is not expended on acquisitions.           Inflation and Seasonality           Although the Company cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation, it does not believe inflation has a material effect on sales or results of operations. The Company considers its business to be somewhat seasonal and expects net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for its Tekno Books book licensing and packaging operation as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi-annually. In addition, although not seasonal, the Company's intellectual properties division and NetCo Partners both experience significant fluctuations in their respective revenue streams, earnings and cash flow as a result of the significant amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements. While certain of the development costs are incurred as normal recurring operating expenses, the recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis.
