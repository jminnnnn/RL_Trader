Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation .               The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hollywood Medias Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.    Overview               Hollywood Media is a provider of information, data, news and other content, and ticketing to consumers and businesses covering the entertainment, Internet and media industries. We own and operate a number of business units focused on the entertainment and media industries. Hollywood Media derives a diverse stream of revenues from this array of business units, including revenue from individual and group Broadway ticket sales, data syndication, subscription fees, content licensing fees, advertising, and book development license fees and royalties. Our Data Business includes CinemaSource, EventSource and ExhibitorAds. Our Broadway Ticketing business includes Broadway.com, 1-800-Broadway and Theatre.com. These services supply media outlets with specific information on entertainment events, such as movies, live theater and concerts, and sell tickets for live theater. Hollywood Medias businesses also include an intellectual property business, as well as Hollywood.com and a minority interest in MovieTickets.com. In addition, Hollywood Media owns and operates the cable television network, Hollywood.com Television.    Acquisitions since 2004               Since 2004, we have significantly expanded our business through acquisitions of other entertainment-related businesses and the development of strategic relationships with media companies, including the items listed below. These changes to our business have affected our results of operations and financial condition.                        On July 1, 2004, Hollywood Media consummated our acquisition by merger of 100% of the outstanding common stock of StudioSystems, Inc. (SSI), one of the leading entertainment industry database and information service providers. As a result of the acquisition, SSI became a subsidiary of Hollywood Media and its business was integrated with our Baseline/FilmTracker subsidiary now known as Baseline/StudioSystems. In August of 2006, Baseline/StudioSystems was sold (see Note 4  Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K).                           On November 23, 2005 Hollywood Media consummated our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of the U.K. based CinemasOnline, a group of advertising sales and data services companies focused primarily on selling advertising on cinema and live theatre websites in the U.K. and Ireland. CinemasOnline became a subsidiary of CinemaSource UK Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hollywood Media.                           On January 18, 2006, Hollywood Media consummated the acquisition of the assets of eFanGuide, Inc. (eFanGuide) including all of its assets related to its celebrity fan websites, including approximately 120 owned URLs and 5 hosted URLs. The aggregate purchase price paid by Hollywood Media for the websites and related assets was $216,500 paid by 50,930 unregistered      22                             shares of common stock of Hollywood Media, based on the closing date fair market value calculation set forth in the asset purchase agreement.                         On January 31, 2006, Hollywood Media consummated the acquisition of the assets of Prosperity Plus, Inc. (Prosperity Plus) including all of its assets related to its celebrity fan websites, including approximately 31 owned URLs and 17 hosted URLs. The aggregate purchase price paid by Hollywood Media for the websites and related assets was (i) $100,000 in cash and (ii) $300,000 paid by the issuance of 69,349 unregistered shares of common stock of Hollywood Media, based on the closing date fair market value calculation set forth in the asset purchase agreement.                           On February 1, 2007, Hollywood Media, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Theatre Direct NY, Inc. ( Theatre Direct ), entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with Showtix LLC ( Showtix ) and each of its members for the acquisition by Theatre Direct of substantially all of the assets of Showtix. Showtix is a full-service, licensed group ticketing sales agency that sells tickets for Broadway and Off-Broadway theatrical performances. This acquisition was completed and closed on February 1, 2007. The aggregate purchase price paid by Hollywood Media for the assets of Showtix was $2.6 million in cash. In addition, Showtix is also entitled to receive up to $370,000 in cash earn-outs as follows: (i) for each of the 2007, 2008 and 2009 fiscal years, Showtix is entitled to receive a cash amount equal to 2.5% of the gross profit earned by Theatre Directs group ticketing business, up to a maximum of $60,000 in each such fiscal year; and (ii) for each of the 2010 and 2011 fiscal years, Showtix is entitled to receive a cash amount equal to 3.0% of the gross profit earned by Theatre Directs group ticketing business, up to a maximum of $95,000 in each such fiscal year.       RESULTS OF OPERATIONS                Year ended December 31, 2006 (fiscal 2006) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005) and year ended December 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004).     Composition of our business segments are as follows:                         Broadway Ticketing   sells tickets via Broadway.com, 1-800-BROADWAY, Theatre.com, and TDI to live theater events for Broadway, Off-Broadway and London theatre, and hotel and restaurant packages, to consumers, domestic and international travel professionals including travel agencies and tour operators, and educational institutions.                           Data Business   licenses entertainment content and data and includes CinemaSource (which licenses movie showtimes and other movie content), EventSource (which licenses local listings of live events for over 10,000 venues and approximately 110,000 events per month including concerts, sporting events, festivals, fairs and shows, touring companies, company playhouses and dinner theaters to media, wireless and Internet companies) and ExhibitorAds (which creates exhibitor-paid directory ads for insertion in newspapers in the U.S. and provides other exhibitor marketing services).                           Ad Sales   sells advertising on Hollywood.com, Broadway.com and MovieTickets.com and also includes CinemasOnline which sells advertising on cinema and live theatre websites in the U.K. Hollywood.com receives commissions on the ads it sells on MovieTickets.com.                           Intellectual Properties   owns or controls the exclusive rights to certain intellectual properties created by best-selling authors and media celebrities, which it licenses for book and other media.

Results of Discontinued Operations               On August 25, 2006, Hollywood Media sold to The New York Times Company (The New York Times) all of the outstanding capital stock of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Baseline Acquisitions Corp. (BAC), for a cash purchase price of $35,000,000, subject to potential post-closing adjustments. Of the purchase price, $3.5 million is being held in escrow for twelve months following the closing to cover potential indemnification claims, if any, made by The New York Times under the terms of the Purchase Agreement. As of December 31, 2006, Hollywood Media is not aware of any claim against the escrow and estimates that the full amount of the escrow, net of costs of $700,000 for certain bonuses due the former Division Heads, will be released after the one-year period is over as per the terms of the Purchase Agreement.              BAC was the subsidiary of Hollywood Media which owned (i) Hollywood Medias Baseline StudioSystems business unit (Baseline) and (ii) the Germany-based Screenline business of Hollywood Media (Screenline). Baseline is a database and research service offering specialized information and online applications to its subscribing users and licensees, which subscribers and licensees include movie and TV studios and production companies, distributors, producers, screenwriters, news organizations and websites. Baselines film and television database contains motion picture and TV information, including data about film and television productions and entertainment industry professionals. Screenline, a German company acquired by Hollywood Media in June 2006, aggregates weekly box office data for more than 30 international territories and countries, as well as film synopses, cast and crew lists, release dates and budget information in English, German and Spanish. Baseline and Screenline constituted a portion of Hollywood Medias Data Syndication Division. This sale to The New York Times did not include the other components of Hollywood Medias Data Business called the Source business which consists of CinemaSource, EventSource and ExhibitorAds. See Note 4 of Notes To Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.              Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  (SFAS 144), the consolidated financial statements have been reclassified for all periods presented to reflect the operations, assets and liabilities of Baseline as discontinued operations.              Following are components of the net results of discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004.

revenues for fiscal 2006 were $115,895,460 compared to $90,355,030 and $69,589,241 for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004, respectively. Revenues increased $25,540,430, or 28%, in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 and increased $20,765,789, or 30%, in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The increase in net revenues for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 is primarily the result of increases in Broadway ticketing revenue of $19,212,243, Data Business revenue of $1,119,256, Ad Sales revenue of $5,396,320 and Cable TV revenue of $134,065, offset in part by a decrease in Intellectual Properties revenue of $321,454. In fiscal 2006, net revenues were derived 85% from Broadway Ticketing, 6% from Data Business, 8% from Ad Sales and 1% from Intellectual Properties. In fiscal 2005, Broadway Ticketing represented 87% of all net revenues, Data Business represented 6%, Ad Sales represented 5% and Intellectual Properties represented 2%. In fiscal 2004, Broadway Ticketing represented 86% of all revenues, Data Business represented 7%, Ad Sales represented 4% and Intellectual Properties represented 3%.              Broadway Ticketing net revenue for fiscal 2006 was $98,102,961 as compared to $78,890,718 for fiscal 2005, and $59,689,971 for fiscal 2004. Broadway Ticketing net revenue increased $19,212,243, or 24%, for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 and increased $19,200,747, or 32%, for fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The increase in Broadway Ticketing net revenue in fiscal 2006 is the result of an increase in sales to consumers attributed primarily to the launch of the new Broadway.com website in November 2004, hotel package sales and changes in our marketing and advertising strategies as well as growth in tourism in New York City. Ticketing revenue is generated from the sales of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and Londons West End both online via Broadway.com and Theatre.com; and offline via 1-800-BROADWAY to domestic and international travel professionals, traveling consumers and New York area theater patrons. Ticketing revenue is recognized on the date of performance of the show. Ticket revenue received for performances yet to take place is recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. For a discussion of adjustments made to 2005 ticketing revenue and cost of revenue-ticketing, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K report.              Data Business net revenue (which includes CinemaSource, EventSource, ExhibitorAds) was $6,478,478 for fiscal 2006 compared to $5,359,222 for fiscal 2005, and $4,601,047 for fiscal 2004. Data Business net revenue increased $1,119,256, or 21%, for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 and $758,175, or 16%, for fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The increase in Data Business revenue from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 is attributable primarily to additional licensing agreements entered into by Data Business and an aggregate increase in license fees payable to us from our existing customers.              Revenue for CinemaSource and EventSource is generated by the licensing of movie, event and theater showtimes and other information to other media outlets and Internet companies including newspapers such as  The New York Times,  Internet companies including AOLs Moviefone and City Guide, MSN, Yahoo! and Google, and wireless providers. Revenue for ExhibitorAds is generated by creating exhibitor paid directory ads for insertion in newspapers.     26                      Ad Sales net revenue was $9,909,996 for fiscal 2006 as compared to $4,513,676 for fiscal 2005 and $2,814,921 for fiscal 2004. Ad Sales net revenue increased $5,396,320 or 120% for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 and increased $1,698,755, or 60%, for fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The increase in Ad Sales from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the acquisition of CinemasOnline in November 2005 and continued growth of ad sales on Hollywood.com and Broadway.com as well as increased commission revenue due to higher ad sales on MovieTickets.com. The increase in revenue from 2004 to 2005 results from growth in Hollywood.com and Broadway.com, as well as commission revenue from ad sales on MovieTickets.com. In addition, CinemasOnline acquired in November 2005 contributed $475,796 to the increase in revenue in 2005. Ad Sales revenue is generated from the sale of advertisements and sponsorships on Hollywood.com and Broadway.com as well as advertisements generated by CinemasOnline. Hollywood Media also earns commissions on ad sales which Hollywood Media sells for placement on MovieTickets.com.              Intellectual Properties revenues were $1,229,126 for fiscal 2006, compared to $1,550,580 for fiscal 2005 and $2,483,302 for fiscal 2004. Net revenues generated from Intellectual Properties decreased $321,454, or 21%, in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 and decreased $932,722, or 38%, in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004. The decrease in revenues from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was attributable to the timing of the delivery of manuscripts as fewer manuscripts were delivered in 2006 as compared to 2005 and to sluggishness in the publishing industry. The decrease in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 is attributed to a series of six books ( Left Behind ), five of which were completed, delivered and accounted for in fiscal 2003, and the sixth and last book of the series was completed, delivered and accounted for in fiscal 2004. The Intellectual Properties division generates revenues from several different activities including book development and licensing, and intellectual property licensing. Revenues vary quarter to quarter depending on the timing of delivery of manuscripts to the publishers. Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete and ultimate collection of such revenues is no longer subject to contingencies. This division does not include NetCo Partners, which is reported separately; see Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees below.    Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees               Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees consists of the following:                                                                                      For the years ended December 31,                     2006              2005              2004              NetCo Partners (a)         $    12,227              $    533,228              $    576,317           MovieTickets.com (b)                                                                                                                              $    12,227              $    533,228              $    576,317                                                                           (a) NetCo Partners              NetCo Partners owns  Tom Clancys NetForce  and is primarily engaged in the development and licensing of  Tom Clancys NetForce . NetCo Partners recognizes revenues when the earnings process has been completed based on the terms of the various agreements, generally upon the delivery of the manuscript to the publisher and at the point where ultimate collection is substantially assured. When advances are received prior to completion of the earnings process, NetCo Partners defers recognition of revenue until the earnings process has been completed. Hollywood Media owns 50% of NetCo Partners and accounts for its investment under the equity method. Hollywood Medias 50% share of earnings of NetCo Partners was $12,227 for fiscal 2006 a decrease of 98% or $521,001 as compared to $533,228 for fiscal 2005. Our 50% share of earnings was $576,317 for fiscal 2004. Revenues decreased for fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 and 2004 primarily due to fewer manuscripts delivered as well as general sluggishness of the publishing industry. Revenues vary year to year dependent on the timing of deliveries of manuscripts to the publisher. Costs related to the acquisition, development and sales of the intellectual properties and their licensed products are expensed in proportion to the revenues that have been recognized.     27                      (b) MovieTickets.com, Inc.              Hollywood Media entered into a joint venture agreement on February 29, 2000 with the movie theater chains AMC Entertainment Inc. (AMC) and National Amusements, Inc. to form MovieTickets.com, Inc. (MovieTickets.com). Effective August 2000, the joint venture entered into an agreement with Viacom Inc. to acquire a five percent interest in the joint venture for $25 million of advertising over five years. In addition to the Viacom advertising and promotion, MovieTickets.com is promoted through on-screen advertising in most participating exhibitors movie screens. In March 2001, America Online, Inc. (AOL) purchased a non-interest bearing convertible preferred voting equity interest in MovieTickets.com for $8.5 million in cash. AOL converted its preferred stock into common stock in 2005.              Hollywood Media owns 26.2% of the equity in MovieTickets.com, Inc. at December 31, 2006, and shares in 26.2% of the income or losses generated by the joint venture. This investment is recorded under the equity method of accounting, recognizing 26.2% of MovieTickets.com income or loss as equity in earnings of investees. Since the investment has been reduced to approximately zero, Hollywood Media is currently not providing for additional losses, if any, generated by MovieTickets.com as Hollywood Media had not committed to fund future losses, if any, generated by MovieTickets.com. Hollywood Media has recorded no income or losses for its investment in MovieTickets.com for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004, as accumulated losses from prior years are in excess of current year income.              MovieTickets.com is a leading destination for the purchase of movie tickets through the Internet. Hollywood Media launched the MovieTickets.com website in May 2000 with several major movie theater exhibitors. The MovieTickets.com website allows users to purchase movie tickets and retrieve them at will call windows or kiosks at theaters or the user can print at home for theatres with that capacity. The website generates revenues from service fees charged to users for the purchase of tickets and the sale of advertising. Service fees on ticket sales were introduced in November 2000. MovieTickets.coms participating exhibitors operate theaters located in all of the top twenty markets and approximately 70% of the top 50 and top 100 markets in the United States and Canada and represent approximately 50% of the top 50 and top 100 grossing theaters in North America. Additionally, MovieTickets.com operates in the United Kingdom. See Item 1  Business, and Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about MovieTickets.com.    Operating Expenses                Cost of Revenues  Ticketing.  Cost of revenues  ticketing was $81,928,952 for fiscal 2006 compared to $67,515,534 for fiscal 2005 and $51,781,133 for fiscal 2004. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of tickets and credit card fees for the Broadway Ticketing segment. As a percentage of ticketing revenues, cost of revenues  ticketing was 84%, 86% and 87% for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The reduction in cost of revenue as percentage of ticketing revenue in 2006 over 2005 and 2005 over 2004, was due in part to a greater proportion of higher margin consumer ticket sales and an increase in sellables (e.g., insurance, restaurant vouchers).               Editorial, Production, Development and Technology.  Editorial, production, development and technology costs consist of payroll and related expenses for the editorial and production staff responsible for creating content on the companys websites for our Ad Sales and Data Business segments. Internet access and computer related expenses for the support and delivery of each divisions services and fees, and royalties paid to authors and co-editors for the Intellectual Properties segments, are also included. Editorial, production, development and technology expense for fiscal year 2006 was $7,204,546 compared to $4,779,185 for fiscal 2005 and $4,057,680 for fiscal 2004. As of percentage of our other (non-ticketing) revenues, these costs were 40%, 42% and 41% for fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 decrease in Editorial, Production, Development and Technology as a percentage of revenue is due in part to the relatively lower incremental costs associated with the increased 2006 revenues in the Data Business and Ad Sales segments.    28                       Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist of occupancy costs, production costs, professional and consulting service fees, telecommunications costs, provision for doubtful accounts receivable, general insurance costs, selling and marketing costs (such as advertising, marketing, promotional, business development, public relations, and commissions due to advertising agencies, advertising representative firms and other parties). The SG&A expenses for fiscal 2006 were $15,589,131 compared to $11,452,679 for fiscal 2005, for an increase of $4,136,452, or 36% and $10,237,259 for fiscal 2004, for an increase of $1,215,420 or 12%. As a percentage of net revenues, SG&A expenses were 13% for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 and 15% for fiscal 2004. The increase in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to an increase of $1,778,000 in advertising expense in the Broadway Ticketing segment, an increase of $1,284,000 in consulting expense, due to our outsourcing of technology to third party providers in India and to cover our staffing needs at one of our subsidiaries while we changed our organizational structure, an increase in bad debt expense of $310,000, an increase in travel and entertainment of $134,000 offset by decreases in Sarbanes Oxley consulting fees of $513,000 and accounting fees of $160,000, all excluding CinemasOnline. In addition, the acquisition of CinemasOnline in November 2005 increased SG&A expense in fiscal 2006 by $884,000 as compared to fiscal 2005. The increase in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to an increase of $1,326,000 in advertising expense in the Broadway Ticketing and Ad Sales segments and an increase of $193,000 in consulting fees related to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.              We are continuing to develop and implement efficiency improvements and cost-savings measures anticipated to reduce or better control various elements of SG&A expenses, including certain overhead reductions, improved accounting systems, and the installation of a new, more robust Broadway ticketing software system to streamline our ticketing functionality and improve efficiencies. These various cost-saving measures are being incrementally implemented during 2006 and 2007 and we expect to realize additional savings in applicable expenses over time as the initiatives increasingly take hold. As part of these cost-saving measures, we have outsourced part of our information technology services to third party providers in India and are implementing additional offshore outsourcing initiatives intended to achieve significant reductions in certain SG&A expenses relating to our Data Business segment and information technology services. These measures should also help us control portions of our payroll and benefits costs (discussed below).               Payroll and Benefits.               Payroll and benefits expenses consist of payroll and benefits including any other types of compensation benefits as well as human resources and administrative functions.              Payroll and benefits expenses for fiscal 2006 were $15,600,177 as compared to $14,688,004 for fiscal 2005, an increase of $912,173, or 6%, and $11,021,138 for fiscal 2004. Payroll and benefits expenses in 2005 increased by $3,666,866, or 33%, over 2004. As a percentage of net revenues, payroll and benefits expenses were approximately 13% in fiscal 2006 and 16% in fiscal 2005 and 2004.              The increase in costs from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 relating to payroll and benefits was due in large part to the following factors: the acquisition of CinemasOnline in the fourth quarter of 2005 added $746,298 of additional payroll costs to fiscal year 2006; recorded $787,513 in additional share-based compensation (see Accounting for Share Based compensation); our growing ticket volume on Broadway.com in fiscal 2006 required increases in technology and customer service personnel resources. These were offset by decreases associated with outsourcing of information technology to India.              The payroll costs increase from 2004 to fiscal 2005 was due in large part to the following factors: addition of new staff in certain departments including the MIS and Ad Sales departments; approximately $883,000 in expenses for executive bonuses; $750,000 in non-cash expenses related to employee stock compensation; and discretionary and/or contractual compensation increases granted to various personnel. Our growing ticket volume on Broadway.com in fiscal 2005 required temporary increases in technology and customer service personnel resources until our new ticketing system launches.    29                      See the discussion of cost-savings measures described above under Selling, general and administrative which includes descriptions of initiatives that we expect to help control costs included in Payroll and Benefits, including outsourcing and other system efficiencies.    Depreciation and Amortization               Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of property and equipment, furniture and fixtures, web site development, leasehold improvements, equipment under capital leases and amortization of goodwill and intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense was $1,879,405 for fiscal 2006 as compared to $1,468,334 for fiscal 2005 and $1,579,201 for fiscal 2004. Depreciation and amortization increased $411,071 or 28% in fiscal 2006 compared to a decrease of $110,867, or 7%, in fiscal 2005. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to the CinemasOnline acquisition. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 is primarily due to certain tangible assets becoming fully amortized.    Interest, net               Interest, net was $1,788,241 for fiscal 2006 as compared to $546,171 for fiscal 2005, and $2,608,776 for fiscal 2004. The increase of $1,242,070 or 227% in interest, net in 2006 as compared to 2005 was primarily attributable to the issuance of $7,000,000 in senior unsecured notes on November 23, 2005, resulting in higher interest expense in 2006. The decrease of $2,062,605, or 79%, in interest, net in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to a $4.7 million decrease in outstanding principal of Convertible Debentures which converted into common stock in 2004, resulting in lower interest expense in 2005 (due to the reduced amount of Debentures outstanding), and which conversion also resulted in increased interest charges in 2004 due to associated amortization relating to the converted Debentures. For fiscal 2004, $2,299,846 was recorded in interest expense for the amortization of the deferred finance costs, beneficial conversion and discount relating to the Debentures.    Change in derivative liability               Change in derivative liability was a positive amount of $640,536 for fiscal 2006 as compared to a positive amount of $87,037 for fiscal 2005, and $0 for fiscal 2004. The increase in gain of $553,499 or 636% in change in derivative liability in fiscal 2006 over fiscal 2005 and the increase of $87,037 or 100% was due to a decrease in the fair value of the derivative, resulting from a reduction in the Companys share price.      Net Income (Loss)               Hollywood Medias net income for fiscal 2006 was $9,522,513 as compared to a net loss for fiscal 2005 of $8,913,182 and a net loss of $11,597,799 for fiscal 2004. The net income increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 by $18,435,695, primarily due to the gain on sale of Baseline/SSI and growth in our Broadway Ticketing and Ad Sales segments, offset by decreasing operating income in our Intellectual Properties segment. The net loss decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 by $2,684,617, or 23%, due primarily to our 2005 revenue growth of $22,635,772 and a $2,058,240 decrease in interest expense in 2005 (described above), offset by a $21,569,424 increase in operating expenses (discussed above) including SG&A and Payroll and Benefits expense increases.    30            LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES               Hollywood Medias cash and cash equivalents were $27,448,649 at December 31, 2006 as compared to $6,926,313 at December 31, 2005 an increase of $20,522,336 due primarily to the cash proceeds received from Hollywood Medias sale of its Baseline/StudioSystems business unit in August 2006. Our net working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $16,380,362 at December 31, 2006 as compared to a deficit of $3,396,040 at December 31, 2005. In addition, Hollywood Media has $2.8 million in escrow, net of costs, which are expected to be collected in August of 2007.              Net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations was $4,042,744 during 2006, which cash usage included, among other things, $1,642,848 to purchase Broadway ticketing inventory held for sale during 2006 and $2,055,919 of cash outlays for financial and internal control audit and consulting fees relating to the 2006 and 2005 audit. This compared to $5,446,101 of net cash used during 2005, which cash usage included, among other things, an increase in Broadway ticketing inventory held for sale of $725,034 and $2,738,747 in cash outlays for financial and internal control audit and consulting fees relating to our 2005 and 2004 audits. Net cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations was $23,732,662 during 2006, which net cash included $1,188,320 used for capital expenditures. This compared to $4,617,664 of net cash used in investing activities during 2005, which net cash included, among other things, $3,647,437 used for the CinemasOnline acquisition and $970,227 used for capital expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $332,692 during 2006, which was comprised primarily of proceeds from exercise of stock options and warrants outstanding. This compared to $9,369,662 in net cash provided by financing activities during 2005, which was comprised primarily of $6,595,690 in proceeds from our sale of Senior Notes, net of issuance costs (as further described below), $2,128,124 in stock option and warrant exercise proceeds and $780,000 in cash proceeds from the issuance of shares to a consultant, and was partially offset by payments under capital lease obligations.    Sale of Baseline StudioSystems Business Unit to The New York Times Company               On August 25, 2006, Hollywood Media, entered into and simultaneously closed on a definitive stock purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with The New York Times Company, a New York corporation (The New York Times), pursuant to which The New York Times purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of Hollywood Medias wholly-owned subsidiary, Baseline Acquisitions Corp. (BAC), for a cash purchase price of $35,000,000. BAC was the subsidiary of Hollywood Media which owned Hollywood Medias Baseline business unit. Baseline constituted a portion of Hollywood Medias Data Business Division. This sale to The New York Times did not include the other components of Hollywood Medias Data Business (e.g., CinemaSource, EventSource and ExhibitorAds). $3.5 million dollars of the purchase price is being held in escrow for twelve months following the closing to cover potential indemnification claims by The New York Times under the terms of the Purchase Agreement. Hollywood Medias expenditures relating to the sale included approximately $1.5 million in fees and expenses payable to Hollywood Medias financial advisor, J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., and approximately $3.6 million in sale-related contractual bonuses payable under performance formulas in preexisting employment agreements with the two principal managers of Baseline. These managers are no longer employees of Hollywood Media and Hollywood Media has no further obligations under these employment agreements. For additional information about this transaction, see Note 4 Discontinued Operations in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K Report. The businesses sold in this transaction are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements.    2004 Private Placement               In February 2004, Hollywood Media completed a private placement of common stock, which included the issuance of 5,773,355 shares of common stock to investors and five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,732,006 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $2.84 per share. Hollywood Medias net cash proceeds from the private placement were approximately $15.1 million after deduction of expenses in connection with the transaction. Hollywood Media received $188,803 and $803,664 net of placement agent commission, from the exercise of a portion of these warrants during 2006 and 2005, respectively.    31            Senior Unsecured Notes Issued in 2005               On November 23, 2005, Hollywood Media issued and sold $7,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior Unsecured Notes (the Senior Notes) for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $7,000,000. The notes carry an 8% interest rate and an initial 12 month term, on which interest is payable in quarterly installments which commenced December 31, 2005. The principal is payable in cash or, at Hollywood Medias option, in shares of Hollywood Medias common stock valued on a per share basis at a 5% discount from the 20-day volume-weighted average market price per share of the common stock (VWAP) as of the payment date, subject to certain conditions to such option including but not limited to the requirement that the shares be registered for resale. Hollywood Medias proceeds related to the issuance, net of issuance costs, was $6,595,690. The holders of the Senior Notes also received warrants to purchase 700,000 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock at an exercise price of $4.29 per share. In March 2006, Hollywood Media exercised its option under the terms of the Senior Notes, to extend the maturity date of the Senior Notes to May 23, 2007 in exchange for the delivery of additional five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock with exercise price per share of $4.29. The Senior Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders.    Conversion of the Convertible Debenture due May 22, 2006               On May 22, 2006, the remaining $1,000,000 principal amount of the 6% Senior Convertible Debentures due May 22, 2006 was converted into shares of Hollywood Medias common stock at a conversion price of $3.20 per share. As a result of such conversion, at December 31, 2006, there is no remaining obligation under this convertible debenture.    Outlook               The increase in cash and cash equivalents during 2006 provided additional capital, a portion of which we are utilizing for our business activities. The growth of our businesses, including our data syndication, ticketing and Ad Sales operations has required substantial financing, and may require additional capital to fund our growth plans and for working capital, which capital requirements we contemplate will be satisfied from our cash and cash equivalents on hand. Based on our current plans and assumptions for operations and investment and financing activities, we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and investment requirements at least through December 31, 2007. If our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek further financing or curtail our growth and/or operations. We believe that our long-term financial success ultimately depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to offset operating expenses.             While we expect growth in Hollywood Medias major business units in the year ahead and plan to continue to develop these businesses, we are also exploring a number of scenarios that may help us to realize the full value of our assets in the interest of our shareholders. As stated in our press release issued on March 13, 2007, we believe Hollywood Medias prospects remain strong and that we are making the necessary investments and strategic add-ons to position Hollywood Media for profitability and success. While we continue developing our businesses, we are also working with JPMorgan as our financial advisor to actively consider opportunities for our businesses, including potential dispositions. As a result of this ongoing process, Hollywood Media currently is precluded from implementing certain alternatives for returning cash to shareholders which had been under consideration by our Board of Directors. When this process is concluded, the Board intends to resume consideration of alternatives for returning cash to shareholders if deemed appropriate under the circumstances. We cannot make assurances as to the timing or occurrence of any such events.             On February 1, 2007, Hollywood Medias wholly-owned subsidiary, Theatre Direct NY, Inc., invested approximately $2.6 million in cash to consummate its acquisition of the Broadway ticketing business of Showtix LLC.              Our capital expenditures during 2006 (excluding discontinued operations) were $1,183,320. We currently anticipate additional capital expenditures in 2007 to be approximately $1.4 million for various systems and equipment upgrades. These anticipated 2007 capital expenditures do not include any estimates for potential business acquisitions.    Contractual Obligations               The following table sets forth information regarding certain types of our contractual obligations specified below as of December 31, 2006, in accordance with SEC rules requiring this disclosure.    32                                                                                                                                      Payments Due by Period           Contractual                             Less than              Years              Years              After           Obligations         Total              1 Year              1-3              4-5              5 Years              Senior unsecured notes (1)         $    7,000,000              $    7,000,000              $                  $                  $               Capital lease obligations (2)              120,039                   71,589                   48,450                                                 Operating lease obligations (3)              2,317,644                   1,050,642                   1,258,004                   8,998                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Total contractual obligations         $    9,437,683              $    8,122,231              $    1,306,454              $    8,998              $                                                                                                                          (1)         Senior unsecured notes due May 23, 2007 exclusive of interest.           (2)         Capital lease obligations are future lease payments under capital leases inclusive of interest.           (3)         Operating lease obligations include leases pertaining to various leased offices and facilities and those classified as operating leases for financial statement purposes. Certain leases provide for payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance, insurance, and certain other expenses. Lease terms expire at various dates through the year 2011. Also, certain equipment used in Hollywood Medias operations is leased under operating leases.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements               At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 of SEC Regulation S-K. As such, management believes that we currently do not have any disclosures to make of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 regarding off-balance sheet arrangements.    Critical Accounting Policies               In response to the SECs Release Number 33-8040 Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies and SEC Release Number 33-8056, Commission Statement about Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to asset impairment, accruals for compensation and related benefits, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, and contingencies and litigation. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For additional information about our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.               Allowance for Doubtful Accounts               Hollywood Media maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Companys accounting for doubtful accounts includes an element of uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectibility of these accounts. When preparing these estimates, management considers a number of factors, including the aging of a customers account, past transactions with customers, creditworthiness of specific customers, historical trends and other information. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,198,370 and $1,756,254 at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Although the Company believes its allowance is sufficient, if the financial condition of a     33           number of the Companys customers were to unexpectedly deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base and their geographic dispersion.               Ticketing Revenue Recognition               Ticketing revenue is derived from the sale of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and Londons West End shows to individuals, groups, travel agencies, tour groups and educational facilities. Revenue recognition is deferred on ticket sales until performance has taken place. Ticketing revenue and cost of revenue are recorded on a gross basis.              Gift certificate revenue is derived from the sale of gift certificates, with a one-year expiration period, for Broadway, off-Broadway, London shows and Dinner and Show sales to individuals, groups, travel agencies, tour groups and corporate programs. Proceeds from these sales are included in Deferred revenue in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue during the period the performance of the show occurs, or upon expiration of the gift certificate.              Hotel package revenue is derived from the sale of exclusive allocation rooms provided by New York City hotels to individuals and groups. Proceeds from these sales are recorded on a net basis and are included in Customer Deposits in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue on the day of departure from hotel.              Dinner voucher revenue is derived from the sale of dinner vouchers for meals at upscale restaurants in New York City to individuals and groups. Proceeds from these sales are recorded on a net basis and are included in Customer Deposits in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue on the date the voucher is presented, or upon expiration of the voucher.              In August 2002, the FASB Emerging Issue Task Force issued EITF Issue No. 02-16 ,  Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor   (EITF 02-16), which addresses the accounting by a vendor for consideration given to a customer, including both a reseller of the vendors products and a entity that purchases the vendors products from a reseller. For additional information about revenue recognition for ticketing, see Notes 2 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K report.               Self-Insurance Accruals               Hollywood Media maintains self-insured retentions for its health benefits programs and limits its exposure by maintaining stop-loss and aggregate liability coverage. The estimate of the Companys self-insurance liability contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. When estimating the Companys self-insurance liability, management considers a number of factors, which include historical claim experience. The self-insurance program was initiated in June 2004. Management recorded the potential liability under the stop-loss insurance coverage using incurred but not reported analyses provided by Hollywood Medias broker. The analyses used historical claims experience data available under the current self-insurance plan, which was then analyzed by the brokers underwriters. The Company had $124,255 and $143,328 accrued for potential claims at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The insurance expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $590,801, $453,467 and $435,636, respectively, and is included in payroll and benefits in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.     34                       Stock Based Compensation               As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transaction and Disclosure  an amendment of FAS 123 (SFAS No. 148), which amended Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), we chose to account for our Stock Plan under the intrinsic value method as allowed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25) and related interpretations through December 31, 2005. Under APB No. 25, because the exercise price of our employee stock options typically equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is typically recorded upon grant (except as discussed in Note 17  Supplemental Disclosure of Non-cash Investing and Financial Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K). SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of our employee stock options granted and pro forma financial information assuming compensation expense was recorded using these fair values. Determining the fair value of stock options requires the Company to make assumptions regarding the key variables of a stock option pricing model which includes expected volatility, estimated life and dividend yield. These estimates are sensitive to changes in several factors including market conditions.              In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaces SFAS No. 123 and supercedes APB No. 25. SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In March 2005, the Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) which expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the application of SFAS No. 123R. SAB 107 provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the SEC staffs views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. In April 2005, the Commission amended compliance dates for SFAS No. 123R to allow companies to implement SFAS No. 123R at the beginning of their next fiscal year, instead of the next fiscal reporting period that began after June 15, 2005. The Company was required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006, at which time the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition. The proforma effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the Black-Scholes pricing model on diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 is disclosed in Note 2 under the caption, Stock Based Compensation. The Company has adopted the provisions of the statement as of January 1, 2006. Application of the standard may have a material impact on the results of operations in future periods.               Impairment of Long-Lived Assets               Effective December 31, 2001, Hollywood Media adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). SFAS No. 144 superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of (SFAS No. 121) and the accounting and reporting provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations  Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, (APB No. 30) for the disposal of a segment of a business. Consistent with SFAS No. 121, SFAS No. 144 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount.              We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them annually as of October 1. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. We determined fair value as the net present value of future cash flows. Based on these evaluations, there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets during the years ended 2006, 2005, or 2004 other than the     35        asset write downs discussed in Note 9  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.              In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001 are no longer subject to amortization. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to June 30, 2001 ceased to be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, SFAS 142 changed the way we evaluated goodwill and intangibles for impairment. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized; however, they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test. The fair value based test is a two-step test. The first step involved comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we are required to proceed to the second step. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets (including unrecognized intangibles) and liabilities of the reporting unit, with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value.              As prescribed by SFAS No. 142, we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of the year ended December 31, 2002 which did not result in an impairment charge. Additionally, Hollywood Media established October 1, as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets. As of December 31, 2006, we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of Hollywood Medias goodwill for impairment. Future changes in estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including revenue projections or market values could cause the analysis to indicate that Hollywood Medias goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write-off of a portion or all of the goodwill. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease would not result in the impairment of goodwill of any reporting unit.    Inflation and Seasonality               Although we cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation, we do not believe inflation has a material effect on revenue or results of operations. We consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our Tekno Books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi-annually. The Broadway Ticketing Business is also effected by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the Tony Awards ©  and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holiday period. In addition, although not seasonal, our Intellectual Properties division and NetCo Partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams, earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements. The recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis.       Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK .               Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in our assets or liabilities that might occur due to changes in market rates and prices, such as interest or foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other relevant market rate or price changes.              Interest rates charged on Hollywood Medias debt instruments are primarily fixed in nature. We therefore do not believe that the risk of loss relating to the effect of changes in market interest rates is material.    36                      We have investments in subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and sell our services into this foreign market. Our foreign net asset/exposures (defined as assets denominated in foreign currency less liabilities denominated in foreign currency) for the United Kingdom at December 31, 2006 of U.S. dollar equivalents was $(238,570).              Our United Kingdom subsidiaries sell services and pay for products and services in British pounds. A decrease in the British foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely impact our margins. An assumed 10% depreciation of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of 2006 (i.e., in addition to actual exchange experience) would have resulted in a translation reduction of our revenue by $644,299 for 2006.              As the assets, liabilities and transactions of our United Kingdom subsidiaries are denominated in British pounds, the results and financial condition are subject to translation adjustments upon their conversion into U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes. A 10% decline in this foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of 2006 (i.e., in addition to actual exchange experience) would have resulted in a translation reduction of our net income by $24,121 for 2006.              We purchase and sell live theater tickets to shows in Londons West End. We minimize our exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates by taking steps to reduce the time lag between the purchase and payment of tickets for the London shows and the collection of related sales proceeds. We do not believe the risk of loss relating to adverse changes in currency exchange rates to be material.        Item 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA .
