Item 7.  Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation .         The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Hollywood Medias Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.   Overview          Hollywood Media is a provider of information, data, news and other content, and ticketing to consumers and businesses covering the entertainment, Internet and media industries. We own and operate a number of business units focused on the entertainment and media industries. Hollywood Media derives a diverse stream of revenues from this array of business units, including revenue from individual and group Broadway ticket sales, data syndication, subscription fees, content licensing fees, advertising, and book development license fees and royalties. Our Data Business includes CinemaSource, EventSource, ExhibitorAds and Baseline/StudioSystems. Our Broadway Ticketing business includes Broadway.com, 1-800-Broadway and Theatre.com. These services supply media outlets with specific information on entertainment events, such as movies, live theater and concerts, and sell tickets for live theater. Hollywood Medias businesses also include an intellectual property business, as well as Hollywood.com and a minority interest in MovieTickets.com. In addition, Hollywood Media owns and operates the cable television network, Hollywood.com Television.   Acquisitions since 1998          Since 1998, we have significantly expanded our business through acquisitions of other entertainment-related businesses and the development of strategic relationships with media companies, including the items listed below. These changes to our business have affected our results of operations and financial condition.                       On May 18, 1999, we purchased substantially all of the assets of CinemaSource, Inc., a business to business company that licenses movie showtimes and other movie-related information to newspaper companies, Internet companies, wireless businesses and others.                           On May 20, 1999, we acquired the capital stock of hollywood.com, Inc. which owns Hollywood.com.                           On August 31, 1999, we purchased substantially all of the motion picture-related data assets of Paul Kagan Associates, Inc., including Baseline, a movie and television database website, and several movie-related professional publications.                           Effective January 3, 2000, we completed agreements with CBS providing for the issuance to CBS of 6,672,031 shares of our common stock in exchange for $100 million of stated value of CBS advertising, promotion and content over seven years across its full range of media properties, valued at $130 million, and $5.3 million in cash. On March 28, 2000, CBS exercised a warrant to acquire 1,178,892 shares of our common stock by delivering $5.5 million in cash plus $5.5 million in additional CBS advertising. In August 2002, these agreements were terminated and such shares were reacquired by Hollywood Media pursuant to an Exchange Agreement with Viacom, resulting in the recording of a $57,274,680 impairment loss. See Amortization of CBS Advertising and Impairment Loss Related to CBS Advertising below.                           On May 1, 2000, we launched Broadway.com and we acquired substantially all the assets of BroadwayTheater.com, Inc. which sold theater tickets online predominately for Broadway, off-Broadway and Londons West End. We simultaneously consolidated BroadwayTheater.com into Broadway.com.                           Effective September 15, 2000, we acquired Theatre Direct NY Inc., d/b/a Theatre Direct International (TDI), a ticketing wholesaler of Broadway, off-Broadway and London theater tickets to businesses, including travel agencies and tour operators, groups, individuals, and educational institutions.      21                                    On July 27, 2001, we acquired the assets of Always Independent Entertainment Corp. (AlwaysI), which offers independent films to subscribers over the Internet and licenses films to third parties.                           On October 19, 2001, we acquired 1-800-BROADWAY which we use to sell Broadway tickets by phone and as a complement to the sale of Broadway tickets on our Broadway.com website.                           On January 14, 2002, Fountainhead Media Services acquired a 20% equity interest in Baseline, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Hollywood Media. Consideration consisted of a $2 million promissory note payable to Hollywood Media and the contribution by Fountainhead Media of its FilmTracker database, intellectual property rights, all existing contracts and content management system with a stated value of $2 million. Our Baseline service was integrated with FilmTracker, resulting in a combined service incorporating Baselines data with FilmTrackers content management system and interface. On January 7, 2004, we exchanged the $2 million promissory note for the 20% equity interest owned by Fountainhead, and we now own 100% of our subsidiary that owns Baseline.                           In January 2002, we launched ExhibitorAds as an expansion of the CinemaSource operations. ExhibitorAds leverages the movie theater showtimes from the CinemaSource data collection systems and our relationship with various exhibitors creating exhibitor paid ads for insertion in newspapers around the country.                           In July 2002 we launched two new digital cable television channels, Totally Hollywood TV and Totally Broadway TV, which we renamed Hollywood.com Television and Broadway.com Television in 2004. The digital cable TV networks provide on-demand video content and on some cable systems up-to-date showtimes for the latest box office movies and current Broadway shows.                           On August 28, 2002, Hollywood Media Corp. entered into an Exchange Agreement with Viacom Inc. pursuant to which Viacom re-conveyed to Hollywood Media an aggregate of 8,614,687 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock, and warrants held by Viacom to purchase 262,973 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock were cancelled. Under the Exchange Agreement, Viacom also paid Hollywood Media $2.0 million in cash, and Hollywood Media retained $5.0 million in non-cash advertising and promotion across CBS properties for use through December 31, 2003. This Exchange Agreement terminated various agreements with CBS, completed in January 3, 2000 as detailed above.                           On July 1, 2004 , Hollywood Media consummated our acquisition by merger of 100% of the outstanding common stock of Studio Systems, Inc. (SSI), one of the leading entertainment industry database and information service providers. As a result of the acquisition, SSI became a subsidiary of Hollywood Media and its business was integrated with our Baseline/FilmTracker subsidiary now known as Baseline/StudioSystems.                           On November 23, 2005 Hollywood Media consummated our acquisition of 100% of the outstanding common stock of the U.K. based CinemasOnline, a group of advertising sales and data services companies focused primarily on selling advertising on cinema and live theatre websites in the U.K. and Ireland. CinemasOnline became a subsidiary of CinemaSource UK Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hollywood Media.      22                RESULTS OF OPERATIONS           Year ended December 31, 2005 (fiscal 2005) as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 (fiscal 2004) and year ended December 31, 2003 (fiscal 2003).

net revenues for fiscal 2005 were $95,614,439 compared to $72,978,667 and $64,858,962 for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenues increased $22,635,772, or 31%, in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004   24       and increased $8,119,705, or 13%, in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003. The increase in net revenues for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 is primarily the result of increases in Broadway ticketing revenue of $19,200,747, Data Business revenue of $2,628,158 and Internet Ad Sales revenue of $1,698,755 offset in part by a decrease in Intellectual Properties revenue of $932,722. We recorded approximately $15,000 in barter revenue in fiscal 2005, and none for 2004 or 2003. In fiscal 2005, net revenues were derived 82% from Broadway Ticketing, 11% from Data Business, 5% from Internet Ad Sales and 2% from Intellectual Properties. In fiscal 2004, Broadway Ticketing represented 82% of all net revenues, Data Business represented 11%, Internet Ad Sales represented 4% and Intellectual Properties represented 3%. In fiscal 2003, Broadway Ticketing represented 81% of all revenues, Data Business represented 11%, Internet Ad Sales represented 4% and Intellectual Properties represented 4%.         Broadway Ticketing net revenue for fiscal 2005 was $78,890,718 as compared to $59,689,971 for fiscal 2004, and $52,266,539 for fiscal 2003. Broadway Ticketing net revenue increased $19,200,747, or 32%, for fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 and increased $7,423,432, or 14%, for fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003. The increase in Broadway Ticketing net revenue in fiscal 2005 is the result of an increase in sales to consumers attributed primarily to the launch of the new Broadway.com website in November 2004, hotel package sales and changes in our marketing and advertising strategies as well as growth in tourism in New York City. Ticketing revenue is generated from the sales of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and Londons West End both online via Broadway.com and offline via 1-800-BROADWAY to domestic and international travel professionals, traveling consumers and New York area theater patrons. Ticketing revenue is recognized on the date of performance of the show. Ticket revenue received for performances yet to take place is recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet. For a discussion of adjustments made to 2005 ticketing revenue and cost of revenue-ticketing, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K report.        Data Business net revenue (which includes CinemaSource, EventSource, ExhibitorAds and Baseline/StudioSystems) was $10,618,631 for fiscal 2005 compared to $7,990,473 for fiscal 2004, and $6,940,971 for fiscal 2003. Data Business net revenue increased $2,628,158, or 33%, for fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 and $1,049,502, or 15%, for fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003. The increase in Data Business revenue from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 is attributable primarily to the July 2004 acquisition of Studio Systems, Inc. and an increase in revenues from our Source and Baseline businesses due to internal growth in customers and increased sales to existing customers. The increase in Data Business revenue in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 is largely attributable to the July 2004 acquisition of Studio Systems, Inc., offsetting a decrease in EventSource revenues resulting from a reduction in the level of event coverage in some smaller geographical markets. Barter transactions included in the Data Business revenues were approximately $15,000 in fiscal 2005 and $0 for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively. Hollywood Media received consulting and promotional items in exchange for database licenses.        Revenue for CinemaSource and EventSource is generated by the licensing of movie, event and theater showtimes and other information to other media outlets and Internet companies including newspapers such as  The New York Times,  Internet companies including AOLs Moviefone and Digital City, MSN, Yahoo!, Google, and Lycos, and wireless providers. Revenue for ExhibitorAds is generated by creating exhibitor paid directory ads for insertion in newspapers. Baseline/StudioSystems is a film and television database, licensing its data to customers including businesses and professionals in the entertainment industry and generates revenues from subscriptions as well as syndication of its data.        Internet Ad Sales net revenue was $4,513,676 for fiscal 2005 as compared to $2,814,921 for fiscal 2004 and $2,812,173 for fiscal 2003. Internet Ad Sales net revenue increased $1,698,755, or 60%, for fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 and remained essentially unchanged in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in Internet Ad Sales from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 is primarily due to increased ad sales on Hollywood.com and Broadway.com websites and increased commissions from advertising on MovieTickets.com, as well as the acquisition of UK-based CinemasOnline. Internet Ad Sales revenue is generated from the sale of advertisements and sponsorships on Hollywood.com and Broadway.com. as well as advertisements generated by CinemasOnline. Hollywood Media also earns commissions on ad sales which Hollywood Media sells for placement on MovieTickets.com.   25             Intellectual Properties revenues were $1,550,580 for fiscal 2005, compared to $2,483,302 for fiscal 2004 and $2,836,279 for fiscal 2003. Net revenues generated from Intellectual Properties decreased $932,722, or 38%, in fiscal 2005 from fiscal 2004 and decreased $352,977, or 12%, in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003. The decrease in revenues from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was attributable to fewer manuscripts delivered in 2005 as well as the sluggishness of the publishing industry. The decrease in fiscal 2004 is attributed to a series of six books ( Left Behind ), five of which were completed, delivered and accounted for in fiscal 2003, and the sixth and last book of the series was completed, delivered and accounted for in fiscal 2004. The Intellectual Properties division generates revenues from several different activities including book development and licensing, and intellectual property licensing. Revenues vary quarter to quarter depending on the timing of delivery of manuscripts to the publishers. Revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete and ultimate collection of such revenues is no longer subject to contingencies. This division does not include NetCo Partners, which is reported separately; see Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees below.   Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees     Equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees consists of the following:                                                                                      As of December 31,                     2005              2004              2003              NetCo Partners (a)         $    533,228              $    576,317              $    957,681           MovieTickets.com (b)                                                                                                                             $    533,228              $    576,317              $    957,681                                                                      (a) NetCo Partners        NetCo Partners owns  Tom Clancys NetForce  and is primarily engaged in the development and licensing of  Tom Clancys NetForce . NetCo Partners recognizes revenues when the earnings process has been completed based on the terms of the various agreements, generally upon the delivery of the manuscript to the publisher and at the point where ultimate collection is substantially assured. When advances are received prior to completion of the earnings process, NetCo Partners defers recognition of revenue until the earnings process has been completed. Hollywood Media owns 50% of NetCo Partners and accounts for its investment under the equity method. Hollywood Medias 50% share of earnings of NetCo Partners was $533,228 for fiscal 2005 a decrease of 7% or $43,089 as compared to $576,317 for fiscal 2004. Our 50% share of earnings was $957,681 for fiscal 2003. Revenues decreased for fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to a per book payment decrease for NetForce  books numbers 9 and 10 delivered to the North American publisher in fiscal 2004. Revenues vary year to year dependent on the timing of deliveries of manuscripts to the publisher. Costs related to the acquisition, development and sales of the intellectual properties and their licensed products are expensed in proportion to the revenues that have been recognized.        (b) MovieTickets.com, Inc.        Hollywood Media entered into a joint venture agreement on February 29, 2000 with the movie theater chains AMC Entertainment Inc. (AMC) and National Amusements, Inc. to form MovieTickets.com, Inc. (MovieTickets.com). Effective August 2000, the joint venture entered into an agreement with Viacom Inc. to acquire a five percent interest in the joint venture for $25 million of advertising over five years. In addition to the Viacom advertising and promotion, MovieTickets.com is promoted through on-screen advertising in most participating exhibitors movie screens. In March 2001, America Online, Inc. (AOL) purchased a non-interest bearing convertible preferred voting equity interest in MovieTickets.com for $8.5 million in cash. AOL converted its preferred stock into common stock in 2005.   26             Hollywood Media owns 26.2% of the equity in MovieTickets.com, Inc. at December 31, 2005, and shares in 26.2% of the income or losses generated by the joint venture. This investment is recorded under the equity method of accounting, recognizing 26.2% of MovieTickets.com income or loss as equity in earnings of investees. Since the investment has been reduced to approximately zero, Hollywood Media is currently not providing for additional losses, if any, generated by MovieTickets.com as Hollywood Media had not committed to fund future losses, if any, generated by MovieTickets.com. Hollywood Media has recorded no income or losses for its investment in MovieTickets.com for fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003.        MovieTickets.com is a leading destination for the purchase of movie tickets through the Internet. Hollywood Media launched the MovieTickets.com website in May 2000 with several major movie theater exhibitors. The MovieTickets.com website allows users to purchase movie tickets and retrieve them at will call windows or kiosks at theaters or the user can print at home for theatres with that capacity. The website generates revenues from service fees charged to users for the purchase of tickets and the sale of advertising. Service fees on ticket sales were introduced in November 2000. MovieTickets.coms participating exhibitors operate theaters located in all of the top twenty markets and approximately 70% of the top 50 and top 100 markets in the United States and Canada and represent approximately 50% of the top 50 and top 100 grossing theaters in North America. Additionally, MovieTickets.com operates in the United Kingdom. See Item 1  Business, and Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about MovieTickets.com.   Operating Expenses           Cost of Revenues  Ticketing.  Cost of revenues  ticketing was $67,515,534 for fiscal 2005 compared to $51,781,133 for fiscal 2004 and $44,850,254 for fiscal 2003. Cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of tickets and credit card fees for the Broadway Ticketing segment. As a percentage of ticketing revenues, cost of revenues  ticketing was 86%, 87% and 86% for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The reduction in cost of revenue as a percentage of ticketing revenue in 2005, as compared to 2004, was due in part to a greater proportion of higher margin consumer ticket sales and an increase in sellables (e.g., insurance, restaurant vouchers). The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of ticketing revenue in 2004, as compared to 2003, was due in part to the change in the mix of ticket sales.         Editorial, Production, Development and Technology.  Editorial, production, development and technology costs consist of payroll and related expenses for the editorial and production staff responsible for creating content on the companys websites for our Internet Ad Sales and Data Business segments. Internet access and computer related expenses for the support and delivery of each divisions services and fees, and royalties paid to authors and co-editors for the Intellectual Properties segments, are also included. Editorial, production, development and technology expense for fiscal year 2005 was $5,885,429 compared to $5,137,458 for fiscal 2004 and $5,347,062 for fiscal 2003. As of percentage of our other (non-ticketing) revenues, these costs were 35%, 39% and 42% for fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 decrease in Editorial, Production, Development and Technology as a percentage of revenue is due in part to the relatively lower incremental costs associated with the increased 2005 revenues in the Data Business segment slightly offset by the increase in the cost of sales for the Internet Ad Sales segment due to the acquisition of CinemasOnline which has a higher cost of sales.         Selling, General and Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses consist of occupancy costs, production costs, professional and consulting service fees, telecommunications costs, provision for doubtful accounts receivable, general insurance costs, selling and marketing costs (such as advertising, marketing, promotional, business development, public relations, and commissions due to advertising agencies, advertising representative firms and other parties). Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2005 were $12,198,054 as compared to $11,476,024 and $7,932,293 for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $772,030 or 6% in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004, due in large part to increased advertising expense in the Broadway Ticketing and Internet Ad Sales divisions and increased expenses in consulting and auditing fees primarily relating to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $3,543,731, or 45%,   27       in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 due in large part to expenses relating to the 2004 settlement of the Water Garden lease litigation case, increased consulting and auditing fees primarily relating to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 which was new in 2004 (our first assessment report), along with increased costs relating to the acquisition of Studio Systems in 2004, and an increase in advertising expense in the Broadway Ticketing and Internet Ad Sales divisions. As a percentage of net revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 13% for fiscal 2005 from 16% for fiscal 2004 and was 12% for fiscal 2003. Barter expense included in selling, general and administrative expense was approximately $15,000 for fiscal year 2005 and $0 in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003.         We have partially implemented and are in the process of developing and implementing additional efficiency improvements and cost-savings measures anticipated to reduce various elements of SG&A expenses, including certain overhead reductions, the installation of a new accounting system, and the installation of a new, more robust Broadway ticketing software system to streamline our ticketing functionality and improve efficiencies. These various cost-saving measures are being incrementally implemented during 2006 and we expect to realize additional savings in applicable expenses over time as the initiatives increasingly take hold. As part of these cost-saving measures, we have outsourced part of our information technology services to India and are beginning the implementation phase of additional offshore outsourcing initiatives intended to achieve significant reductions in certain SG&A expenses relating to our Data Business segment and information technology services. These measures should also help us control portions of our payroll and benefits costs (discussed below).   Payroll and Benefits.          Payroll and benefits expenses consist of payroll and benefits including any other types of compensation benefits as well as human resources and administrative functions.        Payroll and benefits expenses for fiscal 2005 were $16,485,885 as compared to $12,275,369 for fiscal 2004, an increase of $4,210,516, or 34%, and $10,774,386 for fiscal 2003. Payroll and benefits expenses in 2004 increased by $1,500,983, or 14%, over 2003. As a percentage of net revenues, payroll and benefits expenses were approximately 17% in each of fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003.        The increase in costs from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 relating to payroll and benefits was due in large part to the following factors: addition of new staff in certain departments including the MIS and Internet Ad Sales departments; approximately $883,000 in expenses for executive bonuses; $750,000 in non-cash expenses related to employee stock compensation; and discretionary and/or contractual compensation increases granted to various personnel. Our growing ticket volume on Broadway.com in fiscal 2005 required temporary increases in technology and customer service personnel resources until our new ticketing system under development is launched in 2006.        The payroll costs increase from 2003 to fiscal 2004 was due in part to additional resources hired in the MIS and Internet Ad Sales departments and the acquisition of Studio Systems, Inc. in July 2004.        See the discussion of cost-savings measures described above under Selling, general and administrative which includes descriptions of initiatives that we expect to help control costs included in Payroll and Benefits, including outsourcing and other system efficiencies.         Amortization of CBS Advertising and Impairment Loss Relating to CBS Advertising.  Amortization of CBS advertising relating to our agreements with Viacom was $0 for fiscal 2005 compared to $38,807 and $885,974 for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Under our agreements with Viacom, Hollywood Media issued shares of common stock and warrants in exchange for cash and CBSs advertising and promotional efforts over seven years across its full range of media properties. The fair value of the common stock and warrants issued to Viacom was recorded in the balance sheet as deferred advertising and amortized as the advertising is used each related contract year. Since June 30, 2004, unamortized deferred advertising has been zero.   28             On August 28, 2002, an Exchange Agreement (Exchange Agreement) was entered into among Hollywood Media, its wholly owned subsidiaries, hollywood.com, Inc. and Broadway.com, Inc., and Viacom Inc. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Viacom re-conveyed to Hollywood Media an aggregate of 8,614,687 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock, $.01 par value per share, and warrants held by Viacom to purchase 262,973 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock were cancelled. The common stock and warrants had a fair value of $10,656,657 at the time of the Exchange Agreement. Viacom also paid Hollywood Media $2.0 million in cash and Hollywood Media retained $5.0 million in non-cash advertising and promotion across CBS properties for use through December 31, 2003. Each of the Advertising and Promotion Agreement and Content License Agreement, dated as of January 3, 2000, between hollywood.com, Inc. and Viacom, including hollywood.com, Inc.s right to air additional advertising and promotion on CBS properties, was terminated. The remaining recorded value of the terminated advertising and promotion under the Advertising and Promotion Agreement and Content License Agreement at the time of the Exchange Agreement was $70,998,003 (representing approximately $49 million in stated actual advertising). Hollywood Media recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $58,341,346 in August 2002, the difference between the advertising cancelled and the fair value of the common stock and warrants returned by Viacom, plus the $2.0 million in cash paid by Viacom. In addition, during 2001 Viacom had prepaid to Hollywood Media, in cash, for advertising to be delivered in 2002 and 2003. At August 28, 2002, the value of the deferred advertising revenue remaining on Hollywood Medias balance sheet was $1,066,666. This balance reduced the impairment loss recorded. The aggregate impairment loss recorded in August 2002 was $57,274,680.   Depreciation and Amortization.          Depreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation of property and equipment, furniture and fixtures, web site development, leasehold improvements, equipment under capital leases and amortization of goodwill and intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense was $2,414,413 for fiscal 2005 as compared to $2,221,100 and $2,624,729 for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depreciation and amortization increased $193,313, or 9%, in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and decreased $403,629, or 15%, in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 is primarily due to additions of computers and software in the equipment category. The decrease from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to certain tangible assets becoming fully amortized.   Interest, net          Interest, net was $552,841 for fiscal 2005, as compared to $2,611,081 and $1,442,707 for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease of $2,058,240, or 79%, in interest, net in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to a $4.7 million decrease in outstanding principal of Convertible Debentures which converted into common stock in 2004, resulting in lower interest expense in 2005 (due to the reduced amount of Debentures outstanding), and which conversion also resulted in increased interest charges in 2004 due to associated amortization relating to the converted Debentures. For fiscal 2004, $2,299,846 was recorded in interest expense for the amortization of the deferred finance costs, beneficial conversion and discount relating to the Debentures. The increase in interest, net, from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was due primarily to such increased amortization resulting from the early conversion of a portion of the convertible debentures in 2004.   Other, net          Other, net was $159,414 for fiscal 2005, as compared to $776,572 and $1,163,308 for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decrease of $617,158, or 79%, in other, net in fiscal 2005 over fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to a gain of $719,250 recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 upon termination of a put/call option in connection with a third partys surrender of its 20% equity interest in our subsidiary that owns Baseline. The decrease of $386,736, or 33%, in other, net in fiscal 2004 over fiscal 2003 was primarily because of the reduction in gain on a put-call option held by a former minority shareholder of Baseline was greater in 2004 than 2003 (See Note 4 to Hollywood Medias Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K).   29        Net Loss and Loss Per Share          Hollywood Medias net loss for fiscal 2005 was $8,913,182 as compared to a net loss of $11,597,799 and $7,441,687 for fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. The net loss decreased in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 by $2,684,617, or 23%, due primarily to our 2005 revenue growth of $22,635,772 and a $2,058,240 decrease in interest expense in 2005 (described above), offset by a $21,569,424 increase in operating expenses (discussed above) including SG&A and Payroll and Benefits expense increases. The net loss increased in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 by $4,156,112, or 56%, due primarily to increases in operating expenses including SG&A (resulting in part from 2004 being our first year of Sarbanes-Oxley internal control audit and consulting costs, as well as costs relating to the 2004 acquisition and integration of Studio Systems) and Payroll and Benefits expense increases. Net loss per basic and diluted share for fiscal 2005 was $0.28, a 33% decrease, as compared to a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.42 for fiscal 2004. The net loss per basic and diluted share for fiscal 2004 was $0.42 as compared to a net loss per basic and diluted share for 2003 of $0.36.   LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES          Hollywood Medias cash and cash equivalents were $7,058,017 at December 31, 2005 as compared to $6,330,394 at December 31, 2004, an increase of $727,623. Our net working capital deficit (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $3,929,668 at December 31, 2005 as compared to $1,951,662 at December 31, 2004.        Net cash used in operating activities was $3,952,944 during 2005, which cash usage included, among other things, an increase in Broadway ticketing inventory held for sale of $724,875 and $2,738,747 in cash outlays for financial and internal control audit and consulting fees relating to our 2005 and 2004 audits. This compared to $5,772,737 of net cash used in operating activities during 2004, which cash usage included, among other things, $907,617 to purchase Broadway ticketing inventory held for sale during 2004 and 2005, payment of $847,805 in settlement of the Water Garden litigation and $1,028,997 in cash outlays for financial and internal control audit and consulting fees relating to our 2004 audit. Net cash used in investing activities was $4,653,810 during 2005, which cash usage included, among other things, $3,647,437 used for the CinemasOnline acquisition and $1,123,360 used for capital expenditures. This compared to $5,608,216 of net cash used in investing activities during 2004, which cash usage included, among other things, an aggregate of $3,958,758 used for the Studio Systems acquisition, including escrow, and $1,431,037 used for capital expenditures. Net cash provided by financing activities was $9,334,377 during 2005, which was comprised primarily of $6,595,690 in proceeds from our sale of Senior Notes, net of issuance costs (as further described below), $2,128,124 in stock option and warrant exercise proceeds and $780,000 in cash proceeds from the issuance of shares to a consultant, and was partially offset by payments under capital leases obligations. This compares to $15,843,348 in net cash provided by financing activities during 2004, which was comprised primarily of net proceeds resulting from Hollywood Medias private placement of common stock during the first quarter of 2004 as further described below.   2004 Private Placement          In February 2004, Hollywood Media completed a private placement of common stock, which included the issuance of 5,773,355 shares of common stock to investors and five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,732,006 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $2.84 per share. Hollywood Media net cash proceeds from the private placement were approximately $15.1 million after deduction of expenses in connection with the transaction. Hollywood Media received approximately $803,664 net of placement agent commission, from the exercise of a portion of these warrants during 2005.   Senior Unsecured Notes Issued in 2005          On November 23, 2005, Hollywood Media issued and sold $7,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its Senior Unsecured Notes (the Senior Notes) for aggregate gross cash proceeds of $7,000,000. The notes carry an 8% interest rate and an initial 12 month term, on which interest is payable in quarterly installments   30       commencing December 31, 2005. The principal is payable in cash or, at Hollywood Medias option, in shares of Hollywood Medias common stock valued on a per share basis at a 5% discount from the 20-day volume-weighted average market price per share of the common stock (VWAP ) as of the payment date, subject to certain conditions to such option including but not limited to the requirement that the shares be registered for resale. Hollywood Medias proceeds related to the issuance, net of issuance costs, was $6,595,690. The holders of the Senior Notes also received warrants to purchase 700,000 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock at an exercise price of $4.29 per share. In March of 2006, Hollywood Media exercised its option under the terms of the Senior Notes, to extend the maturity date of the Senior Notes to May 23, 2007 in exchange for the delivery of additional five-year warrants to purchase an aggregate of 100,000 shares of Hollywood Medias common stock with exercise price per share at $4.29. The Senior Notes are not convertible at the option of the holders.    May 2002 Convertible Debentures          In May 2002, Hollywood Media issued an aggregate of $5.7 million in principal amount of 6% Senior Convertible Debentures due May 22, 2005 (the Debentures) to a group of investors upon payment of an aggregate $5.7 million cash investment from such investors. The investors included Mitchell Rubenstein, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Laurie S. Silvers, the Vice Chairman and President, of Hollywood Media, and they participated in this financing with a $500,000 cash investment upon the same terms as the other investors. The investors also received fully vested warrants (the Warrants) to acquire at any time through May 22, 2007 an aggregate of 576,590 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $3.78 per share. As a result of the above-referenced private placement of common stock in February 2004, the $3.46 per share conversion price of the Debentures was reduced to $3.30 per share, and the exercise price of the Warrants was reduced to $3.34 per share, after giving effect to the weighted average anti-dilution provisions of the Debentures and Warrants. The Debentures and Warrants contain customary anti-dilution provisions as more fully described in the agreements.        During August and September of 2004, $4.7 million principal amount of the Debentures was converted into shares of Hollywood Medias common stock at a conversion price of $3.05 per share, including the $500,000 principal amount of Debentures held by Hollywood Medias Chief Executive Officer and President. Prior to such conversions, the prevailing conversion price of the converted Debentures had been reduced from $3.30 per share to $3.05 per share pursuant to Hollywood Medias negotiations and agreements with the converting investors for the purpose of facilitating such conversions prior to maturity.        Following such conversions, the remaining Debenture still outstanding ($1,000,000 principal amount) was amended to extend the maturity date to May 22, 2006 and to remove restrictive covenants, and the conversion price of this Debenture was reduced from $3.30 per share to $3.20 per share. This outstanding Debenture is convertible at the option of the investor at any time through the maturity date into shares of common stock of Hollywood Media. Prior to conversion, the Debenture bears interest at 6% per annum, payable quarterly in cash or common stock. Hollywood Media can elect at its option to convert up to 50% of the Debenture at maturity, if the required conditions specified in the Debenture are satisfied.   Outlook          The growth of our businesses, including our data syndication, ticketing and Internet ad sales operations has required substantial financing and may require additional financing to fund our growth plans and for working capital. Based on our plans and assumptions for operations and investment and financing activities during 2006, we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, anticipated cash flow from operations, and potential amounts available if we undertake further equity or debt financing, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and investment requirements through the end of the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2006. If our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek further financing or curtail our growth and/or operations. We believe that our long-term financial success ultimately depends on our ability to generate enough revenue to offset operating expenses. To the extent we do not generate sufficient revenues to offset expenses we will require further financing to fund our ongoing operations.   31             In 2005, Hollywood Media invested approximately $3.9 million in cash, of which $0.1 million remains in escrow pending resolution of certain indemnification items, to consummate its acquisition of U.K. based CinemasOnline for integration with our Source Business and our Internet Ad Sales division.        We currently anticipate additional capital expenditures in 2006 to be approximately $1.8 million for various systems and equipment upgrades. These anticipated 2006 capital expenditures do not include any estimates for business acquisitions.        During 2005 we made cash outlays in connection with preparations for compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including $1.1 million for consulting expertise, and $0.4 million of increased audit expenses for the Section 404 review. At this time we are unable to accurately estimate the full amount of the costs that Hollywood Media will incur during 2006 in connection with our ongoing Section 404 compliance and internal control development efforts, however, such costs during 2006 are currently anticipated to include, in addition to the capital expenditures for new information systems referenced above, an additional $0.3 million for consulting expertise and $0.4 million for the Section 404 audit expenses. See Selling, General and Administrative above regarding our ongoing implementation of cost-saving measures including outsourcing.   Contractual Obligations          The following table sets forth information regarding some of our contractual obligations as specified as of December 31, 2005, in accordance with SEC rules requiring this disclosure.                                                                                                                             Payments Due by Period                Contractual                             Less than         Years         Years         After      Obligations         Total         1 Year         1-3         4-5         5 Years                                                                                          Short-term debt (1)              1,000,000                   1,000,000                                                                    Senior unsecured notes (2)              7,000,000                                      7,000,000                                                 Capital lease obligations (3)              178,003                   96,265                   77,735                   4,003                              Operating lease obligations (4)              3,501,932                   1,259,975                   2,008,917                   233,040                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Total contractual obligations              11,679,935                   2,356,240                   9,086,652                   237,043                                                                                                                                         (1)         Short-term debt of senior convertible debentures due May 22, 2006 exclusive of interest. The holder has the option to convert principal into common stock at an exercise price of $3.20 per share.           (2)         Senior unsecured notes due May 23, 2007 exclusive of interest.           (3)         Capital lease obligations are future lease payments under capital leases inclusive of interest.           (4)         Operating lease obligations include leases pertaining to various leased facilities and those classified as operating leases for financial statement purposes. Certain leases provide for payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance, insurance, and certain other expenses. Lease terms expire at various dates through the year 2010. Also, certain equipment used in Hollywood Medias operations is leased under operating leases.        Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements          At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 of SEC regulation S-K. As such, management believes that we currently do not have any disclosures to make of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 regarding off-balance sheet arrangements.   32        Critical Accounting Policies          In response to the SECs Release Number 33-8040 Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies and SEC Release Number 33-8056, Commission Statement about Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we will evaluate our estimates, including those related to asset impairment, accruals for compensation and related benefits, revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, and contingencies and litigation. These estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For a summary of all our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 3  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.        Allowance for Doubtful Accounts          Hollywood Media maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Companys accounting for doubtful accounts contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to assess the collectibility of these accounts. When preparing these estimates, management considers a number of factors, including the aging of a customers account, past transactions with customers, creditworthiness of specific customers, historical trends and other information. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $1,891,996 and $394,183 at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Although the Company believes its allowance is sufficient, if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to unexpectedly deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required that could materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the Companys customer base and their dispersion across many different geographical regions. The allowance for doubtful accounts increased primarily due to the acquisition of CinemasOnline.        Ticketing Revenue Recognition          Ticketing revenue is derived from the sale of live theater tickets for Broadway, off-Broadway and Londons West End shows to individuals, groups, travel agencies, tour groups and educational facilities. Revenue recognition is deferred on ticket sales until performance has taken place. Ticketing revenue and cost of revenue are recorded on a gross basis.        Gift certificate revenue is derived from the sale of gift certificates for Broadway, off-Broadway, London shows and Dinner and Show sales to individuals, groups, travel agencies, tour groups and corporate programs. Proceeds from these sales are included in Deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue in the period the performance of the show occurs.        Hotel package revenue is derived from the sale of exclusive allocation rooms provided by New York City hotels to individuals and groups. Proceeds from these sales are recorded on a net basis and are included in Deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue on the day of departure from hotel.        Dinner voucher revenue is derived from the sale of dinner vouchers for meals at upscale restaurants in New York City to individuals and groups. Proceeds from these sales are recorded on a net basis and are included in Deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, at the time of receipt, and are recognized as revenue on the date the voucher is presented, or upon expiration of the voucher.   33             In August 2002, the FASB Emerging Issue Task Force issued EITF Issue No. 02-16 ,  Accounting by a Reseller for Cash Consideration Received from a Vendor   (EITF 02-16), which addresses the accounting by a vendor for consideration given to a customer, including both a reseller of the vendors products and a entity that purchases the vendors products from a reseller. For additional information about revenue recognition for ticketing, see Notes 2 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K report.         Advertising Costs         Hollywood Media expenses the cost of advertising as incurred or when such advertising initially takes place. During 2000, Hollywood Media issued common stock and warrants to CBS with a fair value of approximately $137 million in exchange for approximately $105 million of advertising on CBS properties to be received over a period of seven years. Hollywood Media was entitled to utilize a specified portion of this advertising each contract year. The deferred advertising was carried on Hollywood Medias balance sheet as a deferred asset and was being amortized over the contract period as the advertising is utilized. Advertising expense recorded related to CBS advertising for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $0, $38,807 and $885,974, respectively, and is separately reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations under the caption Amortization of CBS advertising.        On August 28, 2002, Hollywood Media entered into an Exchange Agreement with Viacom which terminated various agreements with CBS. Refer to Amortization of CBS Advertising and Impairment Loss Relating to CBS Advertising above.         Self-Insurance Accruals         Hollywood Media maintains self-insured retentions for its health benefits programs and limits its exposure by maintaining stop-loss and aggregate liability coverage. The estimate of the Companys self-insurance liability contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the ultimate cost that will be incurred to settle reported claims and unreported claims for incidents incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date. When estimating the Companys self-insurance liability, management considers a number of factors, which include historical claim experience. The self-insurance program was initiated in June 2004. Management recorded the maximum amount of potential liability under the stop-loss insurance coverage due to the lack of historical claims experience data available under the current self-insurance plan. The former plan has 11 months remaining under the tail provision, which the Company currently has $54,867 accrued for potential residual claims.         Stock Based Compensation         As permitted under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation  Transaction and Disclosure  an amendment of FAS 123 (SFAS No. 148), which amended Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123), we have chosen to account for our Stock Plan under the intrinsic value method as allowed by Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB No. 25) and related interpretations. Under APB No. 25, because the exercise price of our employee stock options typically equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant, no compensation expense is typically recorded upon grant (except as discussed in Note 16  Supplemental Disclosure of Noncash Investing and Financial Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K). SFAS No. 148 requires disclosure of the estimated fair value of our employee stock options granted and pro forma financial information assuming compensation expense was recorded using these fair values. Determining the fair value of stock options requires the Company to make assumptions regarding the key variables of a stock option pricing model which includes expected volatility, estimated life and dividend yield. These estimates are sensitive to changes in several factors including market conditions.   34             In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R), which replaces SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation (SFAS No. 123) and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values and the recording of such expense in the consolidated statements of operations. In March 2005, the Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) which expresses views of the SEC staff regarding the application of SFAS No. 123R. SAB 107 provides interpretive guidance related to the interaction between SFAS No. 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as well as provides the SEC staffs views regarding the valuation of share-based payment arrangements for public companies. In April 2005, the Commission amended compliance dates for SFAS No. 123R to allow companies to implement SFAS No. 123R at the beginning of their next fiscal year, instead of the next fiscal reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R effective January 1, 2006, at which time the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 will no longer be an alternative to financial statement recognition. Under SFAS No. 123R, the Company must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The effect of expensing stock options under a fair value approach using the Black-Scholes pricing model on diluted earnings per common share for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is disclosed in Note 2 under the caption, Stock Based Compensation. The Company has adopted the provisions of the statement as of January 1, 2006. Adoption of the standard may have a material impact on the results of operations in future periods. However, the impact of adoption will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future.         Impairment of Long-Lived Assets         Effective December 31, 2001, Hollywood Media adopted SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets (SFAS No. 144). SFAS No. 144 superseded SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of (SFAS No. 121) and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB No. 30, Reporting the Results of Operations  Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions, (APB No. 30) for the disposal of a segment of a business. Consistent with SFAS No. 121, SFAS No. 144 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount.        We evaluate the recoverability of long-lived assets not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with them. At the time such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows of certain long-lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying values of such assets, the assets are adjusted to their fair values. We determined fair value as the net present value of future cash flows. Based on these evaluations, there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long lived assets in 2005, 2004, or 2003 other than the asset write downs discussed in Note 9  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.        In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill and intangible assets acquired after June 30, 2001 were no longer subject to amortization. Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives acquired prior to June 30, 2001 ceased to be amortized beginning January 1, 2002. In addition, SFAS 142 changed the way we evaluated goodwill and intangibles for impairment. Beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized; however, they are subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test. The fair value based test is a two-step test. The first step involved comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we are required to proceed to the second step. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets (including unrecognized intangibles) and liabilities of the reporting unit, with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the implied value.   35             As prescribed by SFAS No. 142, we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test by the second quarter of 2002 which did not result in an impairment charge. Additionally, Hollywood Media established October 1, as its annual impairment test date and conducted required testing on that date in 2005, 2004 and 2003 and there were no adjustments to the carrying value of long-lived assets other than the asset write downs discussed in Note 8  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2005, we are not aware of any items or events that would cause us to adjust the recorded value of Hollywood Medias goodwill for impairment. Future changes in estimates used to conduct the impairment review, including revenue projections or market values could cause the analysis to indicate that Hollywood Medias goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write-off of a portion or all of the goodwill. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical decrease would not result in the impairment of goodwill of any reporting unit.   Inflation and Seasonality          Although we cannot accurately determine the precise effects of inflation, we do not believe inflation has a material effect on revenue or results of operations. We consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our Tekno Books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industry practice of paying royalties semi-annually. The Broadway Ticketing Business is also effected by seasonal variations with net revenues generally higher in the second quarter as a result of increased sales volumes due to the Tony Awards ©  and in the fourth quarter due to increased levels during the holiday period. In addition, although not seasonal, our Intellectual Properties division and NetCo Partners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams, earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount of time that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements. The recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in time rather than on a regular periodic basis.      Item 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK .          Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in our assets or liabilities that might occur due to changes in market rates and prices, such as interest or foreign currency exchange rates, as well as other relevant market rate or price changes.        Interest rates charged on Hollywood Medias debt instruments are primarily fixed in nature. We therefore do not believe that the risk of loss relating to the effect of changes in market interest rates is material.        We have an investment in a subsidiary in the United Kingdom and sell our services into this foreign market. Our foreign net asset/exposures (defined as assets denominated in foreign currency less liabilities denominated in foreign currency) for the United Kingdom at December 31, 2005 of U.S. dollar equivalents was $325,661.        Our United Kingdom subsidiary sells services and pays for products and services in British pounds. A decrease in the British foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar could adversely impact our margins. An assumed 10% depreciation of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of 2005 (i.e., in addition to actual exchange experience) would have resulted in a translation reduction of our revenue by $46,985 for 2005.        As the assets, liabilities and transactions of our United Kingdom subsidiary are denominated in British pounds, the results and financial condition are subject to translation adjustments upon their conversion into U.S. dollars for our financial reporting purposes. A 10% decline in this foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar over the course of 2005 (i.e., in addition to actual exchange experience) would not have had a material impact on operating loss as the combined foreign operations were approximately break even for the one month of operations included in the consolidated statement of operations. The final month of the year is considered seasonally slow for CinemasOnline. However, a larger decline in the British foreign currency could have a larger and possibly material adverse affect.   36             We purchase and sell live theater tickets to shows in Londons West End. We minimize our exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates by taking steps to reduce the time lag between the purchase and payment of tickets for the London shows and the collection of related sales proceeds. We do not believe the risk of loss relating to adverse changes in currency exchange rates to be material.      Item 8.  FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA .
