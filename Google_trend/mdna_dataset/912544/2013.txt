Notwithstanding these losses, as described below under “Liquidity and CapitalResources,” Hollywood Media expects that it will be able to satisfy its near term liquidity obligations. Other than thenormal seasonal variance described under “Inflation and Seasonality,” Hollywood Media does not expect that there willbe a significant variance in its earnings or its cash flows in the near term and accordingly does not expect its trend of lossesto accelerate.     The United Statesand global economic downturn, which could adversely affect business and personal discretionary spending is an uncertainty alongwith other factors that can have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on Hollywood Media’s revenues, earningsand liquidity.     Net Revenues     Total net revenuesfor fiscal 2012 were $0.6 million compared to $1.1 million for fiscal 2011. Net revenues decreased $0.5 million, or 45% in fiscal2012 from fiscal 2011. The decrease in net revenues for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 is the result of decreases in IntellectualProperty revenue.     The decrease in netrevenues in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was attributable to the timing of the delivery of manuscripts. The IntellectualProperties division generates revenues from several different activities including book development and licensing, and intellectualproperty licensing. Revenues vary quarter to quarter depending on the timing of delivery of manuscripts to the publishers. Revenuesare recognized when the earnings process is complete and the ultimate collection of such revenues is no longer subject to contingencies.This division does not include NetCo Partners, which is reported separately; see “Equity in Earnings of Unconsolidated Investees”below.      22         Equity in Earnings of UnconsolidatedInvestees      Equity in earnings(losses) of unconsolidated investees consists of the following:            For the years ended December 31,          2012      2011          (in millions)      (in millions)                       NetCo Partners (a)    $ -      $ -     MovieTickets.com (b)      (0.3 )      0.4     Project Hollywood LLC(c)      0.2        0.1          $ (0.1 )    $ 0.5        (a) NetCoPartners     NetCo Partners owns NetForce  and is primarily engaged in the development and licensing of  NetForce . NetCo Partners recognizes revenueswhen the earnings process has been completed based on the terms of the various agreements, generally upon the delivery of themanuscript to the publisher and at the point where ultimate collection is substantially assured. When advances are received priorto completion of the earnings process, NetCo Partners defers recognition of revenue until the earnings process has been completed.Hollywood Media owns 50% of NetCo Partners and accounts for its investment under the equity method. Hollywood Media’s 50%share of income of NetCo Partners was de minimus for fiscal 2012 and 2011.     (b) MovieTickets.com     Hollywood Media owns26.2% of the total equity in the MovieTickets.com joint venture. Hollywood Media records its investment in MovieTickets.com underthe equity method of accounting, recognizing its percentage interest in MovieTickets.com’s income or loss as equity in earningsof unconsolidated investees. Under applicable accounting principles, Hollywood Media recorded a $0.3 million loss and $0.4 millionin income from its investment in MovieTickets.com for fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively. Hollywood Media did not record $33,034of its share of losses from MovieTickets.com for fiscal 2012 because accumulated dividends and net losses from 2012 and prioryears exceeded the Company’s investment in MovieTickets.com as of December 31, 2012. During 2012 and 2011 the Company determinedthat $3.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively of the goodwill associated with MovieTickets.com should be written down and accordingly,recorded impairment losses of $3.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively. See Note 13, “Investments in and Advances toEquity Method Unconsolidated Investees” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 ofthis Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the impairment losses of $3.6 million and $4.8 million. The MovieTickets.comweb site generates revenues primarily from service fees charged to users for the purchase of movie tickets online, the sale ofadvertising and research. On July 18, 2011, MovieTickets.com declared a dividend of $4,000,000. Hollywood Media received its 26.2%pro-rata share of such dividend, amounting to $1,048,875 on July 19, 2011, which reduced the Company’s investment in MovieTickets.comas the dividend did not exceed the amount of the Company’s investment.     MovieTickets.com isone of the leading destinations for the purchase of movie tickets through the Internet. Hollywood Media launched the MovieTickets.comwebsite in May 2000 with several major movie theater exhibitors. The MovieTickets.com website allows users to purchase movie ticketsand retrieve them at “will call” windows or kiosks at theaters or the user can print at home for theatres with thatcapacity. The website generates revenues primarily from service fees charged to users for the purchase of tickets, the sale ofadvertising and the sale of research data. Service fees on ticket sales were introduced in November 2000. See Item 1 – Business,and Note 13, “Investments in and Advances to Equity Method Unconsolidated Investees” in the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements for additional information about MovieTickets.com.      23         (c) Project HollywoodLLC     On October 27, 2011,Hollywood Media acquired 21.74% of the total equity in Project Hollywood, which owns Baseline StudioSystems for $1,250,000. OnAugust 28, 2012 Hollywood Media assigned to Baseline Holdings all of Hollywood Media’s membership interest in Project Hollywoodin exchange for total consideration of $1,800,000. See Note 18, “Related Party Transactions” in the Notes to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the assignment ofthe membership interest of Hollywood Media in Project Hollywood, LLC.  Prior to this assignment, Project Hollywood LLC wasnot consolidated in these financial statements, and Hollywood Media recorded its share of the earnings of Project Hollywood LLCas “equity in earnings of unconsolidated investees” in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Under applicableaccounting principles, Hollywood Media recorded $0.1 million in income from its investment in Project Hollywood for fiscal 2011.This does not include the gain on the Assignment which was approximately $0.7 million recorded in “Other, net” inthe Consolidated Statements of Operations contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.      Operating Expenses      Editorial, Production, Developmentand Technology.  Editorial, production, development and technology costs include fees and royalties paid to authors and co-editorsfor the Intellectual Properties segment. Editorial, production, development and technology costs for fiscal 2012 were essentiallyunchanged at $0.6 million as compared to $0.7 million for fiscal 2011.     Selling, Generaland Administrative.  Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses consist of occupancy costs, professionallegal and consulting service fees, telecommunications costs, general insurance costs and selling and marketing costs (such asadvertising, marketing, promotional, business development, public relations, and commissions due to other parties).  TheSG&A expenses for fiscal 2012 were essentially unchanged at $2.9 million compared to $2.8 million for fiscal 2011.  SG&Aexpenses include legal fees of approximately $0.8 million in fiscal 2012.     Payroll and Benefits.     Payroll and benefitsexpenses consist of payroll and benefits including any other types of compensation benefits as well as human resources and administrativefunctions.     Payroll and benefits expensesfor fiscal 2012 were $2.7 million as compared to $3.2 million for 2011, a decrease of $0.5 million or 16%. On October 1,2012, Hollywood Media received the first $7 million tranche of the earnout pursuant to the Broadway Sale. As a result,pursuant to existing employment agreements, Mr. Rubenstein received $405,300 of such earnout payment and Ms. Silvers received$165,200 of such earnout payment on October 5, 2012 which were recorded as payroll expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal2012. Following such payments, Hollywood Media has no further obligation to Mr. Rubenstein and Ms. Silvers in connection withthe Broadway Sale. Also included in payroll expense for fiscal 2012 is non-cash amortization of deferred compensation in theamount of $430,000, of which $107,500 was included in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.     The decrease in payrolland benefits in fiscal 2012 as compared to 2011 was primarily due to a decrease in executive payroll of $0.1 million, a decreasein payroll of the accounting department of approximately $0.1 million and a combined decrease in payroll of human resources, administration,MIS and legal of approximately $0.3 million.     Depreciation andAmortization.     Depreciation and amortizationexpense consists of depreciation of property and equipment, furniture and fixtures, web site development, leasehold improvements,equipment under capital leases and amortization of intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense was $0.1 million for fiscal2012 as compared to $0.2 million for fiscal 2011. Depreciation and amortization decreased $0.1 million or 50% in fiscal 2012 fromfiscal 2011. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense from fiscal 2011 to 2012 is due to  reducedleasehold improvements amortization because of a change in location of the corporate office to a smaller and less expensive rentalspace and the balance is due to fixed assets becoming fully depreciated during or prior to Q1-11.       24              Interest, net.      Interest, net was $1.2million income for fiscal 2012 as compared to $1.0 million income for fiscal 2011. The increase of $0.2 million or 20% in Interest,net in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to interest received on the second $7 million earnout.Interest, net is attributable to the Note Receivable due to Hollywood Media from Key Brand Entertainment Inc., the purchaser ofthe Broadway Ticketing Division. The note has an interest rate of 13% per annum (changed from 12% per annum as of December 31,2012) and matures on June 30, 2015. For additional information, see Note 5 “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes tothe Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Accretion of Discount,net of allowance for uncollectability     Accretion of discount,net was $1.7 million for fiscal 2012. The $1.7 million balance in Accretion of Discount, net in 2012 was primarily attributableto the accretion of the discount on the Loan from the Broadway Sale, net of the reversal of previously recorded allowance for baddebt.     Other, net.     Other, net was $2.1million for fiscal 2012 as compared to $2.0 million for fiscal 2011. The $2.1 million balance in Other, net in 2012 was primarilyattributable to the assignment of Project Hollywood which resulted in a $0.7 million gain and the increase in the fair value ofthe Warrant by $0.7 million. The $2.0 million balance in Other, net in 2011 was primarily attributable to $1.5 million in proceedsfrom key-man life insurance resulting from Dr. Greenberg’s death as well as the change in the fair value of derivative liabilitiesof $0.6 million.     Income Tax Benefit.     The benefit for fiscal2012 of $5.3 million was fully offset by the income tax expense recognized in the “Gain on sale of discontinued operations,net of income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form10-K.     Net Income (Loss).     Hollywood Media’snet income for fiscal 2012 was $10.4 million as compared to a net loss for fiscal 2011 of $6.9 million. The net income for fiscal2012 was primarily due to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $3.6 million, offset by the pre-tax gain on sale of $12.2 millionfrom the Broadway Sale, $2.3 million from the sale of the Hollywood.com Earnout, accretion of the discount of $1.7 million of theNote Receivable from Key Brand, and $1.2 million interest income received from the Note Receivable from the Broadway Sale. Thenet loss for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $4.8 million, offset by the $1.5 millionin proceeds received from the key-man life insurance resulting from Dr. Greenberg’s death.     LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      Cash Balance atYear End; Sources and Uses of Cash     Hollywood Media’scash and cash equivalents were $11.4 million at December 31, 2012 as compared to $3.7 million at December 31, 2011. Our net workingcapital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $12.0 million at December 31, 2012 and $3.1 million at December31, 2011.      25         Net cash used in operatingactivities from continuing operations during fiscal 2012 was $3.9 million, an increase of 50% compared to net cash used in operatingactivities from continuing operations during 2011 of $2.6 million.  Net cash used in operating activitiesduring 2012 was primarily attributable to the following: (1) net income of $10,409,564 and (2) $1,240,000 of interest receivedon the Loan. These items were partially offset by: (1) $3,600,000 non-cash goodwill impairment charge (2) legal fees of $800,000(3) $430,000 non-cash amortization expense of deferred compensation costs, (4) $136,443 depreciation and amortization (5) cashprovided which included cash received of $7,000,000 on the First $7,000,000 Earnout, $2,950,000 of cash received on the sale ofthe Hollywood.com earnout and $1,230,500 of cash received on the sale of Project Hollywood. By comparison, net cash used in operatingactivities during 2011 was $2,595,494.  C ash usage in 2011 was primarily attributable to the lossfrom continuing operations and the need for staffing during the Broadway Ticketing post-sale transition period.      As described in Note5, “Discontinued Operations” in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K, on October 1, 2012, following the end of the third quarter period, Hollywood Media received from KeyBrand in connection with the Broadway Sale the First $7 Million Earnout payment in cash.

We currently anticipate capital expenditures in 2013 of approximately$75,000, including various systems and equipment upgrades.     Authorization ofStock Repurchase Program      Hollywood Media previouslyreported in its current report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 4, 2007, that its Board of Directors authorized a stockrepurchase program under which Hollywood Media may use up to $10 million of its cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding commonstock. During the fourth quarter of 2012, 16,600 shares of Hollywood Media’s common stock were purchased under the repurchaseprogram for a total cost of $24,582. In addition, during the first quarter of 2013, 510,700 shares of Hollywood Media’s commonstock were repurchased under the repurchase program for a total cost of $749,966.     Pursuant to the repurchaseprogram, Hollywood Media is authorized to purchase shares of its common stock from time to time on the open market or in negotiatedtransactions.

The repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinuedat any time, and there is no guarantee as to the number of shares or the amount of cash to be utilized for repurchases. Repurchasedshares will become authorized but unissued shares of Hollywood Media’s common stock.     Off-Balance SheetArrangements     As of December 31,2012 and December 31, 2011, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entitiesoften referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which were established for the purpose of facilitating off-balancesheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes of the sort contemplated by paragraph 4 of Item 303 of SECRegulation S-K. As such, management believes that we currently do not have any disclosures to make of the sort contemplated byparagraph 4 of Item 303 regarding “off-balance sheet arrangements.”     Critical AccountingEstimates      We have identifiedthe following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation ofour consolidated financial statements. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principlesgenerally accepted in the United States of America requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amountsof assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-goingbasis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to asset impairment, accruals for compensation and related benefits,revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, and contingencies and litigation. These estimates are based on the informationthat is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actualresults could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. For additional information about our significantaccounting policies, including the critical accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 – “Summary of SignificantAccounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Reporton Form 10-K.      29         Derivative Instruments     The Company recordsderivative instruments at fair value in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet with changes in the fair values of those instrumentsreported in earnings in our consolidated results of operations. The Company does not hold any derivative instruments that reducerisk associated with hedging exposure, accordingly the Company has not designated any of its derivatives liability financial instrumentsas hedge instruments.       Impairment ofGoodwill     Under the FinancialAccounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standard Codification Topic No. 350,  “Intangibles – Goodwilland Other”  (ASC 350), beginning January 1, 2002, goodwill and certain intangibles are no longer amortized; however, theyare subject to evaluation for impairment at least annually using a fair value based test. The fair value based test is a two-steptest. The first step involves comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to the carrying value of those reportingunits. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, we are required to proceed to thesecond step. In the second step, the fair value of the reporting unit would be allocated to the assets (including unrecognizedintangibles) and liabilities of the reporting unit, with any residual representing the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairmentloss would be recognized if and to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied value.     In September 2011,the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08,  “Testing for Goodwill Impairment (Topic 350),”  (“ASU 2011-08”).ASU 2011-08 allows entities to first assess qualitatively whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test.If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reportingperiod is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative two-step goodwill impairment test is required. An entity has the unconditionaloption to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test.ASU 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011 and its early adoption by the Company during the quarterended September 30, 2011 did not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.     During the three monthsended September 30, 2012, the Company determined that $3.6 million of the goodwill associated with its Ad Sales division shouldbe written down after it was determined that the future cash flow of these assets is likely impaired, and the risk associated withpreviously expected cash flows has increased and accordingly recorded a total impairment loss of $3.6 million for the year endedDecember 31, 2012. During the three months ended September 30, 2011, the Company determined that $4.8 million of the goodwill associatedwith its Ad Sales division should be written down after it was determined that the future cash flow of these assets is likely impaired,and the risk associated with previously expected cash flows has increased and accordingly recorded a total impairment loss of $4.8million for the year ended December 31, 2011. For additional information see Note 13 - “Investments in and Advances to EquityMethod Unconsolidated Investees” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this AnnualReport on Form 10-K. At December 31, 2012 the Company is not aware of any additional items or events that would cause us to adjustthe recorded value of Hollywood Media’s goodwill for impairment further.  Future changes in estimates used to conductthe impairment review, including revenue projections or comparable market data and transactions could cause the analysis to indicatethat Hollywood Media’s goodwill is impaired in subsequent periods and result in a write-off of a portion or all of the goodwill.  In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations of our reporting units on the impairment calculation, we applieda hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit.  The Company believes that the fair value of its remainingreporting unit that contains goodwill at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 met or exceeded the book value of that reportingunit.      30         The Company believesthat the disparity between the book value of its assets as compared to the market capitalization of its business is in large parta consequence of market conditions, including perceived risks in the debt markets, the Company’s industry and the broadereconomy. While the Company believes that some of these risks are unique to specific companies, some represent global industry risks. TheCompany believes that there is no fundamental change in our underlying business model or prospects for our Company.  The Company has evaluated the impairment of its goodwill, giving consideration to these risks, and their impact upon the respectivereporting units’ fair values, and has reported impairments where it deems appropriate.     Inflation and Seasonality      Although we cannotaccurately determine the precise effects of inflation, we do not believe inflation has a material effect on revenue or resultsof operations. We consider our business to be somewhat seasonal and expect net revenues to be generally higher during the secondand fourth quarters of each fiscal year for our Tekno Books book licensing business as a result of the general publishing industrypractice of paying royalties semi-annually. In addition, although not seasonal, our Intellectual Properties division and NetCoPartners both experience fluctuations in their respective revenue streams, earnings and cash flow as a result of the amount oftime that is expended in the creation and development of the intellectual properties and their respective licensing agreements.The recognition of licensing revenue is typically triggered by specific contractual events which occur at different points in timerather than on a regular periodic basis.     Item 7A.
