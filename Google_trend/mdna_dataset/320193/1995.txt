Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  All information is based on the Company's fiscal calendar.        (Tabular information: Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)  Results of Operations              1995   Change     1994   Change     1993  Net sales                       $ 11,062     20%  $  9,189     15%  $  7,977 Gross margin                    $  2,858     22%  $  2,343    -14%  $  2,728   Percentage of net sales          25.8%             25.5%             34.2% Research and development        $    614      9%  $    564    -15%  $    665   Percentage of net sales           5.6%              6.1%              8.3% Selling, general and         administrative                $  1,583     14%  $  1,384    -15%  $  1,632   Percentage of net sales          14.3%             15.1%             20.5% Operating expenses (excluding      restructuring costs)          $  2,197     13%  $  1,948    -15%  $  2,297   Percentage of net sales          19.9%             21.2%             28.8% Restructuring costs             $   (23)    -82%  $  (127)   -140%  $    321   Percentage of net sales         (0.2%)            (1.4%)              4.0% Interest and other income         (expense),  net                $   (10)     55%  $   (22)   -175%  $     30 Net income                      $    424     37%  $    310    258%  $     87 Earnings per share              $   3.45     32%  $   2.61    258%  $   0.73  Net Sales  Net sales increased $1,873 million, or 20%, in fiscal 1995, compared with an  increase  of $1,212 million, or 15%, in fiscal 1994.  The  net  sales growth  in  1995  over  1994 was primarily due to a combination  of  unit growth,  higher average selling prices, and changes in currency  exchange rates.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales increased approximately  15% over  the  prior year.  This unit sales growth resulted principally  from strong  sales of the Company's Power Macintosh products, which accounted for over 70% of total unit shipments at the end of the fourth quarter  of 1995,  compared with 26% in the comparable period of 1994, and from sales of  newer  product  offerings  within the  Performa  family  of  desktop personal  computers.  This unit growth was partially offset by  declining unit  sales  of  certain of the Company's older product  offerings.   The average  aggregate  revenue  per Macintosh unit  increased  12%  in  1995 compared  with 1994, primarily due to a shift in product mix  toward  the Company's newer products and products with multimedia configurations.  The  net sales growth in 1994 over 1993 was primarily due to two factors: unit  sales  growth and, to a lesser extent, an increase in  the  average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit.  Total Macintosh  computer unit  sales  increased  16% over the prior year.   This  growth  resulted principally  from  strong  sales  of the Company's  new  Power  Macintosh products  and  of  newer product offerings within the Macintosh  Performa family of desktop personal computers and, to a lesser extent, from  sales of  products within the PowerBook family of notebook personal computers. This  growth was partially offset by declining unit sales in  certain  of the  Company's more established products and older product versions.  The average   aggregate  revenue  per  Macintosh  unit  increased   slightly, primarily due to fluctuations in product mix throughout the year, despite pricing  actions  undertaken by the Company  in  response  to  continuing industrywide pricing pressures.  International net sales grew 25% from 1994 to 1995, primarily  reflecting strong  net  sales growth in the Pacific region, particularly Japan,  and favorable  changes in currency exchange rates.  Net sales grew moderately in  Europe over the same period.  International net sales grew  17%  from 1993 to 1994, primarily reflecting strong net sales growth in the Pacific region, particularly Japan.  International net sales represented  48%  of net  sales in 1995 compared with 46% of net sales in 1994 and 45% of  net sales in 1993.  Domestic net sales grew 16% over the prior year, compared with  an  increase  of  14% in 1994 over 1993, primarily  resulting  from strong growth in the education and consumer markets.  In general, the Company's resellers typically purchase products on an as- needed  basis.  Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and  order rates   depending   on  changing  market  conditions.   Unfilled   orders ("backlog")  can  be,  and  often are, canceled  at  will.   The  Company attempts  to  fill orders on the requested delivery schedules.   However, products  may  be  in  relatively short supply from time  to  time  until production volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet demand  or  if other production or fulfillment constraints exist.  The Company's backlog was  approximately $618 million at December 1, 1995, consisting primarily of the Company's higher-end Power Macintosh products.                                         10   In  the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular  time  is not a meaningful indication of its  future  business prospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of  or immediately   following   introduction  of  new   products   because   of overordering by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced once  dealers  and  customers believe they can obtain sufficient  supply. Because  of  the  foregoing,  as  well as  other  factors  affecting  the Company's  backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of  the  Company's future revenue or financial performance.  For  further information  regarding  the  Company's  backlog,  refer  to  page  13  of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and  Results of  Operations under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future  Results and Financial Condition."  Gross Margin  Gross  margin represents the difference between the Company's  net  sales and  its cost of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the sale of products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for its products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor  costs.   The  type and cost of components included  in  particular configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk drives) are   often   directly  related  to  the  need  to  market  products   in configurations   competitive   with   those   of   other   manufacturers. Competition  in  the personal computer industry is intense,  and  in  the short  term,  frequent changes in pricing and product  configuration  are often  necessary  in  order  to remain competitive.   Accordingly,  gross margin  as  a percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced  in the  short  term  by  actions undertaken by the Company  in  response  to industrywide competitive pressures.  Gross margin increased both in amount and as a percentage of net sales in 1995 compared with 1994.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage of net  sales  was primarily a result of a shift in product mix  toward  the Company's  newer, high-margin products, which included  strong  sales  of certain  products within the Company's Power Macintosh family of personal computers and its entry-level Macintosh Performa family.  The increase in gross margin levels was affected favorably by changes  in foreign  currency  exchange rates as a result of  a  weaker  U.S.  dollar relative to certain foreign currencies  in 1995 compared with 1994.   The Company's  operating strategy and pricing take into  account  changes  in exchange  rates over time; however, the Company's results  of  operations can  be  significantly  affected in the short  term  by  fluctuations  in foreign currency exchange rates.  Gross  margin  in  1994 declined as a percentage of net sales  from  1993 levels.  The downward trend in gross margin as a percentage of net  sales was  primarily a result of pricing and promotional actions undertaken  by the  Company  in response to industrywide competitive pricing  pressures. Gross  margin was also affected somewhat adversely by changes in  foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in 1994 compared with 1993.  Results from  the Company's ongoing foreign currency hedging activities offset a portion of this adverse foreign currency impact on gross margin.  Although  the Company's gross margin percentage was 25.8% in 1995,  gross margin  as  a  percentage of net sales declined to 20.7%  in  the  fourth quarter  of 1995, primarily due to aggressive pricing actions and product mix  issues  related to component availability and delays in new  PowerPC processor-based product production.  It is anticipated that gross margins will  continue  to remain under significant pressure and  are  likely  to remain  comparable to the level reported for the fourth quarter  of  1995 due  to  a  variety of factors, including continued industrywide  pricing pressures,  increased competition, particularly in Japan, and  compressed product life cycles.  Research and Development  Research  and  development expenditures increased in amount  during  1995 when  compared with 1994, primarily due to higher project- and headcount- related  spending, as the Company continues to invest in the  development of   new  products  and  technologies.   The  decrease  in  research  and development  expenditures during 1994 compared with  1993  reflected  the results  of the Company's restructuring actions aimed at reducing  costs, including  product  development expenditures.  Research  and  development expenditures  as  a  percentage of net sales have continued  to  decrease since  1993  as a result of revenue growth during 1994 and 1995,  coupled with  the  Company's  continuing  efforts  to  focus  its  research   and development project spending in an efficient manner.  The  Company  believes that continued focused investment in research  and development is critical to its future growth and competitive position  in the marketplace, and is directly related to continued, timely development of new and enhanced products.  Selling, General and Administrative  Selling,  general and administrative expenses increased  in  amount,  but decreased as a percentage of net sales, in 1995 compared with 1994.  This increase  in expense was primarily a result of increased advertising  and channel  marketing program spending as the Company continued its  efforts to  expand  its  market share.  Although the Company  has  increased  its selling  and marketing expenses in an effort to expand its market  share, there  can be no assurance that such an increase in spending will  result in a corresponding                                         11   increase  in  market share.  The decrease as a percentage  of  net  sales since  1993 is primarily a result of revenue growth during 1994 and 1995, combined  with  the Company's ongoing efforts to manage  total  operating expense growth.  In 1994, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and as a percentage of net sales compared with 1993, primarily because of lower   employee-related  and  facilities  costs   resulting   from   the restructuring actions taken in the third quarter of 1993.  Revenue growth in  1994  also  contributed  to  the decrease  in  selling,  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales.  The  Company  will continue to face the challenge of managing  growth  in selling,  general and administrative expenses relative  to  gross  margin levels,  particularly in light of the Company's expectation of  continued pressure on gross margins and continued competitive pressures worldwide.  Restructuring Costs  For  information regarding the Company's restructuring actions, refer  to pages 29 - 30 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net  Interest  and  other income (expense), net, decreased to $10  million  in expense  in  1995 from $22 million in expense in 1994.  This $12  million favorable change is comprised of $48 million in interest and other income attributable to higher average cash balances, higher interest rates,  and interest  rate hedging gains, offset in part by a $36 million unfavorable variance  related  to  realized and unrealized foreign  exchange  hedging losses  and foreign exchange hedging costs.  Market volatility and higher foreign currency balances account for the increased hedging cost.  In  1994,  interest  and other income (expense), net,  decreased  to  $22 million in expense from $30 million of income in 1993, resulting in a $52 million  unfavorable change.  Higher interest rates  and  larger  average borrowing  balances  used  to  fund  working  capital  needs  served   to significantly increase interest expense, and accounted for $28 million of the  $52 million change during 1994.  Other factors contributing to  this variance included interest income, which was higher in 1993 than in  1994 primarily  due  to  a  $15  million  interest  payment  received   on   a nonrecurring income tax refund from the Internal Revenue Service in 1993, and  interest  income  from the Company's interest rate  risk  management program,  which  contributed  $6 million in 1993,  and  reduced  interest income by $7 million in 1994.  For more information regarding the Company's strategy and accounting for financial and other derivative instruments, refer to pages 26 -  28 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Provision for Income Taxes            1995   Change  1994   Change  1993  Provision for income taxes          $  250     32%  $ 190    258%   $ 53 Effective tax rate                     37%            38%            38%  The Company's effective tax rate decreased to 37% in 1995 compared with a rate  of  38%  in  1994  and 1993.  For additional information  regarding income  taxes,  refer  to  pages 31 - 32 of  the  Notes  to  Consolidated Financial Statements.  Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition  The  Company's  future  operating results  and  financial  condition  are dependent  on the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and  market technologically innovative products in order to meet  dynamic customer  demand  patterns.  Inherent in this process  are  a  number  of factors  that  the Company must successfully manage in order  to  achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition.  Product Introductions and Transitions  Due  to  the  highly  volatile nature of the personal computer  industry, which  is  characterized by dynamic customer demand  patterns  and  rapid technological  advances, the Company frequently introduces  new  products and  product  enhancements.  The success of new product introductions  is dependent  on  a  number  of factors, including  market  acceptance,  the Company's   ability   to  manage  the  risks  associated   with   product transitions,  the availability of application software for new  products, the  effective  management of inventory levels in line  with  anticipated product   demand,  and  the  manufacturing  of  products  in  appropriate quantities  to meet anticipated demand.  Accordingly, the Company  cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations.                                         12   In  1994, the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of Macintosh computers  based  on  a new PowerPC family of RISC microprocessors.   The Company's  results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if it is unable to successfully complete the transition  of  its lines of personal computers and servers from the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors  to  the PowerPC microprocessor.  The  success  of  this ongoing  transition will depend on the Company's ability to  continue  to sell products based on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors while continuing  to  gain market acceptance of the new PowerPC processor-based products,  to successfully manage inventory levels of both product  lines simultaneously, and to continue to coordinate the timely development  and distribution  by  independent software vendors of new  "native"  software applications   specifically  designed  for  the  PowerPC  processor-based products.  The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new product  is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments for  that product, which depends on many factors, some of which  are  not under  the  control  of the Company.  These factors may  include  initial large  purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends  to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of  users ("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by  users who  anticipated  new  technology and as a result deferred  purchases  of other products; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages  due to the aforementioned factors.  The preceding may also be offset by other factors,  such  as  the  deferral of purchases by many  users  until  new technology  is accepted as "proven" and for which commonly used  software products are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once  they believe  they  can  obtain  sufficient supply of  product  previously  in backlog.  Backlog  is  often volatile after new product introductions  due  to  the aforementioned   demand   factors,  often  increasing   coincident   with introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply of product.  The  measurement  of  demand  for newly introduced  products  is  further complicated  by  the  availability of different  product  configurations, which  may  include various types of built-in peripherals  and  software. Configurations may also require certain localization (such  as  language) for  various  markets  and, as a result, demand in  different  geographic areas  may  be a function of the availability of third-party software  in those  localized  versions.  For example, the availability  of  European- language versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag  behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more.  This may result in lower initial demand for the Company's new products outside the  United  States,  even  though localized versions  of  the  Company's products may be available.  Competition  The personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues to  be characterized by consolidations in the hardware and software  industries, aggressive  pricing practices, and downward pressure  on  gross  margins. For  example,  in  Japan, other companies have begun to initiate  extreme competitive  actions in order to gain market share, and as a result,  the Company  has  implemented incremental pricing and promotional activities. The  Company's  results of operations and financial  condition  could  be adversely affected should the Company be unable to effectively manage the impact of industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on  gross margins.  The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also be  affected  by  the  Company's ability to offer  customers  competitive technologies  while effectively managing the impact on  inventory  levels and   the   potential   for  customer  confusion   created   by   product proliferation.   The  Company's future operating  results  and  financial condition  may also be affected by overall demand for personal  computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another.  On  November 7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with IBM and  Motorola, Inc. on a new hardware reference  platform for the PowerPC  microprocessor that  is  intended  to deliver  a  much wider range of  operating system and application  choices for  computer customers.  As a  result of this agreement, the  Company  is moving  forward  with its efforts  to make the Macintosh operating  system available on the common platform.   In line with its efforts, on  November 13, 1995, the Company, IBM, and  Motorola, Inc. announced the availability of  the "PowerPC Platform," which  is a set of specifications that defines a  "unified"  personal  computer   architecture  and  combines  the  Power Macintosh  platform and the PC  environment.  Accordingly,  the  Company's future  operating results and  financial condition may be affected by  its ability  to  continue  to   implement this  agreement  and  certain  other collaboration agreements,  and to manage the associated competitive risk.  The  Company  is currently the primary maker of hardware  that  uses  the Macintosh  operating system, and it has a minority market  share  in  the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers  that run  the MS-DOS (registered trademark) and Microsoft Windows (trademark)  operating systems.  The Company's future  operating results and financial  condition may be affected by  its ability  to increase market share in its  personal computer business.   As part  of  its  efforts  to  increase  overall market  share,  the  Company announced  the  licensing  of the  Macintosh  operating  system  to  other personal  computer vendors in  January 1995, and several vendors currently sell product that utilize the  Macintosh operating system.  The success of the  Company's  efforts  to   increase its overall  market  share  through licensing  of the Macintosh  operating system will depend in part  on  the Company's  ability  to manage  the risks associated  with  competing  with companies producing Macintosh  OS-based computer systems.  Accordingly,  the  Company  cannot determine                                         13   the  ultimate  effect  that licensing  of  the Macintosh operating system  will have  on  its  product pricing  and  unit  sales  or  future  operating  results  and  financial condition.  The Company believes that licensing the  operating system will result  in a broader installed base on which software  vendors can develop and  provide technical innovations for the Macintosh  platform.   However, there  can  be no assurance that the installed base  will be broadened  by the licensing of the operating system or that licensing will result in an increase  in  the number of application software titles or  the  rate  at which  vendors  will bring to market application software   based  on  the Macintosh operating system.  The   Company's  principal  competitor  in  producing  operating   system software,  Microsoft  Corporation, is a large, well-financed  corporation which  has  a  dominant  position in various  segments  of  the  personal computer  software  industry.   In  August  1995,  Microsoft  Corporation released  Windows 95, another of its operating system  offerings.   As  a result of the introduction of Windows 95, the Company has taken and  will continue  to  take  steps  to address the additional  challenges  to  and competitive  pressures  on its efforts in developing  and  marketing  the Company's products.  Accordingly, the Company's future operating  results and financial condition could be adversely affected should the Company be unable   to  effectively  manage  the  competitive  pressure  and   other challenges presented by the introduction of Windows 95.  Certain  of  the  Company's personal computer  products  are  capable  of running application software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating systems ("Cross-Platform Products"), through software emulation of  Intel Corporation microprocessor chips by use of software specifically designed for  the  Company's  products, either those based on the  Motorola  68000 series  of  microprocessors or those based on the PowerPC microprocessor. The  Company  has also introduced products that include both  the  RISC- based  PowerPC 601 microprocessor and the 486 DX2/66 microprocessor, which enable  users  to  switch between the Macintosh and DOS or Windows  computing environments.  The  Company  currently  supplies customers who  purchase  Cross-Platform Products  capable of running the MS-DOS or Windows 3.1 operating system with operating  system  software under a licensing agreement  with  Microsoft. This  license  agreement expires on December 31, 1995 (the  "Old  License Agreement").   The Company has attempted to license Windows  95  software from  Microsoft  but has been unable to do so because  of  the  Company's unwillingness to consent to Microsoft's demand under Microsoft's proposed license  agreement (the "New License Agreement") that the  Company  agree not to sue Microsoft if Microsoft infringes any of the Company's patents. Microsoft  has also informed the Company that it will not renew  the  Old License  Agreement unless the Company accepts the New License  Agreement. Accordingly,  unless an appropriate licensing agreement is reached,  upon the  expiration of the Old License Agreement, the Company will be  unable to  supply customers with any of Microsoft's operating systems on  Cross- Platform  Products.   Although  customers could  obtain  copies  of  such software from other sources, the Company is unable to predict the  effect of  such a situation on the demand for Cross-Platform Products.  Although Cross-Platform Products represented only a small portion of the Company's unit  sales during 1995, the Company is unable to predict the  effect  of such a situation on the Company's future operating results.  Decisions  by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers,  as opposed  to  MS-DOS  or Windows-based systems, are  often  based  on  the availability  of  third-party software for particular applications.   The Company   believes  that  the  availability  of  third-party  application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on the third- party  developers'  perception and analysis of the relative  benefits  of developing  such software for the Company's products versus software  for the  larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is based on factors such  as  the  relative  market  share of  the  Company's  products,  the anticipated  potential  revenue that may be  earned,  and  the  costs  of developing such software products.  Microsoft Corporation is an important developer   of   application  software  for   the   Company's   products. Accordingly,  Microsoft's interest in producing application software  for the Company's products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as an operating system vendor.  The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of  the PowerPC  RISC  microprocessor for certain of the Company's  products,  to continue  to supply to the Company microprocessors that produce  superior price/performance results compared with those supplied to  the  Company's competitors  by  Intel Corporation, the developer  and  producer  of  the microprocessors  used  by most personal computers using  the  MS-DOS  and Windows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based on  the Intel  microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor,  and  is also the developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Macintosh operating system.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying the Company  with  improved  versions of microprocessors  for  the  Company's products  may  be influenced by IBM's perception of its  interests  as  a competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor.  The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also be   affected  by  the  Company's  ability  to  successfully  expand  and capitalize  on its investments in other markets, such as the markets  for Internet services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.                                            14   Global Market Risks  A   large   portion  of  the  Company's  revenue  is  derived  from   its international  operations.   As a result, the  Company's  operations  and financial  results  could  be  significantly  affected  by  international factors,  such  as  changes in foreign currency exchange  rates  or  weak economic  conditions  in  the  foreign  markets  in  which  the   Company distributes its products.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies,  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  non-U.S.  dollar-based   sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value  of  non- U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases  when the U.S. dollar strengthens.  Overall, the Company  is  a net  receiver  of  currencies other than the U.S. dollar  and,  as  such, benefits  from  a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by  a  stronger dollar  relative to major currencies worldwide.  Accordingly, changes  in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross margins  (as expressed in U.S. dollars).  To  mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on  the  Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement,  and operating  expenses,  the Company regularly hedges its  non-U.S.  dollar- based  exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange forward  and  option  contracts to hedge firmly  committed  transactions. Currently,  hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend  beyond one  year.   The Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to  hedge  certain other probable, but not firmly committed transactions. Hedges  of  probable, but not firmly committed transactions currently  do not  extend  beyond one year.  To reduce the costs associated with  these ongoing  foreign  exchange hedging programs, the Company  also  regularly sells  foreign  exchange option contracts and enters into  certain  other foreign  exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and  option contracts  not  accounted  for  as  hedges,  including  all  transactions intended  to  reduce  the  costs associated with  the  Company's  foreign exchange hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted  on each  balance  sheet date for changes in exchange rates.   Refer  to  the Financial  Instruments  footnote on  pages  26  -  28  of  the  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest rates  of  many  of  the  world's leading industrialized  countries,  the Company's  interest income and expense is most sensitive to  fluctuations in  the general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S.  interest  rates affect the interest earned on the  Company's  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid  on its short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  To mitigate the impact  of fluctuations  in  U.S.  interest rates,  the  Company  has  entered  into interest  rate swap and option transactions.  Certain of these swaps  are intended  to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income  on its  cash,  cash equivalents, and short-term investments with the  fixed- rate  interest  expense on its long-term debt.  The Company  also  enters into  interest rate swap and option transactions in order to diversify  a portion  of  the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in  short-term U.S.  interest  rates.  These instruments may extend the  Company's  cash investment horizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.  To  ensure  the  adequacy  and effectiveness  of  the  Company's  foreign exchange  and  interest rate hedge positions, as well as to  monitor  the risks   and  opportunities  of  the  nonhedge  portfolios,  the   Company continually  monitors its foreign exchange forward and option  positions, and  its  interest rate swap and option positions on a stand-alone  basis and  in  conjunction with its underlying foreign currency-  and  interest rate-related  exposures, respectively, from both  an  accounting  and  an economic  perspective.   However, given the  effective  horizons  of  the Company's risk management activities, there can be no assurance that  the aforementioned  programs will offset more than a portion of  the  adverse financial  impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either  foreign exchange  or  interest rates.  In addition, the timing of the  accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related  to the underlying economic exposures, and as such, may adversely affect  the  Company's  operating results and  financial  position.   The Company generally does not engage in leveraged hedging.  Inventory and Supply  The  Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be  limited by  the  availability of key components.  The Company believes  that  the availability  from  suppliers  to  the  personal  computer  industry   of microprocessors  and  ASICs presents the most significant  potential  for constraining  the  Company's  ability  to  produce  products.    Specific microprocessors  manufactured by Motorola, Inc.  and  IBM  are  currently available  only  from single sources, while some advanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production and thus have limited  availability.  The Company and other producers in  the  personal computer  industry  also  compete for other semiconductor  products  with other  industries  that  have  experienced  increased  demand  for   such products,  due  to either increased consumer demand or increased  use  of semiconductors  in  their  products  (such  as  the  cellular  phone  and automotive  industries).  Finally, the Company uses some components  that are  not  common to the rest of the personal computer industry (including certain  ASICs).   Continued  availability of  these  components  may  be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production  of common  components  instead of custom components.   Such  product  supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could adversely affect  the Company's  future  operating results and financial  condition,  including loss of market share.                                          15   The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also be adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage inventory levels and  lead  times  required  to obtain components  in  order  to  be  more responsive  to  short-term  shifts  in  customer  demand  patterns.    In addition,  if  anticipated unit sales growth for new and current  product offerings  is  not  realized, the Company's  results  of  operations  and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Marketing and Distribution  A  number  of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution  of the  Company's  products.   Currently, the  Company's  primary  means  of distribution  is  through third-party computer resellers.   However,  the Company is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels,  such as  mass-merchandise stores, consumer electronics outlets,  and  computer superstores.   The  Company's  business and financial  results  could  be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers  weakens or  if  resellers  within consumer channels decide  not  to  continue  to distribute the Company's products.  Other Factors  The  majority  of the Company's research and development activities,  its corporate  headquarters,  and  other  critical  business  operations  are located  near major seismic faults. The Company's operating  results  and financial  condition could be materially adversely affected in the  event of a major earthquake.  The  Company  is  currently  in  the process  of  replacing  its  current transaction   systems  (which  include  order  management,  distribution, manufacturing, and finance) with a single integrated system  as  part  of its  ongoing  effort to increase operational efficiency.   The  Company's future  operating  results  and financial condition  could  be  adversely affected  if  it  is  unable  to implement  and  effectively  manage  the transition to this new integrated system.  In  April  1995,  the  Company  announced  a  companywide  reorganization designed  to  more  closely align the Company's organizational  structure with  the  Company's  business strategy of  placing  increased  focus  on customer  needs  and expanding its presence in the home,  education,  and business  markets.   In November 1995, the Company  announced  a  further companywide reorganization to accelerate the implementation of its market segmentation strategy.  The Company's reorganization will result  in  the consolidation   of   its   sales,  marketing,  and   customer   solutions organization  into three geographic business units, namely, the  Americas, Europe,  and Japan and Asia.  The Company's future operating results  and financial  condition  could  be adversely  affected  by  its  ability  to effectively manage the transition to these new organizational structures. Although  it  is  uncertain at this time, the Company  may  incur  future restructuring charges as a result of these reorganizations.  Historically, the Company has experienced increased sales  in  its  first and  fourth fiscal quarters due to holiday demand for and calendar  year- end  buying  of  some  of its products.  As of the date  of  this  Annual Report,  published  reports  relating to the  U.S.  economy  indicated  a potentially  unfavorable year-end buying season.   Any  general  economic slowdown could adversely affect demand for the Company's products,  which could  adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.  Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the Company's  operating  results  and financial  condition,  past  financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results  or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the  Company's participation  in a highly dynamic industry often results in  significant volatility of the Company's common stock price.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The  Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and  short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings,  decreased  to $491  million  at September 29, 1995, from $966 million at September  30, 1994.  Less  cash  was  generated  by operations in  1995  compared  with  1994, primarily  as a result of growth in inventory levels and an  increase  in accounts  receivable.   Inventory levels grew during  1995  in  order  to support anticipated demand in the first quarter of 1996 for the Company's new  products.  Accounts receivable also increased, reflecting the higher sales levels achieved during 1995, primarily toward the end of the fourth quarter.  Cash  used  for operations in 1995 was partially offset by cash generated from  higher  sales  and accounts payable levels.   The  increased  sales levels  were driven by aggressive pricing and promotional actions coupled with  strong  demand for the Company's PowerPC processor-based  products. Accounts  payable  increased as a result of the growth in  inventory  and production levels and longer payment terms negotiated with vendors.  More  cash  was  generated  by operations in  1994  compared  with  1993, primarily due to a significant decrease in inventory levels, as  well  as increased  sales  levels.  The significant decrease in  inventory  levels during 1994 resulted from improved inventory                                         16   management, higher 1994 sales levels attributable to various pricing  and promotional actions, and strong sales of new product inventory which  had been  built  up  in preparation for the introduction of Power  Macintosh. Profit  levels  improved  as  operating expenses  decreased  due  to  the Company's implementation of restructuring actions initiated in the  third quarter of 1993.  Cash  generated by operations in 1994 was partially offset by  cash  used for  restructuring and an increase in accounts receivable.  The  increase in  accounts  receivable reflected an increase in sales  levels  achieved during 1994.  The balance of accrued restructuring costs decreased as the restructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of 1993 continued to be  implemented.  In addition, in the third quarter of 1994, the  Company lowered  its estimate of the costs associated with the restructuring  and recorded  an  adjustment  that  increased income  by  $127  million  ($79 million,  or  $0.66  per share, after taxes).  This adjustment  primarily reflected  the  modification or cancelation of certain  elements  of  the Company's  original restructuring plan because of changing  business  and economic conditions that made certain elements of the restructuring  plan financially less attractive than originally anticipated.  Excluding short-term investments, net cash used for investments increased in  1995  compared  with 1994 and 1993 levels.  Net  cash  used  for  the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $159 million in  1995, and  was  primarily made up of increases in manufacturing  machinery  and equipment.   The  Company anticipates that capital expenditures  in  1996 will remain relatively consistent with 1995 expenditure levels.  The  Company  leases the majority of its facilities and  certain  of  its equipment  under noncancelable operating leases.  In 1995,  rent  expense under all operating leases was approximately $127 million.  The Company's future  lease  commitments are discussed on  page  34  of  the  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Short-term  borrowings  at September 29, 1995,  were  approximately  $169 million  higher  than  at  September  30,  1994.  These  borrowings  were primarily made to fund expected working capital growth in certain markets worldwide.   In  general,  the  Company's short-term  borrowings  reflect borrowings  made under its commercial paper program and short-term  loans from  certain  commercial banks.  In particular, Apple  Japan,  Inc.  and Apple Computer BV (Netherlands), subsidiaries of the Company, held short- term  borrowings from several banks, totaling approximately $199  million and $262 million, respectively, at September 29, 1995.  The  Company's  balance  of long-term debt remained  relatively  constant during  1995.  In 1994, $300 million aggregate principal amount  of  6.5% unsecured notes were issued under an omnibus shelf registration statement filed   with   the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission.   This   shelf registration was for the registration of debt and other securities for an aggregate  offering  amount of $500 million.   The  notes  were  sold  at 99.925%  of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%.  The  notes pay  interest semi-annually and mature on February 15, 2004.   The  6.51% fixed  rate  was  subsequently effectively converted to a  floating  rate through ten-year interest rate swaps based on the three-month U.S. dollar London  Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").  To mitigate  the  credit  risk associated  with  these ten-year swap transactions, the  Company  entered into  margining  agreements  with  its third-party  bank  counterparties. Margining under these agreements does not start until 1997.  Furthermore, these agreements would require the Company to post margin only if certain credit  risk thresholds were exceeded.  It is anticipated that any margin the  Company  may  be required to post in the future  would  not  have  a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity position.  The  Company expects that it will continue to incur short- and  long-term borrowings  from time to time to finance U.S. working capital  needs  and capital  expenditures,  because a substantial portion  of  the  Company's cash,  cash  equivalents, and short-term investments is held  by  foreign subsidiaries,  generally  in U.S. dollar-denominated  holdings.   Amounts held  by  foreign  subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income  taxation upon   repatriation  to  the  United  States;  the  Company's   financial statements  fully provide for any related tax liability on  amounts  that may be repatriated.  Refer to the Income Taxes footnote on pages 31 -  32 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  The  Company  believes that its balances of cash, cash  equivalents,  and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-  and long-term borrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to  meet its operating cash requirements on a short- and long-term basis.                                                     17   Item 8.
