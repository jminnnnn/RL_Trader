ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS   OF OPERATIONS      THIS SECTION AND OTHER PARTS OF THIS FORM 10-K CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE SUBSECTION ENTITLED "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION" BELOW.      THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K. ALL INFORMATION IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S FISCAL CALENDAR.  OVERVIEW      During 1997, the Company continued to experience declines in net sales, units shipped and share of the personal computer market compared to prior years. The decline in demand and the resulting losses, coupled with intense price competition throughout the industry, led to the Company's decision to continue to restructure its business during 1997 aimed at reducing its core structure, improving its competitiveness and restoring sustainable profitability. The Company's restructuring efforts have included significant headcount reductions, simplifications and modifications of the Company's product lines, increases in the proportion of products manufactured under outsourcing arrangements and the implementation of an on-line store in the U.S. In addition, the Company plans to increase the proportion of products manufactured on a made-to-order basis The Company believes that restructuring actions effected through the fourth quarter of 1997, as well as those currently planned to be effected during 1998, will decrease operating expenses in 1998 compared with 1997. There is no assurance that such decreases in operating expenses will be achieved or that, if achieved, such reductions will be sufficient to offset the decline in the Company's net sales.      In February 1997, the Company acquired NeXT. NeXT developed, marketed and supported software that enables customers to implement business applications on the Internet/World Wide Web, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server networks. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the operating results pertaining to NeXT subsequent to the date of acquisition have been included in the Company's consolidated operating results. The total purchase price, including the fair value of the net liabilities assumed, was $427 million of which $375 million was allocated to purchased in-process research and development and $52 million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. The purchased in-process research and development was charged to operations upon acquisition, and the goodwill and other tangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over two years.      The Company had previously entered into agreements to license its Mac OS to other personal computer vendors (the "Clone Vendors") as part of an effort to increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform. The Company recently determined that the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors under these agreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing program. As a result, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets, including the license to distribute the Mac OS, of PCC, a clone vendor, and has no plans to renew its other Mac OS licensing agreements.      The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand patterns, and are also dependent upon its ability to effect a change in marketplace perception of the Company's prospects, including the viability of the Macintosh platform. Inherent in this process are a number of factors that the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and a favorable financial condition. Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition include, among other things, continued competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the Company; the availability of key components on terms acceptable to the Company; the Company's ability to supply products in certain categories; the Company's ability to supply products free of latent defects or other faults; the Company's                                         9  ability to make timely delivery to the marketplace of technological innovations, including its ability to continue to make timely delivery of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS and to make timely delivery of a new and substantially backward-compatible operating system; the Company's ability to successfully integrate NeXT technologies, processes and employees with those at Apple; the Company's ability to successfully implement its strategic direction and restructuring actions, including reducing its expenditures; the Company's ability to attract, motivate and retain employees, including a new Chief Executive Officer; the effects of significant adverse publicity; the availability of third-party software for particular applications; and the impact on the Company's sales, market share and gross margins as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing program.

Net sales decreased 28% in 1997 compared with 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral unit sales decreased 27% and 33%, respectively, during 1997, compared with 1996, as a result of a decline in worldwide demand for most of the Company's product families, which the Company believes was due principally to continued customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial condition and future prospects, and the viability of the Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit decreased slightly in 1997 compared with 1996, primarily due to continued pricing actions, including increased rebates, across most product lines, substantially offset by a shift in product mix toward the Company's newer and higher priced PowerBook products. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit did not change in 1997 compared with 1996. For information regarding quarterly net sales, see "Selected Quarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.                                         10      International net sales represented 50% of total net sales in 1997 compared with 52% of net sales in 1996. International net sales declined 30% in 1997 compared with 1996. Net sales in European markets and Japan decreased during 1997 compared with 1996, as a result of decreases in Macintosh computer and peripheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit in Japan, which were partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit. Further discussion relating to factors contributing to the decline in net sales in the Japanese market may be found in this Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading "Global Market Risks" included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.      Domestic net sales declined 26% during 1997 compared with 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh computers and peripheral products and in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit in the U.S. did not change in 1997 compared with 1996.      During 1997, as compared with 1996, the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 3.6% from 5.7%, and to 4.6% from 7.4%, respectively, based upon current market information provided by industry sources.      The Company believes that net sales will be below the level of the prior year's comparable periods through at least the second fiscal quarter of 1998, if not longer.  Q4 97 COMPARED WITH Q4 96      Net sales decreased 30% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the same quarter of 1996. Total Macintosh computer unit sales and peripheral unit sales decreased 30% and 32%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 1997, compared with the same period of 1996, which the Company believes was due principally to continued customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial condition and future prospects, and the viability of the Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of continued pricing actions, including increased rebates, across most product lines, partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per Powerbook unit. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product also decreased slightly for the foregoing reasons. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit and per peripheral unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including industrywide pricing pressures, increased competition, and the need to stimulate demand for the Company's products.      International net sales represented 42% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with 47% of net sales in the same period of 1996. International net sales declined 38% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996. Net sales decreased in the European markets and decreased significantly in Japan during the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the same period of 1996, as a result of decreases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales in Europe and Japan and in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit in the European markets and the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit in Japan. These decreases were partially offset by increases in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit in Europe and the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit in Japan. Further discussion relating to factors contributing to the decline in net sales in the Japanese market may be found in this Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading "Global Market Risks" included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.      Domestic net sales declined 24% in the fourth quarter of 1997 over the comparable period of 1996, due to decreases in unit sales of Macintosh computers and peripheral products and in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.                                         11      During the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the comparable period of 1996, the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 3.1% from 5.2%, and to 4.3% from 6.6%, respectively, based upon current market information provided by industry sources.  Q4 97 COMPARED WITH Q3 97      Net sales decreased 7% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997. Total Macintosh computer unit sales decreased 8% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the prior quarter which the Company believes was due principally to continued customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial condition and future prospects, and the viability of the Macintosh platform, and to competitive pressures in the marketplace, as well as continued easing of pent-up demand for new PowerBook products which were introduced in the second quarter. In addition, unit sales in Japan decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997, primarily as a result of a weaker personal computer market. Unit sales of peripheral products decreased slightly in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit remained constant as higher average aggregate revenue per "Value" (entry level Power Macintosh) unit was offset by a lower average aggregate revenue per Powerbook unit and aggressive pricing on discontinued products. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit decreased 5% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997. Furthermore, the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer and peripheral unit was unfavorably affected by pricing actions, including increased rebates, across most product lines.      International net sales represented 42% of total net sales in the fourth quarter of 1997, compared with 53% in the third quarter of 1997. International net sales decreased 27% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter of 1997, primarily as a result of a significant decrease in net sales of Macintosh computers and peripheral products in Japan and a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit, slightly offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit. Further discussion relating to factors contributing to the decline in net sales in the Japanese market may be found in this Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading "Global Market Risks" included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.      Domestic net sales increased 15% in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the prior quarter, due to increases in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales and the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit, which increases were slightly offset by a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per peripheral unit.      During the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997, the Company's estimated share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets decreased to 3.1% from 3.7%, and to 4.3% from 4.7%, respectively, based upon current market information provided by industry sources.  YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 1996 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 1995      Net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing $1,229 million, or 11%; $1,545 million, or 19%; and $682 million, or 23%; during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in 1995, due to a decrease in net sales of Macintosh computers and of peripheral products. Total Macintosh computer unit sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 11%, 19%, and 26% during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in 1995. This decline in unit sales was a result of a decline or lack of growth in worldwide demand for all product families, which the Company believes was due principally to customer concerns regarding the Company's strategic direction, financial condition, and future prospects, and due to delays in the shipment of certain PowerBook products as a result of quality problems. In addition, unit sales of peripheral products trended                                         12  downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 20%, 24%, and 30% during the twelve, nine and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in 1995, for the reasons noted above. The average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased slightly during the twelve and three months ended September 27, 1996, and decreased slightly during the nine months ended September 27, 1996, compared with the same periods in 1995, primarily due to a continued shift in product mix toward the Company's newer products and products with multimedia configurations, offset to varying degrees by pricing actions across all product lines. The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product was flat during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995.      International net sales represented 52% of net sales in 1996 compared with 48% of net sales in 1995. International net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 3%, 11% and 13% during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in 1995. Net sales in European markets trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995, as a result of a decrease in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per peripheral unit, primarily during the first part of the year. Net sales in Japan trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995. An increase in Macintosh unit sales during these periods was more than offset by a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per peripheral unit and a decrease in peripheral unit sales. Domestic net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing by 18%, 26%, and 30% for the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the corresponding periods in 1995, resulting from a decline or lack of growth in demand for all product families.      In the fourth quarter of 1996 compared with the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company's share of the worldwide and U.S. personal computer markets declined to 5.4% from 8.7%, and to 7.3% from 13.2%, respectively, based on current information provided by industry sources.  BACKLOG      In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed basis. Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates depending on changing market conditions. Unfilled orders (backlog) can be, and often are, canceled at will. The Company attempts to fill orders on the requested delivery schedules. However, products may be in relatively short supply from time to time until production volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet demand or if other production or fulfillment constraints exist. The Company's backlog of unfilled orders decreased to approximately $230 million at November 28, 1997 from approximately $563 million at November 29, 1996 and consisted primarily of the Company's "Flagship" line of higher-end Power Macintosh products. The Company's backlog at November 29, 1996 consisted primarily of the Company's PowerBook products, as well as the Company's "Flagship" line of higher-end Power Macintosh products. The Company expects that substantially all of its orders in backlog at November 28, 1997 will be either shipped or canceled during fiscal 1998.      In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following introduction of new products because of overordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further information regarding the Company's backlog may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Product Introductions and Transitions" included under                                         13  the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  GROSS MARGIN      Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales and its cost of goods sold. The amount of revenue generated per unit sold is influenced by the price set by the Company for its products. The cost of goods sold is based primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor costs. The type and cost of components included in particular configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk drives) are often directly related to the need to market products in configurations competitive with other manufacturers. Competition in the personal computer industry is intense and, in the short term, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary in order to remain competitive. Accordingly, gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by actions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide competitive pressures.      Gross margin increased from 10% to 19% of sales during 1997 compared to 1996, primarily as a result of a $616 million charge in the second quarter of 1996 that related principally to the write-down of certain inventory, as well as to the cost of cancelling excess component orders necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for many of the Company's products, primarily its "Value" line of Power Macintosh products (formerly generally referred to as entry level and Performa-Registered Trademark- products). The Company separately incurred approximately $145 million in charges during 1996 to provide for the estimated costs of correcting certain quality problems in certain of its "Value" line of Power Macintosh products, as well as PowerBook and peripheral products, covering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods. In addition, gross margins in the second quarter of 1996, and to a lesser degree the first quarter of that year, were adversely affected by aggressive pricing actions in Japan in response to extreme competitive actions by other companies, as well as price reductions in the United States and Europe across all product lines in order to stimulate demand.      Gross margin decreased from 22% to 20% of sales during the fourth quarter of 1997 compared to the same period of 1996, and remained constant compared to the third quarter of 1997. This was primarily as a result of certain pricing actions effected by the Company as noted above, as well as the Company's inability to fulfill all purchase orders of certain high-margin Power Macintosh product due to the unavailability of sufficient quantities of certain components, which were offset to varying degrees by sales of the Company's new operating system, Mac OS 8, during the fourth quarter of 1997.      The gross margin levels in the fourth quarter of 1997 compared with the third quarter of 1997 and the fourth quarter of 1996, and in 1997 compared with 1996, were also adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies. This negative impact was offset by currency hedging. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.      There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to sustain the gross margin levels achieved in 1997. Gross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industrywide global pricing pressures, increased competition, and compressed product life cycles. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. The Company expects to experience additional pricing pressure through at least the first fiscal quarter of 1998 as a result of the Company winding down its Mac OS licensing program, including the acquisition of its Mac OS license and other assets of Power Computing Corporation ("PCC"), as the Company expects certain Mac OS licensees to sell aggressively their remaining inventory in early fiscal 1998. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to                                         14  effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate demand for certain of its products.      Gross margin decreased to 10% in 1996 compared with 26% in 1995. This decrease is primarily the result of a $616 million charge in the second quarter of 1996 for the write-down of certain inventory, as well as the costs of cancelling excess component orders, necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for many of the Company's products, primarily its entry-level products. The Company separately incurred approximately $145 million in charges during the last nine months of 1996 to provide for the estimated costs of correcting certain quality problems in certain of the "Value" line of Power Macintosh products as well as PowerBook and peripheral products, covering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods. The Company also incurred greater warranty expenses per unit sold during 1996 compared with 1995. The decrease in gross margin was also due to the Company's response to extreme competitive actions by other companies attempting to gain market share, including the Company's pricing actions in the U.S., Japan and Europe across most product lines, which were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain product components.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT                                                                         1997       CHANGE       1996        CHANGE        1995                                                                    ---------  -----------  ---------  -------------  ---------            Research and development.........................................  $     485         (20%) $     604           (2%)  $     614   Percentage of net sales........................................         7%                       6%                        6%       Research and development expenditures decreased in dollar amounts in 1997 when compared with 1996, primarily due to certain restructuring actions, including a reduction in headcount and the cancellation of certain research and development related contracts, taken during 1997. The increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales resulted from a decrease in the level of net sales. There was a slight decrease in research and development expenditures during 1996 compared with 1995. The slight increase as a percentage of net sales in 1996 over 1995 was the result of a decrease in net sales during 1996.      The Company believes that continued and focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. The Company believes that research and development expenditures will decrease in 1998 compared to 1997 as the Company completes and more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan.      Information relating to in-process research and development may be found in this Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading "In-process Research and Development" included under the heading "Special Charges," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE                                                                    1997       CHANGE       1996        CHANGE        1995                                                               ---------  -----------  ---------  -------------  ---------            Selling, general and administrative.........................  $   1,286         (18%) $   1,568           (1%)  $   1,583   Percentage of net sales...................................        18%                      16%                       14%       Selling, general and administrative expenditures decreased in dollar amounts in 1997 when compared to 1996, primarily due to certain restructuring actions, including a reduction in headcount, the closing of facilities, and the writedown of assets, taken during 1997, and to lower variable expenses. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenditures as a percentage of net sales resulted from a decrease in the level of net sales. In 1996, selling, general and administrative expenditures remained essentially flat when                                         15  compared to 1995. The increase as a percentage of net sales in 1996 over 1995 was the result of a decrease in net sales during 1996.      The Company believes that selling, general and administrative expenditures will decrease in 1998 compared to 1997 as the Company completes and more fully realizes the cost reduction benefits of its restructuring plan. The Company believes that selling, general and administrative expenditures will decrease only slightly in the first quarter of 1998 compared to the fourth quarter of 1997 as a result of continued cost reduction benefits from the restructuring plan, partially offset by planned advertising spending.  SPECIAL CHARGES  IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT      As a result of the NeXT acquisition, the Company took a substantial charge for in-process research and development during 1997. Further discussion relating to the Company's acquisition of NeXT, including the related in-process research and development charge, may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading "NeXT Acquisition" included under the heading "Special Charges", which information is hereby incorporated by reference. Information relating to the Company's research and development expenditures, may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Research and Development" and in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Research and Development," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  RESTRUCTURING COSTS      Information relating to the Company's restructuring costs may be found in this Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading "Restructuring of Operations" included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading "Restructuring of Operations" included under the heading "Special Charges," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  TERMINATION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT      Information relating to the Company's termination of license agreement may be found in this Part II, Item 7 of Form 10-K under the subheading "Competition" included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading "Termination of License Agreement" included under the heading "Special Charges," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET                                                                             1997        CHANGE        1996        CHANGE       1995                                                                          -----     -----------     -----     -----------  ---------            Interest and other income (expense), net............................   $      25          (72%)  $      88           NM   $     (10)       Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased to $25 million in 1997 from $88 million in 1996. The decrease is primarily due to gains realized in 1996 on sales of available-for-sale and other securities. Interest and other income (expense), net, also decreased compared to the prior year due to decreased foreign exchange gains, net of cost, in 1997 compared to 1996, partially offset by higher average cash balances during 1997. Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to non-investment grade. The Company's cost of funds may increase as a result of the downgrading in the second quarter of 1997 of its senior and subordinated long-term debt to B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services, and the downgrading in October 1997 of its senior and subordinated long-term debt to B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and Poor's Rating Agency.                                         16      In 1996, interest and other income (expense), net, increased to $88 million in income from $10 million in expense in 1995. This $98 million favorable change was primarily composed of a favorable variance of $78 million related to net realized and unrealized foreign exchange hedging gains and lower foreign exchange hedging costs, primarily as a result of lower market and option volatility, higher U.S. interest rates compared with rates abroad, and reduced foreign currency cash flows; an increase of $73 million related to realized gains on the sale of most of the Company's available-for-sale and other equity securities during 1996, partially offset by a $52 million unfavorable variance, as a result of higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances during 1996, and an overall decline in average interest rate yields.      A summary of the Company's interest and other income (expense), net, hedge horizons and accounting for financial instruments, and notes payable to banks and long-term debt, may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES      As of September 26, 1997, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $695 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. In 1997, an increase in the valuation allowance of $208 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses which may not be realized. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset representing tax loss and credit carryforwards is dependent on the Company's ability to generate approximately $245 million of future U.S. taxable income. Management believes that it is more likely than not that forecasted U.S. income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax-planning strategies, will be sufficient to utilize the tax carryforwards prior to their expiration in 2011 and 2012 to fully recover this asset. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet its expectations of future U.S. income. As a result, the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's financial results. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. Additional information relating to income taxes, may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  RESTRUCTURING OF OPERATIONS      During 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustainable profitability. During 1997, the Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions, including significant headcount reductions, to meet the foregoing objectives. There are several risks inherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost structure. These include the risk that the Company will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore sustainable profitability and the risk that cost-cutting initiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate and remain competitive in the computer industry.      Implementation of this restructuring involves several risks, including the risk that by simplifying and modifying its product line the Company will increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially reduce overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven products and technology. Another risk of the restructuring is that by increasing the proportion of the Company's products to be manufactured under outsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality or quantity of the products manufactured and distributed, or lose the flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules in order to respond to changing market conditions. As part of its restructuring, the Company announced and                                         17  opened its on-line store, which makes available most of its products to end-users in the U.S., in November 1997. There can be no assurance the on-line store will result in greater sales. The Company also began manufacturing products on a build-to-order basis in November 1997. There can be no assurance this manufacturing process will result in decreased costs or increased gross margins. The Company is also reducing the number of wholesale and retail channel partners, particularly in the Americas, which places a greater volume of sales through fewer partners. There can be no assurance that this will not adversely impact the Company. In addition, the actions taken in connection with the restructuring could adversely affect employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain and motivate employees. Also, because the Company contemplates relying to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, the Company will have less direct control over certain of its research and development efforts, and its ability to create innovative new products may be reduced. In addition, there can be no assurance that the technologies acquired from NeXT will be successfully exploited, or that key NeXT employees and processes will be retained and successfully integrated with those at Apple. Also, the restructuring includes the winding down of the Company's Mac OS licensing program. There can be no assurance that the winding down of this program will result in greater sales, market share, and increased gross margins to the Company. In addition, there can be no assurance that this action will not result in the availability of fewer application software titles for the Mac OS, which may result in a decrease to the Company's sales, market share and gross margins. Finally, even if the restructuring is successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the Company. Although the Company believes that the actions it is taking in connection with the restructuring, including its acquisition of NeXT and the winding down of its Mac OS licensing program, should help restore marketplace confidence in the Company, there can be no assurance that such actions will enable the Company to achieve its objectives of reducing its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustainable profitability. The Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter difficulty in effectively managing the restructuring and new cost structure.      Additional information relating to the restructuring of operations may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading "Restructuring of Operations" included under the heading "Special Charges," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS      Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continuously introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. Recent introductions include certain PowerBook and Power Macintosh products, and the introduction of Mac OS 8 in July 1997. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. In addition, although the number of new product introductions may decrease as a result of the Company's restructuring actions, the risks and uncertainties associated with new product introductions may increase as the Company refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments and to the extent new product introductions are in markets that are new to the Company.      The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments for that product, which depends on many factors, some of which are not under the control of the Company. These factors may include initial large purchases by a                                         18  small segment of the user population that tends to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users ("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by users who anticipated new technology and, as a result, deferred purchases of other products; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors. These factors may be offset by others, such as the deferral of purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as "proven" and for which commonly used software products are available; and the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously in backlog.      Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply of the new products. The Company has in the past experienced difficulty in anticipating demand for new products, resulting in product shortages which have adversely affected the Company's operating results.      The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further complicated by the availability of different product configurations, which may include various types of built-in peripherals and software. Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas may be a function of the availability of third-party software in those localized versions. For example, the availability of European-language versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result in lower initial demand for the Company's new products outside the U.S., even though localized versions of the Company's products may be available.      The increasing integration of new or enhanced functions and complexity of operations of the Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or other faults could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products have been produced or shipped. If such defects were significant, the Company could incur material recall and replacement costs under product warranties.      The Company has announced plans for two operating systems. The Company plans to continue to introduce major upgrades to the current Mac OS and later introduce a new operating system (code named "Rhapsody") which is expected to offer advanced functionality based on Apple and NeXT software technologies. However, the NeXT software technologies that the Company plans to use in the development of Rhapsody were not originally designed to be compatible with the Mac OS. As a result, there can be no assurance that the development of Rhapsody can be completed at reasonable cost or at all. In addition, Rhapsody may not be fully backward-compatible with all existing applications, which could result in a loss of existing customers. Finally, it is uncertain whether Rhapsody or the planned enhancements to the current Mac OS will gain developer support and market acceptance. Inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially backward-compatible Rhapsody or of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS, or to gain developer support and market acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse impact on the Company's consolidated operating results and financial condition.  COMPETITION      The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality and hardware performance and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Many of the Company's competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company.                                         19      The Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another.      The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers that run the Microsoft Windows 95 and Windows NT operating systems. The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its perceived advantages over Windows, and the general reluctance of the Macintosh installed base to incur the costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the past several years. Recent innovations in the Windows platform, including those included in Windows 95 and Windows NT, or those expected to be included in a new version of Windows to be introduced in 1998, have added features to the Windows platform that make the differences between the Mac OS and Microsoft's Windows operating systems less significant. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future operating results and financial condition will be substantially dependent on its ability to maintain continuing improvements of the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional advantages over competing platforms.      The Company had previously entered into agreements to license its Mac OS to other personal computer vendors (the "Clone Vendors") as part of an effort to increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform. The Company recently determined that the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors under these agreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing program. As a result, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets, including the license to distribute the Mac OS, of PCC, a Clone Vendor, and has no plans to renew its other Mac OS licensing agreements. Although the Company believes that this winding down of its licensing program will help reduce the adverse impact of the licensing program on the Company's sales, market share and gross margins, there can be no assurance that this will occur. In addition, there can be no assurance that this winding down of the licensing program will not result in the availability of fewer application software titles for the Mac OS, which may result in a decrease to the Company's sales, market share and gross margins.      As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from Windows and other platforms, the Company had previously devoted substantial resources toward developing personal computer products capable of running application software designed for the Windows operating systems. These products include an add-on card containing a Pentium or 586-class microprocessor that enables users to run applications concurrently that require the Mac OS, Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 operating systems. The Company plans to transition the cross-platform business to third-parties during 1998. There can be no assurance that this transition will be successful.      The Company, International Business Machines Corporation and Motorola, Inc. had agreed upon and announced the availability of specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based hardware platform (the "Platform"). These specifications defined a "unified" personal computer architecture that would have given the Clone Vendors broad access to the Power Macintosh platform and would have utilized standard industry components. The Company had intended to license the Mac OS to manufacturers of the Platform. However, the Company has decided it will no longer support the Platform based upon its decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing program, and because of little industry support for the Platform. The decision not to further develop this Platform may affect the Company's ability to increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform.      Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including education and publishing. Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company.                                         20      In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements. Under these agreements, the companies provided patent cross licenses to each other. In addition, for a period of five years from August 1997, Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS, and the Company will bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac OS system software releases and make that product the default Internet browser for such releases. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series 'A' non-voting convertible preferred stock for $150 million. While the Company believes that its relationship with Microsoft will be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the Company competes with Microsoft, including the Windows platform. In addition, the Microsoft relationship may have an adverse effect on, among other things, the Company's relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance that the benefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages.  SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS      Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications. The Company believes that the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's recent financial losses and declining demand for the Company's products, as well as the Company's decision to wind down its Mac OS licensing program, have caused software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce a new operating system (code named "Rhapsody") could cause software developers to stop developing software for the current Mac OS. In addition, there can be no assurance that software developers will decide to develop software for the new operating system on a timely basis or at all.      Microsoft is an important developer of application software for the Company's products. Although the Company has entered into a relationship with Microsoft, which includes Microsoft's agreement to develop and ship future versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products and certain other Microsoft tools for the Mac OS, such relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many areas in which the Company competes with Microsoft. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS not covered by the relationship or upon expiration of the relationship may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system.  GLOBAL MARKET RISKS      A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's consolidated operations and financial results could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold.      Countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, have recently experienced weaknesses in their currency, banking and equity markets. These weaknesses could adversely affect consumer demand for the Company's product, the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales, the                                         21  availability and supply of product components to the Company, and ultimately the Company's consolidated results of operations.      When the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases. When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar strengthens. Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars).      While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest rates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into interest rate swap, collar, and floor transactions.      To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's consolidated operating results and financial position. The Company does not engage in leveraged hedging.      The Company's current financial condition may increase the costs of its hedging transactions, as well as affect the nature of the hedging transactions into which the Company's counterparties are willing to enter.      Additional information regarding the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate risk management programs and the accounting thereon, may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  INVENTORY AND SUPPLY      The Company makes a provision for inventories of products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand, accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled, and accrues for the estimated costs to correct any product quality problems. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may again have, a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.      The Company must order components for its products and build inventory well in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk that the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. The Company's consolidated operating results and financial condition have been in                                         22  the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.      Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the Company or otherwise. As part of its restructuring actions, the Company sold its Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI and entered into a related manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI; sold its Singapore printed circuit board manufacturing assets to NatSteel Electronics Pte., Ltd., which is expected to supply main logic boards to the Company under a manufacturing outsourcing agreement; entered into an agreement with Ryder Integrated Logistics, Inc. to outsource the Company's domestic operations transportation and logistics management; and has entered into other similar agreements to outsource the Company's European operations transportation and logistics management. As a result of the foregoing actions, the proportion of the Company's products produced and distributed under outsourcing arrangements will continue to increase. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the Company has over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the Company to liquidated damages or cancellation of the arrangement. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service. Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, the Company may remain primarily liable. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition.      Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single sources. If the supply of a key single-sourced component were to be delayed or curtailed, the Company's business and financial performance could be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The Company believes that the availability from suppliers to the personal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs presents the most significant potential for constraining the Company's ability to manufacture products. Some advanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for production and thus have limited availability. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone and automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's consolidated operating results and financial condition.      The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to supply to Company in adequate numbers microprocessors that produce superior price/performance results compared with those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, and other developers and producers of the microprocessors used by most personal computers using the Windows operating systems. The desire of IBM and Motorola to continue producing these microprocessors may be influenced by Microsoft's decision not to adapt its Windows NT operating                                         23  system software to run on the PowerPC microprocessor. IBM produces personal computers based on Intel microprocessors as well as workstations based on the PowerPC microprocessor, and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Mac OS. Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying the Company with microprocessors for the Company's products may be influenced by IBM's perception of its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor. In addition, Motorola has recently announced its intention to stop producing Mac clones. As a result, Motorola may be less inclined to continue to produce PowerPC microprocessors.      The Company's current financial condition and uncertainties related to recent events could affect the terms on which suppliers are willing to supply the Company with their products. There can be no assurance that the Company's current suppliers will continue to supply the Company on terms acceptable to the Company or that the Company will be able to obtain comparable products from alternate sources on such terms. The Company's future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to continue to obtain key components on terms substantially similar to those currently available to the Company.      Further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Raw Materials," and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the subheading "Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply and Material Product" included under the heading "Concentrations of Risk" and under the subheading "Purchase Commitments" included under the heading "Commitments and Contingencies," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION      A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the Company's products. Currently, the Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, mass merchants, cataloguers and direct to education institutions (collectively referred to as "resellers"). In addition, in November 1997 the Company began selling many of its products directly to end users in the U.S. through the Company's on-line store. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins. Most such resellers also distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels were to decide not to continue to distribute the Company's products.      Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may continue to cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. In addition, the Company has in the past and may in the future experience delays in ordering by resellers in light of uncertain demand for the Company's products. Under the Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the option to reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances without financial penalty. Resellers also have the option to return products to the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which they may be assessed fees. The Company has recently revised its channel program, including decreasing the number of resellers and reducing returns, price protection and certain rebate programs, in an effort to reduce channel inventory, increase inventory turns, increase product support within the channel and improve gross margins. In addition, in November 1997 the Company opened its on-line store in the U.S. which makes many of the Company's products available directly to the end-user. Although the Company believes the foregoing changes will improve its consolidated operating results and financial condition, there can be no assurance that this will occur.      Further discussion relating to Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Markets and Distribution," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.                                         24  CHANGE IN SENIOR MANAGEMENT      On July 9, 1997, the Company announced that Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio had resigned his positions as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer and that the Company was initiating a search for a new Chief Executive Officer. While the Company intends to name a new Chief Executive Officer as soon as practicable, there can be no assurance that the change in senior management and related uncertainties will not adversely affect the Company's consolidated operating results and financial condition during the period until a new Chief Executive Officer is hired and afterward. In addition, certain members of the Company's senior management have been with the Company for less than six months. There can be no assurance that new members of the management team can be successfully assimilated, that the Company will be able to satisfactorily allocate responsibilities or that such new members of its management will succeed in their roles in a timely and efficient manner. The Company's failure to recruit, retain and assimilate new executives, or the failure of any such executive to perform effectively, or the loss of any such executive, could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations.  CHANGES TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS      The Company announced on August 6, 1997 significant changes to its Board of Directors, replacing all but two former directors. The continuing directors are Gareth C.C. Chang, Corporate Senior Vice President, Marketing, Hughes Electronics and President, Hughes International, and Edgar S. Woolard, Jr., retired Chairman of E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Company. The new directors are William V. Campbell, President and CEO of Intuit Corp.; Lawrence J. Ellison, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Oracle Corp.; Steven P. Jobs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pixar Animation Studios; and Jerome B. York, Vice Chairman of Tracinda Corporation and former Chief Financial Officer of IBM and Chrysler Corporation.  DEPENDENCE ON KEY EMPLOYEES      During the past several years, the Company has experienced significant voluntary employee turnover as a result of employees' concerns over the Company's prospects, as well as the abundance of career opportunities available elsewhere. The Company is dependent on its key employees in order to achieve its business plan. There can be no assurance the Company will be able to attract, motivate and retain key employees. Failure to do so may have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated operating results and financial condition.  OTHER FACTORS      The Company is in the process of identifying operating and application software challenges related to the year 2000. While the Company expects to resolve year 2000 compliance issues substantially through normal replacement and upgrades of software, there can be no assurance that there will not be interruption of operations or other limitations of system functionality or that the Company will not incur substantial costs to avoid such limitations. Any failure to effectively monitor, implement or improve the Company's operational, financial, management and technical support systems could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and consolidated results of operations.      The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.      Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations which include, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave                                         25  responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. It is unclear what effect such regulations will have on the Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition.      The Company recently decided to replace its existing transaction systems in the U.S. (which include order management, product procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated system as part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency. Substantially all of the transaction systems in the European operations were replaced with the same integrated system in 1997. The Company's future consolidated operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and effectively manage the transition to this new integrated system.      Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's consolidated operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the Company's common stock price.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES      The Company's consolidated financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks, decreased to $1,434 million as of September 26, 1997, from $1,559 million as of September 27, 1996. The Company's consolidated financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments decreased to $1,459 million as of September 26, 1997, from $1,745 million as of September 27, 1996. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 26, 1997 and September 27, 1996 include $165 million and $177 million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing facility to SCI.      Cash generated by operations during 1997 totaled $188 million. Cash generated by operations was primarily the result of decreases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by the Company's net loss, adjusted for non-cash expenditures such as in-process research and development, as well as decreases in accounts payable.      Cash used to acquire NeXT totaled $384 million in 1997. The Company expects no additional cash expenditures related to the NeXT acquisition. Net cash used for the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $53 million in 1997, and consisted primarily of increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment. The Company expects that the level of capital expenditures in 1998 will be comparable to 1997.      Cash generated by financing activities in 1997 included the sale of $150 million of Apple Series A non-voting convertible preferred stock to Microsoft Corporation. Cash used by financing activities in 1997 included $161 million to retire notes payable to banks.      Over the last two years, the Company's debt ratings have been downgraded to non-investment grade. In October 1997, the Company's senior and subordinated long-term debt were downgraded to B- and CCC, respectively, by Standard and Poor's Rating Agency. In the second quarter of 1997, the Company's debt ratings were downgraded to B3 and Caa2, respectively, by Moody's Investor Services. Both Standard and Poor's Rating Agency and Moody's Investor Services have the Company on negative outlook. These actions may increase the Company's cost of funds in future periods. In addition, the Company may be required to pledge additional collateral with respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to more stringent covenants than in the past.      The Company believes that its balances of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, and continued short-term borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve months. Expected cash requirements over the next twelve months include an estimated $130 million to effect actions under the restructuring plan, most of which will be effected during the first half of fiscal                                         26  1998. No assurance can be given that the $25 million in short-term borrowings from banks can be continued, or that any additional required financing could be obtained should the restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or be unsuccessful. If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially adversely affected.      The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has proposed federal income tax deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions with the U.S. Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although a substantial number of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.                                         27  ITEM 8.
