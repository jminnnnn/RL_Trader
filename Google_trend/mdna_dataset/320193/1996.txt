Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition  and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the  consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  All information is  based on the Company's fiscal calendar.

This decline in demand and the resulting losses, coupled  with intense price competition throughout the industry, led to the  Company's decision to implement a new strategic direction intended to  improve the Company's competitiveness and restore its profitability.  The  Company has initiated programs to develop and market products and  services more selectively targeted to education, home, and business  segments.  In moving in this new strategic direction, the Company expects  to reduce the number of new product introductions and the number of  products in certain categories within its current product portfolio.  Net Sales Net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996,  decreasing $1,229 million, or 11%; $1,545 million, or 19%; and $682  million, or 23%; during the twelve, nine, and three months ended  September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in  1995, due to a decrease in net sales of Macintosh(registered trademark) computers and of peripheral products such as displays and printers.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 11%, 19%, and 26% during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same  periods in 1995. This decline in unit sales was a result of a decline or lack of growth in worldwide demand for all product families, which the  Company believes was due principally to customer concerns regarding the  Company's strategic direction, financial condition, and future prospects,  and due to delays in the shipment of certain PowerBook(registered trademark) products as a result of quality problems.  In addition, unit sales of peripheral products trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 20%, 24%, and 30% during the twelve, nine and three months ended September 27, 1996, respectively, compared with the same periods in  1995, for the reasons noted above.  The average aggregate revenue per  Macintosh unit increased slightly during the twelve and three months  ended September 27, 1996, and decreased slightly during the nine months  ended September 27, 1996, compared with the same periods in 1995,  primarily due to a continued shift in product mix toward the Company's  newer products and products with multimedia configurations, offset to  varying degrees by pricing actions across all product lines in order to   				12   stimulate demand.  The average aggregate revenue per peripheral product was flat during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995.  The average revenue per Macintosh and per peripheral unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including industrywide pricing pressures and increased competition.   International net sales represented 52% of net sales in 1996 compared with  48% of net sales in 1995.  International net sales trended downward  beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing 3%, 11% and 13%  during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996,  respectively, compared with the same periods in 1995.  Net sales in  European markets trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  1996, decreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months ended  September 27, 1996 compared with the same periods in 1995, as a result of  a decrease in Macintosh and peripheral unit sales, partially offset by an  increase in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per  peripheral unit, primarily during the first part of the year.  Net sales in  Japan trended downward beginning in the second quarter of 1996,  decreasing during the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27,  1996 compared with the same periods in 1995.  An increase in Macintosh  unit sales during these periods was more than offset by a decrease in the  average aggregate revenue per Macintosh and per peripheral unit and a  decrease in peripheral unit sales.  Domestic net sales trended downward  beginning in the second quarter of 1996, decreasing by 18%, 26%, and  30% for the twelve, nine, and three months ended September 27, 1996,  respectively, compared with the corresponding periods in 1995, resulting  from a decline or lack of growth in demand for all product families.  According to an industry source, in the fourth quarter of 1996 compared  with the fourth quarter of 1995, the Company's share of the worldwide and  U.S. personal computer markets declined to 5.4% from 8.7%, and to 7.3%  from 13.2%, respectively.   Net sales increased $1,873 million, or 20%, in 1995 over 1994, primarily  due to a combination of unit growth, higher average selling prices, and  changes in currency exchange rates.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales  increased approximately 15% over the prior year.  This unit sales growth  resulted principally from strong sales of the Company's Power  Macintosh(registered trademark) products, which accounted for more than 70% of total unit shipments during the fourth quarter of 1995, compared with 26% in the comparable period of 1994, and from sales of newer product offerings  within the Performa(registered trademark) family of desktop personal computers. This unit growth was partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of the Company's older product offerings.  The average aggregate revenue per  Macintosh unit increased 12% in 1995 compared with 1994, primarily due  to a shift in product mix toward the Company's newer products and  products with multimedia configurations.  International net sales represented 48% of net sales in 1995 compared with  46% of net sales in 1994.  International net sales grew 25% in 1995 from  1994, primarily reflecting strong net sales growth in the Pacific region,  particularly Japan.  Domestic net sales increased 16% in 1995 over 1994.  In general, the Company's resellers purchase products on an as-needed  basis.  Resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates  depending on changing market conditions.  Unfilled orders ('backlog')  can be, and often are, canceled at will.  The Company attempts to fill  orders on the requested delivery schedules.  However, products may be in  relatively short supply from time to time until production volumes have  reached a level sufficient to meet demand or if other production or  fulfillment constraints exist.  The Company's backlog was approximately  $563 million at November 29, 1996, and consisted primarily of the  Company's PowerBook products, as well as higher-end Power Macintosh  products.  In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any  particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business  prospects.  In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or  immediately following introduction of new products because of  overordering by dealers anticipating shortages.  Backlog often is reduced  once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply.   Because of the foregoing, as well as other factors affecting the Company's  backlog, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the  Company's future revenue or financial performance.   The Company believes that net sales will remain below the level of the  prior year's comparable periods through at least the first quarter of 1997, if not later.  In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company will be  able to achieve sales levels in the first quarter of 1997 comparable to the  levels achieved in the fourth quarter of 1996.  				13   Gross Margin   Gross margin represents the difference between the Company's net sales  and its cost of goods sold.  The amount of revenue generated by the sale of  products is influenced principally by the price set by the Company for its  products relative to competitive products.  The cost of goods sold is based  primarily on the cost of components and, to a lesser extent, direct labor  costs.  The type and cost of components included in particular  configurations of the Company's products (such as memory and disk  drives) are often directly related to the need to market products in  configurations competitive with those of other manufacturers.   Competition in the personal computer industry is intense, and in the short  term, frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often  necessary in order to remain competitive.  Accordingly, gross margin as a  percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by  actions undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide  competitive pressures.  Gross margin decreased to 9.8% in 1996 compared with 25.8% in 1995.   This decrease is primarily the result of a $616 million charge in the second  quarter of 1996 for the write-down of certain inventory, as well as the  costs to cancel excess component orders, necessitated by significantly  lower than expected demand for many of the Company's products,  primarily its entry-level products.  Also, the Company separately incurred  approximately $145 million in charges during the last nine months of 1996  to provide for the estimated costs to correct certain quality problems in  certain entry-level, Performa, PowerBook and peripheral products,  covering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods.  The Company  also incurred greater warranty expenses per unit sold during 1996  compared with 1995.  In addition, this decrease in gross margins is due to  the Company's response to extreme competitive actions by other  companies attempting to gain market share, including the Company's  pricing actions in the United States, Japan and Europe across most product  lines, which were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain  product components.  In the first quarter of 1997, the Company took, and  the Company expects that it will continue to take, similar pricing actions  with respect to a number of product lines.  The decrease in gross margin levels was slightly offset by hedging gains,  net of the effects of a stronger U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign  currencies.  The Company's operating and pricing strategies take into  account changes in exchange rates over time; however, the Company's  results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.     Gross margin increased both in amount and as a percentage of net sales in  1995 compared with 1994.  The increase in gross margin as a percentage  of net sales was primarily a result of a shift in product mix toward the  Company's newer, high-margin products, which included strong sales of  certain products within the Company's Power Macintosh family of  personal computers and its Macintosh Performa family.  The increase in  gross margin levels was affected favorably by changes in foreign currency  exchange rates as a result of a weaker U.S. dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in 1995 compared with 1994.   Although gross margin for 1996 was 9.8%, it improved to 22.0% during  the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of lower component costs, sales of  fully reserved product, and a shift in product mix toward the Company's  newer products and products with multimedia configurations, which tend  to have higher margins.  There can be no assurance that the Company will  be able to sustain the gross margin level achieved in the fourth quarter.   Gross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due to a  variety of factors, including continued industrywide pricing pressures,  increased competition, and compressed product life cycles.  Gross margins  could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage  quality problems and warranty costs, and to stimulate demand for certain  of its products.   Research and Development	1996	Change	1995	Change	1994             Research and development	$604     (2%)	$614      9%	$564            Percentage of net sales	6.1%		5.6%		6.1%   Research and development expenditures decreased slightly in 1996 when  compared with 1995, primarily due to the termination of certain third-party  joint development efforts.  The increase as a percentage of net sales  resulted from a decrease in the level of net sales. The increase in research  and development expenditures during 1995 compared with 1994 reflected  higher project- and headcount-related spending.  The decrease as a  percentage of net sales was the result of revenue growth in 1995 over  1994.  				14   The Company believes that continued investments in research and  development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in  the marketplace and are directly related to continued, timely development  of new and enhanced products.  The Company believes that research and  development expenditures in 1997 will be comparable to those in 1996.    Selling, General and Administrative			1996	Change	1995	Change	1994             Selling, general and administrative	      $1,568     (1%) $1,583   	 14%  $1,384      Percentage of net sales      15.9%	       14.3%	       15.1%  Selling, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat, but  increased as a percentage of net sales, in 1996 compared with 1995.  The  increase as a percentage of net sales in 1996 when compared with 1995  was the result of reduced net sales.  In 1995, selling, general and  administrative expenses increased as a result of increased advertising and  channel marketing programs.  The decrease as a percentage of net sales  was primarily the result of the sales growth in 1995 over 1994.  As a result of its restructuring plan, the Company expects that selling,  general and administrative expenditures in 1997 will decrease compared  with 1996 levels.   Restructuring Costs  For information regarding the Company's restructuring actions, refer to  page 39 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    Interest and Other Income(Expense), Net	1996	Change	1995	Change	1994             Interest and other income(expense), net	$ 88      NM 	$(10)    55% 	$(22)       Interest and other income (expense), net, increased to $88 million in  income in 1996 from $10 million in expense in 1995.  This $98 million  favorable change is primarily composed of a favorable variance of $78  million related to net realized and unrealized foreign exchange hedging  gains, and lower foreign exchange hedging costs, primarily as a result of  lower market and option volatility, higher U.S. interest rates compared  with rates abroad, and reduced foreign currency cash flows; an increase of  $73 million related to realized gains on the sale of most of the Company's  available-for-sale and other equity securities during 1996; offset by a $52  million unfavorable variance related to interest income (expense), as a  result of higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances  during the year, and an overall decline in average interest rate yields. In addition, the Company's cost of funds has increased as a result of the  downgrading from January 1996 through May 1996 of its short-term debt  to NP and C by Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating  Agency, respectively, and of its long-term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's  Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.  In 1995, interest and other income (expense), net, decreased to $10 million  in expense from $22 million in expense in 1994.  This $12 million  favorable change was primarily composed of $49 million in interest  income (expense) attributable to higher average cash balances, higher  interest rates, and interest rate hedging gains, offset in part by a $36  million unfavorable variance related to realized and unrealized foreign  exchange hedging losses and foreign exchange hedging costs.  Market  volatility and higher foreign currency balances accounted for the increased  hedging costs.

A substantial portion of this  asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax  liabilities. Realization of approximately $85 million of the asset is  dependent on the Company's ability to generate approximately $245  million of future U.S. taxable income.  Management believes that it is  more likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted U.S. income.   However, there can be no assurance that the Company will meet  its expectations of future U.S. income.  As a result, the amount of the  deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and  long term if estimates of future taxable U.S. income are reduced.  Such an  occurrence could materially adversely affect the Company's financial  results and condition.  The Company will continue to evaluate the  realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for a  valuation allowance.  For additional information regarding income taxes,  refer to pages 40 - 41 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition  The Company's future operating results and financial condition are  dependent on the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture,  and market technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic  customer demand patterns.  Inherent in this process are a number of factors  that the Company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable  future operating results and financial condition.  Potential risks and  uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and  financial condition include, without limitation, continued competitive  pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the  Company to such competitive pressures, including pricing actions by the  Company; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery to the  marketplace of successful technological innovations; the effects of  significant adverse publicity; the Company's ability to supply products in  certain categories; and uncertainties concerning the Company's ability to  successfully implement its new strategic direction and restructuring  actions.  The Company expects that it will not return to sustained profitability until  at least the second quarter of 1997, if not later.  Restructuring of Operations  During 1996, the Company began to implement certain restructuring  actions aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its competitiveness,  and restoring sustained profitability.  There are several risks inherent in the Company's efforts to transition to a new cost structure.  These include the  risk that the Company will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly  enough to restore sustained profitability and the risk that cost-cutting  initiatives will impair the Company's ability to innovate and remain  competitive in the computer industry.    As part of its restructuring effort, the Company has begun to implement a  new business model. Implementation of the new business model involves  several risks, including the risk that by simplifying its product line the  Company will increase its dependence on fewer products, potentially  reduce overall sales, and increase its reliance on unproven products and  technology. Another risk of the new business model is that by increasing  the proportion of the Company's products to be manufactured under  outsourcing arrangements, the Company could lose control of the quality  or quantity of the products manufactured, or lose the flexibility to make  timely changes in production schedules in order to respond to changing  market conditions. In addition, the new business model could adversely  affect employee morale, thereby damaging the Company's ability to retain  and motivate employees. Also, because the new business model contemplates that the Company will rely to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties, the Company will have less direct control over certain of its research and development efforts, and its ability to create innovative new products may be reduced. Finally, even if the new business model is successfully implemented, there can be no assurance that it will effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the Company. In addition, although the Company believes that the actions it is taking under its restructuring plan should help restore marketplace confidence in the Macintosh platform, there can be no assurance that such actions will be successful. 				16   For the foregoing reasons there can be no assurance that the current  restructuring actions will achieve their goals or that similar actions will not be required in the future.  The Company's future operating results and  financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter  difficulty in effectively managing the transition to the new business model  and cost structure.  For more information regarding the Company's restructuring actions  initiated in the second quarter of 1996, refer to page 39 of the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Product Introductions and Transitions   Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which  is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid  technological advances, the Company frequently introduces new products  and product enhancements.  The success of new product introductions is  dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the  Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions,  the availability of application software for new products, the effective  management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand,  the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated  demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects  in the early stages of introduction.  Accordingly, the Company cannot  determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or  results of operations.  In addition, although the number of new product  introductions may decrease under the Company's new business model, the  risks and uncertainties associated with new product introductions may  increase as the Company refocuses its product offerings on key growth  segments.  The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a  new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments  for that product, which depends on many factors, some of which are not  under the control of the Company.  These factors may include initial large  purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to purchase  new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users ("early  adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of pent-up demand by users who  anticipated new technology and, as a result, deferred purchases of other  products; and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to the  aforementioned factors.  These factors may be offset by others, such as the  deferral of purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as  "proven" and for which commonly used software products are available;  and the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain  sufficient supply of products previously in backlog.   Backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the  aforementioned demand factors, often increasing coincident with  introduction, and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they  can obtain sufficient supply of the new products.   The measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further  complicated by the availability of different product configurations, which  may include various types of built-in peripherals and software.   Configurations may also require certain localization (such as language) for  various markets and, as a result, demand in different geographic areas may  be a function of the availability of third-party software in those localized  versions.  For example, the availability of European-language versions of  software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag behind the  availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more. This may result in lower  initial demand for the Company's new products outside the United States,  even though localized versions of the Company's products may be  available.  The increasing integration of functions and complexity of operations of the  Company's products also increase the risk that latent defects or other faults could be discovered by customers or end-users after volumes of products  have been produced or shipped.  If such defects were significant, the  Company could incur material recall and replacement costs under product  warranties.  				17   Competition  The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized  by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins,  frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual  improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity  on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors.  During  1996, the Company's results of operations and financial condition were,  and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by industrywide  pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins.  The industry  has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software  functionality and hardware performance and features based on existing or  emerging industry standards.  Many of the Company's competitors have  greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources;  broader product lines; and larger installed customer bases than those of the  Company.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition may be  affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer  preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features  over another.  The Company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the  Macintosh operating system ("Mac(registered trademark) OS").  The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by  makers of computers that run the MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows  operating systems.  The Company believes that the Mac OS, with its  perceived advantages over MS-DOS and Windows, has been a driving  force behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware for the  past several years.  Recent innovations in the Windows platform, including  those introduced by Windows 95, have added features to the Windows  platform similar to those offered by the Mac OS.  The Company is  currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the  competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a  result of the recent innovations in the Windows platform.  The Company's  future operating results and financial condition may be affected by its  ability to maintain and increase the installed base for the Macintosh  platform.  The Company recently announced a new strategy with respect to  updating its operating system while redesigning its plan for a next- generation operating system.  To extend the life of its current operating  system, the Company intends to issue periodic releases consisting of  discrete operating system components.  The Company expects that this  will enable it to introduce some new functionality for the current operating  system sooner than it would be able to introduce a completely new  operating system.  Concurrently, the Company will continue development  of its next-generation operating system, focusing on increased  functionality at the possible expense of some backward compatibility.   Diminished backward compatibility in its new operating system could  result in a loss of existing customers.  Inability to introduce a next- generation operating system on a timely basis, or to gain developer support  and market accepatance for it, may have an adverse impact on the  Company's operating results and financial condition.    As part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the Macintosh  platform, the Company announced the licensing of the Mac OS to other  personal computer vendors in January 1995, as well as an additional  licensing initiative in 1996.   Several vendors currently sell products that  utilize the Macintosh operating system.  The Company believes that  licensing the operating system will result in a broader installed base on  which software vendors can develop and provide technical innovations for  the Macintosh platform.  However, there can be no assurance that the  installed base will be broadened by the licensing of the operating system or  that licensing will result in an increase in the number of application  software titles or the rate at which vendors will bring to market application software based on the Mac OS.  In addition, as a result of licensing its  operating system, the Company is forced to compete with other companies  producing Mac OS-based computer systems.  The benefits to the Company  from licensing the Mac OS to third parties may be more than offset by the  disadvantages of being required to compete with them.  As a supplemental means of addressing the competition from MS-DOS  and Windows, the Company has devoted substantial resources toward  developing personal computer products capable of running application  software designed for the MS-DOS or Windows operating systems  ("Cross-Platform Products"). These products include the RISC-based  PowerPC(trademark) microprocessor and either include the Pentium or 586-class microprocessor or can accommodate an add-on card containing a Pentium  or 586-class microprocessor.  These products enable users to run  concurrently applications that require the Mac OS, MS-DOS, Windows  3.1, or Windows 95 operating systems.   Depending on customer demand, the Company may supply customers who  purchase Cross-Platform Products with Windows operating system  software under licensing agreements with Microsoft.  However, in order to  do so, the Company will need to enter into one or more agreements with  certain Microsoft distributors.    				18   The Company, International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and  Motorola, Inc. have agreed upon and announced the availability of  specifications for a PowerPC microprocessor-based hardware reference  platform.  These specifications define a "unified" personal computer  architecture that gives access to both the Power Macintosh platform and  the PC environment.  The Company's future operating results and financial  condition may be affected by its ability to continue to implement this  agreement and to manage the risk associated with the transition to this new  hardware reference platform.   Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as  opposed to MS-DOS or Windows-based systems, are often based on the  availability of third-party software for particular applications.  The  Company believes that the availability of third-party application software  for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party  developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing,  maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products  versus software for the larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This  analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company  and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated,  and the costs of developing such software products.  To the extent the  Company's recent financial losses and declining demand for the  Company's product have caused software developers to question the  Company's position in the personal computer market, developers could be  less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing  software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their  resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger MS-DOS  and Windows market.  Microsoft Corporation is an important developer of  application software for the Company's products.  Accordingly,  Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Company's  products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the  vendor of the Windows operating systems.   The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also  dependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of the  PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to  supply to the Company in adequate numbers microprocessors that produce  superior price/performance results compared with those supplied to the  Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, the developer and producer  of the microprocessors used by most personal computers using the MS- DOS and Windows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers  based on Intel microprocessors as well as workstations based on the  PowerPC microprocessor, and is also the developer of OS/2, a competing  operating system to the Company's Mac OS.  Accordingly, IBM's interest  in supplying the Company with  microprocessors for the Company's  products may be influenced by IBM's perception of its interests as a  competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing  operating system vendor.    Several competitors of the Company, including Compaq, IBM, and  Microsoft, have either targeted or announced their intention to target  certain of the Company's key market segments, including education and  publishing.  Many of these companies have greater financial, marketing,  manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company.  The Company is integrating Internet capabilities into its new and existing  hardware and software platforms.  There can be no assurance that the  Company will be able to continue to do so successfully.  In addition, the  Internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing  number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products  addressing access to, authoring for, or communication over, the Internet.   Many of these competitors have a significant lead over the Company in  developing products for the Internet, have significantly greater financial,  marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources than the Company,  or both.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition may also  be affected by the Company's ability to successfully expand and capitalize  on its investments in other markets, such as the markets for MessagePad (registered trademark) and related products.    				19   Global Market Risks   A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international  operations.  As a result, the Company's operations and financial results  could be significantly affected by international factors, such as changes in  foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the  foreign markets in which the Company distributes its products.  When the  U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies, the U.S. dollar value of  non-U.S. dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the  U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases.  Correspondingly, the U.S. dollar value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs  increases when the U.S. dollar weakens and decreases when the U.S. dollar  strengthens.  Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other  than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is  adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies  worldwide.  Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a  strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's  consolidated sales and gross margins (as expressed in U.S. dollars).   To mitigate the short-term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates  on the Company's non-U.S. dollar-based sales, product procurement, and  operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S. dollar- based exposures.  Specifically, the Company enters into foreign exchange  forward and option contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions.   Currently, hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond  one year.  The Company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts  to hedge certain other probable but not firmly committed transactions.   Hedges of probable but not firmly committed transactions currently do not  extend beyond one year.  To reduce the costs associated with these  ongoing foreign exchange hedging programs, the Company also regularly  sells foreign exchange option contracts and enters into certain other  foreign exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and option  contracts not accounted for as hedges, including all transactions intended  to reduce the costs associated with the Company's foreign exchange  hedging programs, are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each  balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.    While the Company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest  rates of many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the  Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in  the general level of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard, changes in U.S.  interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash  equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid on its notes  payable to banks and long-term debt.  To mitigate the impact of  fluctuations in U.S. interest rates, the Company has entered into interest  rate swap, collar, and floor transactions.  Certain of these transactions are  intended to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its  cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments with the fixed-rate  interest expense on its long-term debt.  The Company also enters into these  transactions in order to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure  away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates.  These instruments  may extend the Company's cash investment horizon up to a maximum  duration of three years.  To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign  exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks  and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually  monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest  rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in  conjunction with its underlying foreign currency- and interest rate-related  exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic  perspective.  However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk  management activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned  programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact  resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or  interest rates.  In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of  gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given  period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the  underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the  Company's operating results and financial position.  The Company  generally does not engage in leveraged hedging.   The Company's current financial condition may have an impact on the  costs of its hedging transactions, as well as the willingness of its financial counter-parties to enter into hedging transactions with the Company.  Inventory and Supply  In line with the Company's efforts to redesign its business model, the  Company is taking steps to streamline its product portfolios in its key  usage areas in education, business, and the home.  This planned  simplification of product lines has resulted in inventory reserves.    Cancelation fees related to custom component inventory purchased for  anticipated product introductions that have been canceled have also been  paid or accrued.  The Company has also separately provided for the  estimated cost to correct certain quality problems in certain entry-level,  Performa, PowerBook, and peripheral products.  Although the Company  believes its inventory and related reserves are adequate, no assurance can  be given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related  charges.  				20   The Company must order components for its products and build inventory  well in advance of product shipments.  Because the Company's markets are  volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk  that the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or  insufficient inventories of particular products.  The Company's operating  results and financial condition have been and may in the future be  materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its  inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand  patterns.    Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by  third-party manufacturers, either pursuant to design specifications of the  Company or otherwise.  As a result of the Company's restructuring actions,  which include the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado,  manufacturing facility to SCI Systems, Inc. ("SCI") and a related  manufacturing outsourcing agreement with SCI, the proportion of the  Company's products produced and distributed under outsourcing  arrangements will increase.  While outsourcing arrangements may lower  the fixed cost of operations, they will also reduce the direct control the  Company has over production.  It is uncertain what effect such diminished  control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured,  or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market  conditions. Furthermore, any efforts by the Company to manage its  inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the Company to  liquidated damages or cancelation of the arrangement.    Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain  provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at  least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service.   Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, the  Company may remain primarily liable.  Any unanticipated product defect  or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract  manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future  operating results and financial condition.  The Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited  by the availability of key components.  The Company has experienced  some limitations in supply of certain microprocessors in the first quarter of  1996.  The Company believes that the availability from suppliers to the  personal computer industry of microprocessors and ASICs presents the  most significant potential for constraining the Company's ability to  produce products.  Specific microprocessors manufactured by IBM and  Motorola, Inc. are currently available only from single sources, while some  advanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp-up for  production and thus have limited availability.  The Company and other  producers in the personal computer industry also compete for other  semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced  increased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer  demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the  cellular phone and automotive industries).  Finally, the Company uses  some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer  industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs).  Continued  availability of these components may be affected if producers were to  decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of  components customized to meet the Company's requirements.  Such  product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could  decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's  operating results and financial condition.  Marketing and Distribution  A number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the  Company's products.  Currently, the Company's primary means of  distribution is through third-party computer resellers. Such resellers  include consumer channels such as mass-merchandise stores, consumer  electronics outlets, and computer superstores.  The Company's business  and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition  of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels were  to decide not to continue to distribute the Company's products.  Uncertainty over demand for the Company's products may cause resellers  to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.  Under  the Company's arrangements with its resellers, resellers have the option to  reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed, in most instances  without financial penalty.  Resellers also have the option to return products  to the Company without penalty within certain limits, beyond which they  may be assessed fees.  The Company has recently experienced a reduction  in ordering from historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty  concerning the Company's condition and prospects.  Other Factors  The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its  corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including  certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The  Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.  				21   Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may  subject the Company to environmental and other regulations which  include, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide  consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of  its useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company.  It is unclear what effect such regulation will  have on the Company's future operating results and financial condition.  The Company is currently in the process of replacing its existing  transaction systems (which include order management, product  procurement, distribution, and finance) with a single integrated system as  part of its ongoing effort to increase operational efficiency.  The  Company's future operating results and financial condition could be  adversely affected if the Company is unable to implement and effectively  manage the transition to this new integrated system.    As part of the Company's restructuring plan, the Company sold its Napa,  California, data center to MCI Systemhouse ("MCI"), and entered into a  data processing outsourcing agreement with MCI.  While this outsourcing  agreement may lower the Company's fixed costs of operations, it will also  reduce the direct control the Company has over its data processing.  It is  uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the Company's  data processing.  Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the  Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial  performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future  performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate  results or trends in future periods.  In addition, the Company's  participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant  volatility of the Company's common stock price.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents,  and short-term investments, net of notes payable to banks, increased to  $1,559 million at September 27, 1996, from $491 million at September 29,  1995.  The Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash  equivalents, and short-term investments increased to $1,745 million at  September 27, 1996, from $952 million at September 29, 1995.    The  Company's cash and cash equivalent balance at September 27, 1996,  includes $177 million pledged as collateral to support letters of credit  primarily associated with the Company's purchase commitments under the  terms of the sale of the Company's Fountain, Colorado, manufacturing  facility to SCI.  The Company's cash and cash equivalent balance at  September 29, 1995, includes $90 million pledged as collateral to support  notes payable to banks.   Cash generated by operations during 1996 totaled $519 million.  Cash  generated by operations was primarily the result of decreases in  inventories and accounts receivable, partially offset by decreases in  accounts payable and deferred tax liabilities.  As part of the Company's  restructuring plan and in order to meet certain liquidity requirements  during 1996, the Company generated $145 million of cash from the sale of  certain equity investments, and the sale of the Fountain, Colorado,  manufacturing facility to SCI and the Napa, California, data center to MCI.   The Company expects that cash generated from the sale of equity  investments and property, plant and equipment will be significantly less in  1997 compared with 1996.  Net cash used for the purchase of property,  plant, and equipment totaled $67 million in 1996, and consisted primarily  of increases in manufacturing machinery and equipment.  The Company  expects that the level of capital expenditures in 1997 will be comparable to  1996.  Notes payable to banks at September 27, 1996, were approximately $275  million lower than at September 29, 1995.  During 1996, an outstanding  loan to Apple Computer B.V., a subsidiary of the Company, was repaid in  full.  At September 27, 1996, Apple Japan, Inc., a subsidiary of the  Company, held $186 million of notes payable to several banks, with  maturity dates ranging from the end of December 1996 to May 1997.  The  majority of these loans are guaranteed by the Company.  The Company's balance of long-term debt increased during 1996 due to the  issuance of $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% unsecured  convertible subordinated notes to certain qualified parties in a private  placement.  These notes were sold at 100% of par.  These notes pay  interest semi-annually and mature on June 1, 2001.  The remainder of  long-term borrowings consists of $300 million aggregate principal amount  of 6.5% unsecured notes issued under an omnibus shelf registration  statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1994.   The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of  6.51%.  The notes pay interest semi-annually and mature on February 15,  2004.  For more information regarding the Company's long-term debt,  refer to pages XX-XX of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  				22    The Internal Revenue Service has proposed federal income tax deficiencies  for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain  prepayments thereon.  The Company contested the proposed deficiencies  for the years 1984 through 1988, and most of the issues in dispute for these  years have been resolved.  On June 29, 1995, the IRS issued a notice of  deficiency proposing increases to the amount of the Company's federal  income taxes for the years 1989 through 1991.  The Company has filed a  petition with the United States Tax Court to contest these alleged tax  deficiencies.  Management believes that adequate provision has been made  for any adjustments that may result from these tax examinations.   The Company's cost of funds has increased as a result of the downgrading  from January 1996 through May 1996 of its short-term debt to NP and C  by Moody's Investor Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency,  respectively, and of its long-term debt to B1 and B+ by Moody's Investor  Services and Standard and Poor's Rating Agency, respectively.  In  addition, the Company may be required to pledge additional collateral with  respect to certain of its borrowings and letters of credit and to agree to  more stringent covenants than in the past.  The Company believes that its  balances of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together  with continued short-term borrowings from banks, will be sufficient to  meet its operating and other cash requirements, including the impact of  planned restructuring actions, on a short- and long-term basis.  No  assurance can be given that short-term borrowings from banks can be  continued, or that any additional required financing could be obtained  should the restructuring plan take longer to implement than anticipated or  be unsuccessful.  If the Company is unable to obtain such financing, its  liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially  adversely affected.                          				23   Item 8.
