Executive Overview  The Company designs, manufactures, and marketspersonal computers and related software, services, peripherals, and networkingsolutions. The Company also designs, develops, and markets a line of portabledigital music players along with related accessories and services including theonline distribution of third-party music, audio books, music videos, shortfilms, television shows, movies, and iPod games. The Companys products andservices include the Macintosh line of desktop and notebook computers, the iPodline of portable digital music players, the Xserve server and Xserve RAIDstorage products, a portfolio of consumer and professional softwareapplications, the Mac OS X operating system, the iTunes Store, a portfolio ofperipherals that support and enhance the Macintosh and iPod product lines, anda variety of other service and support offerings. The Company sells itsproducts worldwide through its online stores, its retail stores, its directsales force, and third-party wholesalers, resellers, and value-added resellers.In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Macintosh and iPodcompatible products including application software, printers, storage devices,speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and supplies through itsonline and retail stores. The Company sells to education, consumer, creativeprofessional, business, and government customers. A further description of theCompanys products may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Kunder the heading Business.  The Company believes that for both professionals andconsumers the personal computer has become the center of an evolving digitallifestyle by integrating and enhancing the utility of advanced digital devicessuch as the Companys iPods, digital video and still cameras, televisions, CDand DVD players, cellular phones, personal digital assistants, and otherconsumer electronic devices. The attributes of the personal computer thatenable this functionality include a high-quality user interface, easy access torelatively inexpensive data storage, the ability to run complex applications,and the ability to connect easily to a wide variety of other digital devicesand to the Internet. The Company is the only participant in the personalcomputer industry that controls the design and development of the entirepersonal computerfrom the hardware and operating system to sophisticatedapplications. This, along with its products innovative industrial designs,intuitive ease-of-use, built-in graphics, multimedia and networkingcapabilities, uniquely positions the Company to offer innovative integrateddigital lifestyle solutions.  The Companys business strategy leverages its ability,through the design and development of its own operating system, hardware, and manysoftware applications and technologies, to bring to its customers around theworld compelling new products and solutions with superior ease-of-use, seamlessintegration, and innovative industrial design.  The Company participates in several highly competitivemarkets, including personal computers with its Macintosh line of computers,consumer electronics with its iPod line of portable digital music players, anddistribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. Whilethe Company is widely recognized as an innovator in the personal computer andconsumer electronic markets as well as a leader in the emerging market fordistribution of digital content, these are all highly competitive markets thatare subject to aggressive pricing and increased competition. To remaincompetitive, the Company believes increased investment in research anddevelopment (R&D) and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintainand extend its position in the markets where it competes. The Companys R&Dspending is focused on delivering timely updates and enhancements to itsexisting line of personal computers, displays, operating systems, softwareapplications, and portable digital music players; developing new digitallifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in newproduct areas such as rack-mount servers, RAID storage systems, and wirelesstechnologies. The Company also believes investment in marketing and advertisingprograms is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.  49      In June 2005, the Company announced its plan tobegin using Intel microprocessors in its computers. During 2006, the Companyintroduced new Intel-based models of the MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro, iMac,and Mac mini computers. The Companys transition to Intel microprocessors forMacintosh systems was completed in August 2006, and its transition forXserve was completed in November 2006. The MacBook Pro, MacBook, Mac Pro,iMac, and Mac mini feature Mac OS X version 10.4 Tiger, iLife 06, and theCompanys new translation technology, Rosetta, which allows most PowerPC-basedMacintosh applications to run on Intel-based Macintosh computers. There arepotential risks and uncertainties that may occur due to this transition, whichare further discussed in Item 1A under the heading Risk Factors.  The Company utilizes a variety of direct and indirectdistribution channels. The Company believes sales of its innovative anddifferentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who canconvey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration,demonstrate the unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only onMacintosh computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Macintosh withthe Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing ahigh-quality sales and after-sales support experience is critical to attractingand retaining customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for itsproducts in which service and education are emphasized, the Company hasexpanded and improved its distribution capabilities by opening its own retailstores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 165 stores open as of September 30,2006.  The Company also staffs selected third-party storeswith the Companys own employees to improve the buying experience throughreseller channels. The Company has deployed Apple employees and contractors inreseller locations around the world including the U.S., Europe, Japan, andAustralia. The Company also sells to customers directly through its onlinestores around the world.  To improve access to theiPod product line, the Company has significantly expanded the number ofdistribution points where iPods are sold. The iPod product line can bepurchased in certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, largeretail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channelslisted above.  Critical AccountingPolicies and Estimates  The preparation of financial statements and relateddisclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principlesand the Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition andresults of operations require the Companys management to make judgments,assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in its consolidatedfinancial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 of the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K describes thesignificant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of theCompanys consolidated financial statements. Management bases its estimates onhistorical experience and on various other assumptions it believes to bereasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis formaking judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actualresults may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material.  Management believes theCompanys critical accounting policies and estimates are those related torevenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation andinventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, andincome taxes. Management believes these policies to be critical because theyare both important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition andresults, and they require management to make judgments and estimates aboutmatters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys senior management hasreviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with theAudit and Finance Committee of the Companys Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition  Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the saleof hardware, software, peripherals, digital content, and service and supportcontracts. The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting   50      standards, including American Institute of CertifiedPublic Accountants Statement of Position (SOP) No. 97-2,  Software Revenue Recognition , as amended, and SEC StaffAccounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104,  Revenue Recognition.  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasiveevidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price isfixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considereddelivered to the customer once it has been shipped, and title and risk of losshave been transferred. For most of the Companys product sales, these criteriaare met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals,for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales,the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product because theCompany retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. Ifat the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee isnot, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable, revenue is deferred andsubsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all othercriteria for revenue recognition have been met.  The Company recordsreductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection andfor customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, andother sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involvingprice protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount tobe refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliablyestimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Ifrefunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliableestimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentiveprograms, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later ofthe date at which the Company has sold the product or the date at which theprogram is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expectedfuture product returns based on the Companys historical experience. Futuremarket conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increasecustomer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligationsthat could result in additional reductions to revenue at the time such programsare offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs requiremanagement to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem theincentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditionsof particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion ofcustomers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to recordadditional reductions to revenue, which could have a material adverse impact onthe Companys results of operations.  Allowance forDoubtful Accounts  The Company distributes its products throughthird-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education,consumer, and commercial customers. The Company generally does not requirecollateral from its customers; however, the Company will require collateral incertain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Companydoes attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurancefor certain customers in Latin America, Europe, Asia, and Australia and byarranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangementsand other loan and lease programs to the Companys direct customers. Thesecredit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financingcompany and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assumeany recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral,third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with theCompanys distribution and retail channel partners.  Theallowance for doubtful accounts is based on managements  assessment ofthe collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration ofthe credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers.   The Company records an allowance to reducethe specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to becollectible . The Company also records anallowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including  historicalexperience with bad debts, the general economic   51      environment, the financialcondition of the Companys distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables.   If there is a deterioration of a majorcustomers financial condition, if the Company becomes aware of additionalinformation related to the credit worthiness of a major customer, or if futureactual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from thosecurrently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance fordoubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustmentswere made.  Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments  The Company must order components for its products andbuild inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records awrite-down for inventories of components and products, including third-partyproducts held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipateddemand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review ofinventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple factors including demandforecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current saleslevels, and component cost trends. The personal computer and consumerelectronic industries are subject to a rapid and unpredictable pace of productand component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or marketconditions for the Companys products are less favorable than forecasted or ifunforeseen technological changes negatively impact the utility of componentinventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs whichwould negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs wererecorded.  The Company accruesreserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that havebeen cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industrypractice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchaseorders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demandinformation. These commitments typically cover the Companys requirements forperiods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and substantialdecline in demand for one or more of the Companys products or an unanticipatedchange in technological requirements for any of the Companys products, theCompany may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation feesthat would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellationfees are identified.  Warranty Costs  The Company provides currently for the estimated costfor hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue isrecognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historicaland projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific product failures thatare outside of the Companys typical experience. Each quarter, the Companyreevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warrantyliabilities considering the size of the installed base of products subject towarranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary.  If actual product failure rates or repair costsdiffer from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would berequired and could  negatively affect the Companys results ofoperations.  The Company periodicallyprovides updates to its applications and system software to maintain thesoftwares compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop suchupdates is accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the timerelated software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determiningappropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of unitsdelivered, the number of updates expected to occur, and the historical cost andestimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.  Stock-BasedCompensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation inaccordance with SFAS No. 123R. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 123R,stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the awardsfair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) option-pricingmodel and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period. TheBSM model requires various highly   52      judgmental assumptions including volatility,forfeiture rates, and expected option life. If any of the assumptions used inthe BSM model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differmaterially in the future from that recorded in the current period.  In connection with theCompanys restatement of its consolidated financial statements, the Company hasapplied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates for prioroption grants. Information regarding the restatement, including ranges ofpossible additional stock-based compensation expense if other measurement dateshad been selected for certain grants, is set forth in the Explanatory Noteimmediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and in Note 2, Restatement ofConsolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements of this Form 10-K.  Income Taxes  The Company records a tax provision for theanticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. Inaccordance with SFAS No. 109,  Accounting for IncomeTaxes , the provision for income taxes is computed using the assetand liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities arerecognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences betweenthe financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and foroperating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets andliabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply totaxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expectedto be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reducedeferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to berealized.  Management believes it is more likely than not thatforecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result ofcertain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferredtax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred taxassets. In the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets aredetermined not to be realizable in the future, an adjustment to the valuationallowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.Similarly, if the Company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that werepreviously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowancewould be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the periodsuch determination is made. In addition, the calculation of tax liabilitiesinvolves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in theapplication of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a mannerinconsistent with managements expectations could have a material impact on theCompanys results of operations and financial position.  53      Net Sales

(h)               Derived by dividing total iPod net salesby total iPod unit sales.  54      Fiscal Year 2006 versus 2005  Net sales during2006 increased 39% or $5.4 billion from 2005. This increase was due in part tothe fact that 2006 spanned 53 weeks while 2005 spanned 52 weeks. Several otherfactors contributed to these increases including the following:  ·         Net sales of  iPods increased $3.1 billion or 69% during 2006compared to 2005. Unit sales of iPods totaled 39.4 million in 2006, whichrepresents an increase of 75% from 22.5 million iPod units sold in 2005. StrongiPod sales during 2006 reflected significant sales of both  the hard-drive based iPod that supports video,first introduced in October of 2005 and the iPod nano, introduced in September 2005,as well as continued expansion of iPod distribution points.  During 2006,the net sales per iPod unit sold decreased by 3% compared to 2005 primarily dueto an overall decrease in average selling prices for all iPods as well as ashift in product mix to the iPod nano. From the introduction of the iPod in2002 through 2006, the Company has sold approximately 68 million iPods.  ·         Macintosh net salesincreased $1.1 billion or 18% during 2006 compared to 2005. Macintosh unitsales increased by 769,000 units or 17% during 2006 compared to 2005.  These increases were mainly due to strong demandfor the Intel-based MacBook and MacBook Pro systems and reflect a shift inproduct mix to portable products in all of the Companys operating segments. Netsales and unit sales of the Companys portable products increased 43% and 42%,respectively, during 2006 compared to 2005. Macintosh desktop net sales andunit sales both decreased by 3% during 2006 compared to 2005. The decrease insales of the Companys Macintosh desktops was due to declines in sales of theCompanys professional-oriented desktop products. The Company believes thedecline in the Companys professional-oriented desktop products was due tocustomers delaying purchases of such products in anticipation of the release ofthe Intel-based Mac Pro, which did not begin shipping until August 2006,and updated software applications capable of running on Intel-based Macintoshcomputers, and the trend toward portable computers. A slight increase of 1%during 2006 in net sales per Macintosh unit sold was due to a shift in mix tohigher-priced portable products, partially offset by price reductions oncertain Macintosh systems.  ·         Othermusic related products and services consists of sales associated with theiTunes Store and iPod services and accessories. Net sales of other musicrelated products and services increased $986 million or 110% during 2006compared to 2005. The increase was primarily due to increased net sales fromthe iTunes Store and Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories andservices. The increase in sales from the iTunes Store stemmed from significantgrowth in U.S. sales and the opening of The iTunes Store in Japan during August 2005and Australia during October 2005. The increased sales from the iTunesStore were also attributable to the availability of videos, television shows,and feature-length movie downloads.  ·         Net sales of software,service, and other sales increased $188 million or 17% during 2006 compared to2005. The growth was primarily attributable to increased net sales of  AppleCare Protection Plan (APP) extended serviceand support contracts  and application software, partially offset by adecrease in sales of Mac OS X.  Mac OS Xsales were particularly high in 2005 due to the release of Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005.  Offsetting thefavorable factors discussed above, the Companys net sales during 2006 werenegatively impacted by the following:  ·         Net sales of  peripherals and other hardware declined $26 millionor 2% compared to 2005 primarily due to price decreases and a decrease in netsales of displays relating to a shift in mix from desktop to portable systems. Thedecrease in net sales of displays for 2006 is consistent with the overalldecrease in unit sales of Macintosh professional desktop systems.  55      Fiscal Year 2005 versus 2004  During 2005, netsales increased 68% or $5.7 billion from 2004. Several factors contributedfavorably to net sales during 2005:  ·         Net sales of  iPods rose $3.2 billion or 248% during 2005 comparedto 2004. Unit sales of iPods totaled 22.5 million in 2005, which represented anincrease of 409% from the 4.4 million iPod units sold in 2004. Strong sales ofiPods during 2005 were experienced in all of the Companys operating segmentsand was driven by  strong demand for the iPodshuffle introduced in January 2005, the release of an updated version ofthe iPod mini in February 2005, the release of the iPod nano in September 2005,and expansion of the iPods distribution network . Net sales per iPodunit sold decreased 32% primarily due to the introduction of the lower pricediPod shuffle in January 2005 and iPod mini pricing reductions in February 2005.From the introduction of the iPod in 2002 through 2005, the Company had soldapproximately 28 million iPods.  ·         Netsales of other music related products and services increased $621 million or223% during 2005 compared to 2004. The Company experienced strong growth insales of iPod services and accessories consistent with the increase in overalliPod unit sales for 2005. The increased sales from the iTunes Store wereprimarily due to substantial growth of net sales in the U.S. and expansion inEurope, Canada, and Japan.  ·         TotalMacintosh net sales increased $1.4 billion or 27% during 2005 compared to 2004.Unit sales of Macintosh systems increased 1.2 million units or 38% during 2005compared to 2004. The increases in Macintosh net sales and unit sales relatedprimarily to strong demand for the Companys desktop products, which wasexperienced in all of the Companys operating segments. The Company believesthat the success of the iPod had a positive impact on Macintosh net sales byintroducing new customers to the Companys other products. Desktop demand wasstimulated in 2005 due to the iMac G5 and the introduction of the Mac mini in January 2005.Net sales and unit sales of desktop products increased 45% and 55%,respectively, during 2005 compared to 2004. Macintosh net sales and unit salesalso included sales of the Companys portable products, which increased 11% and21%, respectively, compared to 2004.  Net sales per Macintoshunit sold decreased 7% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was the resultof changes in the overall unit mix towards relatively lower-priced consumerproducts, specifically the impact of the Mac mini product, and desktop andportable price reductions. This decrease was partially offset by an increase inthe proportion of direct sales.  ·         Netsales of peripherals and other hardware rose by 18% during 2005 compared to2004 primarily due to an increase in net sales of displays and other computeraccessories.  Net sales  of otherhardware include AirPort cards and base stations, Xserve RAID storage, iSightdigital video cameras, and third-party hardware products.  ·         Net sales of software, service and other salesrose $270 million or 33% during 2005 compared to 2004. This growth wasprimarily attributable to increased net sales in APP extended service andsupport contracts, driven primarily by higher associated Macintosh computersales. Additionally, the Company experienced increases in net sales of .MacInternet service, professional and consumer applications, third-party software,and Mac OS X that was primarily attributable to the release of version 10.4Tiger in April 2005.  Segment OperatingPerformance  The Company manages itsbusiness primarily on a geographic basis. The Companys reportable operatingsegments are comprised of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. TheAmericas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activitiesrelated to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North andSouth America. The Europe segment includes European countries as well as the   56      Middle East and Africa.The Retail segment operated Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S., Canada,Japan, and the U.K. during 2006. Each reportable geographic operating segmentprovides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Furtherinformation regarding the Companys operating segments may be found in Note 11,Segment Information and Geographic Data in Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements of this Form 10-K.  Americas  During 2006, net sales in the Americas segmentincreased $2.7 billion, or 41%, compared to 2005. The main factors for thisincrease were significant increases in net sales of iPods, other music relatedproducts and services, Macintosh portable systems, and APP. Sales of iPodsincreased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod withvideo-playing capabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005.The increase in other music related products and services was due to increasesin sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and sales from theiTunes Store. The increase in sales of Macintosh portable systems in theAmericas was due to strong sales of the Intel-based MacBook and MacBook Produring 2006. The overall increase in net sales was partially offset by adecline in net sales of desktops, displays, and Mac OS X. The decrease indesktop products and displays net sales reflects the overall shift in productmix toward portable Macintosh systems. Mac OS X sales decreased from 2005 sincethe Company has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger beganshipping in April 2005. During 2006, the Americas segment representedapproximately 48% of the Companys total net sales as compared to 47% in thesame period of 2005. During 2006, U.S. education channel net sales andMacintosh unit sales increased by 13% and 11%, respectively, compared to 2005.Net sales from the higher education market grew 22% during 2006 compared to2005 due to strong sales of Macintosh portable products and iPods. Net saleswere relatively flat for K-12 due to continued budget constraints.  During 2005, net sales inthe Americas segment grew 64% or $2.6 billion compared to 2004. The increase innet sales during 2005 was primarily attributable to the significantyear-over-year increase in iPod sales, sales of other music related productsand services, and strong sales of desktop and portable Macintosh systems. Thisincrease was partially offset by a shift in sales to the Retail segment, whichhad 117 stores in the U.S. and Canada as of the end of 2005. Macintosh unitsales also increased by 30% in 2005 compared to 2004, driven primarily bystrong sales of desktop systems largely attributable to strong sales from theupdated iMac, which began shipping in September 2004, and the Mac mini,which was introduced in January 2005. During 2005 and 2004, the Americassegment represented approximately 47% and 49%, respectively, of the Companystotal net sales and represented approximately 48% and 51%, respectively, oftotal Macintosh unit sales. The Company experienced an increase in both U.S.education channel net sales and unit sales of 21% for 2005 compared to 2004.Strength in higher education sales related primarily to strong iMac andportable system shipments. This strength drove year-over-year growth in netsales of 32% for the higher education channel during 2005. Despite challengesin the K-12 market from continued budget constraints and competitivepressures, the Companys K-12 net sales grew year-over-year by 11% during2005 due to increased iBook sales and 1:1 education sales.  Europe  Europe segment net sales increased $1.0 billion or 33%during 2006 compared to 2005. Consistent with the Americas segment, theseincreases were a result of strong growth in iPod sales, other music relatedproducts and services, and Macintosh portable systems. Sales of iPods increasedprimarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod with video-playingcapabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005.The increase in other music related products and services was due to increasesin sales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories and sales from theiTunes Store. The increase in sales of portable systems in Europe was due tostrong sales of the Intel-based MacBook and MacBook Pro that were introducedduring 2006. In addition, Europe also reported increased sales in APP relatedto the increase in Macintosh unit sales. These increases were partially offsetby a decrease in desktop and   57      Mac OS X net sales during 2006 compared to2005. The decrease in desktop net sales was due to the shift in product mix towardportable Macintosh systems. Mac OS X sales have decreased from 2005 since theCompany has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tiger began shippingin April 2005.  During 2005, net sales inthe Europe segment grew $1.3 billion or 71% from 2004. Total Macintosh unitsales in Europe also experienced growth during the current year by increasing47% in 2005 compared to 2004. Consistent with the Americas segment, Europeexperienced strong net sales of desktop products, iPod, other music relatedproducts and services, and software and service sales. Demand in Europe during2005 was particularly strong for the Companys desktop computers, whichexperienced a year-over-year increase of 56% from 2004. Similar to the resultsof the Companys other segments, net sales of iPods, peripherals and softwarewere strong in 2005.  Japan  Japans net sales increased $288 million or 31% during2006 compared to 2005. The Japan segment experienced increased net sales iniPods,  Macintosh portable products, and other music related products and services. Consistent with the Companysother segments, Japan experienced increases in sales of iPods due to theintroduction of the iPod with video-playing capabilities and the iPod nano in October andSeptember of 2005, respectively. Japan also experienced strong sales ofthe Intel-based MacBook and increased sales from the iTunes Store. Theseincreases were partially offset by decreases in net sales of Macintosh desktopproducts, displays, and Mac OS X. The decreases in desktop products anddisplays reflect the overall shift in product mix toward portable Macintoshsystems.  Mac OS X sales have decreased from2005 since the Company has not released a new version of Mac OS X since Tigerbegan shipping in April 2005.  Total Macintosh unit sales during2006 remained relatively flat compared to 2005. The relatively flat growth inMacintosh unit sales is partially attributable to Japans overall slow consumerPC market growth. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways to improve itsindirect and direct channel sales in Japan.  Japans net sales andMacintosh unit sales were up 36% and 8%, respectively, during 2005 compared to2004. Japan experienced increased net sales in desktop products, iPod, andother music related products and services. Desktop net sales and unit salesincreased by 31% and 41%, respectively, and iPod sales increased by 220% during2005 compared to 2004. The overall increase in net sales was partially offsetby a decline in portable system net sales during 2005 compared to 2004, whichthe Company believes might have been attributable to a shift in sales fromportables to the iMac G5 and Mac mini, and a shift to the Retail segment as aresult of opening two additional stores in Japan during 2005.  Retail  The Company opened 41 new retail stores during 2006,including a total of 10 international stores in the U.K., Japan, and Canada,bringing the total number of open stores to 165 as of September 30, 2006. Thiscompares to 124 open stores as of September 24, 2005 and 86 open stores asof September 25, 2004.  The Retail segments net sales increased by 43% to$3.4 billion during 2006 compared to 2005. Retail segment Macintosh unit salesincreased 45% during 2006 compared to 2005. With an average of 142 stores open during 2006, average revenue per storeincreased to $23.6 million compared to $22.4 million during 2005 and $15.6million in 2004. The current year increase  was primarily due to strongsales of Macintosh portable and desktop products, iPods, and other musicrelated products and services.  Sales ofiPods increased primarily due to the introduction of the updated iPod withvideo-playing capabilities in October 2005 and the iPod nano during September 2005.The increase in other music related products and services was due to increasedsales of Apple-branded and third-party iPod accessories. Macintosh portable anddesktop sales increased due to strong sales of the Intel-based MacBook, MacBookPro, and iMac.  As measured by the Companys operating segmentreporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $198 million during2006 as compared to operating income of $151 million during 2005 and   58      operating income of $39 million during 2004. Thisimprovement was primarily attributable to the impact of opening new stores andthe segments year-over-year increase in average revenue per store, whichresulted in higher leverage on occupancy, depreciation, and other fixed costs.  Expansion of the Retailsegment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment infixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease commitments,personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital expenditures associated withthe Retail segment were $200 million in 2006, bringing the total capitalexpenditures since inception of the Retail segment to approximately $729million. As of September 30, 2006, the Retail segment had approximately5,787 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated withretail store space and related facilities of approximately $887 million. TheCompany would incur substantial costs if it were to close its retail stores.Such costs could adversely affect the Companys results of operations andfinancial condition.  Gross Margin  Grossmargin for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions,except gross margin percentages):                September 30,         September 24,         September 25,                     2006         2005         2004                               As Restated (1)         As Restated (1)           Net sales              $    19,315                   $    13,931                   $    8,279                Cost of sales              13,717                   9,889                   6,022                Gross margin              $    5,598                   $    4,042                   $    2,257                Gross margin percentage              29.0    %              29.0    %              27.3    %            (1)            See the ExplanatoryNote immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatement ofConsolidated Financial Statements in Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements of this Form 10-K.  Gross margin percentage of 29.0% in 2006 remained flatas compared to 2005. The Company experienced more favorable pricing on certaincommodity components including LCD flat-panel displays and DRAM memory andhigher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed productioncosts, offset by an increase in lower margin iPod sales and other music-relatedservices.  The Company anticipates that its gross margin and thegross margins of the personal computer and consumer electronics industries willbe under pressure due to price competition. The Company expects gross marginpercentage to decline sequentially in the first quarter of 2007 primarily as aresult of a shift in the mix of revenue toward lower margin products such asthe iPod and content from the iTunes Store.  The foregoing statements regarding the Companysexpected gross margin percentage are forward-looking. There can be no assurancethat current gross margin percentage will be maintained or targeted grossmargin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins andmargins on individual products, including iPods, will remain under significantdownward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industrywide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product lifecycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material andoutside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Companys productmix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower averageselling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these competitivepressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions withrespect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Companysability to effectively manage product quality and warranty costs and tostimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Companys significantinternational operations, financial results can be significantly affected inthe short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.  The Company orders components for its products andbuilds inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Companys marketsare volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a   59      risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produceor order from third-parties excess or insufficient inventories of particularproducts or components. The Companys operating results and financial conditionin the past have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected bythe Companys ability to manage its inventory levels and outstanding purchasecommitments and to respond to short-term shifts in customer demandpatterns.  Gross margin percentageincreased in 2005 to 29.0% of net sales from 27.3% of net sales in 2004. TheCompanys gross margin during 2005 increased due to more favorable pricing oncertain commodity components including LCD flat-panel displays and DRAM memory;an increase in higher margin software sales; a favorable shift in direct salesrelated primarily to the Companys retail and online stores; and higher overallrevenue that provided for more leverage on fixed production costs. Theseincreases to gross margin were partially offset by an increase in lower marginiPod sales.  Operating Expenses  Operatingexpenses for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (in millions,except for percentages):                September 30,         September 24,         September 25,                     2006         2005         2004                               As Restated (1)         As Restated (1)           Research and  development              $    712                   $    535                   $    491                Percentage of net sales              4    %              4    %              6    %           Selling, general,  and administrative expenses              $    2,433                   $    1,864                   $    1,430                Percentage of net sales              13    %              13    %              17    %           Restructuring costs              $                       $                       $    23                 (1)            Seethe Explanatory Note immediately preceding Part I, Item 1 and Note 2, Restatementof Consolidated Financial Statements, in Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements of this Form 10-K.  Research andDevelopment (R&D)  Expenditures for R&Dincreased 33% or $177 million to $712 million in 2006 compared to $535 millionin 2005. The increase was due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount inthe current year to support expanded R&D activities, an increase of $46million in stock-based compensation recognized as R&D expense resultingfrom the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, and higher overall expenses due to  the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of2006  to realign the Companys fiscal quarters with calendar quarters .  In addition, during 2005, the Companycapitalized approximately $29.7 million of costs associated with thedevelopment of Mac OS X Tiger. No software development costs were capitalizedduring 2006. Further information related to the Companys capitalization ofsoftware development costs may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-Kat Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Despite the increasein expenditures, R&D as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flatin 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the significant increase in revenue. TheCompany continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are criticalto its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and aredirectly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that arecentral to the Companys core business strategy. As such, the Company expectsto make further investments in R&D to remain competitive.  Selling, General,and Administrative Expense (SG&A)  Expenditures for SG&A increased $569 million or31% during 2006 compared to 2005. These increases are due primarily to theCompanys continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic andinternational markets, an increase of $50 million in stock-based compensationexpense recognized as   60      SG&A expense resulting from the adoption of SFAS No. 123R,a current year increase in discretionary spending on marketing and advertising,higher direct and channel selling expenses resulting from the increase in netsales and employee salary merit increases, and  the expenses associated with the 14th week added to the first fiscalquarter of 2006 . Despite the increase in expenditures, SG&A as apercentage of total net sales in 2006 remained flat as compared to 2005.  Expenditures for SG&Aincreased $434 million or 30% during 2005 compared to 2004. These increases aredue primarily to the Companys continued expansion of its Retail segment inboth domestic and international markets, a current year increase indiscretionary spending on marketing and advertising, and higher direct andchannel selling expenses resulting from the increase in net sales and employeesalary merit increases. SG&A as a percentage of total net sales in 2005 was13%, down from 17% in 2004, which is due to the increase in total net sales of68% for the Company during 2005.  Fiscal 2004 RestructuringActions  During 2004, the Companyrecorded total restructuring charges of approximately $23.0 million, includingapproximately $14.0 million in severance costs, $5.5 million in assetimpairments, and $3.5 million for lease cancellations. The lease cancellationsrelate to vacating a leased sales facility as a result of a European workforcereduction during 2004. Of the $23.0 million charges, $21.3 million had beenutilized by the end of 2006, with the remainder consisting of $1.7 million forlease cancellations. These actions resulted in the termination of 452positions.  Other Income andExpense  Otherincome and expense for each of the last three fiscal years are as follows (inmillions):                September 30,         September 24,         September 25,                     2006         2005         2004           Gains on  non-current investments, net              $                       $                       $    4                Interest income              $    394                   $    183                   $    64                Interest expense                                                    (3    )           Other income  (expense), net              (29    )              (18    )              (8    )           Interest and  other income, net              $    365                   $    165                   $    53                Total other  income and expense              $    365                   $    165                   $    57                   Gains and Losses onNon-current Investments  The Company previouslyheld significant investments in ARM Holdings plc (ARM),  Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), and EarthLink Network, Inc.(EarthLink). T he Company sold all of the remaining holdings in thesenon-current investments in 2004 and 2003. Pretax gains recorded upon the saleof these non-current investments were $4 million in 2004.  Interest and OtherIncome, Net  Total interest and other income, net increased $200million or 121% to $365 million during 2006 compared to $165 million in2005 and $53 million in 2004. These increases are attributable primarily tohigher cash and short-term investment balances and increasing investment yieldsresulting from higher market interest rates and  the 14th week added to the first fiscal quarter of 2006 . Theweighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cashequivalents, and short-term investments increased to 4.58% in 2006 compared tothe 2.70% and 1.38% rates earned during 2005 and 2004, respectively. Thecurrent year increase in other income was partially offset by higher foreigncurrency hedging expenses.  Interest expense in 2004consisted primarily of interest on the Companys $300 million aggregateprincipal amount unsecured notes, which were repaid upon their maturity in February 2004.The unsecured notes   61      were sold at 99.925% ofpar for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. Total deferred gain resultingfrom the closure of debt swaps of approximately $23 million was fully amortizedas of the notes maturity in February 2004.  Provision forIncome Taxes  The Companys effective tax rate for the year ended September 30,2006 was approximately 29%. The Companys effective rate differs from thestatutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributedforeign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings areintended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. In addition, theCompany recorded a tax benefit of $20 million due to settlement of prior yeartax audits in the U.S., and a net benefit of $20 million resulting from thedividend repatriation under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) andinternational tax planning strategies associated with the repatriation asfurther discussed below.  As of September 30, 2006, the Company haddeferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses,and tax credits of $739 million before being offset against certain deferredliabilities and a valuation allowance for presentation on the Companys balancesheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income,including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planningstrategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, willbe sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. As of September 30,2006 and September 24, 2005, a valuation allowance of $5 million wasrecorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of state operatinglosses that may not be realized. The Company will continue to evaluate therealizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need forand amount of the valuation allowance.  On October 22, 2004, the AJCA was signed into law.The AJCA included a provision for the deduction of 85% of certain foreignearnings that were repatriated, as defined in the AJCA, within a specified timeframe. Among other requirements, dividends qualifying for the 85% deductionmust be reinvested in the United States in certain qualified investmentspursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan approved by the CEO and Board ofDirectors. During 2006, the Company repatriated approximately $1.6 billion offoreign earnings. Of the earnings repatriated, $755 million is eligible for thereduced tax rate provided by the AJCA. Accordingly, the Company recorded a taxcharge of $51 million related to the repatriation of foreign earnings under theprovisions of the AJCA. In addition, the Company recorded a tax benefit of $71 millionresulting from the implementation of tax planning strategies to recognizedeferred tax assets that were previously not recognizable within certainforeign subsidiaries.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has substantiallycompleted its field audit of the Companys federal income tax returns for theyears 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company intendsto contest certain of these adjustments through the IRS Appeals Office. Substantiallyall IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition,the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Managementbelieves that adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that mayresult from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot bepredicted with certainty. Should any issues addressed in the Companys taxaudits be resolved in a manner not consistent with managements expectations,the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in theperiod such resolution occurs.  62      Quarterly FinancialInformation  Thefollowing tables set forth a summary of the Companys quarterly financialinformation for each of the four quarters in the

SAB No. 108 is effective for fiscal years endingafter November 15, 2006. Although the Company will continue to evaluatethe application of SAB No. 108, management does not currently believeadoption will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations orfinancial position.  In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements,  which definesfair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands thedisclosures required for fair value measurements.

Lease terms on the Companys existingmajor facility operating leases range from 5 to 15 years.  PurchaseCommitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers  The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers tomanufacture sub-assemblies for the Companys products and to perform finalassembly and test of finished products. These contract manufacturers acquirecomponents and build product based on demand information supplied by theCompany, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. TheCompany also obtains individual components for its products from a wide varietyof individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Companyacquires components through a combination of purchase orders, suppliercontracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such purchasecommitments typically cover the Companys forecasted component andmanufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. As of September 30,2006, the Company had outstanding third-party manufacturing commitments and componentpurchase commitments of approximately $2.3 billion.  During 2006, the Companyentered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix Semiconductor, Inc.,Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.,and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendaryear 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion forflash memory components during 2006. These prepayments will be applied toinventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement.  Asset RetirementObligations  The Companys assetretirement obligations are associated with commitments to return propertysubject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As ofSeptember 30, 2006, the Company estimates that gross expected future cashflows of approximately $19 million will be required to fulfill theseobligations.  Other Obligations  The Companys otherobligations of approximately $39 million are primarily related to Internet andtelecommunications services.  Indemnifications  The Company generally does not indemnify end-users ofits operating system and application software against legal claims that thesoftware infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreementsentered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions underwhich the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of aninfringement claim against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However,the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resultingfrom such an infringement claim asserted against itself or an indemnifiedthird-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a liabilityrelated to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that wouldhave a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or resultsof operations.  69      Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Interest Rate andForeign Currency Risk Management  The Company regularlyreviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions and its interest rateswap and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunctionwith its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures.However, given the effective horizons of the Companys risk managementactivities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be noassurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impactresulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. Inaddition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and lossesrelated to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may notcoincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economicexposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Companys operating resultsand financial position.  Interest Rate Risk  While the Company is exposed to interest ratefluctuations in many of the worlds leading industrialized countries, theCompanys interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in thegeneral level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interestrates affect the interest earned on the Companys cash, cash equivalents, andshort-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currencyhedges.  The Companys short-term investment policy andstrategy is to ensure the preservation of capital, meet liquidity requirements,and optimize return in light of the current credit and interest rateenvironment. A portion of the Companys cash is managed by external managerswithin the guidelines of the Companys investment policy and to an objectivemarket benchmark. The Companys internal portfolio is benchmarked againstexternal manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs.  The Companys exposure to market risk for changes ininterest rates relates primarily to the Companys investment portfolio. TheCompany places its short-term investments in highly liquid securities issued byhigh credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of creditexposure to any one issuer. The Companys general policy is to limit the risk ofprincipal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market andcredit risk. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of threemonths or less are classified as cash equivalents; highly liquid investmentswith initial maturities greater than three months are classified as short-terminvestments. As of September 30, 2006, approximately $921 million of theCompanys short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5years. As of September 24, 2005, $287 million of the Companys short-terminvestments had underlying maturities ranging from 1 to 5 years. The remainderall had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell itsinvestments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipationof credit deterioration or for duration management. The Company recognized netlosses before taxes of $434,000 and $137,000 in 2006 and 2005, respectively,and a net gain before taxes of $1 million in 2004 as a result of such sales.  To provide a meaningfulassessment of the interest rate risk associated with the Companys investmentportfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impacta change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolioassuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield curve. Based oninvestment positions as of September 30, 2006, a hypothetical 100 basispoint increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $15.2million decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of September 24,2005, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted ina $19.9 million decline in fair value. Such losses would only be realized ifthe Company sold the investments prior to maturity.  70      Foreign CurrencyRisk  In general, the Company is a net receiver of foreigncurrencies. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular astrengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Companys net salesand gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. There is also a risk theCompany will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitivepressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currencyexchange rates.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward andoption contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreignexchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmlycommitted transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments inforeign subsidiaries. Generally, the Companys practice is to hedge a majorityof its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, theCompany may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due toimmateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, andlimited availability of appropriate hedging instruments.  To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreigncurrency risk associated with certain of the Companys foreign currencyderivative positions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using avalue-at-risk (VAR) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations inexchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation togenerate 3,000 random market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected lossin fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Companys foreignexchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is notintended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation andmanagement tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecastedtransactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated inforeign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on the results of themodel, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fairvalue of $9.2 million as of September 30, 2006 compared to a maximumone-day loss of $10.0 million as of September 24, 2005. Because theCompany uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurredon those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of theunderlying exposures.  Actual future gains and losses associated with theCompanys investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materiallyfrom the sensitivity analyses performed as of September 30, 2006 due tothe inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timingand amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Companysactual exposures and positions.  71      Item 8.
