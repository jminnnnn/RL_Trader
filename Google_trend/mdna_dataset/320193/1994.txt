Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.  All information is based on the Company's fiscal calendar.  (Tabular information: Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)   RESULTS OF OPERATIONS              1994    Change    1993   Change    1992            Net sales                       $ 9,189     15%   $ 7,977   13%    $ 7,087 Gross margin                    $ 2,344    -14%   $ 2,728  -12%    $ 3,095   Percentage of net sales         25.5%             34.2%            43.7% Operating expenses (excluding  restructuring costs)           $ 1,948    -15%   $ 2,297    --    $ 2,289   Percentage of net sales         21.2%             28.8%            32.3% Restructuring costs             $  (127)  -140%   $   321    --        --    Percentage of net sales         (1.4%)             4.0%              --  Net income                      $   310    258%   $    87   -84%   $   530 Earnings per share              $  2.61    258%   $  0.73   -83%   $  4.33   Net Sales  Net sales increased $1,212 million, or 15% in fiscal 1994, compared with an increase of $890 million, or 13%, in fiscal 1993.  The net sales growth  in 1994 over 1993 was primarily due to two factors: unit sales growth and,  to a lesser extent, an increase in the average aggregate revenue per Macintosh computer unit.  Total Macintosh computer unit sales increased 16% over  the prior  year.   This growth resulted principally from strong  sales  of  the Company's  new  Power Macintosh products, first introduced  on  March  14, 1994,  and  from  sales  of newer product offerings  within  the  Macintosh Performa  line  of  desktop personal computers and, to  a  lesser  extent, within  the PowerBook family of notebook personal computers.  This  growth was  partially  offset by declining unit sales in certain of the  Company's more   established  products  and  older  product  versions.   The  average aggregate revenue per Macintosh unit increased slightly, primarily  due  to fluctuations  in  product mix throughout the year, despite pricing  actions undertaken  by  the Company in response to continuing industrywide  pricing pressures.  Total  Macintosh  computer unit sales increased  32%  from  1992  to  1993, reflecting  strong  unit  sales of the Company's  newer  product  offerings within  the  Macintosh Quadra, LC and Performa lines of  desktop  personal computers  and within the PowerBook family of notebook personal  computers. This growth was partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of  the Company's  more  established  products and  older  product  versions.   The average aggregate revenue per unit declined 15% in 1993 compared with 1992, primarily  as  a  result of pricing actions undertaken by  the  Company  in response to continuing industrywide pricing pressures.  In  1994,  domestic net sales increased 14% over the prior  year,  compared with  an  increase of 13% in 1993 over 1992.  International net sales  grew 17%  from  1993  to  1994,  compared with 12% growth  from  1992  to  1993, primarily  as  a  result  of strong sales growth  in  the  Pacific  region, particularly  in  Japan.  International net sales represented  46%  of  net sales in 1994 compared with 45% of net sales in both 1993 and 1992.  Gross Margin  Gross margin in 1994 continued to decline as a percentage of net sales from 1993  and  1992 levels.  The gross margin percentage declined to  25.5%  in 1994  from  34.2%  in  1993.   The downward trend  in  gross  margin  as  a percentage  of net sales was primarily a result of pricing and  promotional actions  undertaken by the Company in response to industrywide  competitive pricing pressures.                                        12   Gross  margin  was also affected somewhat adversely by changes  in  foreign currency  exchange rates as a result of a stronger U.S. dollar relative  to certain  foreign currencies in 1994 compared with 1993.  Results  from  the Company's  ongoing foreign currency hedging activities offset a portion  of this  adverse  foreign  currency  impact on  gross  margin.   Although  the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the  short term  by  fluctuations  in foreign currency exchange rates,  the  Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account changes in exchange  rates over time.  The decline in gross margin as a percentage of net sales from 43.7% in 1992 to  34.2%  in  1993  was  primarily the result of industrywide  competitive pressures  and  associated  pricing  and  promotional  actions.   Inventory valuation  reserves recorded against certain products also  contributed  to the  decline  in gross margin as a percentage of net sales.  The  Company's results  of  operations  were  minimally affected  by  changes  in  foreign currency exchange rates in 1993 compared with 1992.  Although  the  Company's gross margin percentage was 27.2% for  the  fourth quarter  of  1994,   resulting primarily from  strong  sales  of    Power Macintosh  computers  and  the PowerBook 500 series  of  notebook  personal computers, it is anticipated that gross margins will remain under  pressure and  could  fall below prior years' levels worldwide due to  a  variety  of factors,  including  continued  industrywide pricing  pressures,  increased competition, and compressed product life cycles.    Operating Expenses                     1994  Change   1993  Change    1992            Research and development             $  564    -15%  $  665    10%  $  602 Percentage of net sales                6.1%            8.3%           8.5%   Research  and  development expenditures decreased  in  amount  during  1994 compared  with 1993 and 1992.  This decrease reflected the results  of  the Company's restructuring actions aimed at reducing costs, including  product development   expenditures.   The  increase  in  research  and  development expenditures  from 1992 to 1993 reflected net additions  to  the  Company's engineering   staff   and   related  costs.    Research   and   development expenditures,  as  a percentage of net sales, decreased  since  1992  as  a result  of  revenue growth during 1993 and 1994, coupled with the Company's continuing efforts to focus its research and development project spending.  The  Company believes that continued investment in research and development is   critical  to  its  future  growth  and  competitive  position  in  the marketplace,  and is directly related to continued, timely  development  of new  and  enhanced  products.   Although the Company  continues  to  manage operating  expense growth relative to gross margin levels,  it  anticipates that  research and development expenditures in 1995 will increase  slightly in amount.                                          1994  Change   1993  Change    1992            Selling, general and administrative  $1,384    -15%  $1,632   -3%    $1,687 Percentage of net sales               15.1%           20.5%           23.8%   Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in amount and  as  a percentage  of  net  sales in 1994 and 1993 compared with  1993  and  1992, respectively.   These decreases reflect the Company's  ongoing  efforts  to manage operating expense growth relative to gross margin levels.  In  1994, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in  amount and  as a percentage of net sales compared with 1993, primarily because  of lower   employee-related   and  facilities   costs   resulting   from   the restructuring  actions taken in the third quarter of  1993.   In  addition, revenue growth in 1994 contributed to the decrease in selling, general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales.                                         13   General  and administrative expenses decreased in 1993 compared with  1992, primarily because of reduced employee-related expenses resulting  from  the restructuring actions taken in the third quarter of 1993.  This decrease in general  and administrative expenses was offset slightly by an increase  in sales  and marketing expenses as a result of increases in costs for product marketing and advertising programs related to new product introductions and efforts to increase product demand.  The  Company  will  continue to face the challenge of  managing  growth  in selling,  general  and  administrative expenses relative  to  gross  margin levels,  particularly  in light of the Company's expectation  of  continued pressure  on  gross margins and continued competitive pressures  worldwide. The  Company anticipates an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses  in  1995 from current levels, primarily resulting from  marketing and advertising expenditures.                                       1994  Change   1993  Change    1992            Restructuring costs                 $(127)  -140%  $ 321     --      --                                      Percentage of net sales             (1.4%)          4.0%             --  For  information  regarding the Company's restructuring actions,  refer  to pages 33-34 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.    Interest and Other Income              (Expense), Net                        1994   Change   1993   Change   1992            Interest and other income (expense),     net                                $ (22)   -175%   $ 29    -41%    $ 50                                        Interest and other income (expense), net, decreased by $51 million, to  $22 million  in  expense in 1994 compared with $29 million of income  in  1993. Higher  interest rates and larger average borrowing balances used  to  fund working  capital  needs served to significantly increase interest  expense, and  accounted  for  $28 million of the $51 million  increase  in  expenses during  1994.  Other factors contributing to this variance include interest income,  which  was  higher in 1993 than in 1994 primarily  due  to  a  $15 million interest payment received on a non-recurring income tax refund from the  Internal  Revenue  Service  in 1993,  and  interest  income  from  the Company's  interest  rate  risk management program,  which  contributed  $6 million in 1993, and reduced interest income by $7 million in 1994.  Interest  and  other income (expense), net, decreased  in  amount  in  1993 compared  with  1992 because of lower interest rates, lower cash  balances, expenses associated with certain financing transactions, lower gains on the sale  of  certain of the Company's venture capital investments, an increase in  the cost of hedging certain foreign currency exposures, and an increase in  interest expense due to higher commercial paper borrowing levels.  This decrease  was partially offset by interest earned on an income  tax  refund from  the  Internal  Revenue Service and gains realized  on  the  Company's ongoing foreign exchange risk management programs.

Inherent in this process  are  a  number  of factors  that  the Company must successfully manage in order  to  achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition.  Product Introductions and Transitions  Due  to  the  highly  volatile nature of the personal computer  industry, which  is  characterized by dynamic customer demand  patterns  and  rapid technological  advances, the Company frequently introduces  new  products and  product  enhancements.  The success of new product introductions  is dependent  on  a  number  of factors, including  market  acceptance,  the Company's   ability   to  manage  the  risks  associated   with   product transitions,  the effective management of inventory levels in  line  with anticipated  product  demand,  and  the  manufacturing  of  products   in appropriate  quantities  to meet anticipated  demand.   Accordingly,  the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will  have on its sales or results of operations.  On  March 14, 1994, the Company introduced Power Macintosh, a new line of Macintosh   computers   based   on  a  new   PowerPC   family   of   RISC microprocessors.   The  Company's results  of  operations  and  financial condition  may  be  adversely affected if it is  unable  to  successfully complete  the transition of its lines of personal computers  and  servers from  the  Motorola  68000  series  of  microprocessors  to  the  PowerPC microprocessor.  The success of this ongoing transition  will  depend  on the  Company's ability to continue to sell products based on the Motorola 68000  series of microprocessors while gaining market acceptance  of  the new  PowerPC  processor-based products, to successfully manage  inventory levels  of  both  product  lines  simultaneously,  and  to  continue   to coordinate   the  timely  development  and  distribution  by  independent software  vendors  of  new  "native" software  applications  specifically designed for the PowerPC processor-based products.  The rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new product  is not necessarily an indication of the anticipated future  rate of  shipments  for that product, which depends on many factors,  some  of which  are  not  under  the control of the Company.   These  factors  may include initial large purchases by a small segment of the user population that  tends  to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance  by  the majority of users ("early adopters"); purchases in satisfaction of  pent- up  demand  by  users  who anticipated new technology  and  as  a  result deferred  purchases of other products; and overordering  by  dealers  who anticipate  shortages due to the aforementioned factors.   The  preceding may also be offset by other factors, such as the deferral of purchases by many  users  until new technology is accepted as "proven" and  for  which commonly  used  software products are available;  and  the  reduction  of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain sufficient supply  of product previously in backlog.  Backlog  is  often volatile after new product introductions  due  to  the aforementioned  demand factors, often increasing sharply coincident  with introduction,  and  then  reducing sharply  once  dealers  and  customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply of product.  The  measurement  of  demand  for newly introduced  products  is  further complicated  by  the  availability of different  product  configurations, which  may  include various types of built-in peripherals  and  software. Configurations may also require certain localization (such  as  language) for  various  markets  and, as a result, demand in  different  geographic areas  may  be a function of the availability of third-party software  in those  localized  versions.  For example, the availability  of  European- language versions of software products manufactured by U.S. producers may lag  behind the availability of U.S. versions by a quarter or more.  This may result in lower initial demand for the Company's new products outside the  United  States, although localized versions of the products  may  be available.                                             15   Competition  The personal computer industry is highly competitive and continues to  be characterized by consolidations in the hardware and software  industries, aggressive  pricing practices, and downward pressure  on  gross  margins. The  Company's  results of operations and financial  condition  could  be adversely affected should the Company be unable to effectively manage the impact  of  industrywide pricing pressures and continue  to  realize  the anticipated  cost -reduction benefits associated with  the  restructuring plan initiated in the third quarter of 1993.  The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also be  affected  by  the  Company's ability to offer  customers  competitive technologies  while effectively managing the impact on  inventory  levels and   the   potential   for  customer  confusion   created   by   product proliferation.  On  November 7, 1994, the Company reached an agreement with International Business  Machines Corporation (IBM) and Motorola, Inc. on a new hardware reference  platform for the PowerPC microprocessor that is  intended  to deliver  a  much wider range of operating system and application  choices for  computer  customers.   As a result of this  agreement,  the  Company intends  to  port the Macintosh operating system to the common  platform. Accordingly,   the  Company's  future  operating  results  and  financial condition  may be affected by its ability to implement this  and  certain other collaboration agreements entered into, and to manage the associated competitive risk.  The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also be  affected  by the Company's ability to increase market  share  in  its personal computer business.  Currently, the Company is the only maker  of hardware  that  uses  the  Macintosh operating system,  and  it  has  a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by  makers  of  computers  that run the MS-DOS (registered trademark)  and   Microsoft  Windows(TM) operating  systems.  Certain of the Company's  personal computer  products are  capable  of  running software designed for the  MS-DOS  or  Windows operating  system,  through software emulation  of Intel  microprocessor chips  (except  for one product, which does so by  means of a  coprocessor card).  Optimal performance of the Company's products is obtained by  use of  software  specifically  designed for the Company's   products,  either those  based  on  the Motorola 68000 series of  microprocessors  or  those based  on  the  PowerPC microprocessor.  However, as  a  result  of  the collaboration  agreement noted in the preceding   paragraph,  the  Company will  have  the opportunity to increase its market  share in the  personal computer business as the Macintosh operating system  becomes available  on computers based on the new hardware reference platform.  Decisions  by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers,  as opposed  to  MS-DOS  or Windows-based systems, are  often  based  on  the availability  of  third-party software for particular applications.   The Company   believes  that  the  availability  of  third-party  application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on the third- party  developers'  perception and analysis of the relative  benefits  of developing  such software for the Company's products versus software  for the  larger MS-DOS and Windows market.  This analysis is based on factors such  as  the  relative  market  share of  the  Company's  products,  the anticipated  potential  revenue that may be  earned,  and  the  costs  of developing such software products.  In  an  effort  to  increase overall market share, the Company  plans  to license the Macintosh operating system to other personal computer vendors beginning in 1995.  The Company anticipates that the licensing activities will  result  in  a variety of these vendors bringing to market  personal computers  that  will run application software based  on  the  Macintosh operating  system.  The Company also believes that licensing  will  offer software  vendors a broader installed base on which they can develop  and provide technical innovations for the Macintosh platform.  At this  time, the  Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that  licensing of  the Macintosh  operating  system  will  have  on  its  sales  or  results  of operations.  Microsoft  Corporation  is  the  developer  of  the  MS-DOS  and  Windows operating systems, which are the principal competing operating systems to the Company's Macintosh operating system.  Microsoft is also an important developer   of   application  software  for   the   Company's   products. Accordingly,  Microsoft's interest in producing application software  for the Company's products may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as an operating system vendor.                                         16   The  Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability of IBM and Motorola, Inc., the suppliers of  the new PowerPC RISC microprocessor for certain of the Company's products, to continue  to supply to the Company microprocessors which produce superior price/performance results compared with those supplied to  the  Company's competitors  by  Intel Corporation, the developer  and  producer  of  the microprocessors  used  by most personal computers using  the  MS-DOS  and Windows operating systems.  IBM produces personal computers based on  the Intel  microprocessors as well as on the PowerPC microprocessor,  and  is also the developer of OS/2, a competing operating system to the Company's Macintosh operating system.  Accordingly, IBM's interest in supplying the Company  with  improved  versions of microprocessors  for  the  Company's products  may  be influenced by IBM's perception of its  interests  as  a competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor.  The  Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also be  affected  by  the Company's  ability to successfully expand  its  new businesses and product offerings into other markets, such as the  markets for on-line services and personal digital assistant (PDA) products.  Global Market Risks  A  large  portion  of  the  Company's revenue  is  derived  from  its international operations.  As a result, the Company's operations  and financial  results could be significantly affected  by  international factors, such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  or  weak economic  conditions  in the foreign markets  in  which  the  Company distributes  its products.  When the U.S. dollar strengthens  against other  currencies,  the  U.S. dollar value of  non-U.S.  dollar-based sales decreases.  When the U.S. dollar weakens, the U.S. dollar value of  non-U.S. dollar-based sales increases. Correspondingly, the  U.S. dollar  value of non-U.S. dollar-based costs increases when the  U.S. dollar  weakens  and  decreases  when the  U.S.  dollar  strengthens. Overall,  the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than  the U.S.  dollar  and,  as  such, benefits from a weaker  dollar  and  is adversely  affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide.   Accordingly, changes in exchange  rates  may  negatively affect  the  Company's  consolidated  sales  and  gross  margins  (as expressed in U.S. dollars).  To  mitigate  the short-term impact of fluctuating currency  exchange rates   on   the  Company's  non-U.S.  dollar-based  sales,   product procurement, and operating expenses, the Company regularly hedges its non-U.S.  dollar-based exposures.  Specifically, the  Company  enters into  foreign  exchange forward and option contracts to hedge  firmly committed   transactions.   Currently,  hedges  of  firmly  committed transactions  do  not  extend  beyond one  year.   The  Company  also purchases  foreign exchange option contracts to hedge  certain  other probable, but not firmly committed transactions.  Hedges of probable, but  not firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year. To  reduce  the costs associated with these ongoing foreign  exchange hedging  programs, the Company also regularly sells foreign  exchange option  contracts  and  enters into certain  other  foreign  exchange transactions.  All foreign exchange forward and option contracts  not accounted  for  as  hedges,  including all transactions  intended  to reduce  the  costs  associated with the  Company's  foreign  exchange hedging  programs,  are carried at fair value and are  adjusted  each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates.  While  the Company is exposed with respect to the interest  rates  of many  of  the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in  the general  level  of U.S. interest rates.  In this regard,  changes  in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as interest paid on  its  short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  To  mitigate  the impact  of  fluctuations  in U.S. interest  rates,  the  Company  has entered into interest rate swap and option transactions.  Certain  of these  swaps are intended to better match the Company's floating-rate interest  income  on  its  cash,  cash  equivalents,  and  short-term investments  with  the fixed-rate interest expense on  its  long-term debt.  The Company also enters into interest rate swap, swaption, and option  transactions in order to extend the effective duration  of  a portion  of  its  cash,  cash equivalent, and  short-term  investment portfolios.  These  swaps  may extend the Company's  cash  investment horizon up to a maximum effective duration of three years.                                         17   To  ensure  the  adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's  foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks  and  opportunities  of the nonhedge  portfolios,  the  Company continually  monitors  its  foreign  exchange  forward   and   option positions, and its interest rate swap, swaption, and option positions on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency-  and  interest rate- related exposures, respectively,  from both  an accounting and an economic perspective.  However, given  the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities, there can be no assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more than  a  portion  of  the  adverse financial  impact  resulting  from unfavorable  movements in either foreign exchange or interest  rates. As  such, the Company's operating results and financial position  may be adversely affected.  Inventory  The  Company's  products  include certain components,  such  as  specific microprocessors  manufactured  by  Motorola,  Inc.,  that  are  currently available  only  from  single  sources.   Any  availability  limitations, interruptions  in  supplies,  or  price  increases  of  these  and  other components  could adversely affect the Company's business  and  financial results.   The Company's future operating results and financial condition may  also  be  adversely  affected by the  Company's  ability  to  manage inventory levels and lead times required to obtain components in order to be  more responsive to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  In addition,  if  anticipated unit sales growth for new and current  product offerings  is not realized, inventory valuation reserves may be necessary that  would  adversely  affect the Company's results  of  operations  and financial condition.  Marketing and Distribution  A  number of uncertainties exist regarding the marketing and distribution of  the  Company's products.  Currently, the Company's primary  means  of distribution  is  through third-party computer  resellers.   However,  in response  to  changing industry practices and customer  preferences,  the Company is continuing its expansion into various consumer channels,  such as  mass-merchandise  stores (for example, Sears and Wal-Mart),  consumer electronics  outlets, and computer superstores.  The  Company's  business and  financial  results  could be adversely  affected  if  the  financial condition of these sellers weakens or if sellers within consumer channels decide not to continue to distribute the Company's products.  Other Factors  The  majority  of the Company's research and development activities,  its corporate  headquarters,  and  other  critical  business  operations  are located  near major seismic faults. The Company's operating  results  and financial  condition could be materially adversely affected in the  event of a major earthquake.  The  Company  plans  to  replace its current transaction  systems  (which include order management, distribution, manufacturing, and finance)  with a  single  integrated system as part of its ongoing  effort  to  increase operational  efficiency.   The  Company's future  operating  results  and financial  condition  could  be adversely  affected  by  its  ability  to implement  and  effectively manage the transition to this new  integrated system.  Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting  the Company's  operating  results  and financial  condition,  past  financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results  or  trends  in  future  periods.   In  addition,  the  Company's participation  in a highly dynamic industry often results in  significant volatility of the Company's common stock price.                                          18     Liquidity and Capital Resources                  1994     1993     1992        Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term                                        investments, net of short-term   borrowings    $   966  $    69  $ 1,251 Working capital                                  $ 2,532  $ 1,830  $ 2,151 Cash generated by (used for) operations          $   737  $ (651)  $   921 Cash used for investment activities, excluding      short-term investments                         $   163  $   228  $   264                             Cash generated by (used for) financing               activities                                     $ (208)  $   336  $ (114)   The  Company's financial position with respect to cash, cash equivalents, and  short-term investments, net of short-term borrowings,  increased  to $966  million  at September 30, 1994, from $69 million at  September  24, 1993.   This  increase  reflects  a $300  million  issuance  of  ten-year unsecured  notes,  the  proceeds  of which  replaced  a  portion  of  the Company's   short-term  financing.   The  improvement  in  the  Company's financial  condition  was  also attributable to the  Company's  continued efforts  to  increase  profit  levels  and  to  manage  working  capital, particularly in the area of inventory management.  More  cash  was  generated  by operations in  1994  compared  with  1993, primarily because of a significant  decrease in inventory levels, as well as  increased sales levels.  The significant decrease in inventory levels during  1994  resulted  from improved inventory management,  higher  1994 sales levels attributable to various pricing and promotional actions, and strong  sales  of  new  product inventory which  had  been  built  up  in preparation  for  the  introduction of Power  Macintosh.   Profit  levels improved   as   operating  expenses  decreased  due  to   the   Company's implementation of restructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of 1993.  Cash  generated by operations in 1994 was partially offset by  cash  used for  restructuring and an increase in accounts receivable.  The  increase in  accounts  receivable reflected an increase in sales  levels  achieved during 1994.  The balance of accrued restructuring costs decreased as the restructuring actions initiated in the third quarter of 1993 continued to be  implemented.  In addition, in the third quarter of 1994, the  Company lowered  its estimate of the costs associated with the restructuring  and recorded  an  adjustment  that  increased income  by  $127  million  ($79 million,  or  $0.66  per share, after taxes).  This adjustment  primarily reflected  the  modification or cancelation of certain  elements  of  the Company's  original restructuring plan because of changing  business  and economic conditions that made certain elements of the restructuring  plan financially less attractive than originally anticipated.  More  cash  was used for operations in 1993 compared with 1992, primarily because of a significant increase in inventory levels; decreases  in  net income,  income  taxes  payable, and other current  liabilities;  and  an increase  in  accounts receivable levels.  Cash used for  operations  was offset  slightly by increases in accrued restructuring costs and accounts payable.  Inventory  increased  substantially during 1993 as  a  result  of  higher levels  of purchased parts, work in process, and finished goods inventory in  support  of  an expanded product line and distribution  channels  and anticipated  higher sales volumes.  The decrease in net  income  resulted primarily from a reduction in gross margins and the restructuring  charge included  in operating expenses for the third quarter.  The reduction  in earnings also contributed to the decrease in income taxes payable.  Other current  liabilities  decreased  as  the  Company  continued  to   manage operating   expense   levels.   The  increase  in   accounts   receivable corresponded  to the higher sales levels achieved in 1993  compared  with 1992,  coupled with slower collections resulting from economic  pressures in  the  reseller  industry, and the Company's  expansion  into  consumer channels, where payment terms are generally longer.  These uses  of  cash were  offset slightly by increases in accrued restructuring  costs  as  a result of the Company's plan to restructure its operations worldwide  and increases  in accounts payable, reflecting the higher level of  inventory purchases.  Excluding short-term investments, net cash used for investments  declined in  1994  compared  with 1993 and 1992 levels.  Net  cash  used  for  the purchase of property, plant, and equipment totaled $160 million in 1994,                                         19   and was primarily made up of increases in land, buildings, machinery, and equipment.   The  Company anticipates that capital expenditures  in  1995 will be slightly above 1994 expenditures.  The  Company  leases the majority of its facilities and  certain  of  its equipment  under noncancelable operating leases.  In 1994,  rent  expense under all operating leases was approximately $122 million.  The Company's future  lease  commitments are discussed on  page  38  of  the  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The  Company's balance of long-term debt increased during 1994 due to the issuance  of  $300 million aggregate principal amount of  6.5%  unsecured notes  under  an  omnibus  shelf registration statement  filed  with  the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This shelf registration was for  the registration  of  debt  and other securities for  an  aggregate  offering amount  of $500 million.  The notes were sold at 99.925% of par,  for  an effective  yield  to  maturity of 6.51%.  The notes  pay  interest  semi- annually and mature on February 15, 2004.  The 6.51% fixed-rate   was subsequently effectively converted to a floating-rate  through ten-year interest  rate swaps based on the six-month U.S. dollar London  Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).  The impact of the swaps during 1994 was to  reduce the 6.51% fixed-rate yield to a 5.62% yield.  To mitigate the credit risk associated  with  these ten-year swap transactions, the  Company  entered into  margining  agreements  with  its third-party  bank  counterparties. Margining  under  these agreements generally does not start  until  1997. Furthermore,  these agreements would require the Company to  post  margin only  if certain credit risk thresholds were exceeded.  It is anticipated that  any margin the Company may be required to post in the future  would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity position.  Short-term  borrowings  at September 30, 1994,  were  approximately  $531 million  lower  than  at  September 24, 1993, as the  proceeds  from  the issuance  of  $300 million in long-term debt were used to  pay  down  the balance  of  short-term borrowings.  The Company's short-term  borrowings reflect borrowings made under its commercial paper program and short-term uncommitted  bid-line  arrangements with certain  commercial  banks.   In particular, Apple Japan, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the  Company, incurred  short-term  yen-denominated borrowings  from  several  Japanese banks  during  1994,  the  balance of which aggregated  the  U.S.  dollar equivalent  of approximately $202 million at September 30, 1994.   During the  first quarter of 1994, the Company also entered into a 364-day  $500 million  committed revolving credit facility which terminated on December 8, 1994, with a syndicate of banks primarily in support of its commercial paper program.  No borrowings  were made under this facility.  The  Company expects that it will continue to incur short- and  long-term borrowings  from time to time to finance U.S. working capital  needs  and capital  expenditures,  because a substantial portion  of  the  Company's cash,  cash  equivalents, and short-term investments is held by  foreign subsidiaries,  generally  in U.S. dollar-denominated  holdings.   Amounts held  by  foreign  subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income  taxation upon   repatriation  to  the  United  States;  the  Company's   financial statements  fully provide for any related tax liability on  amounts  that may be repatriated.  Refer to the Income Taxes footnote on pages 35-36 of  the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  The  Company  believes that its balances of cash, cash  equivalents,  and short-term investments, together with funds generated from operations and short-  and long-term borrowing capabilities, will be sufficient to  meet its operating cash requirements on a short- and long-term basis.                                                     20   Item 8.
