Company experienced a 25% rise in Macintosh unit sales. This increase is primarily attributable to the success of iMac, the Company's moderately priced desktop Macintosh system designed for the education and consumer markets. The Company sold approximately 1.8 million iMac units in 1999, an increase of approximately 730,000 units or 68% over unit sales of similar products in 1998. Growth in unit sales was strong in all of the Company's geographic operating segments, particularly in Japan and Asia Pacific due to strong acceptance of iMac in those regions and the general economic improvements experienced in much of Asia during the year. The Company also experienced improved profitability in 1999. Operating income before special charges rose 44% or $118 million to $386 million in 1999 from $268 million in 1998. Contributing to the improvement in operating margin in 1999 was a rise in gross margin as a percentage of net sales to 28% as compared to 25% in 1998. The impact of improved gross margins was partially offset by planned increases in recurring operating expenses during 1999 of 8% to a total of $1.337 billion.  Despite improved unit sales and improved profitability, the Company's net sales rose only 3% in 1999 to $6.134 billion. Growth in net sales was negatively impacted during the year by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system for both Power Macintosh and iMac systems and by a shift in unit mix towards the lower priced iMac systems. Net sales were also negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of 1999 due to lower than planned deliveries of PowerPC G4 processors from Motorola. The primary focus of the Company during fiscal 2000 remains achieving meaningful year-over-year growth in both unit sales and net sales.  The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market technologically innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions within the highly competitive market for personal computers. Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition are discussed                                         10  throughout this Item 7, including the discussion under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."

Net sales increased $193 million or 3% to $6.134 billion in 1999 compared to 1998. The primary source of this growth was an overall 25% increase in Macintosh unit sales, which was reflective of strong unit growth in all of the Company's geographic operating segments. Offsetting the rise in unit shipments was a decline in the average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales, which fell 17% to $1,739 from $2,095 in 1998. The decline during 1999 in the average revenue per Macintosh system is attributable to lower pricing for both iMac and Power Macintosh products, which reflects the continuing overall industry trend towards lower pricing. The decline is also attributable to the shift in the Company's unit mix toward lower-priced consumer products such that iMac units and comparable products comprised 52% of total Macintosh unit sales in 1999 versus 39% in 1998.  Net sales declined sequentially during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to the third quarter by $222 million or 14%, and declined $220 million or 14% compared to the same period in 1998. Similarly, Macintosh unit sales declined 15% and 7% during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to the third quarter of 1999 and the same period in 1998, respectively. The primary causes for these declines in both net sales and unit sales were lower than planned deliveries of PowerPC G4 processors from Motorola and production interruptions at vendors supplying PowerBooks and iBooks experienced during the last week of the fourth quarter of 1999 as a result of the earthquake in Taiwan on September 20, 1999. The shortage of G4 processors reduced net sales by approximately $200 million during the fourth quarter of 1999.  Net sales decreased $1.140 billion, or 16%, to $5.941 billion in 1998 compared to 1997. The decline during 1998 in net sales is attributable to several factors. The Company experienced a $454 million decrease in net sales of peripheral products during 1998 compared to 1997 principally due to the discontinuance by the                                         11  Company of certain imaging and display products. The average revenue per Macintosh system fell 11% during 1998 as compared to 1997 from $2,375 to $2,095, reflecting the effect of aggressive pricing of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems introduced in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral products, the overall industry trend toward lower priced products, and the Company's reentry during the fourth quarter of 1998 into the lower-priced consumer market. Lastly, overall Macintosh CPU unit sales for 1998 declined approximately 4% from 1997. International net sales were particularly affected by these factors and by the economic conditions existing in Asia during 1998.  SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan, while the Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia except for Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, "Segment Information and Geographic Data," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  AMERICAS  Net sales in the Americas segment increased 2% to $3.527 billion during 1999 as compared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 22%. This followed a 5% decline in net sales in the Americas between 1998 and 1997. During 1999, the Americas segment represented approximately 57% and 59% of the Company's total net sales and total Macintosh unit sales, respectively. The results experienced by this segment in 1999 reflect the overall trends experienced by the Company of growing Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system.  EUROPE  Net sales in the Europe segment increased 2% to $1.317 billion during 1999 as compared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 23%. This followed a 16% decline in net sales in the Europe segment between 1998 and 1997. Like the Americas segment, Europe's results in 1999 as compared to 1998 are indicative of strong growth in Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system.  JAPAN AND ASIA PACIFIC  Macintosh unit sales and net sales in Asia, particularly in Japan, recovered during 1999 from the declines experienced in 1998. Net sales in the Japan segment increased 17% or $127 million to a total of $858 million in 1999 as compared to 1998. Macintosh unit sales in Japan increased 35% during 1999 compared to 1998 while Macintosh unit sales in the Asia Pacific segment increased 37%. The increases in net sales and Macintosh unit sales in both Japan and Asia Pacific are the result of strong iMac sales experienced by these operating segments, strong growth in Japanese consumer sales, and the general economic recovery experienced in the region.  BACKLOG  In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of overordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further information regarding the Company's backlog may be found below under the subheading "Product Introductions and Transitions"                                         12  included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  GROSS MARGIN  Gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1999 to 28% as compared to 25% in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to declines in the cost of various components of the Company's products, improvements in manufacturing efficiencies brought about by selective outsourcing of final assembly of certain of the Company's products, improved design of products leading to lower manufacturing and warranty costs, and relatively stable pricing of the Company's products over the last six months of 1999. During 1999, the Company was also able to fully realize the benefits of actions taken primarily in 1998 and 1997 that led to improved inventory management and a more efficient distribution model for its products. These improvements are discussed below.  Gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1998 to 25% compared to 19% in 1997. This increase was primarily the result of a shift in revenue mix toward the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh G3 systems and newer PowerBook G3 systems, the low volume of lower margin consumer products shipped during the first three quarters of 1998, and the declining cost of various components of the Company's products, particularly those sourced from Asia. Improvements in the Company's inventory management also contributed to the increase in gross margins. During 1998, the Company simplified its product line, moving from approximately 15 separate individual products to three main product families. Further, the Company attempted to use as many industry standard parts in its newer products as possible, expanded the use of supplier hubs at manufacturing sites, and outsourced the manufacture of printed circuit boards and some systems assembly. These changes have allowed the Company to more accurately forecast demand, reduce inventory carrying levels and related costs, lessen the financial exposure resulting from inventory obsolescence and excess inventory levels, and reduce the component cost of obtaining certain standardized parts. The Company also made changes to its distribution model during 1998 and 1997 that contributed to the increase in gross margins in 1998. The Company significantly reduced the number of locations where it stages finished goods, generally holding inventory on a regional basis rather than in each country. Also, the Company significantly reduced the number of its distributors, authorized resellers, and national retail channel partners, particularly in the United States. These changes allowed the Company to reduce inventory and related financial exposures and reduced the inventory and related financial exposure associated with inventory held in the Company's distribution channels. The Company has also revised its distribution channel policies by decreasing the price protection and stock return privileges of its distributors and resellers.  The Company anticipates that as lower priced consumer products become a larger share of net sales and the overall industry trend toward lower-priced products continues, gross margins will decline during fiscal 2000. The foregoing statement is forward-looking. The Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition."  There can be no assurance targeted gross margin levels will be achieved or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign                                         13  currency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  The Company recognizes focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. Expenditures on research and development increased 4% or $11 million to $314 million in 1999 as compared to 1998. This followed a $182 million or 38% decline in 1998 as compared to 1997. The overall decline in spending on research and development over the last two years is principally due to restructuring actions taken in 1996, 1997, and 1998 intended to focus the Company's research and development efforts on those projects perceived as critical to the Company's future success. These restructuring actions led to significant reductions in research and development related headcount and the cancellation of many research and development projects.  SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE  Selling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 10% to $996 million in 1999 as compared to 1998 and increased to 16% of net sales in 1999 from 15% in 1998. These increases are primarily the result of increased spending on marketing and promotional activities throughout 1999 and a 12% increase in combined sales, marketing, and general and administrative headcount from the end of 1998 to the end of 1999.  Selling, general, and administrative expenditures declined $378 million or 29% in 1998 compared to 1997 and declined to 15% of net sales in 1998 from 18% of net sales in 1997. These decreases were primarily the result of restructuring actions taken in 1996, 1997, and 1998, which resulted in reductions in headcount, closing of facilities, and write-down and disposal of operating assets during 1996, 1997, and 1998. Additionally, changes during 1998 in the Company's distribution channel policies and business model, including contraction and focus of the Company's product line and simplification of the Company's internal and external distribution channels, led to a reduction in selling expenses during 1998.  SPECIAL CHARGES  1996 AND 1997 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS  In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and return the Company to profitability. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a charge during 1996 of $179 million. During 1997, the Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those actions. All material restructuring actions contemplated under the plan were essentially complete at the end of fiscal 1998. The combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions consisted of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time employees; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings, and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies that were not critical to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring actions under the plan resulted in cash expenditures of $293 million and noncash asset write-downs of $95 million from the second quarter of 1996 through September 25, 1999. Of the combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring charges of $396 million, approximately $3 million was determined to be excess during the fourth quarter of 1999. The remaining balance of $5 million as of September 25, 1999, in accrued restructuring costs for the 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions is comprised of payments over the next two years on leases and contracts that had been terminated prior to fiscal 1999. The Company expects the remaining accrual will result in cash expenditures of $5 million over the next two years.                                         14  1999 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS  During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in a charge to operations of $21 million. The net restructuring charge of $18 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 1999 reflects the $3 million of excess reserves related to the 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions. The total cost of these actions of $21 million is comprised of $11 million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of the Company's outsourced data center and $10 million for contract cancellation charges related to supply and development agreements previously discontinued. The Company expects these actions to result in cash expenditures of $21 million over the next year.  During the second quarter of 1999, the Company took certain actions to improve the flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final assembly of certain of its products to third-party manufacturers. These restructuring actions resulted in the Company recognizing a charge to operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999, which was comprised of $6 million for severance benefits to be paid to employees involuntarily terminated, $2 million for the write-down of operating assets to be disposed of, and $1 million for payments on canceled contracts. These actions resulted in the termination of approximately 580 employees and are substantially complete as of September 25, 1999.  IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT  In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under development and had no alternative future use. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of purchased in-process research and development, which was charged to operations upon acquisition.  In February 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of NeXT Software, Inc. (NeXT). NeXT had developed, marketed, and supported software enabling customers to implement business applications on the Internet/World Wide Web, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server networks. Of the total purchase price of $427 million, $375 million was allocated to purchased in-process research and development and $52 million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. The purchased in-process research and development was charged to operations upon acquisition, and the goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over two to three years.  TERMINATION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT  In August 1997, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets of Power Computing Corporation (PCC), a licensed distributor of the Mac OS operating system, including PCC's customer database and its license to distribute the Mac OS. The agreement with PCC also included a release of claims between the parties. On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets from PCC. The total purchase price was approximately $110 million, of which $75 million was expensed in the fourth quarter of 1997 as "termination of license agreement" and $35 million was recorded as goodwill in the second quarter of 1998. The goodwill is being amortized over three years.  INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET  Interest and other income and expense (net) increased $59 million or 211% to $87 million during 1999 as compared to 1998. This increase is attributable to two primary factors. First, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased $926 million or 40% during 1999 resulting in an increase in interest income during 1999 of $44 million. Second, interest expense declined $15 million during 1999, primarily as a result of the conversion of approximately $661 million of the Company's convertible subordinated notes to common stock during the third quarter of 1999. During 1998, the Company experienced a $27 million increase in interest income net of interest expense, the result of higher cash and investment balances and lower average short-term borrowings, offset by decreased foreign exchange gains and increased other expense.                                         15  GAINS FROM SALES OF INVESTMENT  As of September 26, 1997, the Company owned 42.3% of the outstanding stock of ARM Holdings plc (ARM), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The Company had accounted for this investment using the equity method through September 25, 1998. On April 17, 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately $24 million, which was recognized as other income. Foreign tax recognized on this gain was approximately $7 million.  At the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common stock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value, the equity method requires the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the investor's share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from the sale. It is the Company's policy to record an adjustment reflecting its share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from such a sale as a gain or loss in other income. Consequently, the Company also recognized in the third quarter of 1998 other income of approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering. As of September 25, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's investment in ARM carried in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately $22 million. On October 14, 1998, the Company sold 11.6 million shares (split adjusted) of ARM stock. As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM fell to 19.7%. Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company ceased accounting for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity method and categorized its remaining shares as available-for-sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  During fiscal 1999, the Company sold approximately 32.6 million shares (split adjusted) of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $245 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $230 million, and recognized related income tax of approximately $25 million. As of September 25, 1999, the Company's remaining 16 million shares of ARM stock are valued at $226 million. The fair value of the Company's investment in ARM is reflected in other assets as of September 25, 1999, with an offsetting amount net of $84 million of related deferred income taxes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.  PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES  As of September 25, 1999, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $613 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of September 25, 1999, a valuation allowance of $60 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was 11% compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes were provided.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed federal income tax deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although most of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.                                         16  The Company anticipates its effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 will be approximately 25%. The foregoing statement is forward-looking. The Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition." Additionally, the actual future tax rate will be significantly impacted by the amount of and jurisdiction in which the Company's foreign profits are earned.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions):                                                                    1999       1998       1997                                                               --------   --------   --------        Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments..........   $3,226     $2,300     $1,459 Accounts receivable, net....................................   $  681     $  955     $1,035 Inventory...................................................   $   20     $   78     $  437 Working capital.............................................   $2,736     $2,178     $1,606 Days sales in accounts receivable(a)........................       46         56         58 Days of supply in inventory(b)..............................        2          6         31 Operating cash flow.........................................   $  798     $  775     $  154   - ------------------------  (a) Based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales     for each period.  (b) Based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each     period.  As of September 25, 1999, the Company had $3.226 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $926 million or 40% over the same balances at the end of fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1999, the Company's primary source of cash was $798 million in cash flows from operating activities. Cash generated by operations was primarily from net income, declines in accounts receivables and inventory resulting from improved asset management, and an increase in accounts payable. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 25, 1999 and 1998, include $4 million and $56 million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit.  In addition to the net purchase of short-term investments of $1.081 billion, net cash used by investing activities included $112 million for the purchase of investments in Samsung and Akamai discussed below and $47 million for the purchase of fixed assets. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of ARM stock of $245 million and proceeds from the sale of equipment of $23 million. The Company expects the level of capital expenditures in 2000 will increase moderately from 1999.  In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. As of September 25, 1999, the Company had repurchased a total of 1.25 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $75 million.  On November 18, 1999, the Company entered into a $100 million revolving credit agreement with Bank of America. Loans under the agreement pay interest at LIBOR plus 1%, and the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.2% of the unused portion of the credit facility. No advances have been made against this credit facility. This revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the Company with an additional source of liquidity and to provide additional support to the Company's capital position in the event of short-term liquidity disturbances in worldwide financial markets associated with the Year 2000 crossover.  The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve months, including any cash utilized by its stock repurchase plan. However, given the Company's current non-investment grade debt ratings, if the Company should need to obtain short-term borrowings, there can no assurance such borrowings could be                                         17  obtained at favorable rates. The inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.  OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS  As discussed above, the Company has categorized its shares in ARM as available-for-sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. As of September 25, 1999, the Company held 16 million shares of ARM stock valued at $226 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2000 through December 17, 1999, the Company sold an additional 5.1 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $136 million and gains before taxes of approximately $134 million. As of December 17, 1999, the Company holds 10.9 million shares of ARM stock valued at approximately $690 million.  During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung) to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel display production capacity. The investment, in the form of three year unsecured bonds, is convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock beginning in June 2000. The bonds carry an annual coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their maturity.  In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. The Company is restricted from selling more than 25% of its shares within one year after the date of the closing of a public offering of Akamai's stock. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company has categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale requiring they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 17, 1999, the fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai was approximately $1.2 billion. Because Akamai is a newly public company and its stock price has experienced significant volatility, the fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai may fluctuate significantly in the future.  YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE  THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW RELATED TO YEAR 2000 (Y2K) COMPLIANCE CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K REGARDING Y2K COMPLIANCE.  YEAR 2000  The Year 2000 (Y2K) issue is the result of certain computer hardware, operating system software and software application programs having been developed using two digits rather than four to define a year. For example, the clock circuit in the hardware may be incapable of holding a date beyond the year 1999; some operating systems may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than 2000 and certain applications may have limited date processing capabilities. These problems could result in the failure of major systems or miscalculations, which could have a material impact on companies through business interruption or shutdown, financial loss, damage to reputation, and legal liability to third parties.  Y2K PLAN  The Company's Information Systems and Technology department (IS&T) began addressing the Y2K issue in 1996 as part of its Next Generation strategy, which addressed the need for ongoing enhancement and replacement of the Company's various disparate legacy information technology (IT) Systems. In 1998, the Company established a Year 2000 Executive Steering Committee (Steering Committee) comprised of senior executives of the Company and the Company's Year 2000 Project Management Office (PMO). The PMO reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Steering Committee, and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.                                         18  The PMO developed and manages the Company's worldwide Y2K strategic plan (Y2K Plan) to address the potential impact of Y2K on the Company's operations and business processes. In particular, the Y2K Plan addresses four principal areas that may be impacted by the Y2K issue: Apple Branded Products; Third Party Relationships; Non-IT Business Systems; and IT Systems. With respect to the IT Systems and Non-IT Business Systems, the Y2K Plan consists of four separate but overlapping phases: Phase I--Inventory and Risk Assessment; Phase II--Remediation Cost Estimation; Phase III--Remediation; and Phase IV--Remediation Testing. In addition, the Company has an ongoing Y2K Awareness Program designed to keep employees informed about Y2K issues. The discussion below reflects management's estimate of the current status of the four principal areas of the Company's Y2K Plan. Regardless of the current status, all areas of the Y2K Plan remain under review and subject to modification as deemed necessary throughout the remainder of calendar 1999 through the date rollover and into January 2000.  APPLE BRANDED PRODUCTS  The Company designs and manufactures personal computers, related peripherals, operating system software and application software, including Macintosh personal computers and the Mac OS, which are marketed under the "Apple" brand (collectively "Apple Branded Products"). The Company tested certain Apple Branded Products to determine Y2K compliance, although such testing did not include third party products bundled with Apple Branded Products and certain Apple Branded Products no longer distributed and/or supported by the Company. For purposes of this discussion, Y2K compliant means a product will not produce errors processing date data in connection with the year change from December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000, when used with accurate date data in accordance with its documentation, provided all other products (including other software, firmware and hardware) used with it properly exchange date data with it. A Y2K compliant product will recognize the Year 2000 as a leap year. Information about testing and Y2K compliance of Apple Branded Products is available on the Apple corporate web site under the heading "Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure", at www.apple.com/about/year/. Such information, which is updated on an ongoing basis, is not to be considered part of this annual report. Because the Company does not control the design of non-Apple Branded Products or third party products that are bundled with Apple Branded Products, it cannot assure such products are Y2K compliant.  Some Apple Branded Products installed at customer sites may require upgrades or other remediation. While the Company believes its customers are responsible for the Y2K readiness of their IT and business environments, the Company has taken steps to assist customers in achieving their readiness goals. Apple is issuing software updates (at no additional charge) for most, but not all, known issues in certain Apple Branded Products.  THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS  The Company's business operations are heavily dependent on third party corporate service vendors, materials suppliers, outsourced operations partners, distributors and others. The Company is working with key external parties to identify and attempt to mitigate the potential risks to it of Y2K. The failure of external parties to resolve their own Y2K issues in a timely manner could result in a material financial risk to the Company. As part of its Y2K Plan and to establish the state of readiness of certain third parties, the Company is actively communicating on an ongoing basis with certain third parties whose lack of Y2K compliance would present a high degree of risk to the Company. Based on information obtained from various sources, the Company believes it is reasonably possible there will be interruptions around the world in critical services such as air traffic control, airfreight transportation, customs clearance, telecommunications, and power utilities early in calendar year 2000 that could result in shipping delays of raw material and finished goods. The Company also believes it is reasonably possible that worldwide financial markets could exhibit unusual short-term volatility and liquidity disturbances at the end of calendar 1999 and at the beginning of calendar 2000. Such events could result in material adverse effects on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See further discussion regarding this issue below under the heading "Contingency Plans." The Company has substantially completed its review of certain third parties as of the                                         19  end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. Although numerous third parties have advised the Company they are addressing their Y2K issues, the readiness of third parties overall varies widely. Because the Company's Y2K compliance is dependent on the timely Y2K compliance of third parties, there can be no assurances the Company's efforts alone will resolve all Y2K issues. The Company continues to communicate with and monitor the compliance efforts of key third parties. The Company will continue these efforts with key third parties through the date rollover and into January 2000.  IT SYSTEMS AND NON-IT BUSINESS SYSTEMS  Phase I--Inventory and Risk Assessment:  This Phase requires an inventory and assessment of the Non-IT Business Systems used by the Company, including systems with embedded technology, building access systems, and health and safety systems. This Phase also includes inventory and assessment of IT Systems used by the Company, including large IS&T systems, desktop hardware and software, and network hardware and software. Each system is evaluated and the business risk is quantified as being High, Medium or Low Risk to the Company's business. Systems that are High Risk are those, which if uncorrected, would cause an interruption of or complete failure to conduct the Company's business. Medium Risks are those that would negatively impact the business but complete cessation could be avoided with some inconvenience. Low Risks are those where the risk to business interruption or cessation are remote. The Company intends that High and Medium Risk items will be remediated or replaced, and Low Risk items will likely not be addressed prior to the Year 2000. The status of the Company's remediation efforts is discussed below. The Company had substantially completed the Inventory and Risk Assessment Phase for both IT Systems and Non-IT Systems by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1999. However, the Company has and will continue to review information developed as the result of its Y2K Plan, which could result in additional items being added to its Y2K inventory.  Phase II--Remediation Cost Estimation:  This Phase involves the analysis of each High and Medium Risk to determine how such risks may be remediated and the cost of such remediation. The Company has substantially completed this Phase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems.  Phase III--Remediation:  This Phase includes the replacement or correction of the High and Medium Risk Non-IT Business Systems and IT Systems. The Company substantially completed this Phase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999.  Phase IV--Remediation Testing:  This Phase includes the future date testing of the remediation efforts made in Phase III to confirm that the changes made bring the affected systems into compliance, no new problems have arisen as a result of the remediation, and new systems that replaced noncompliant systems are Y2K compliant. The Company substantially completed this Phase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems during the first quarter of fiscal 2000.  COSTS TO ADDRESS Y2K  The costs of the Y2K program are primarily costs associated with the utilization of existing internal resources and incremental external spending. The Company's current estimate of total incremental external spending over the life of its Y2K plan to address those risks identified as High or Medium is approximately $10 million of which approximately $9 million had been spent as of September 25, 1999. As the Company's Y2K Plan continues, the actual future incremental spending may prove to be higher. Also, this estimate does not include the costs that could be incurred by the Company if one or more of its significant third party vendors fails to achieve Y2K compliance. The Company is not separately identifying                                         20  and including in these estimates the Y2K costs incurred that are the result of utilization of the Company's existing internal resources.  CONTINGENCY PLANS  Under the guidance and management of the PMO, the Company is in the final stages of developing, implementing, and testing Y2K contingency plans for critical business operations. The Company's contingency plans, which are based in part on the assessment of the magnitude and probability of potential risks, primarily focus on proactive steps to prevent Y2K failures from occurring, or if they should occur, to detect them quickly, minimize their impact and expedite their remediation. The Y2K contingency plans will supplement existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans.  As part of its contingency plans, the Company has developed a global Incident Management Team (IMT) to identify, escalate, and mitigate the potential impact of various Y2K failures. The IMT is comprised of personnel from the PMO as well as key areas of the Company's operations. The IMT will begin to monitor the date rollover commencing with Sydney, Australia and will "follow the sun" through the time change in the Pacific Standard Time zone. The Company's contingency planning efforts were approximately 85% complete at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 and are expected to be substantially completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2000.  The Company believes it is reasonably possible there will be interruptions in air traffic control, airfreight transportation, customs clearance, telecommunications, and power utilities early in calendar year 2000 that could result in shipping delays of raw material and finished goods and other business interruptions. The Company has developed and implemented contingency plans to mitigate the effects of a short-term interruption in such services. However, if the interruption in these services last for an extended period of time, or if alternative Y2K compliant services are not readily available at reasonable cost, there could be material adverse effects on the Company's results of operations and financial position.  The Company also believes it is reasonably possible worldwide financial markets could exhibit unusual short-term volatility and liquidity disturbances at the end of calendar 1999 and at the beginning of calendar 2000. The Company has developed and implemented contingency plans to mitigate some of the potential short-term effects of such disturbances. However, if these disturbances in the financial markets last for an extended period of time, or if alternative mitigating actions are not readily available at reasonable cost, there could be material adverse effects on the Company's results of operations and financial position.  RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH Y2K ISSUES  The Company has substantially completed its initial assessment of reasonably likely worst case scenarios of Non-IT Business Systems and/or IT Systems failures and related consequences. Based on current information, the Company believes the most likely worst case scenario is it will experience minor malfunctions and failures of its IT Systems and Non-IT Business Systems at the beginning of the Year 2000 not previously detected during the Company's inventory and risk assessment and remediation activities. The Company currently believes these malfunctions and failures will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance the Y2K remediation by the Company or third parties will be properly and timely completed, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its business, its results of operations, and its financial condition.  In particular, the Company believes a lack of Y2K readiness by its significant third party vendors could cause material interruptions in the Company's operations. The identification of additional issues with respect to the Y2K compliance of key third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. In addition, important factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the ability of the Company to successfully identify systems and vendors that have a Y2K issue, the nature and amount of remediation effort required to fix the affected systems, the adequacy of such remediation efforts, the production-related contingency plans of competitors with the Company's                                         21  third party suppliers, and the costs and availability of labor and resources to successfully address the Y2K issues and/or to execute on any required contingency plans.  FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION  COMPETITION  The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including consumer, education and publishing. Additionally, several of the Company's competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design and technical features of the Company's products. Many of the Company's competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, the Company's future operating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another.  The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing Microsoft Windows operating systems. The Company believes the innovative industrial design of its products, the unique set of features its products currently provide, the perceived advantages of the Mac OS over Windows, and the general reluctance of the Macintosh installed base to incur the costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware in recent years. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms.  PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS  Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations.  The Company plans to continue to introduce upgrades to the current Mac OS, Mac OS 9, and later introduce a new operating system, Mac OS X Client, which is expected to offer advanced functionality based on Apple and NeXT software technologies. It is uncertain whether Mac OS X will gain developer support and market acceptance. Inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially backward-compatible Mac OS X or of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS, or to gain                                         22  developer support and market acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition.  INVENTORY AND SUPPLY  The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand and accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may again have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations.  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns.  Many of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service. Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, the Company may remain primarily liable. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition.  Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components (including without limitation DRAM and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained, the Company's business and financial performance could be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone and automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial condition.  The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with                                         23  price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using the Windows operating systems.  Further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Raw Materials," and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8 under the subheading "Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION  The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, and directly to education institutions for resale (collectively referred to as "resellers"). In addition, the Company also sells many of its products in most of its major markets directly to end users through its on-line store. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins. Most such resellers also distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products causes resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products.  Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Markets and Distribution," which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  GLOBAL MARKET RISKS  A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased.  Countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, have recently experienced weaknesses in their currency, banking and equity markets. These weaknesses have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect consumer demand for the Company's products, the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales, the availability and cost of product components to the Company, and consequently the Company's results of operations.  Further information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference.  SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS  Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications. The Company believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and declining demand for the Company's products, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused                                         24  software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce Mac OS X could cause software developers to stop developing software for the current Mac OS. In addition, there can be no assurance software developers will decide to develop software for the new operating system on a timely basis or at all.  In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years from August 1997, as subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. The Company will bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac OS system software releases and make that product the default Internet browser for such releases. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the Company competes with Microsoft, including the Windows platform. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS not covered by the relationship or following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. In addition, the Microsoft relationship may have an adverse effect on, among other things, the Company's relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance the benefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages.  EURO CONVERSION  On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union adopted the Euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro. The Euro is now traded on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions. A three year transition period began during which transactions can be made in the old currencies.  The Company has taken steps to evaluate internal system capabilities, review the ability of financial institution vendors to support Euro transactions, and examine current marketing and pricing policies and strategies in light of the Euro conversion. The cost of this effort is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance, however, all issues related to the Euro conversion have been identified and that any additional issues would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. The conversion to the Euro may have competitive implications on the Company's pricing and marketing strategies, the impact of which are not known at this time. Additionally, the Company is at risk to the extent its principal European suppliers and customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the Euro conversion.  OTHER FACTORS  The potential risks associated with the Company's Y2K Plan are discussed above under the heading "Year 2000 Compliance."  The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake.  Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be given such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the environment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company.                                         25  Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the Company's common stock price.  ITEM 7A. DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT  To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial position.  INTEREST RATE RISK  While the Company is exposed with respect to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investments and long-term debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short-term investments. As of September 25, 1999, substantially all of the Company's investments have maturities less than 12 months.  During 1996, the Company issued $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the Notes) to certain qualified parties in a private placement. The Notes were sold at 100% of par. The Notes paid interest semiannually and matured, if not converted earlier, on June 1, 2001. The Notes were convertible by their holders at any time after September 5, 1996, at a conversion price of $29.205 per share subject to adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. No Notes had been converted as of September 25, 1998. The Notes were redeemable by the Company at 102.4% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the 12 month period beginning June 1, 1999, and at 101.2% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the 12 month period beginning June 1, 2000. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $15 million of costs associated with the issuance of the Notes. These costs were accounted for as a deduction from the face amount of the Notes and were being amortized over the life of the Notes.  On April 14, 1999, the Company called for redemption the Notes. Not including approximately $7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, debentures in an aggregate principal amount outstanding totaled approximately $661 million as of March 27, 1999. During the third quarter of 1999, debenture holders                                         26  chose to convert virtually all of the outstanding debentures to common stock at a rate of $29.205 per share resulting in the issuance of approximately 22.6 million shares of the Company's common stock.  During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004.  The following table presents the principal (or notional) amounts and related weighted-average interest rates for the Company's investment portfolio and its long-term debt obligations. The long-term debt is comprised of $300 million of unsecured notes described above, which mature in February 2004. The Company's U.S. corporate securities include commercial paper, loan participations, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities include foreign commercial paper, loan participation, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments have generally been held until maturity. Gross unrealized gains and losses were negligible as of September 25, 1999 and 1998.  In millions, except weighted-average interest rates                                                              SEPTEMBER 25, 1999        SEPTEMBER 25, 1998                                                          --------------------      --------------------                                                                     WEIGHTED-                 WEIGHTED-                                                                      AVERAGE                   AVERAGE                                                          CARRYING   INTEREST       CARRYING   INTEREST                                                           AMOUNT      RATE          AMOUNT      RATE                                                          --------   ---------      --------   ---------          Assets:   Cash equivalents:     U.S. Treasury and Agency securities................   $    3      5.00%         $   10      5.45%     U.S. corporate securities..........................      517      5.16%            785      5.55%     Foreign securities.................................      636      4.94%            613      5.55%                                                           ------                    ------       Total cash equivalents...........................    1,156      5.04%          1,408      5.55%                                                           ------                    ------    Short-term investments:     U.S. Treasury and Agency securities................   $  298      5.57%         $    0       N/A     U.S. corporate securities..........................      780      5.72%            163      5.56%     Foreign securities.................................      822      5.39%            656      5.54%                                                           ------                    ------       Total short-term investments.....................    1,900      5.55%            819      5.54%                                                           ------                    ------   Total investment securities..........................   $3,056      5.36%         $2,227      5.55%                                                           ======                    ======  Debt:   Fixed rate...........................................   $  300      5.98%         $  954      6.07%                                                           ======                    ======   Purchased floors are options limiting the Company's exposure to falling interest rates on its cash equivalents and short-term investments by locking in a minimum interest rate. The Company receives a payment when interest rates fall below a predetermined level. A purchased floor generally qualifies for hedge accounting treatment and is reported on the balance sheet at its premium cost, which is amortized over the life of the floor. The purchased floors are generally designated and effective as hedges against interest rate risk on the Company's securities classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value in other current liabilities with the unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Purchased floors outstanding as of September 25, 1998, provided the Company with the option of a weighted-average interest rate of 5.15% on the notional amount of $525 million. There were no purchased floors outstanding as of September 25, 1999. Gains and losses are recognized in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net in the same period as the hedged transaction. Unrealized gains and losses on such contracts were immaterial as of September 25, 1998.                                         27  During the last two years, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management.  The interest rate swaps qualifying as accounting hedges generally require the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively convert the Company's fixed-rate 10 year debt to floating-rate debt and convert the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The maturity date for $25 million of the asset swaps is October 1999 with the remaining debt and asset swaps maturing in February and September of 2001. As of September 25, 1999 and 1998, interest rate debt swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 6.04%. The weighted-average pay rate on the debt swaps was 5.45% and 5.73% as of September 25, 1999 and 1998, respectively. As of September 25, 1999, interest rate asset swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 5.53% and a weighted-average pay rate of 5.24%. The unrealized gains and losses on these swaps are deferred and recognized in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net in the same period as the hedged transaction. Deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately $5 million as of September 25, 1999, while deferred gains on such contracts totaled $7 million as of September 25, 1998.  FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK  Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars.  The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company's foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of the related currency's historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities. The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and marked to market through earnings.  Probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the Company's products and purchases of raw material, sub-assemblies, and assembled finished goods in currencies other than the functional currency. A majority of these transactions are made through the Company's subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia. The Company purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with these probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company also sells foreign exchange option contracts, in order to partially finance the purchase of these foreign exchange option contracts. The term of the Company's foreign exchange hedging instruments, whether for firmly committed transactions, probable but not firmly committed transactions, or to partially finance the foreign risk management program, currently does not extend beyond six months.  Gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are generally recorded in income or shareholders' equity against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly committed transactions are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on                                         28  accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions.  Gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange instruments not accounted for as hedges are recorded in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net. Sold interest rate and foreign exchange instruments do not qualify as accounting hedges. Premiums associated with sold foreign exchange option contracts are marked to market through earnings.  The following table provides information about the Company's foreign currency derivative financial instruments outstanding as of September 25, 1999 and 1998. The information is provided in U.S. dollar amounts, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. For foreign currency exchange contracts, the table presents the notional amount (at contract exchange rates) and the weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates. The combined increase in Yen denominated forward contracts and options is the result of increasing net sales in Japan and the substantial appreciation in the Yen                                         29  during 1999. Generally, all instruments mature within 6 months.
