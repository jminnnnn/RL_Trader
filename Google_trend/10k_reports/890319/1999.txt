Item 1.  BUSINESS

The Company

     Taubman Centers, Inc. (the "Company" or "TCO") was incorporated in Michigan
in 1973 and had its initial public offering  ("IPO") in 1992. Upon completion of
the IPO, the Company became the managing  general  partner of The Taubman Realty
Group Limited  Partnership (the "Operating  Partnership" or "TRG").  The Company
has a 62.8% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, through which the
Company conducts all its operations.  The Company owns, develops,  acquires, and
operates  regional  shopping  centers  ("Centers")  and interests  therein.  The
Company's  portfolio,  as of December 31,  1998,  includes 16 urban and suburban
Centers  located in seven states.  One  additional  Center opened in March 1999.
Three  additional  Centers are presently or will soon be under  construction and
are  expected to open in 2001.  Thirteen  of the  Centers  are  "super-regional"
centers  because they have more than 800,000 square feet of gross leasable area.
The Operating  Partnership  also owns certain  regional  retail  shopping center
development   projects  and  more  than  99%  of  The  Taubman  Company  Limited
Partnership (the "Manager"),  which manages the shopping  centers,  and provides
other services to the Operating  Partnership  and the Company.  See the table on
pages 12 and 13 of this report for information regarding the Centers.

  The Company is a real estate  investment  trust,  or REIT,  under the Internal
Revenue  Code of  1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code").  In order  to  satisfy  the
provisions of the Code  applicable to REITs,  the Company must distribute to its
shareholders  at least 95% of its REIT  taxable  income and meet  certain  other
requirements.  The Operating Partnership's agreement provides that the Operating
Partnership will distribute,  at a minimum,  sufficient  amounts to its partners
such  that  the  Company's  pro  rata  share  will  enable  the  Company  to pay
shareholder  dividends  (including  capital gains dividends that may be required
upon the  Operating  Partnership's  sale of an asset) that will satisfy the REIT
provisions of the Code.

Recent Developments

     On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10
shopping centers (nine wholly owned (Briarwood, Columbus City Center, The Falls,
Hilltop, Lakeforest, Marley Station, Meadowood Mall, Stoneridge, and The Mall at
Tuttle Crossing) and one joint venture (Woodfield)) and a share of the Operating
Partnership's  debt for all of the partnership units owned by two pension trusts
of General Motors Corporation (GMPT) (the GMPT Exchange). Performance statistics
for periods presented below include these ten centers (the GMPT Centers) through
the completion of the GMPT Exchange, except as noted.

  For a discussion of the GMPT  Exchange and other  business  developments  that
occurred in 1998,  see the  response  to Item 7,  "Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD&A).

The Shopping Center Business

  There are several types of retail shopping centers,  varying primarily by size
and marketing strategy.  Retail shopping centers range from neighborhood centers
of less than 100,000 square feet of GLA to regional and super-regional  shopping
centers.  Retail  shopping  centers in excess of 400,000  square feet of GLA are
generally referred to as "regional" shopping centers, while those centers having
in  excess  of  800,000  square  feet  of  GLA  are  generally  referred  to  as
"super-regional"  shopping centers. In this annual report on Form 10-K, the term
"regional shopping centers" refers to both regional and super-regional  shopping
centers. The term "GLA" refers to gross retail space, including anchors and mall
tenant areas,  and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail  space,  excluding
anchors.  The term "anchor"  refers to a department  store or other large retail
store.  The term "mall  tenants"  refers to stores (other than anchors) that are
typically specialty retailers and lease space in shopping centers.

Business of the Company

  The Company,  as managing  general  partner of the Operating  Partnership,  is
engaged in the ownership,  management,  leasing,  acquisition,  development  and
expansion of regional shopping centers.

  The Centers:

  o are strategically  located in major metropolitan  areas, many in communities
    that are among the most  affluent in the country,  including  New York City,
    Los Angeles, Denver, Detroit, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.;

  o range in size between 437,000 and 1.5 million square feet of GLA and between
    132,000  and  598,000  square  feet of Mall GLA.  The  smallest  Center  has
    approximately 50 stores,  and the largest has  approximately  200 stores. Of
    the 16 Centers, 13 are super-regional shopping centers;

  o have  approximately  2,160  stores  operated  by its mall  tenants  under
    approximately 790 trade names;

  o have 50 anchors, operating under 15 trade names;

  o lease   approximately  77%  of  Mall  GLA  to  national  chains,   including
    subsidiaries  or  divisions of The Limited (The  Limited,  Limited  Express,
    Victoria's  Secret,  and others),  The Gap (The Gap,  Banana  Republic,  and
    others),  and Venator Group,  Inc. (Foot Locker,  Kinney Shoes, and others);
    and

  o are among the most productive  (measured by mall tenants' average per square
    foot  sales) in the United  States.  In 1998,  mall  tenants had average per
    square foot sales of $426, which is  substantially  greater than the average
    for all regional shopping centers owned by public companies.

     The most important factor  affecting the revenues  generated by the Centers
is leasing to mall tenants  (primarily  specialty  retailers),  which represents
approximately 90% of revenues.  Anchors account for approximately 5% of revenues
because many own their stores and, in general,  those that lease their stores do
so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.

  The Company's  portfolio is concentrated in highly  productive  super-regional
shopping  centers.  Of the 16 Centers,  13 had annual rent rolls at December 31,
1998 of over $10 million and  had  annualized  sales per square foot in excess
of $350. The Company  believes that this level of  productivity is indicative of
the  Centers'  strong   competitive   position  and  is,  in  significant  part,
attributable  to the Company's  business  strategy and  philosophy.  The Company
believes  that  large  shopping  centers  (including   regional  and  especially
super-regional shopping centers) are the least susceptible to direct competition
because (among other reasons)  anchors and large specialty  retail stores do not
find it  economically  attractive  to open  additional  stores in the  immediate
vicinity of an existing  location  for fear of  competing  with  themselves.  In
addition to the  advantage  of size,  the  Company  believes  that the  Centers'
success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics,  such
as design, layout, and amenities.

                                      2

Business Strategy And Philosophy

  The Company believes that the regional  shopping center business is not simply
a real estate development business,  but rather an operating business in which a
retailing  approach  to the  on-going  management  and leasing of the Centers is
essential. Thus the Company:

  o offers a large,  diverse  selection of retail  stores in each Center to give
    customers a broad selection of consumer goods and variety of price ranges;

  o endeavors to increase  overall mall  tenants'  sales,  and thereby  increase
    achievable rents, by leasing space to a constantly  changing mix of tenants;
    and

  o seeks to anticipate trends in the retailing  industry and emphasizes ongoing
    introductions  of new retail concepts into the Centers.  Due in part to this
    strategy,  a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first
    mall stores in the Centers.  The Company believes that its execution of this
    leasing  strategy is unique in the industry  and is an important  element in
    building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity.

  The Centers compete for retail consumer  spending  through  diverse,  in-depth
presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to
facilitate  customer  shopping.  While some Centers  include  stores that target
high-end,  upscale customers,  each Center is individually merchandised in light
of the  demographics  of  its  potential  customers  within  convenient  driving
distance.

  The  Company's  leasing  strategy  involves  assembling  a diverse mix of mall
tenants in each of the Centers in order to attract customers, thereby generating
higher  sales by mall  tenants.  High  sales by mall  tenants  make the  Centers
attractive to  prospective  tenants,  thereby  increasing  the rental rates that
prospective tenants are willing to pay. The Company implements an active leasing
strategy to  increase  the  Centers'  productivity  and to set minimum  rents at
higher  levels.   Elements  of  this  strategy  include  terminating  leases  of
under-performing  tenants,  renegotiating existing leases, and not leasing space
to prospective  tenants that (though viable or attractive in certain ways) would
not enhance a Center's retail mix.

Potential For Growth

     The Company's  principal  objective is to enhance  shareholder  value.  The
Company seeks to maximize the financial results of its assets,  while pursuing a
growth strategy that concentrates  primarily on an active new center development
program.

Development of New Centers
- --------------------------

     The  Company is  pursuing an active  program of  regional  shopping  center
development.  The  Company  believes  that  it  has  the  expertise  to  develop
economically  attractive regional shopping centers through intensive analysis of
local retail  opportunities.  The Company  believes that the  development of new
centers is the best use of its capital and an area in which the Company  excels.
At any time, the Company has numerous potential  development projects in various
stages.

  During  November 1998, the Company  opened Great Lakes  Crossing,  an enclosed
value  super-regional  mall in Auburn Hills,  Michigan.  In addition,  MacArthur
Center, located in Norfolk, Virginia, opened in March 1999.






                                      3

<PAGE>



  Additionally,  three new  centers  are  currently  under  construction:  Tampa
International, an enclosed 1.3 million square foot super-regional mall in Tampa,
Florida;  The Shops at Willow Bend, a 1.5 million square foot regional  shopping
center in the metropolitan  Dallas area; and The Mall at Wellington Green, a 1.3
million square foot regional  shopping center located in West Palm Beach County,
Florida. All three of these Centers are expected to open in 2001.

     The Company's policies with respect to development  activities are designed
to reduce the risks  associated  with  development.  For  instance,  the Company
entered into an agreement to lease Memorial City Mall, a center  adjacent to one
of the most  affluent  residential  areas in Houston,  Texas,  while the Company
investigates the  redevelopment  opportunities of the center.  Also, the Company
generally does not intend to acquire land early in the development  process, but
will  instead  generally  acquire  options  on land or  form  partnerships  with
landholders  holding  potentially   attractive   development  sites,   typically
exercising options only once it is prepared to begin construction.  In addition,
the Company does not intend to begin  construction  until a sufficient number of
anchor  stores  have  agreed to operate in the  shopping  center,  such that the
Company  is  confident  that the  projected  sales and  rents  from Mall GLA are
sufficient to earn a return on invested  capital in excess of the Company's cost
of capital.  Having  historically  followed these two principles,  the Company's
experience  indicates  that less than 20% of the costs of the  development  of a
regional  shopping  center will be incurred  prior to the  construction  period;
however,  no assurance can be given that the Company will continue to be able to
so limit pre-construction costs.

  While the  Company  will  continue  to  evaluate  development  projects  using
criteria,  including  financial  criteria for rates of return,  similar to those
employed in the past,  no  assurances  can be given that the  adherence to these
policies will produce comparable  results in the future. In addition,  the costs
of shopping center  development  opportunities  that are explored but ultimately
abandoned  will,  to some  extent,  diminish the overall  return on  development
projects (see "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations -- Liquidity  and Capital  Resources -- Capital  Spending"
for further discussion of the Company's development activities).

Strategic Acquisitions
- ----------------------

  The  Company's  objective is to acquire  existing  centers only when these are
compatible with the quality of the Company's portfolio (or can be redeveloped to
that  level)  and  that  satisfy  the  Company's  strategic  plans  and  pricing
requirements.




                                      4

<PAGE>



  The  Company  believes  it will  have  additional  opportunities  to  acquire 
regional  shopping  centers,  or  interests  therein,   and  will  have  certain
advantages in doing so.

  o First, the management  expertise of the Manager will enhance the leasing and
    operation of newly acquired  regional  shopping  centers.  If  opportunities
    exist to expand,  remodel, or re-merchandise the center through new leasing,
    the  Company's  expertise  will  assist  in making an  informed  and  timely
    evaluation  of  the  economic  consequences  of  such  activities  prior  to
    acquisition, as well as facilitate implementation of such activities.

  o Second,  a center  can be  acquired  for any  combination  of cash or equity
    interests in the Operating  Partnership or (subject to certain  limitations)
    the  Company,   possibly   creating  the  opportunity  for  tax-advantaged  
    transactions for the seller, thereby reducing the price that might otherwise
    have  to be  paid  in an all  cash  transaction  or  making  an  opportunity
    available that would not otherwise exist. The Operating  Partnership is able
    to offer  partnership  interests in itself in exchange  for shopping  center
    interests,  allowing sellers to diversify their interests,  attain liquidity
    not otherwise available, possibly defer taxes that might otherwise be due if
    the  interests  were instead sold for cash,  maintain an  investment  in the
    regional  shopping center business,  and resolve concerns sellers  otherwise
    may have regarding future management of their properties.

Expansions of the Centers
- -------------------------

  Another  potential  element of growth is the  strategic  expansion of existing
properties to update and enhance their market positions,  by replacing or adding
new anchor stores or increasing mall tenant space. Most of the Centers have been
designed to accommodate expansions.  Expansion projects can be as significant as
new  shopping  center  construction  in  terms  of  scope  and  cost,  requiring
governmental  and  existing  anchor  store  approvals,  design  and  engineering
activities, including rerouting utilities, providing additional parking areas or
decking, acquiring additional land, and relocating anchors and mall tenants (all
of which must take place with a minimum of  disruption  to existing  tenants and
customers).  In 1998,  for  example,  the Company  opened a 132,000  square foot
expansion of the Mall GLA at Cherry  Creek and completed a major renovation at  
Woodland.  In addition, a new Macy's will begin construction in 1999 at Fair 
Oaks and is expected to open in 2000.

Internal Growth
- ---------------

  The Centers are among the most productive in the nation, when measured by mall
tenant's average sales per square foot. Higher sales per square foot enable mall
tenants to remain  profitable  while paying  occupancy  costs that are a greater
percentage  of total sales.  As leases  expire at the  Centers,  the Company has
consistently been able, on a portfolio basis, to lease the available space to an
existing or new tenant at higher rates.

  Augmenting  this  growth,  the  Company is pursuing a number of new sources of
revenue from the Centers.  For example,  the Company expects  increased  revenue
from its  specialty  leasing  efforts.  In recent years a new industry -- beyond
traditional  carts and  kiosks -- has  evolved,  with  more and  better  quality
specialty  tenants.  The  Company  has put in place a  company-wide  program  to
maximize this opportunity.

Rental Rates

  As leases have expired in the Centers,  the Company has generally been able to
rent the  available  space,  either to the existing  tenant or a new tenant,  at
rental  rates that are higher than those of the expired  leases.  In a period of
increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations
of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or
declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for
the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older
leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated
at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for
existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per
square foot base rent at Centers that have been owned and open for five years.

(1)Excludes  leases that expire in 1999 for which renewal  leases or leases with
   replacement tenants have been executed as of December 31, 1998.
</TABLE>

  The Company  believes  that the  information  in the table is not  necessarily
indicative  of what will occur in the future  because  of several  factors,  but
principally  because its leasing  policies and  practices  create a  significant
level of early lease  terminations  at the  Centers.  For  example,  the average
remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period 1993 to 1998
was  approximately  1.8 years. The average term of leases signed during 1998 and
1997 was approximately 7.4 years.

  In  addition,  mall  tenants at the  Centers  may seek the  protection  of the
bankruptcy  laws,  which could result in the termination of such tenants' leases
and thus cause a reduction in cash flow.  Prior to 1992, such  bankruptcies  had
not affected more than 3% of leases in the shopping  centers in any one calendar
year. In 1998, approximately 1.2% of leases were so affected compared to 1.5% in
1997,  2.8% in 1996,  3.2% in 1995,  and 3.1% in 1994.  Since  1991,  the annual
provision  for  losses on  accounts  receivable  has been less than 2% of annual
revenues.

  Mall tenant average  occupancy , ending  occupancy,  and leased space rates of
the Centers are as follows:

Major Tenants

  No single retail company represents 10% or more of the Company's revenues. The
combined  operations of The Limited,  Inc.  accounted for approximately  9.4% of
leased Mall GLA as of December 31, 1998 and for  approximately  9.1% of the 1998
base rent.  The largest of these,  in terms of square  footage and rent,  is The
Limited,  which accounted for approximately  1.8% of leased Mall GLA and 1.7% of
1998 base rent.  No other single  retail  company  accounted for more than 4% of
leased Mall GLA or 1998 base rent.


Environmental Matters

  All of the  Centers  presently  owned by the  Company  (not  including  option
interests in the Development  Projects or any of the real estate managed but not
included  in  the  Company's  portfolio)  have  been  subject  to  environmental
assessments. The Company is not aware of any environmental liability relating to
the Centers or any other property in which they have or had an interest (whether
as an owner or operator) that the Company believes would have a material adverse
effect  on  the  Company's  business,  assets,  or  results  of  operations.  No
assurances can be given, however,  that all environmental  liabilities have been
identified or that no prior owner,  operator, or current occupant has created an
environmental condition not known to the Company. Moreover, no assurances can be
given that (i)  future  laws,  ordinances,  or  regulations  will not impose any
material  environmental   liability  or  that  (ii)  the  current  environmental
condition  of the Centers  will not be affected by tenants and  occupants of the
Centers,  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the Centers (such as
the presence of underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to the
Company.

  With  respect  to  the  matters  described  below,  while  there  can  be  no
assurances,  the Company  believes  that such  matters  will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, assets, or results of operations.

  Beverly  Center is located over an oil field and several  abandoned oil wells,
and is adjacent to an active oil production  facility that operates numerous oil
and gas wells.  In the Los  Angeles  basin,  where  Beverly  Center is  located,
pockets of methane gas may be found in oil fields;  however,  elevated levels of
methane have not been detected at Beverly Center.

  Cherry  Creek is situated  on land that was used as a landfill  prior to 1950.
Because  of the past use of the site as a  landfill,  the site is  listed on the
United States  Environmental  Protection  Agency's  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Information System list.

  In the summer of 1997, geotechnical drilling activities were undertaken in the
former  gasoline  station  area  as  part  of a  parking  lot  expansion  at the
southeastern corner of the Cherry Creek site. The geotechnical soil samples were
observed  to have  petroleum  odors and  staining.  A  subsurface  environmental
investigation  subsequently revealed a limited zone of hydrocarbon  contaminated
soils, with no significant impacts to groundwater. Discussions with the Colorado
Department of Labor and Employment,  Oil Inspection  Section,  held in September
1997,  resulted  in a "passive  retardation"  remedial  approach  that relies on
natural processes to degrade the hydrocarbon contamination.  A Corrective Action
Plan was submitted and accepted in 1998 that  provided for  monitoring  the soil
and groundwater.  The monitoring procedures required under this plan have been
completed.

  Paseo  Nuevo is  located  in an area of  known  groundwater  contamination  by
tetrachloroethylene  ("PCE").  The  groundwater  under and  around  the site was
monitored for six years before, during, and after construction of the center. No
on-site sources of PCE were identified during  construction.  The Regional Water
Quality Control Board has given approval to discontinue  the monitoring  program
because the PCE levels remained relatively constant over the six-year period and
do not exceed the state standard for PCE in drinking water.

  There are  asbestos  containing  materials  ("ACMs")  at most of the  Centers,
primarily in the form of floor  tiles,  roof  coatings  and  mastics.  The floor
tiles,  roof coatings and mastics are generally in good  condition.  The Manager
has developed and is  implementing  an operations and  maintenance  program that
details  operating  procedures  with respect to ACMs prior to any renovation and
that requires periodic inspection for any change in condition of existing ACMs.

payment of principal  and interest on the mortgage  debt of these  Centers.  The
loan agreements  provide for the reduction of the amounts  guaranteed as certain
center   performance  and  valuation   criteria  are  met,  with  the  Operating
Partnership's  guaranty of the Arizona Mills'  principal  being $13.1 million at
December 31, 1998. The guarantee on the MacArthur  Center  mortgage is currently

     During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company  offered and sold a total of
31,399,913 shares of Series B Non-Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (the
"Series B Stock") to the partners  (other than the Company) in TRG, which is the
Company's  subsidiary  Operating   Partnership,   in  an  offering  exempt  from
registration  under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). Under the
Company's  articles of  incorporation,  as amended on September  30,  1998,  the
Company was required to offer each partner in the Operating  Partnership  (other
than the Company) the right to subscribe  for Series B Stock on the basis of one
share of Series B Stock for each Unit of  Partnership  Interest in the Operating
Partnership owned by the subscribing  partner.  The aggregate offering price was
$38,400,  which  was  equal  to the  Series  B  Stock's  per  share  liquidation
preference of $0.001  multiplied by the number of shares sold.  The Company sold
all of the offered shares.  The Company offered and sold all shares directly and
did not pay any  commissions  or  discounts.  

     Each share of Series B Stock is  entitled  to one vote.  The Series B Stock
and the Company's  Common Stock vote as a single class on all matters  submitted
to a vote of the Company's  shareholders.  The Series B Stock is not entitled to
dividends or other distributions, except upon liquidation as indicated above.

     The Series B Stock is convertible under certain  circumstances  into Common
Stock at the ratio of one share of Common Stock for each 14,000 shares of Series
B Stock (with any resulting fractional shares of Common Stock being redeemed for
cash). Generally, a partner desiring to sell (by exchange or otherwise) Units in
the Operating Partnership to the Company must surrender for conversion shares of
Series B Stock  equal in number to the  Units  being  sold.  In  addition,  if a
transfer  of Series B Stock  results in the  transferee  holding  more shares of
Series B Stock than is permitted under the Company's  articles of incorporation,
then the  shares  of  Series B Stock in  excess  of the  permitted  number  will
automatically  convert  into  Common  Stock (or will be  redeemed  for cash,  as
indicated above).

     The offering of Series B Stock described above was exempt from registration
under the Securities  Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities  Act. Under
the Company's articles of incorporation,  the Company may issue shares of Series
B Stock only to partners in the  Operating  Partnership.  Offers were limited to
partners  in the  Operating  Partnership,  who  constitute  a limited  number of
sophisticated  investors (all of whom are "accredited  investors," as defined in
Rule 501  under  the  Securities  Act)  fully  familiar  with the  business  and
operations  of the  Company,  and did not involve any  general  solicitation  or
advertising.  Under the  Company's  articles  of  incorporation,  resales of the
Series B Stock are permitted  only if registered  (or exempt from  registration)
under the Securities Act, and each certificate evidencing Series B Stock carries
a restrictive legend.

(1)  On September 30, 1998 the  Company obtained a  majority  and  controlling 
     interest in  The  Taubman  Realty  Group Limited  Partnership  (TRG or the
     Operating Partnership) as a result of the GMPT Exchange (see Management's 
     Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
     (MD&A) - GMPT  Exchange  and Related  Transactions).  As a result of this 
     transaction, the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership increased
     to 62.8% and the  Company began consolidating the  Operating  Partnership. 
     For 1998, the  interest of the  noncontrolling  partners of the  Operating
     Partnership (the Minority Interest) is deducted to arrive at the results 
     allocable to the Company's shareowners.  For years prior to 1998, amounts 
     reflect  the  Company's  interest in the  Operating Partnership under the 
     equity method.
(2)  1998   extraordinary   charges   include  $49.8  million  related  to  debt
     extinguished in anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  primarily consisting of
     prepayment premiums. In 1995, the Company recognized its $6.6 million share
     of an extraordinary  gain related to the disposition of Bellevue Center and
     the related  extinguishment of debt. Also,  included as extraordinary items
     in 1994 through  1998 are charges  related to the  extinguishment  of other
     debt, primarily consisting of prepayment premiums.
(3)  In October 1997, the Company issued 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock on which 
     dividends are paid quarterly.
(4)  Basic and diluted earnings per share  amounts are  equal, except  for 1998,
     for which basic income before extraordinary items per share was $0.33. 
(5)  Operating statistics  for  1998  exclude  centers  transferred  to  GMPT as
     part of the GMPT Exchange. See MD&A for 1997 operating statistics restated
     to exclude the transferred centers.

(6)  Funds from  Operations  is defined and  discussed  in MD&A - Liquidity  and
     Capital  Resources-Funds  from  Operations.  Funds from Operations does not
     represent  cash flow from  operations,  as  defined by  generally  accepted
     accounting principles, and should not be considered to be an alternative to
     net  income as a measure  of  operating  performance  or to cash flows as a
     measure of liquidity.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------------------------------

  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial
Data and the  Financial  Statements  of  Taubman  Centers,  Inc.  and the  Notes
thereto.

General Background and Performance Measurement

  The Company owns a managing general  partner's  interest in The Taubman Realty
Group Limited  Partnership  (Operating  Partnership),  through which the Company
conducts  all of its  operations.  The  Operating  Partnership  owns,  develops,
acquires,  and operates regional shopping centers  nationally.  The Consolidated
Businesses  consist of shopping  centers  that are  controlled  by  ownership or
contractual agreement, development projects for future regional shopping centers
and The Taubman Company Limited Partnership (the Manager). Shopping centers that
are not  controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties
(Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.

  The operations of the shopping  centers are best understood by measuring their
performance  as a whole,  without  regard to the Company's  ownership  interest.
Consequently,   in  addition  to  the   discussion  of  the  operations  of  the
Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are
presented and discussed as a whole.

  On September 30, 1998,  the Operating  Partnership  exchanged  interests in 10
shopping centers (nine Consolidated Businesses (Briarwood, Columbus City Center,
The Falls, Hilltop, Lakeforest,  Marley Station, Meadowood Mall, Stoneridge, and
The Mall at Tuttle Crossing) and one Unconsolidated  Joint Venture  (Woodfield))
and a share of the Operating Partnership's debt for all of the partnership units
owned by General  Motors  Pension Trusts (GMPT) (the GMPT Exchange - see Results
of Operations -- GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions). Performance statistics
presented  below include  these ten centers  (transferred  centers)  through the
completion  of the  GMPT  Exchange,  except  as  noted.  Because  the  Company's
portfolio changed significantly as a result of the GMPT Exchange, the results of
operations of the transferred centers have been separately classified within the
Consolidated  Businesses  and  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  for  purposes of
analyzing and understanding the historical results of the current portfolio.

  Since the Company's  interest in the Operating  Partnership  has been its sole
material  asset  throughout all periods  presented,  references in the following
discussion to "the  Company"  include the  Operating  Partnership,  except where
intercompany  transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted,  even though the
Operating  Partnership did not become a consolidated  subsidiary until September
30, 1998.

Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues

 Over the long term, the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important
determinant  of revenues of the shopping  centers  because mall tenants  provide
approximately  90% of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the
amount of rent,  percentage  rent, and  recoverable  expenses  (together,  total
occupancy  costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay.  However,  levels of mall
tenant  sales can be  considerably  more  volatile  in the short run than  total
occupancy  costs.  

  The Company believes  that the  ability  of tenants to pay occupancy costs and
earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot
increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because
most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can
afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher
sales per square foot.

Occupancy

  Historically,  average annual  occupancy has been within a narrow band. In the
last ten years,  average  annual  occupancy has ranged  between 86.5% and 89.4%.
Mall tenant average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy and leased space rates are as
follows:

   (1) Includes transferred centers through the date of the GMPT Exchange.

Rental Rates

  As leases have expired in the shopping centers, the Company has generally been
able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant,
at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of
increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations
of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or
declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for
the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older
leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated
at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for
existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per
square foot base rent at the shopping  centers that have been owned and open for
five years.

Seasonality

  The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant
sales  highest in the  fourth  quarter  due to the  Christmas  season,  and with
lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter
holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are
generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire
in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of
the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Accordingly,  revenues
and occupancy  levels are generally  highest in the fourth quarter.  Because the
seasonality of sales  contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents
and  recoveries,  mall  tenant  occupancy  costs  (the  sum  of  minimum  rents,
percentage  rents and expense  recoveries)  relative  to sales are  considerably
higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter.

Results of Operations

  The following represent  significant debt and equity transactions,  new center
openings,  acquisitions  and  expansions  which  affect  the  operating  results
described under Comparison of Fiscal Year 1998 to Fiscal Year 1997.

GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions

  On September 30, 1998,  the Operating  Partnership  exchanged  interests in 10
shopping  centers  (nine wholly  owned and one  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture),
together  with  $990  million  of  debt,  for all of  GMPT's  partnership  units
(approximately 50 million units with a fair value of $675 million,  based on the
average  stock price of the  Company's  common shares of $13.50 for the two week
period  prior  to the  closing),  providing  the  Company  with a  majority  and
controlling  interest  in the  Operating  Partnership.  As a result  of the GMPT
Exchange,   the  Company's  general   partnership   interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership  increased  to  62.8% of the  approximately  84.3  million  units of
partnership  interest  outstanding.  The Operating  Partnership will continue to
manage the centers  exchanged under management  agreements with GMPT that expire
December 31, 1999. The management agreements are cancelable with 90 days notice.

  In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating Partnership used the $1.2
billion  proceeds from two bridge loans bearing interest at one month LIBOR plus
1.30% to extinguish  $1.1 billion of debt,  including  substantially  all of the
Operating Partnership's public unsecured debt, its outstanding commercial paper,
and borrowings on its existing line of credit.  The remaining proceeds were used
primarily to pay prepayment  premiums and transaction  costs.  An  extraordinary
charge of  approximately  $49.8  million,  consisting  primarily  of  prepayment
premiums, was incurred in connection with the extinguishment of the debt. GMPT's
share of debt received in the exchange  included the $902 million balance on the
first bridge loan, $86 million representing 50% of the debt on the Joint Venture
owned shopping  center,  and $1.6 million of assessment bond  obligations.  (See
Liquidity and Capital  Resources  below  regarding  the Operating  Partnership's
beneficial interest in debt and its plans to refinance its bridge loan.)

  Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating Partnership committed to a
restructuring of its operations.  A restructuring  charge of approximately $10.7
million was  incurred,  consisting  primarily  of costs  related to  involuntary
termination of personnel.  The Company expects to reduce its annual consolidated
general and administrative expense to approximately $19 million in 1999. This is
a forward-looking  statement,  and certain  significant  factors could cause the
actual reductions in general and  administrative  expense to differ  materially,
including but not limited to: 1) actual payroll reductions  achieved;  2) actual
results of negotiations;  3) use of outside  consultants;  and 4) changes in the
Company's owned or managed portfolio.

Other Debt and Equity Transactions

  In January 1998,  the Operating  Partnership  redeemed a partner's 6.1 million
units of partnership interest for approximately $77.7 million (including costs).
The  redemption  was funded  through  the use of an  existing  revolving  credit
facility.

  In October 1997,  the Company used the $200 million  public  offering of eight
million shares of 8.3% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock to acquire
a  preferred  equity  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  Operating
Partnership  used the net  proceeds  to pay down debt under  existing  revolving
credit and commercial paper facilities,  which were used to fund the acquisition
of Regency Square in September 1997.

Openings, Expansions and Acquisitions

  In  November  1998,  Great  Lakes  Crossing,   an  80%  owned  enclosed  value
super-regional mall, opened in Auburn  Hills,  Michigan.  The center  opened 95%
leased.   In  November   1997,   Arizona  Mills,  a  37%  owned  enclosed  value
super-regional shopping center located in Tempe, Arizona, opened 90% leased.

  At Cherry Creek, a 132,000 square foot expansion  opened in stages  throughout
the fall of 1998. A 135,000 square foot expansion  opened at Westfarms in August
1997. In addition, approximately 50,000 square feet of new mall stores opened at
Biltmore in 1997.

  In September 1997, the Operating Partnership acquired Regency Square (Regency)
shopping center, located in Richmond,  Virginia, for $123.9 million in cash. The
operating  results of Regency have been reflected in the Company's  results from
the acquisition date.

  In December 1997, the Operating Partnership acquired The Falls shopping center
and the leasehold interest in The Mall at Tuttle Crossing,  which opened in July
1997. These two centers were transferred to GMPT.

Memorial City Mall Lease

  In November 1996, the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to lease
Memorial City Mall (Memorial  City),  a 1.4 million square foot shopping  center
located in Houston,  Texas. The lease of this  unencumbered  property grants the
Operating  Partnership  the  exclusive  right to manage,  lease and  operate the
property.  The Operating Partnership has the option to terminate the lease after
the third full lease year by paying $2  million  to the  lessor.  The  Operating
Partnership   is  using  this  option  period  to  evaluate  the   redevelopment
opportunities of the center.  As a development  project,  Memorial City has been
excluded  from all  operating  statistics  in this report,  and Memorial  City's
results of  operations  have been  presented as a net line item in the following
tabular comparisons of results of operations.  Memorial City is expected to have
an immaterial effect on EBITDA and net income during the option period.

Presentation of Operating Results

  In order to facilitate the analysis of the ongoing  business for periods prior
to the GMPT  Exchange,  the  following  tables  contain the  combined  operating
results of the Company and the Operating Partnership and also present separately
the revenues and expenses,  other than interest,  depreciation and amortization,
of the transferred  centers.  The following  discussions include analysis of the
Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, with the interest
of the  noncontrolling  partners  of the  Operating  Partnership  (the  Minority
Interest)  deducted  to  arrive  at  the  results  allocable  to  the  Company's
shareowners.  Because the Operating  Partnership's net equity is less than zero,
for periods subsequent to the GMPT Exchange the income allocated to the Minority
Interest  is equal  to the  Minority  Interest's  share  of  distributions.  The
Operating  Partnership's  net  equity  is  less  than  zero  due to  accumulated
distributions  in excess of net income and not as a result of operating  losses.
Distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income
includes  non-cash  charges for  depreciation  and  amortization.  The Company's
average  ownership  percentage of the Operating  Partnership  was 43.2% for 1998
(including  averages  of 38.96% for the period  through the GMPT  Exchange,  and
62.77% thereafter) and 36.7% for 1997.

Consolidated Businesses
- -----------------------

  Total  revenues  for 1998  were  $322.3  million,  a $20.7  million,  or 6.9%,
increase over 1997. Minimum rents increased $13.4 million, of which $8.9 million
was due to the opening of Great Lakes  Crossing and the  acquisition of Regency.
Minimum  rents also  increased  because of the  expansion at Biltmore and tenant
rollovers.  Expense recoveries  increased  primarily due to Great Lakes Crossing
and  Regency.  Revenues  from  management,   leasing  and  development  services
increased  primarily  due to the new  management  agreements  with  GMPT.  Other
revenue  increased  primarily due to an increase in gains on sales of peripheral
land and lease cancellation revenue.

    Total operating  costs increased $22.8 million,  or 8.6%, to $286.8 million.
Recoverable and other operating  expenses  increased due to Great Lakes Crossing
and Regency.  Other operating  expense also increased due to professional  fees,
management  expense  and an increase  in the charge to  operations  for costs of
potentially unsuccessful pre-development activities.  General and administrative
expense  decreased $2.1 million  between periods due to decreases in payroll and
reduced employee  relocation and recruiter costs,  partially offset by increases
attributable to the phase-in of the long term compensation plan.

  Interest  expense  increased due to an increase in debt used to finance Tuttle
Crossing,  the  acquisition  of The  Falls  and the  redemption  of a  partner's
interest in the Operating  Partnership,  partially  offset by a decrease in debt
paid down with the proceeds of the October 1997 and April 1998 equity  offerings
and the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT  Exchange.  Depreciation
and amortization expense increased due to Great Lakes Crossing, Tuttle Crossing,
Regency and The Falls,  partially  offset by the  decrease in expense due to the
transferred  centers  only being  included in 1998  through the date of the GMPT
Exchange.

  Revenues and expenses other than interest and depreciation for the transferred
centers for 1998 represent operations through the date of the GMPT Exchange. The
resulting decreases from 1997 were partially offset by increases in revenues and
expenses due to the acquisition of The Falls and the opening of Tuttle Crossing.

  During 1998, a $10.7 million loss on the restructuring  was recognized,  which
primarily represented the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
- -----------------------------

  Total  revenues  for 1998 were  $286.3  million,  a $27.5  million,  or 10.6%,
increase  from 1997.  The increase in minimum rents and expense  recoveries  was
primarily due to Arizona Mills and the expansions at Westfarms and Cherry Creek.
Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers. Other revenue decreased by
$1.2 million primarily due to a decrease in gains on peripheral land sales.

  Total operating costs increased by $30.3 million,  or 18.2%, to $196.7 million
for 1998.  Recoverable and  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses  increased
primarily  due to Arizona  Mills and the  expansions.  Other  operating  expense
increased  primarily due to Arizona Mills.  Interest expense increased primarily
due to an  increase  in debt used to  finance  Arizona  Mills and the  Westfarms
expansion, and a decrease in capitalized interest related to these two projects.

  Revenues and expenses other than interest and depreciation for the transferred
centers for 1998 represent the  operations of Woodfield  through the date of the
GMPT Exchange, resulting in decreases from the prior year.

  As a  result  of the  foregoing,  income  before  extraordinary  item  of the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  decreased by $2.7  million,  or 2.9%,  to $89.7
million.  The  Company's  equity  in  income  before  extraordinary  item of the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  was $46.4  million,  a 4.9%  decrease  from the
comparable period in 1997.

Net Income
- ----------

  As a result of the foregoing,  the Company's income before extraordinary items
and Minority Interest decreased to $70.4 million for 1998. The Minority Interest
in the  Company's  results  decreased  to  $6.0  million,  from  $57.8  million,
reflecting the Company's increased ownership in the Operating Partnership due to
the  GMPT  Exchange  and  other  equity  transactions,  as well as the  Minority
Interest's $30.7 million share of the 1998 extraordinary items.

  Also,  the Company  recognized  its $20.1  million  share of $50.8  million in
extraordinary  charges  related to the  extinguishment  of debt,  including debt
extinguished  in  anticipation  of the GMPT  Exchange,  primarily  consisting of
prepayment  premiums.  After  payment  of $16.6  million  in Series A  preferred
dividends, net income (loss) available to common shareowners for 1998 was $(3.0)
million compared to $24.6 million for 1997.

Comparison of Fiscal Year 1997 to Fiscal Year 1996

  Discussion of  significant  debt and equity  transactions,  acquisitions,  and
openings  occurring in 1997 is included in the Comparison of Fiscal Year 1998 to
Fiscal Year 1997. Significant 1996 items are described below.

  In December 1996, the Company acquired an additional interest in the Operating
Partnership  with the proceeds  from the  Company's  December  1996  offering of
common stock. The Operating  Partnership used the net proceeds to pay down short
term floating rate debt and to acquire La Cumbre  Plaza.  Additionally  in 1996,
the Operating  Partnership  issued units of  partnership  interest in connection
with the  acquisition  of the 75%  remaining  interest in Fairlane  Town Center.
These units were redeemed by the Operating Partnership in January 1998. Prior to
the acquisition date, the Company's  interest in Fairlane (through the Operating
Partnership)  was  accounted  for under the equity  method as an  Unconsolidated
Joint Venture.  Additionally, in June 1996, the Operating Partnership acquired a
100% leasehold  interest in Paseo Nuevo,  located in Santa Barbara,  California,
for $37 million in cash.

  The Company's  average ownership  percentage of the Operating  Partnership was
36.7% for 1997 and 34.5% for 1996.

Consolidated Businesses
- -----------------------

  Total revenues for 1997 were $301.6 million, a $39.4 million or 15.0% increase
over 1996.  Minimum rents  increased  $17.0 million,  of which $15.1 million was
caused by the 1997 and 1996  acquisitions.  The  results of  Fairlane  have been
consolidated  in  the  Operating   Partnership's   results   subsequent  to  the
acquisition  date in July 1996 (prior to that date  Fairlane was  accounted  for
under the equity method as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture).  Minimum rents also
increased due to the expansion at Biltmore and tenant rollovers. Percentage rent
and  expense  recoveries  increased  primarily  due to the  acquisitions.  Other
revenue  increased  $2.2  million  primarily  due to an  insurance  recovery,  a
litigation  settlement,  and an  increase  in lease  cancellation  revenue.  The
transferred  centers' total revenues  increased  primarily due to the opening of
Tuttle Crossing.

  Total  operating  costs  increased  $29.0 million,  or 12.3%.  Recoverable and
depreciation  and  amortization   expenses   increased   primarily  due  to  the
acquisitions.   Other  operating  expenses   increased   primarily  due  to  the
acquisitions,  offset by a  decrease  in the charge to  operations  for costs of
potentially unsuccessful pre-development activities. General and administrative
expense  increased by $4.0 million  primarily  due to increases in  compensation
(including  the  continuing  phase-in  of  the  long-term   compensation  plan),
recruiter fees and relocation  charges,  travel, and training.  Interest expense
increased due to an increase in debt used to finance Tuttle Crossing and capital
expenditures at other Consolidated  Businesses,  partially offset by an increase
in capitalized interest.  The acquisitions were initially funded with debt which
was  subsequently  paid down with the proceeds  from the  December  1996 and the
October 1997 equity issuances.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
- -----------------------------

  Total revenues for 1997 were $258.8 million, a $6.5 million, or 2.5%, decrease
from  1996,  representing  a $15.0  million  decrease  caused  by the  change of
Fairlane from an Unconsolidated Joint Venture to a Consolidated Business, offset
by  increases  due to the  openings  of  Arizona  Mills  and  the  expansion  at
Westfarms,  in addition to increases at other  centers.  The decrease in minimum
rents was  primarily  due to Fairlane,  offset by Arizona  Mills,  Westfarms and
increases  due to tenant  rollovers  at other  centers.  The decrease in expense
recoveries was primarily due to Fairlane, offset by Arizona Mills. Other revenue
increased  by $0.4  million  primarily  due to gains on  peripheral  land sales,
offset by a decrease in lease cancellation revenue and interest income.

  Total operating  costs  decreased by $4.7 million,  or 2.7%, to $166.4 million
for  1997  including  a $10.1  million  decrease  due to  Fairlane.  Recoverable
expenses  decreased $4.6 million primarily due to Fairlane,  offset by increases
due to Arizona Mills. Other operating costs decreased  primarily due to Fairlane
and a  decrease  in bad  debt  expense.  Additionally,  included  in 1996  other
operating expense was a nonrecurring $0.5 million payment to an anchor at one of
the  centers.  Interest  expense  increased  $1.0  million  primarily  due to an
increase  in debt used to finance  Arizona  Mills and the  Westfarms  expansion,
partially  offset by a decrease in debt related to Fairlane.  Operating costs as
presented in the preceding  table differ from the amounts shown in the combined,
summarized  financial  statements of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures by the
amount of intercompany profit.

  As a result of the foregoing,  net income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
decreased by $1.9 million,  or 2.0%, to $92.4 million.  The Company's  equity in
net  income of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  was $48.8  million,  a 0.4%
increase from 1996.

Net Income
- ----------

  As a result of the foregoing,  the Company's income before  extraordinary item
and minority interest increased by $10.4 million, or 13.7%, to $86.4 million for
1997. In 1996,  the Company  recognized a $1.3 million  extraordinary  charge
related to the prepayment of Fairlane's  debt.  After payment of $4.1 million in
Series A preferred  dividends,  net income  available to common  shareowners for
1997 was $24.6 million, compared to $20.3 million in 1996.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

  On  September  30,  1998,  the  Company  obtained a majority  and  controlling
interest in the  Operating  Partnership  as a result of the GMPT  Exchange  (see
Results  of  Operations  --  GMPT  Exchange  and  Related  Transactions  above).
Consequently,  the  Company  has  consolidated  the  accounts  of the  Operating
Partnership  in the Company's  financial  statements for the year ended December
31,1998.  For prior  periods,  the Company  accounted for its  investment in the
Operating  Partnership  under the equity  method.  In the following  discussion,
references to beneficial interest represent the Operating Partnership's share of
the results of its consolidated and unconsolidated  businesses. The Company does
not have, and has not had, any parent company  indebtedness;  all debt discussed
represents obligations of the Operating Partnership.

  The  Company  believes  that its net cash  provided by  operating  activities,
distributions  from the Joint  Ventures,  the  unutilized  portion of its credit
facilities,  and its  ability  to access  the credit  markets,  assure  adequate
liquidity  to  conduct  its  operations  in  accordance  with its  dividend  and
financing policies.

  As of December 31, 1998, the Company had a consolidated  cash balance of $19.0
million.  Additionally,  the Company has a $200 million line of credit. The line
had no  borrowings  as of December 31, 1998 and expires in September  2001.  The
Company  also has  available  an  unsecured  bank  line of  credit  of up to $40
million.  The line had $15.5  million of  borrowings as of December 31, 1998 and
expires in August 1999.

Equity Transactions

  In April 1998, the Company sold approximately two million shares of its common
stock at $13.1875 per share,  before deducting the  underwriting  commission and
expenses of the offering,  under the Company's shelf registration statement. The
Company  used the  proceeds  to acquire an  additional  equity  interest  in the
Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership paid all costs of the offering.
The Operating Partnership used the net proceeds of approximately $25 million for
general partnership purposes.

  In October  1997,  the Company  issued eight  million  shares of 8.3% Series A
Preferred  Stock under its equity shelf  registration  statement.  Dividends are
payable  in  arrears on or before  the last day of each  calendar  quarter.  The
Company  used the $200 million  proceeds to acquire a Series A Preferred  Equity
interest in the Operating Partnership that entitles the Company to distributions
(in the form of guaranteed  payments) in amounts equal to the dividends  payable
on the Company's Series A Preferred  Stock.  The Operating  Partnership used the
net proceeds to pay down floating rate debt.

Debt

  In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating Partnership used the $1.2
billion  proceeds from two bridge loans bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus
1.30% to extinguish  approximately $1.1 billion of debt, including substantially
all of the  Operating  Partnership's  public  unsecured  debt,  its  outstanding
commercial paper, and borrowings on its existing lines of credit.  The remaining
proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment premiums and transaction costs.

  The balance of the first  bridge  loan of $902  million was assumed by GMPT at
the time of the GMPT Exchange.  The second loan had a balance of $340 million at
December 31, 1998 and expires in June 1999. The Company expects to refinance the
balance on the bridge loan prior to the expiration date (see below).

  Proceeds  from  other  borrowings  in 1998  were  used for the  $77.7  million
redemption of 6.1 million units of partnership  interest in January 1998, and to
fund capital  expenditures for the Consolidated  Businesses and contributions to
Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for construction costs.



                                      30

<PAGE>


  At December 31, 1998,  the  Operating  Partnership's  debt and its  beneficial
interest  in the debt of its  Consolidated  and  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures
totaled $1,186.2  million.  As shown in the following  table,  $190.8 million of
this debt was floating  rate debt that  remained  unhedged at December 31, 1998.
Interest  rates shown do not include  amortization  of debt  issuance  costs and
interest rate hedging costs. These items are reported as interest expense in the
results  of  operations.  In the  aggregate,  these  costs  added  0.47%  to the
effective rate of interest on beneficial  interest in debt at December 31, 1998.
Included in  beneficial  interest in debt is debt used to fund  development  and
expansion  costs.  Beneficial  interest  in  assets on which  interest  is being
capitalized totaled $223.8 million as of December 31, 1998.  Beneficial interest
in capitalized interest was $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.

  Certain  loan  agreements  contain  various  restrictive  covenants  including
limitations  on net worth,  minimum  debt  service  and fixed  charges  coverage
ratios, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, and a minimum debt yield ratio,
the latter being the most restrictive.  The Company is in compliance with all of
such covenants.

  In February  1999, an application  was completed for a secured,  ten-year $270
million financing with an all-in rate of approximately 6.9% on The Mall at Short
Hills.  The  financing  is expected to close by the end of the first  quarter of
1999 and the proceeds will be used to pay down the bridge loan, which matures on
June 21, 1999.  The bridge loan has a balance of $340 million and the Company is
working on refinancing  the remaining  balance.  The Company expects to obtain a
secured  financing  on  an  additional  center.  In  addition,   there  will  be
availability  under existing  lines of credit to repay the remaining  balance if
the additional financing is delayed past the end of the second quarter.

Sensitivity Analysis

  The Company has  exposure to interest  rate risk on its debt  obligations  and
interest  rate  instruments.  Based on the  Operating  Partnership's  beneficial
interest  in debt and  interest  rates in effect at  December  31,  1998,  a one
percent  increase in interest  rates would  decrease  earnings and cash flows by
approximately  $5.2  million.  A one percent  decrease  in interest  rates would
increase  earnings and cash flows by  approximately  $6.0 million.  Based on the
Company's consolidated debt and interest rates in effect at December 31, 1998, a
one percent  increase or decrease in interest  rates would  decrease or increase
the fair value of debt by approximately $7 million.

Funds from Operations

  A principal  factor that the Company  considers  in  determining  dividends to
shareowners  is  Funds  from  Operations,  which is  defined  as  income  before
extraordinary and unusual items, real estate depreciation and amortization,  and
the  allocation  to the minority  interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  less
preferred dividends.

   Funds from  Operations  does not  represent  cash flows from  operations,  as
defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be
considered  to be an  alternative  to net income as an  indicator  of  operating
performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However,
the National  Association of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts suggests that Funds
from Operations is a useful  supplemental  measure of operating  performance for
REITs.

Dividends

  The  Company  pays  regular  quarterly  dividends  to its  common and Series A
preferred shareowners. Dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion
of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash  available to the Company,  its
financial condition,  capital and other requirements,  and such other factors as
the Board of Directors deems relevant. Preferred dividends on the Series A Stock
accrue  regardless  of  whether  earnings,  cash  availability,  or  contractual
obligations were to prohibit the current payment of dividends.

  On December 10, 1998, the Company  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.24 per
common share payable  January 20, 1999 to  shareowners of record on December 31,
1998. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.51875 per
share on the Company's 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock,  paid December 31, 1998 to
shareowners of record on December 21, 1998.

<PAGE>



  Common  dividends  declared  totaled $0.945 per common share in 1998, of which
$0.854  represented  return of capital and $0.091  represented  ordinary income,
compared  to  dividends  declared in 1997 of $0.925 per common  share,  of which
$0.324 represented return of capital and $0.601 represented ordinary income. The
tax status of total 1999 common dividends declared and to be declared,  assuming
continuation of a $0.24 per common share quarterly dividend,  is estimated to be
approximately  50% return of capital,  and approximately 50% of ordinary income.
Series A preferred  dividends  declared  were $2.075 and $0.50722 per  preferred
share in 1998 and 1997, respectively,  all of which represented ordinary income.
The tax status of total 1999 dividends to be paid on Series A Preferred Stock is
estimated to be 100% ordinary income.  These are forward-looking  statements and
certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,
including:  1) the amount of  dividends  declared;  2) changes in the  Company's
share of  anticipated  taxable  income of the Operating  Partnership  due to the
actual  results of the  Operating  Partnership;  3) changes in the number of the
Company's  outstanding  shares;  4) property  acquisitions or  dispositions;  5)
financing  transactions,  including refinancing of existing debt; and 6) changes
in the Internal Revenue Code or its application.

  The  annual  determination  of the  Company's  common  dividends  is  based on
anticipated Funds from Operations available after preferred  dividends,  as well
as financing considerations and other appropriate factors.  Further, the Company
has decided that the growth in common  dividends will be less than the growth in
Funds from Operations for the immediate future.

  Any inability of the  Operating  Partnership  or its Joint  Ventures to secure
financing as required to fund maturing debts,  capital  expenditures and changes
in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require
the utilization of cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly reducing
distributions  to partners of the Operating  Partnership  and funds available to
the Company for the payment of dividends.

Capital Spending

  Capital spending for routine  maintenance of the shopping centers is generally
recovered  from  tenants.   Capital  spending  not  recovered  from  tenants  is
summarized in the following tables:

</TABLE>

  The Operating  Partnership's  share of mall tenant  allowances per square foot
leased during the year,  excluding  expansion  space and new  developments,  was
$10.86 ($11.80 excluding the transferred centers) in 1998, and $8.34 in 1997. In
addition,  the Operating  Partnership's  share of  capitalized  leasing costs in
1998,  excluding new developments,  was $11.4 million,  or $8.96 per square foot
leased  ($7.0  million,  or $7.95 per square  foot,  excluding  the  transferred
centers),  and $10.9 million or $10.72 per square foot leased during the year in
1997.

  MacArthur Center, a new center under construction in Norfolk, Virginia, opened
in March 1999. The 930,000 thousand square foot center is anchored by Nordstrom 
and Dillard's.  This Center is owned by a joint venture in which the Operating
Partnership   has  a  70%   controlling   interest  and  is  projected  to  cost
approximately $157 million.

  International  Plaza, a new 1.3 million square foot center under  construction
in Tampa, Florida, will be anchored by Nordstrom,  Lord & Taylor,  Dillard's and
Neiman  Marcus.  This  center  will be owned  by a joint  venture  in which  the
Operating  Partnership  will have a controlling  50.1%  interest.  In 1999,  the
Company held ground-breaking ceremonies for The Shops at Willow Bend, a new 1.5 
million square foot center in Plano, Texas.  Anchors will be Neiman Marcus, Saks
Fifth  Avenue,  Lord & Taylor,  Foley's and  Dillard's.  The Mall at  Wellington
Green,  a 1.3 million square foot center under  construction  in West Palm Beach
County,  Florida, will be anchored by Lord & Taylor, Burdine's, Dillard's and
JCPenney.  The center  will be owned by a joint  venture in which the  Operating
Partnership  has a 90%  controlling  interest.  All three of these  centers  are
expected  to open in 2001  and  will  have an  aggregate  cost to the  Operating
Partnership of over $500 million.

  In 1996, the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to lease Memorial
City Mall, a 1.4 million square foot shopping center located in Houston,  Texas.
Memorial City is anchored by Sears,  Foley's,  Montgomery Ward and Mervyn's.  In
November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  has the option to terminate the lease
by paying $2 million to the  lessor.  The  Operating  Partnership  is using this
option period to evaluate the redevelopment  opportunities of the center.  Under
the terms of the lease, the Operating Partnership has agreed to invest a minimum
of $3  million  during  the  three  year  option  period.  If the  redevelopment
proceeds,  the Operating  Partnership  is required to invest an  additional  $22
million in property  expenditures  not recoverable from tenants during the first
10 years of the lease term.

  The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance to
develop  value  super-regional  projects  in  major  metropolitan  markets.  The
ten-year  agreement  calls for the two  companies to jointly  develop and own at
least seven of these centers,  each representing  approximately  $200 million of
capital  investment.  A number of  locations  across the nation are targeted for
future initiatives.

   The Operating Partnership's share of costs for development projects scheduled
to be  completed in 2001 is  anticipated  to be as much as $185 million and $165
million in 2000 and 2001,  respectively.  Estimates of future  capital  spending
include  only  projects  approved  by the  Company's  Board  of  Directors  and,
consequently,  estimates  will change as new  projects are  approved.  Estimates
regarding capital  expenditures  presented above are forward-looking  statements
and  certain  significant  factors  could  cause the  actual  results  to differ
materially, including but not limited to: 1) actual results of negotiations with
anchors,  tenants  and  contractors;  2)  changes  in the  scope  and  number of
projects;   3)  cost  overruns;   4)  timing  of   expenditures;   5)  financing
considerations; and 6) actual time to complete projects.

   The Company  expects to fund the  development  of new centers  primarily with
proceeds  from  construction  facilities.  Other  potential  sources  of capital
include equity  offerings,  joint venture partner  contributions  and borrowings
under other credit facilities.

Year 2000 Matters

   The approach of the calendar year 2000 (Year 2000)  presents  issues for many
financial,  information, and operational systems that may not properly recognize
the Year 2000.  The Company has  developed a detailed  plan to address the risks
posed by the Year 2000 issue,  covering affected  application and infrastructure
systems.  Affected  systems include both  informational  (such as accounting and
payroll)  and  operational  (such as  elevators,  security  and  lighting).  The
Company's plan also addresses the effect of third parties with which it conducts
business,  including tenants, vendors,  contractors,  creditors, and others. The
Company has completed the assessment,  inventory and planning phases of its plan
and has determined that the majority of the Company's  internal  systems and all
of its mission critical systems are already Year 2000 compliant. The Company has
requested information and has obtained commitments from its national tenants and
the majority of its critical vendors and suppliers, and is continuing to develop
alternative solutions to minimize the impact on the Company in the event they do
not meet their Year 2000 commitments.

   The Company  expects to  remediate  any  remaining  issues  encountered  with
application and infrastructure  systems through repair and/or  replacement,  and
plans  to  perform  a full  system  test by the end of the  first  quarter.  The
estimated  costs of addressing the Year 2000 issue were not material to 1998 and
are not  expected  to be  material to 1999  operations.  The  Company  will also
continue  monitoring the progress of material  third  parties'  responses to the
Year 2000 issue.  The Company believes that its most likely exposure will be the
failure of third parties in  comprehensively  addressing the issue. For example,
failure of utility companies to meet their commitments might result in temporary
business   interruption  at  centers.  The  Company  is  continuing  to  develop
contingency plans in response to such exposure, as appropriate. Failure of third
parties with which the Company conducts business to respond successfully to the
Year 2000 issue may have a material adverse effect on the Company.

Cash Tender Agreement

  A.  Alfred  Taubman  has the annual  right to tender to the  Company  units of
partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership  (provided that the aggregate
value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered
interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the
trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender
Agreement).  At A. Alfred Taubman's  election,  his family, and Robert C. Larson
and his family may  participate in tenders.  The Company will have the option to
pay for  these  interests  from  available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the
proceeds of an offering of the Company's  common stock.  Generally,  the Company
expects to finance these purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock.
The  tendering  partner will bear all market risk if the market price at closing
is less than the purchase price and will bear the costs of sale. Any proceeds of
the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the
Company.

  Based on a market value at December 31, 1998 of $13.75 per common  share,  the
aggregate value of interests in the Operating  Partnership  that may be tendered
under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately $332 million.  The purchase of
these  interests at December 31, 1998 would have resulted in the Company  owning
an additional 29% interest in the Operating Partnership.

New Accounting Pronouncements

  In June 1998, the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative  Instruments and Hedging  Activities." This Statement
requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and
liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of
the derivatives and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting. This Statement is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company's  consolidated  financial
statements.  This Statement is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after June
15, 1999.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT





Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.


  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Taubman Centers,  Inc. (the
"Company")  as of December  31, 1998 and 1997,  and the  related  statements  of
operations,  shareowners'  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period  ended  December  31, 1998.  Our audits also  included the  financial
statement  schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial  statements
and  financial  statement  schedules  are the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

  We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion,  such financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects,  the financial  position of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. as of December 31,
1998 and 1997,  and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1998 in  conformity  with
generally accepted accounting  principles.  Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement  schedules,  when  considered  in  relation  to  the  basic  financial
statements  taken as a whole,  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the
information set forth therein.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       Three Years Ended December 31, 1998


Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Basis of Presentation

  Taubman Centers, Inc. (the Company or TCO), a real estate investment trust, or
REIT,  is the  managing  general  partner of The Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited
Partnership (the Operating  Partnership or TRG). The Operating Partnership is an
operating  subsidiary  that  engages  in  the  ownership,  management,  leasing,
acquisition,  development, and expansion of regional retail shopping centers and
interests  therein.  The  Operating  Partnership's  portfolio as of December 31,
1998,  includes 16 urban and  suburban  shopping  centers in seven  states.  One
additional  center  opened in March  1999.  Three  additional  centers are under
construction  in Florida and Texas.  The  Company's  investment in the Operating
Partnership  consists of a general  partnership  interest and a preferred equity
interest (Note 3).

  On  September  30,  1998,  the  Company  obtained a majority  and  controlling
interest in the Operating  Partnership as a result of a transaction in which the
Operating Partnership exchanged interests in 10 shopping centers,  together with
$990 million of its debt, for all of the partnership  units owned by the General
Motors Pension Trusts (GMPT),  representing  approximately  37% of the Operating
Partnership's  equity  (the  GMPT  Exchange)  (Note  2). As a result of the GMPT
Exchange,   the  Company's  general   partnership   interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership increased to 62.8%.

  The consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 1998 includes
all accounts of the Company,  the  Operating  Partnership  and its  consolidated
subsidiaries;  all intercompany  balances have been  eliminated.  Investments in
entities not  unilaterally  controlled  by ownership or  contractual  obligation
(Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.  The
statements  of  operations  and cash flows for the year ended  December 31, 1998
include the Operating  Partnership as a  consolidated  subsidiary for the entire
year. The balance sheet as of December 31, 1997 and the statements of operations
and cash flows for periods  prior to 1998  reflect the  financial  position  and
results of operations of the Operating Partnership under the equity method.

  Since the Company's  interest in the Operating  Partnership  has been its sole
material  asset  throughout all periods  presented,  references in the following
notes  to  "the  Company"  include  the  Operating  Partnership,   except  where
intercompany  transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted,  even though the
Operating  Partnership did not become a consolidated  subsidiary until September
30, 1998.

  Because the net equity of the  Operating  Partnership  is less than zero,  the
ownership interest of the Operating  Partnership's  noncontrolling partners (the
Minority  Interest) is presented as a zero balance in the  consolidated  balance
sheet as of December 31, 1998, and  subsequent to the GMPT Exchange,  the income
allocated to the Minority Interest is equal to the Minority  Interest's share of
distributions.  The Operating  Partnership's net equity is less than zero due to
accumulated  distributions  in  excess  of net  income  and not as a  result  of
operating losses.  Distributions to partners are usually greater than net income
because net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization. 

  Dollar  amounts  presented  in  tables  within  the  notes  to  the  financial
statements are stated in thousands of dollars, except share data or as otherwise
noted.

Income Taxes

  Federal income taxes are not provided  because the Company  operates in such a
manner as to qualify  as a REIT under the  provisions  of the  Internal  Revenue
Code; therefore,  applicable taxable income is included in the taxable income of
its  shareowners,  to the extent  distributed  by the  Company.  As a REIT,  the
Company  must  distribute  at  least  95%  of its  REIT  taxable  income  to its
shareowners and meet certain other requirements.  Additionally, no provision for
income taxes for consolidated  partnerships has been made, as such taxes are the
responsibility of the individual partners.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  Dividends  per common  share  declared in 1998 were  $0.945,  of which  $0.854
represented return of capital and $0.091 represented ordinary income.  Dividends
per common  share  declared in 1997 were  $0.925,  of which  $0.324  represented
return of capital and $0.601 represented  ordinary income.  Dividends per common
share declared in 1996 were $0.89, of which $0.41 represented  return of capital
and $0.48  represented  ordinary income.  The tax status of the Company's common
dividends  in  1998,  1997 and 1996 may not be  indicative  of  future  periods.
Dividends  per  preferred  share  declared  in 1998 and  1997  were  $2.075  and
$0.50722, respectively, all of which represented ordinary income. The difference
between net income for financial  reporting  purposes and taxable income results
primarily from differences in depreciation expense.

Revenue Recognition

  Shopping center space is generally leased to specialty retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are generally recognized on an accrual basis as earned, the result
of which does not differ materially from a straight-line method. Percentage rent
is accrued when lessees' specified sales targets have been met or achievement of
the  sales  targets  is  probable.  The  effect on 1998  income  of  recognizing
percentage  rent only after  specified  sales targets have been achieved  rather
than the Company's  method of  recognition is  immaterial.  Expense  recoveries,
which  include an  administrative  fee, are  recognized as revenue in the period
applicable costs are chargeable to tenants.

Depreciation and Amortization

  Buildings,  improvements  and equipment are  depreciated on  straight-line  or
double-declining  balance bases over the  estimated  useful lives of the assets,
which range from 3 to 50 years. Tenant allowances and deferred leasing costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases.

Capitalization

  Costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement of
properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction is
substantially  complete.  Properties  are reviewed for  impairment  if events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amounts of the properties
may not be recoverable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash  equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Deferred Charges

  Direct  financing  and interest  rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

  Stock-based  compensation  plans  are  accounted  for under  APB  Opinion  25,
"Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees"  and related  interpretations,  as
permitted under FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

  Premiums paid for interest  rate caps are  amortized to interest  expense over
the terms of the cap agreements.  Amounts  received under the cap agreements are
accounted  for on an accrual  basis,  and  recognized as a reduction of interest
expense.  Amounts paid or received under treasury lock  agreements are amortized
to interest expense over the term of the related debt agreement.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
financial instruments:

    The carrying value  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,   accounts  and  notes
       receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short
       maturity of these instruments.

    The fair  value of debt is  estimated  based  on  quoted  market  prices  if
       available,  or on the current rates  available to the Company for debt of
       similar terms and maturity and the  assumption  that debt will be prepaid
       at the earliest possible date.

    The fair value of interest rate hedging  instruments  is the amount that the
       Company  would receive or pay to terminate the agreement at the reporting
       date, taking into account current interest rates.

Operating Segment

  The  Company has one  reportable  operating  segment;  it owns,  develops  and
manages  regional  shopping  centers.  The shopping centers are located in major
metropolitan  areas,  have similar tenants (most of which are national  chains),
and share common economic  characteristics.  No single retail company represents
10% or more of the Company's revenues.

Note 2 - The GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions

  On September  30, 1998,  the Company  obtained a  controlling  interest in the
Operating   Partnership  due  to  the  following   transaction.   The  Operating
Partnership  transferred  interests  in 10 shopping  centers  (nine wholly owned
(Briarwood,  Columbus  City  Center,  The  Falls,  Hilltop,  Lakeforest,  Marley
Station,  Meadowood Mall,  Stoneridge,  and The Mall at Tuttle Crossing) and one
Unconsolidated Joint Venture  (Woodfield)),  together with $990 million of debt,
for all of the partnership units of GMPT  (approximately 50 million units with a
fair value of $675  million,  based on the average  stock price of the Company's
common  shares of $13.50 for the two week period prior to the closing) (the GMPT
Exchange). The Operating Partnership continues to manage the transferred centers
under agreements with GMPT (Note 10).

  As of the date of the GMPT  Exchange,  the excess of the Company's cost of its
investment  in  the  Operating  Partnership  over  the  Company's  share  of the
Operating Partnership's  accumulated deficit was $390.4 million, of which $176.6
million and $213.8 million was allocated to the Company's bases in the Operating
Partnership's  properties  and  investment  in  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures,
respectively.

  In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating Partnership used the $1.2
billion  proceeds from two bridge loans bearing interest at one-month LIBOR plus
1.30% to extinguish  approximately $1.1 billion of debt, including substantially
all of the  Operating  Partnership's  public  unsecured  debt,  its  outstanding
commercial paper, and borrowings on its existing lines of credit.  The remaining
proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment  premiums and transaction  costs.
An extraordinary charge of approximately $49.8 million,  consisting primarily of
prepayment  premiums,  was incurred in connection with the extinguishment of the
debt.

                                     F-9

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  The balance on the first  bridge  loan of $902  million was assumed by GMPT in
connection with the GMPT Exchange. The second loan had a balance of $340 million
as of December 31, 1998,  and expires in June 1999.  The  Operating  Partnership
expects to  refinance  the  balance on the bridge  loan during the first half of
1999 (Note 15 - Subsequent Event).

  Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating Partnership committed to a
restructuring of its operations.  A restructuring  charge of approximately $10.7
million was incurred,  primarily  representing  the cost of certain  involuntary
terminations of personnel.  Pursuant to the restructuring plan, approximately 40
employees were terminated across various administrative functions.  During 1998,
termination benefits of $6.1 million were paid.  Substantially all benefits were
paid by the end of the first quarter of 1999.


Note 3 - Investment in the Operating Partnership

  The Company's ownership in the Operating  Partnership at December 31, 1998 and
1997 consisted of a 62.8% and 36.70% managing general partnership  interest,  as
well as a preferred equity interest.  Net income and distributions are allocable
first to the preferred equity interest, and the remaining amounts to the general
and limited Operating  Partnership  partners in accordance with their percentage
ownership.   The  Company's  average  ownership   percentage  in  the  Operating
Partnership  was 43.2% for 1998  (including  averages  of 38.96%  for the period
through the GMPT Exchange (Note 2), and 62.77% thereafter),  36.7% for 1997, and
34.5% for 1996.

  During the three years in the period ended  December 31, 1998,  the  Company's
ownership of the  Operating  Partnership  also  increased  due to the  following
transactions.

  In April 1998, the Company sold approximately two million shares of its common
stock at $13.1875 per share,  before deducting the  underwriting  commission and
expenses of the offering,  under the Company's shelf registration statement. The
Company  used the  proceeds  to acquire an  additional  equity  interest  in the
Operating Partnership. The Operating Partnership paid all costs of the offering.
In January  1998,  the  Operating  Partnership  redeemed  6.1  million  units of
partnership interest from a partner.

  In October  1997,  the Company  used the proceeds  from a $200 million  public
offering  of  eight  million  shares  of 8.3%  Series  A  Cumulative  Redeemable
Preferred  Stock  (Series A  Preferred  Stock) to  acquire a Series A  Preferred
Equity interest in the Operating Partnership that entitles the Company to income
and distributions  (in the form of guaranteed  payments) in amounts equal to the
dividends  payable on the  Company's  Series A Preferred  Stock.  The  Operating
Partnership  bore all expenses of the offering.  The Operating  Partnership used
the net proceeds to pay down short term debt.

  In December 1996, the Company  purchased  newly issued  Operating  Partnership
units with the $75 million proceeds from the Company's December 1996 offering of
5.97 million shares of common stock. The Operating Partnership bore all expenses
of the Company's  offering.  The Operating  Partnership used the net proceeds to
pay  down  short  term  floating  rate  debt and to  acquire  La  Cumbre  Plaza.
Additionally  in 1996,  the Operating  Partnership  issued units of  partnership
interest in connection with its acquisition of the 75% interest in Fairlane Town
Center held by a joint venture partner.

  Also in  1998,  1997 and  1996,  the  Operating  Partnership  issued  units of
partnership  interest in connection with the exercise of incentive options.  The
Company  exchanged  shares of common stock for these newly issued units pursuant
to the Company's Continuing Offer (Note 12).

  The Company's income from its investment in the Operating Partnership included
$4.1  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997 from its Series A Preferred
Equity interest in the Operating Partnership.  Additionally, the Company's share
of the Operating  Partnership's  income before  extraordinary items available to
partnership unitholders under the equity method for the years ended December 31,
1997 and 1996,  was $33.5 million and $29.0  million,  respectively,  reduced by
$8.2 million and $7.6 million,  respectively,  representing  adjustments arising
from the Company's additional basis in the Operating Partnership's net assets.

     The Company's  share of the Operating  Partnership's  extraordinary  charge
recorded under the equity method in 1996 was approximately  $0.4 million,  which
related to prepayment premiums incurred in connection with the extinguishment of
debt.

  The Operating Partnership's summarized balance sheet and results of operations
information are presented  below for periods in which the Company  accounted for
the Operating Partnership under the equity method.

Note 4 - Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

     Following   are  the   Company's   investments   in  various   real  estate
Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures which own regional retail shopping  centers.  The
Operating  Partnership  is  generally  the  managing  general  partner  of these
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  The Operating  Partnership's  interest in each
Unconsolidated Joint Venture is as follows:
                                                                   TRG's %

                                                                   as of

  Arizona Mills, L.L.C. has a construction  facility with a maximum availability
of $142  million,  under which $141 million was  outstanding  as of December 31,
1998.  The rate on the  facility is capped at 9.5% until  maturity,  plus credit
spread.  The payment of  principal  and  interest is  guaranteed  by each of the
owners of  Arizona  Mills to the extent of its  ownership,  with  reductions  in
amounts  guaranteed  being provided as certain center  performance and valuation
criteria are met. The  Operating  Partnership's  guaranty of principal was $13.1
million at December 31, 1998.

  The  Company's  carrying  value  of its  Investment  in  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures  exceeds its share of the deficiency in assets reported in the combined
balance  sheet of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  due to (i)  intercompany
profits on sales of services that are  capitalized by the  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures  and  (ii)  the  Company's  cost of its  investment  in  excess  of the
historical net book values of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  The Company
reduces  its  investment  in  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures to  eliminate  the
intercompany  profits and  amortizes  such  amounts over the useful lives of the
related assets.  The Company's  additional basis allocated to depreciable assets
is recognized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.

  Combined  balance  sheet and results of operations  information  are presented
below (in  thousands) for all  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures,  followed by the
Operating  Partnership's   beneficial  interest  in  the  combined  information.
Beneficial interest is calculated based on the Operating Partnership's ownership
interest in each of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. The accounts of Woodfield
Associates,  formerly a 50%  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture  transferred  to GMPT
(Note 2), are included in these results through  September 30, 1998, the date of
the GMPT Exchange.

rates between 5.4% and 6.5%.

  In October 1997,  the Operating  Partnership  closed on a three-year,  $150
million  construction  facility  for  MacArthur  Center,  which  is  owned  by a
consolidated 70% owned venture.  The loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus
1.2%.  Under the facility  agreement  the maturity  date may be extended for two
years (Note 15). The payment of  principal  and  interest is  guaranteed  by the
Operating  Partnership.  The loan  agreement  provides for the  reduction of the
amount guaranteed as certain center performance and valuation criteria are met.

  The following table presents scheduled principal payments on mortgage debt, as
of December 31, 1998.

Interest Expense

   Interest  paid  in  1998,  net  of  amounts  capitalized  of  $18.2  million,
approximated $76.1 million.

Extraordinary Items

   During 1998, the Company  recognized  extraordinary  charges of $50.8 million
relating  to  the  extinguishment  of  debt,   including  debt  extinguished  in
connection with the GMPT Exchange (Note 2). The charges  consisted  primarily of
prepayment premiums. During 1996, the Company recognized an extraordinary charge
of $0.4  million  relating to the  extinguishment  of debt at an  Unconsolidated
Joint Venture.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

   The Company  enters into interest  rate  agreements to reduce its exposure to
changes  in the  cost of its  floating  rate  debt.  The  derivative  agreements
generally match the notional  amounts,  reset dates and rate bases of the hedged
debt to assure the  effectiveness  of the derivatives in reducing  interest rate
risk. As of December 31, 1998, the following  interest rate cap agreements  were
outstanding:

                                 Frequency
          Notional     LIBOR     of Rate
           Amount     Cap Rate    Resets                      Term
           ------     --------    ------     -----------------------------------

          $200,000      7.0%      Monthly    December 1997 through December 1999
           200,000      6.0%      Monthly    December 1998 through May 1999


  In September  1998, the Company  entered into treasury lock  agreements with a
notional  amount of $200 million at  approximately  5%, plus credit  spread.  In
October 1998,  the Company  effectively  closed out its position in the treasury
locks at a cost of  approximately  $4 million,  which will be amortized over the
term of the anticipated loan (Note 15).

  The  Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of  nonperformance  by the
counterparties to its interest rate cap agreements, but has no off-balance sheet
risk of loss. The Company anticipates that its counterparties will fully perform
their obligations under the agreements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Related to Debt

  The estimated fair values of financial instruments at December 31, 1998 are as

Note 8 - Leases

Operating Leases

  Shopping  center  space is leased to tenants and certain  anchors  pursuant to
lease agreements.  Tenant leases typically provide for guaranteed  minimum rent,
percentage  rent and other  charges to cover  certain  operating  costs.  Future
minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 1998 for operating
centers,  assuming no new or renegotiated  leases or option extensions on anchor
agreements, is summarized as follows:

2001, 2002, 2003, and thereafter.

Memorial City Mall Lease

  In November 1996, the Operating Partnership entered into an agreement to lease
Memorial City Mall,  located in Houston,  Texas. The lease of this  unencumbered
property grants the Operating  Partnership the exclusive right to manage,  lease
and operate the property. The annual rent is initially $7 million. The Operating
Partnership  has the option to  terminate  the lease  after the third full lease
year by  paying  $2  million  to the  lessor.  Accordingly,  the  lease  will be
accounted  for as an operating  lease during the option  period.  The  Operating
Partnership   is  using  this  option  period  to  evaluate  the   redevelopment
opportunities of the center.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  If the  Operating  Partnership  does not exercise its option to terminate  the
lease at the end of the third full lease year,  the lease  continues for another
52 years and provides for  increases in rent every ten years based on 75% of the
increase in the Consumer  Price Index  between  1996 and the then current  year.
Under the terms of the lease,  the Operating  Partnership has agreed to invest a
minimum of $3 million during the three year option period.  If the redevelopment
proceeds,  the Operating  Partnership  is required to invest an  additional  $22
million in property  expenditures  not recoverable from tenants during the first
10 years of the lease term.


Note 9 - Transactions with Affiliates

  The revenue from management,  leasing and development  services  includes $3.2
million from  transactions  with  affiliates.  Accounts  receivable from related
parties    includes    amounts   related   to   reimbursement   of   third-party
(non-affiliated) costs.

     During 1997,  the Operating  Partnership  acquired an option from a related
party to purchase  certain real estate on which the  Operating  Partnership  may
develop a shopping  center.  The option  agreement  requires  option payments of
$150,000  during each of the first five years,  $400,000 in the sixth year,  and
$500,000 in the seventh year. If the Operating Partnership exercises the option,
the purchase  price for the property will be between $5 million and $10 million,
depending upon the year of purchase. While the optionor will have no interest in
the shopping  center  itself,  the optionor may,  under  certain  circumstances,
participate in the proceeds from the Operating  Partnership's  future sales,  if
any, of the peripheral land contiguous to the shopping center.

  Other related party transactions are described in Notes 8 and 10.


Note 10 - The Manager

  The  Taubman  Company  Limited   Partnership  (the  Manager),   which  is  99%
beneficially owned by the Operating  Partnership,  provides property management,
leasing,  development  and other  administrative  services to the  Company,  the
shopping  centers,  and Taubman  affiliates.  In addition,  the Manager provides
services to centers transferred to GMPT under management  agreements that expire
December 31, 1999. The management agreements are cancelable with 90 days notice.

  The Manager has a voluntary  retirement  savings plan  established in 1983 and
amended and restated effective January 1, 1994 (the Plan). The Plan is qualified
in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code (the Code).  The
Manager  contributes  an  amount  equal  to 2% of  the  qualified  wages  of all
qualified employees and matches employee  contributions in excess of 2% up to 7%
of  qualified   wages.   In  addition,   the  Manager  may  make   discretionary
contributions  within the limits prescribed by the Plan and imposed in the Code.
Costs relating to the Plan were $1.7 million in 1998.

  The Operating  Partnership  has an incentive  option plan for employees of the
Manager.  Currently,  options for 8.0 million Operating Partnership units may be
issued under the plan,  including  options  outstanding  for 6.8 million  units.
Incentive options generally become exercisable to the extent of one-third of the
units on each of the  third,  fourth,  and  fifth  anniversaries  of the date of
grant.  Options  expire  ten  years  from  the  date  of  grant.  The  Operating
Partnership's  units issued in  connection  with the  incentive  option plan are
exchangeable for shares of the Company's common stock under the Continuing Offer
(Note 12).

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  A summary of the status of the plan as of December 31, 1998 and changes during
1998 is presented below:

         Outstanding at
           end of year             6,805,018          11.22

                                   =========          

  Options  outstanding  at December  31, 1998 have a remaining  weighted-average
contractual  life of 4.4 years and range in exercise price from $9.39 to $13.89.
There were no grants in 1998.

  The Company applies APB Opinion 25 and related  Interpretations  in accounting
for the plan.  The exercise price of all options  outstanding  granted under the
plan  was  equal  to  market  value  on  the  date  of  grant.  Accordingly,  no
compensation expense has been recognized for the plan. Had compensation cost for
the plan been  determined  based on the fair  value of the  options at the grant
dates  consistent  with the method of FAS Statement 123, the pro forma effect on
the Company's earnings and earnings per share would not have been material.

  Effective  January 1, 1996, the Manager adopted The Taubman Company  Long-Term
Performance  Compensation  Plan.  Annually,  eligible  employees will be granted
contingent  notional  Operating  Partnership units, the ultimate number of which
will be based on the employee's  performance.  These awards,  which will vest on
the third  anniversary  of the date of  grant,  will  also  accrue  distribution
equivalents  in the form of  additional  notional  units each time the Operating
Partnership  makes a  distribution  to its partners.  Upon  vesting,  additional
notional  units may be granted based on the  performance of the employee and the
Manager  and/or  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  awards  will  be paid to the
employee in cash upon vesting, based on the value of the Operating Partnership's
units of partnership  interest,  unless the employee  elects to defer payment as
provided in the plan. The cost of this plan was  approximately  $6.6 million for
1998.

Note 11 - Preferred Stock

  The 8.3%  Series A Preferred  Stock has no stated  maturity,  sinking  fund or
mandatory  redemption and is not  convertible  into any other  securities of the
Company.  The Series A  Preferred  Stock has a  liquidation  preference  of $200
million ($25 per share).  Dividends are  cumulative and accrue at an annual rate
of 8.3% from the date of the original issuance, October 3, 1997, and are payable
in arrears on or before the last day of each calendar quarter.  The 1998 accrued
dividends were paid in 1998. The Series A Preferred Stock can be redeemed by the
Company  beginning in October 2002 at $25 per share plus any accrued  dividends.
The redemption  price can be paid solely out of the sale of capital stock of the
Company.

  In connection with the GMPT Exchange, the Company became obligated to issue to
the   Minority   Interest,   upon   subscription,   one   share   of   Series  B
Non-Participating  Convertible  Preferred  Stock (Series B Preferred  Stock) for
each of the  Operating  Partnership  units held by the Minority  Interest.  Each
share of Series B Preferred Stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters
submitted  to the  Company's  shareholders.  The  holders of Series B  Preferred
Stock,  voting as a class,  have the right to designate up to four  nominees for
election as  directors  of the  Company.  On all other  matters,  including  the
election of  directors,  the holders of Series B Preferred  Stock will vote with
the holders of common  stock.  The  holders of Series B Preferred  Stock are not
entitled to dividends or earnings.  Under  certain  circumstances,  the Series B
Preferred Stock is convertible  into common stock at a ratio of 14,000 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock for one share of common stock.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies

  At the time of the Company's  initial public offering (IPO) and acquisition of
its partnership interest in the Operating Partnership,  the Company entered into
an  agreement  with A. Alfred  Taubman,  who owns an  interest in the  Operating
Partnership,  whereby he has the annual right to tender to the Company Operating
Partnership  units  (provided that the aggregate  value is at least $50 million)
and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered  interests  at a purchase  price
based on a market  valuation  of the  Company on the  trading  date  immediately
preceding the date of the tender (the Cash Tender  Agreement).  The Company will
have the option to pay for these interests from available  cash,  borrowed funds
or from the proceeds of an offering of the Company's  common  stock.  Generally,
the Company expects to finance these purchases through the sale of new shares of
its stock.  The tendering  partner will bear all market risk if the market price
at closing is less than the purchase  price and will bear the costs of sale. Any
proceeds of the  offering in excess of the  purchase  price will be for the sole
benefit of the Company. At A. Alfred Taubman's  election,  his family and Robert
C. Larson and his family may participate in tenders.

  Based on a market value at December 31, 1998 of $13.75 per common  share,  the
aggregate value of partnership  interests in the Operating Partnership which may
be tendered under the Cash Tender  Agreement was  approximately  $332 million at
December  31, 1998.  The purchase of these  interests at December 31, 1998 would
have resulted in the Company  owning an additional 29% interest in the Operating
Partnership.

  The Company has made a continuing,  irrevocable  offer to all present  holders
(other than certain excluded holders, including A. Alfred Taubman), assignees of
all present  holders,  those  future  holders of  partnership  interests  in the
Operating  Partnership  as the  Company  may, in its sole  discretion,  agree to
include in the continuing offer, and all existing and future optionees under the
Operating  Partnership's  incentive  option plan (Note 10) to exchange shares of
common  stock  for  partnership  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  (the
Continuing  Offer).  Under  the  Continuing  Offer  agreement,  one  unit of the
Operating  Partnership  interest is exchangeable  for one share of the Company's
common stock.

  Shares of common stock that were acquired by GMPT and the AT&T Master  Pension
Trust in  connection  with the IPO may be sold  through a  registered  offering.
Pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the Company, the owners of each
of these  shares  have the annual  right to cause the  Company to  register  and
publicly  sell their  shares of common stock  (provided  that the shares have an
aggregate   value  of  at  least  $50  million  and  subject  to  certain  other
restrictions).  All  expenses  of such a  registration  are to be  borne  by the
Company,  other than the underwriting  discounts or selling  commissions,  which
will be borne by the exercising party.

  The  Company  is  currently  involved  in  certain  litigation  arising in the
ordinary course of business.  Management  believes that this litigation will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.

Note 13 - Earnings Per Share

  Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing earnings  available
to common  shareowners by the average number of common shares outstanding during
each period.  For diluted  earnings per common share,  the  Company's  ownership
interest in the  Operating  Partnership  (and  therefore  earnings) are adjusted
assuming the exercise of all options for units of partnership interest under the
Operating  Partnership's  incentive option plan having exercise prices less than
the average market value of the units using the treasury  stock method.  For the
years ended  December 31,  1998,  1997 and 1996,  options for 0.3  million,  0.4
million and 1.0 million  units of  partnership  interest  with average  exercise
prices of $13.81,  $13.58  and  $12.64,  respectively,  were  excluded  from the
computation of diluted  earnings per share because the options'  exercise prices
were greater than the average market price for the period calculated.

Note 15 - Subsequent Events

  In February 1999, an application was completed for a secured, ten-year
financing of $270 million with an all- in rate of approximately 6.9% on The Mall
at Short  Hills.  The  financing  is  expected  to close by the end of the first
quarter of 1999; the Company  intends to use the proceeds to pay down its bridge
loan, which matures on June 21, 1999.

  The Company is in the process of finalizing a three-year $170 million facility
secured by Great Lakes Crossing.  The loan agreement will provide for an option 
to extend the maturity  date one year. The loan will bear interest at one month
LIBOR plus  1.50%.  Proceeds from the loan will be used to repay the balance of
the existing construction facility. Payment of principal and interest will be
guaranteed by the Operating Partnership. The loan agreement will provide for a 
reduction of the interest rate and the amount guaranteed as certain center 
performance and valuation criteria are met.

  In  addition,  the  Company  is  finalizing  an  amendment  to  the  MacArthur
construction  facility.  The total  availability under the facility will be $120
million with interest at one month LIBOR plus 1.35%.

                         INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT




Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.

  We have audited the  accompanying  combined  balance sheets of  Unconsolidated
Joint   Ventures  of  The  Taubman   Realty  Group  Limited   Partnership   (the
"Partnership")  (a  consolidated  subsidiary  of  Taubman  Centers,  Inc.) as of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the related  combined  statements of operations,
accumulated  deficiency in assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period  ended  December  31, 1998.  Our audits also  included the  financial
statement  schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial  statements
and financial  statement  schedules are the  responsibility of the Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on the  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

  We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion,  such combined  financial  statements  present fairly,  in all
material  respects,  the combined  financial  position of  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures of The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership as of December 31, 1998
and 1997, and the combined  results of their  operations and their combined cash
flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1998 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion,
such financial  statement  schedules,  when  considered in relation to the basic
combined financial  statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

Partnership,  which is approximately  99% beneficially  owned by TRG) to provide
property management and leasing services for the shopping centers and to provide

  Arizona Mills, L.L.C.  developed Arizona Mills, a value super-regional mall in
Tempe,  Arizona,  which opened in November  1997.  TRG's  ownership  interest in
Arizona Mills,  L.L.C.  increased in January 1997 to 37% from 35% as a result of
Arizona  Mills,  L.L.C.'s  redemption  of a former  owner's 5% interest for $2.8
million.  The former owner is an affiliate of a partner in TRG. In 1996, Arizona
Mills,  L.L.C.  purchased for $24.8 million  approximately  116 acres of land on
which the Center was constructed  from an affiliate of a partner in TRG and of a
former owner in Arizona Mills. Also in 1996, TRG and the other owners of Arizona
Mills  contributed  non-cash  pre-construction  costs  related  to  this  center
totaling $12.8 million.

             NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)


     On September  30, 1998,  TRG  completed a  transaction  which  included the
transfer  of  interests   in  nine   consolidated   shopping   centers  and  one
Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  (the GMPT  Exchange).  The accounts of Woodfield
Associates  (Woodfield),  a 50%  owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that was
transferred,  are  included  in  these  combined  financial  statements  through
September  30,  1998.  On the date of the GMPT  Exchange,  the  book  values  of
Woodfield's assets and liabilities were approximately  $107.4 million and $196.9
million, respectively.

  In July 1996, TRG completed transactions that resulted in it acquiring the 75%
interest in Fairlane Town Center  (Fairlane)  previously held by a Joint Venture
Partner.   TRG  also  assumed  mortgage  debt  of  approximately   $26  million,
representing the former Joint Venture Partner's beneficial interest in the $34.6
million mortgage encumbering the property. The accounts of Fairlane are included
in these  combined  financial  statements  until the  acquisition  date.  On the
acquisition  date,  the book values of Fairlane's  assets and  liabilities  were
approximately $25 million and $39 million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

  Shopping  center space is generally  leased to specialty  retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are generally recognized on an accrual basis as earned, the result
of which does not differ materially from a straight-line method. Percentage rent
is accrued when lessees' specified sales targets have been met or achievement of
the  sales  targets  is  probable.  The  effect on 1998  income  of  recognizing
percentage  rent only after  specified  sales targets have been achieved  rather
than  the  Joint  Ventures'   method  of  recognition  is  immaterial.   Expense
recoveries,  which include an  administrative  fee, are recognized as revenue in
the period applicable costs are chargeable to tenants.

Depreciation and Amortization

  Buildings,  improvements  and equipment,  stated at cost,  are  depreciated on
straight-line or double-declining  balance bases over the estimated useful lives
of the assets  which range from 3 to 55 years.  Tenant  allowances  and deferred
leasing  costs are  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the lives of the
related leases.

Capitalization

  Costs related to the acquisition,  development,  construction, and improvement
of properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction
is substantially  complete.  Properties are reviewed for impairment if events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amounts of the properties
may not be recoverable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash  equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Deferred Charges

  Direct  financing  and interest  rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

             NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)


Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

  Premiums paid for interest  rate caps are  amortized to interest  expense over
the terms of the cap agreements.  Amounts  received under the cap agreements are
accounted  for on an accrual  basis,  and  recognized as a reduction of interest
expense. The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements is accounted
for on an accrual basis and  recognized  as an  adjustment to interest  expense.
Amounts  paid or received  under  treasury  lock  agreements  are  amortized  to
interest expense over the term of the related debt agreement.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
financial instruments:

    The  carrying  value  of cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  and  notes
      receivable,  and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short
      maturity of these instruments.

    The fair value of mortgage notes and other notes payable is estimated  based
      on quoted market prices if available, or on the current rates available to
      the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures for debt of similar terms and maturity
      and the  assumption  that debt will be  prepaid at the  earliest  possible
      date.

    The fair  value of  interest  rate  hedging  instruments  is the  amount the
      Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  would  pay or  receive  to  terminate  the
      agreement at the  reporting  date,  taking into account  current  interest
      rates.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

     The  Arizona  Mills  loan  is  a  construction   facility  with  a  maximum
availability of $142 million.  The rate is capped at 9.5% until  maturity,  plus
credit  spread.  The payment of principal  and interest is guaranteed by each of
the owners of Arizona Mills to the extent of its ownership percentage.  The loan
agreement  provides for the reduction of the amount guaranteed as certain center
performance and valuation  criteria are met. TRG's guaranty of the principal was
$13.1 million at December 31, 1998.

  The other  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures with floating rate debt have entered
into interest rate  agreements to reduce their exposure to increases in interest
rates.  The rate on Cherry Creek's loan is capped to maturity at 7%, plus credit
spread,  based on one month LIBOR.  The loan can be extended up to an additional
two years.  The rate on the Twelve Oaks loan is capped at 8.55% until  maturity,
plus credit  spread,  based on one month LIBOR.  The Westfarms  balance of $55.0
million  represents  borrowings  under a  construction  facility  which is fully
drawn. The rate on the  construction  facility is capped until maturity at 6.5%,
plus credit spread.

  The Stamford note also requires payment of additional  interest ($1.5 million,
$1.3  million,  and $1.6  million in 1998,  1997,  and 1996) based on  operating
results.

Interest Expense

  Interest paid on mortgages and other notes payable in 1998, 1997 and 1996, net
of  amounts  capitalized  of $2.5  million,  $9.4  million,  and  $4.8  million,
approximated $64.0 million, $48.7 million, and $49.9 million.

Extraordinary Item

  In March 1998,  Fairfax Company of Virginia  L.L.C.  completed a $140 million,
6.60%,  secured  financing  maturing  in 2008.  The net  proceeds  were  used to
extinguish an existing  mortgage on Fair Oaks of  approximately  $39 million and
pay a prepayment penalty of approximately $1.8 million. In addition, proceeds of
$5.6 million were used to close out a treasury  lock  agreement  entered into in
1997, which resulted in an effective rate on the financing of approximately  7%.
The remaining proceeds were distributed to the owners.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

  Certain of the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures have entered into interest rate
cap  agreements to reduce their exposure to changes in the cost of floating rate
debt.  The terms of the  derivative  agreements  are  equivalent to the notional
amounts,  reset dates and rate bases of the underlying hedged debt to assure the
effectiveness  of  the  derivatives  in  reducing   interest  rate  risk.  These
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  are  exposed  to  credit  risk in the  event of
nonperformance  by  their   counterparties  to  the  agreements,   but  have  no
off-balance sheet risk of loss. These  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures anticipate
that their  counterparties will be able to fully perform their obligations under
the agreements.

Note 5 - Leases

  Shopping  center  space is leased to tenants and certain  anchors  pursuant to
lease agreements.  Tenant leases typically provide for guaranteed  minimum rent,
percentage  rent and other  charges to cover  certain  operating  costs.  Future
minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 1998 for operating
centers,  assuming no new or renegotiated  leases or option extensions on anchor
agreements, is summarized as follows:

                      1999            $ 150,314
                      2000              145,103

                      Thereafter        329,850

  Revenues  derived  from  the  combined  operations  of  The  Limited  provided
approximately  10.5%  of  total  revenues  in 1998.  Revenues  derived  from the
combined  operations of The Limited were less than 10% of total revenues in 1997
and 1996. Amounts due from The Limited at December 31, 1998 were $358 thousand.

  One  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture,  as lessee, has a ground lease expiring in
2083.  Rental payments under the lease were $2.0 million,  $1.8 million and $1.7
million in 1998,  1997 and 1996.  All of the ground  lease  rental  payments and
scheduled future payments  represent minimum rental expense payable to its Joint
Venture Partner.

  The following is a schedule of future minimum rental  payments  required under
the lease:

                      1999             $  1,984

Capital Lease Obligations

  Certain  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures have entered into lease agreements for
property  improvements  with three to five year terms.  As of December 31, 1998,
future minimum lease payments for these capital leases are as follows:
