<B>Item 1.  BUSINESS

The Company</B>

   Taubman Centers,  Inc. (the "Company" or "TCO") was incorporated in Michigan in 1973 and had its initial public offering
("IPO") in 1992.  Upon  completion of the IPO, the Company became the managing  general partner of The Taubman Realty Group
Limited  Partnership (the "Operating  Partnership" or "TRG").  The Company has a 62% partnership  interest in the Operating
Partnership,  through which the Company conducts all its operations.  The Company owns,  develops,  acquires,  and operates
regional shopping centers  ("Centers") and interests therein.  The Company's  portfolio,  as of December 31, 2001, included
20 urban and suburban  Centers  located in nine states.  Two  additional  centers are under  construction  and will open in
October 2002 and September 2003. The Operating  Partnership also owns certain  regional retail shopping center  development
projects and more than 99% of The Taubman  Company LLC (the  "Manager"),  which  manages the shopping  centers and provides
other  services  to the  Operating  Partnership  and the  Company.  See the  table on pages  11 and 12 of this  report  for
information regarding the Centers.

   The Company is a real estate  investment  trust,  or REIT,  under the  Internal  Revenue  Code of 1986,  as amended (the
"Code").  In order to  satisfy  the  provisions  of the Code  applicable  to REITs,  the  Company  must  distribute  to its
shareholders at least 90% of  its  REIT taxable income and meet  certain  other  requirements. The Operating  Partnership's
partnership agreement provides that the  Operating  Partnership  will distribute,  at a minimum, sufficient  amounts to its
partners  such that the  Company's pro rata share will enable the  Company to pay  shareholder dividends (including capital
gains  dividends  that  may  be  required  upon  the Operating  Partnership's sale  of an asset) that will satisfy the REIT
provisions of the Code.

<B>Recent Developments</B>

   For a discussion of business  developments that occurred in 2001, see Item 7,  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD&amp;A).

<B>The Shopping Center Business</B>

   There are several types of retail shopping centers,  varying primarily by size and marketing  strategy.  Retail shopping
centers range from  neighborhood  centers of less than 100,000 square feet of GLA to regional and  super-regional  shopping
centers.  Retail  shopping  centers  in excess of  400,000  square  feet of GLA are  generally  referred  to as  "regional"
shopping  centers,  while  those  centers  having in excess of 800,000  square  feet of GLA are  generally  referred  to as
"super-regional"  shopping centers.  Seventeen of the Centers are  "super-regional"  centers. In this annual report on Form
10-K, the term "regional  shopping centers" refers to both regional and  super-regional  shopping  centers.  The term "GLA"
refers to gross  retail  space,  including  anchors and mall tenant  areas,  and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail
space,  excluding  anchors.  The term "anchor"  refers to a department  store or other large retail  store.  The term "mall
tenants"  refers to stores  (other  than  anchors)  that are  typically  specialty  retailers  and lease  space in shopping
centers.


                                                       1


<B>Business of the Company</B>

   The  Company,  as managing  general  partner of the  Operating  Partnership,  is engaged in the  ownership,  management,
leasing, acquisition, development, and expansion of regional shopping centers.

   The Centers:

   o   are strategically  located in major  metropolitan  areas, many in  communities  that are among  the most affluent in
       the country,  including New York City, Los Angeles, Denver, Detroit,  Phoenix, Miami, Dallas, Tampa, and Washington,
       D.C.;

   o   range in  size  between  438,000 and 1.6 million square feet of GLA and  between  133,000 and 636,000 square feet of
       Mall GLA. The smallest Center has  approximately 50 stores,  and the largest has over 200 stores. Of the 20 Centers,
       17 are super-regional shopping centers;

   o   have approximately 2,800 stores operated by its mall tenants under approximately 1,200 trade names;

   o   have 60 anchors, operating under 17 trade names;

   o   lease approximately 78% of Mall GLA to national chains,  including  subsidiaries  or  divisions of  The Limited (The
       Limited,  Express,  Victoria's Secret, and others),  The Gap (The Gap, Gap Kids, Banana Republic,  and others),  and
       Foot Locker, Inc. (Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Champs Sports, and others); and

   o   are  among  the most  productive  (measured  by mall tenants'  average per square foot sales) in the United  States.
       In 2001,  mall tenants had average per square foot sales of $456,  which is  significantly  greater than the average
       for all regional shopping centers owned by public companies.

   The most  important  factor  affecting  the  revenues  generated  by the Centers is leasing to mall  tenants  (primarily
specialty  retailers),  which  represents  approximately  90% of  revenues.  Anchors  account for less than 10% of revenues
because  many own their  stores and, in general,  those that lease  their  stores do so at rates  substantially  lower than
those in effect for mall tenants.

   The Company's  portfolio is concentrated in highly productive  super-regional  shopping centers.  Of the 20 Centers,  17
had annual rent rolls at December 31, 2001 of over $10 million.  The Company  believes that this level of  productivity  is
indicative  of the Centers'  strong  competitive  position  and is, in  significant  part,  attributable  to the  Company's
business  strategy and philosophy.  The Company  believes that large shopping  centers  (including  regional and especially
super-regional  shopping  centers) are the least  susceptible to direct  competition  because (among other reasons) anchors
and large  specialty  retail  stores do not find it  economically  attractive  to open  additional  stores in the immediate
vicinity of an existing  location for fear of competing with themselves.  In addition to the advantage of size, the Company
believes  that the Centers'  success can be  attributed in part to their other  physical  characteristics,  such as design,
layout, and amenities.


                                                       2


<I>Business Strategy And Philosophy</I>

   The Company believes that the regional shopping center business is not simply a real estate  development  business,  but
rather an  operating  business  in which a  retailing  approach to the  on-going  management  and leasing of the Centers is
essential. Thus the Company:

   o   Offers a large,  diverse selection of retail stores in each  Center  to give customers a broad selection of consumer
       goods and variety of price ranges.

   o   Endeavors  to increase  overall mall  tenants'  sales by leasing  space to a  constantly  changing  mix  of tenants,
       thereby increasing achievable rents.

   o   Seeks to anticipate trends in the retailing industry  and  emphasizes  ongoing  introductions of new retail concepts
       into the Centers.  Due in part to this  strategy,  a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first
       mall stores in the Centers.  In addition,  the Company has brought to the Centers "new to the market" retailers. The
       Company believes that its execution of this leasing strategy is unique in the industry and  is  an important element
       in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity.

   o   Provides  innovative  initiatives that utilize technology and the  internet  to heighten the shopping experience for
       customers,  build  customer loyalty and increase  tenant sales. One such  initiative  is the  Company's  ShopTaubman
       one-to-one  marketing  program, which connects shoppers and retailers through online websites.  Approximately 99% of
       the managed centers' tenants  participate  in  the  center  websites  and  at  the  end  of  2001, these  sites  had
       approximately 350,000 registered users.

   The Centers compete for retail consumer  spending through  diverse,  in-depth  presentations  of  predominantly  fashion
merchandise in an  environment  intended to facilitate  customer  shopping.  While some Centers  include stores that target
high-end,  upscale  customers,  each Center is  individually  merchandised  in light of the  demographics  of its potential
customers within convenient driving distance.

   The  Company's  leasing  strategy  involves  assembling a diverse mix of mall tenants in each of the Centers in order to
attract  customers,  thereby  generating  higher  sales by mall  tenants.  High  sales  by mall  tenants  make the  Centers
attractive to prospective  tenants,  thereby  increasing the rental rates that prospective  tenants are willing to pay. The
Company  implements an active  leasing  strategy to increase the Centers'  productivity  and to set minimum rents at higher
levels.  Elements of this strategy include terminating leases of under-performing  tenants,  renegotiating existing leases,
and not leasing  space to  prospective  tenants  that (though  viable or  attractive  in certain  ways) would not enhance a
Center's retail mix.

<I>Potential For Growth</I>

   The Company's  principal  objective is to enhance shareholder value. The Company seeks to maximize the financial results
of its assets, while pursuing a growth strategy that concentrates primarily on an active new center development program.

<U>Development of New Centers</U>

   The Company is pursuing an active program of regional  shopping  center  development.  The Company  believes that it has
the expertise to develop  economically  attractive  regional  shopping centers through  intensive  analysis of local retail
opportunities.  The  Company  believes  that the  development  of new centers is the best use of its capital and an area in
which the Company excels.  At any time, the Company has numerous potential development projects in various stages.


                                                       3


   The following table includes the new centers that opened in 2001:

                                                                             Marshall's,  Oshman's  Supersports  USA,

  (Tampa, Florida)                                                           Taylor, Dillard's

The Mall at Wellington Green          October 5, 2001         1.3 million    Burdines,  Dillard's,  JCPenney,  Lord &amp;
  (Wellington, Florida)                                                      Taylor, Nordstrom (2003)

   Additionally,  two new centers  are  currently  under  construction;  The Mall at  Millenia,  a 1.2 million  square foot
regional  shopping  center in Orlando,  Florida is scheduled to open in October  2002,  and Stony Point Fashion Park, a 690
thousand square foot center in Richmond, Virginia,  is scheduled to open in September 2003.

   The  Company's  policies  with  respect to  development  activities  are  designed to reduce the risks  associated  with
development.  For  instance,  the  Company  previously  entered  into an  agreement  to lease a center  while  the  Company
investigated the  redevelopment  opportunities of the center.  Also, the Company  generally does not intend to acquire land
early in the development  process.  Instead,  the Company  generally  acquires options on land or forms  partnerships  with
landholders holding potentially  attractive  development sites. The Company typically exercises the options only once it is
prepared to begin construction.  The pre-construction  phase for a regional center typically extends over several years and
the time to obtain  anchor  commitments,  zoning and  regulatory  approvals,  and public  financing  arrangements  can vary
significantly  from project to project.  In addition,  the Company does not intend to begin construction until a sufficient
number of anchor  stores  have  agreed to operate in the  shopping  center,  such that the  Company is  confident  that the
projected  sales and rents from Mall GLA are  sufficient  to earn a return on invested  capital in excess of the  Company's
cost of capital.  Having historically  followed these principles,  the Company's experience indicates that less than 10% of
the costs of the development of a regional shopping center will be incurred prior to the construction  period.  However, no
assurance  can be given that the Company will  continue to be able to so limit  pre-construction  costs.  Unexpected  costs
due to extended  zoning and  regulatory  processes may cause the Company's  investment in a project to exceed this historic
experience.

   While the Company will continue to evaluate development projects using criteria,  including financial criteria for rates
of return,  similar to those  employed in the past,  no assurances  can be given that the adherence to these  policies will
produce  comparable  results in the future. In addition,  the costs of shopping center  development  opportunities that are
explored  but  ultimately  abandoned  will,  to some extent,  diminish  the overall  return on  development  projects  (see
"Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources
- -- Capital Spending" for further discussion of the Company's development activities).

<U>Strategic Acquisitions</U>

   The Company's  objective is to acquire  existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of the Company's
portfolio (or can be redeveloped to that level) and that satisfy the Company's strategic plans and pricing requirements.

   In early  2002,  the Company  entered  into an  agreement  to acquire a 50% general  partnership  interest in  Sunvalley
Shopping Center in Concord, California.  The Manager has managed this center since its development.



                                                       4


<U>Expansions of the Centers</U>

   Another  potential  element of growth is the  strategic  expansion of existing  properties  to update and enhance  their
market  positions,  by replacing or adding new anchor  stores or  increasing  mall tenant  space.  Most of the Centers have
been designed to accommodate  expansions.  Expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center  construction in
terms of scope and cost,  requiring  governmental and existing anchor store approvals,  design and engineering  activities,
including rerouting  utilities,  providing  additional parking areas or decking,  acquiring additional land, and relocating
anchors and mall tenants (all of which must take place with a minimum of disruption to existing tenants and customers).

   The following table includes information regarding recent development, acquisition, and expansion activities.

<u>Internal Growth</u>

   The Centers are among the most  productive in the nation when  measured by mall tenant's  average sales per square foot.
Higher  sales per square foot enable mall tenants to remain  profitable  while  paying  occupancy  costs that are a greater
percentage  of total  sales.  As leases  expire at the  Centers,  the Company has  consistently  been able,  on a portfolio
basis, to lease the available space to existing or new tenants at higher rates.

                                                       5


   Augmenting  this  growth,  the  Company is  pursuing  a number of new  sources of revenue from the Centers. For example,
the Company has entered into a 15-year lease agreement with  JCDecaux,  the world's  largest street furniture and outdoor
advertising company.  The agreement created an in-mall advertising  program in the Company's portfolio of owned properties,
creating new point-of-sale  opportunities for retailers and manufacturers as well as heightening the in-mall experience for
shoppers.  In addition,  the Company expects increased revenue from its specialty leasing  efforts.  In recent  years a new
industry -- beyond  traditional  carts  and  kiosks -- has  evolved,  with  more  and  better  quality  specialty  tenants.
The Company has in place a company-wide program to maximize this opportunity.

<I>Rental Rates</I>

   As leases have expired in the Centers,  the Company has generally been able to rent the available  space,  either to the
existing  tenant or a new  tenant,  at rental  rates  that are  higher  than those of the  expired  leases.  In a period of
increasing  sales,  rents  on new  leases  will  tend to  rise as  tenants'  expectations  of  future  growth  become  more
optimistic.  In periods of slower  growth or  declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will  decline
for the opposite  reason.  However,  Center  revenues  nevertheless  increase as older  leases roll over or are  terminated
early and replaced with new leases  negotiated at current  rental rates that are usually  higher than the average rates for
existing leases.

   The following table contains certain information  regarding per square foot minimum rent at Centers that have been owned
and open for at least two years.

(1)  A higher  percentage of space at value  centers is typically  rented to major  and  mall tenants  at  lower rents than
     the portfolio average.  Excluding value centers,  the annualized base rent under expiring leases is greater by a range
     of $2.78 to $12.89 or an average of $6.63 for the periods presented within this table.
(2)  Excludes  leases  that  expire  in  2002  for  which  renewal  leases or leases  with  replacement  tenants  have been
     executed as of December 31, 2001.



                                                       6


   The Company believes that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative  of  what  will occur in the future
because of several factors, but principally because its leasing policies and practices create a  significant level of early
lease terminations at the Centers.  For example, the average remaining term of the leases that were terminated  during  the
period 1996 to 2001 was approximately two years. The average term of leases signed during 2001 and  2000 was  approximately
eight years.

   In addition,  mall tenants at the Centers may seek the  protection  of the  bankruptcy  laws,  which could result in the
termination  of such tenants'  leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow. In 2001,  approximately  4.5% of leases were
so  affected  compared  to 2.3% in 2000.  This  statistic  has ranged  from 1.2% to 4.5% since the  Company  went public in
1992.  Since 1991, the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than 2% of annual revenues.

<I>Major Tenants</I>

   No single retail  company  represents  10% or more of the Company's  revenues.  The combined  operations of The Limited,
Inc.  accounted  for  approximately  5.7% of Mall GLA as of December  31,  2001 and of 2001  minimum  rent.  The largest of
these,  in terms of square footage and rent, is Express,  which  accounted for  approximately  1.7% of Mall GLA and 1.6% of
2001 minimum  rent.  No other single  retail  company  accounted  for more than 3% of Mall GLA or 4% of 2001 minimum  rent.
The following table shows the ten largest tenants and their square footage as of December 31, 2001.

<B>General Risks of the Company</B>

<I>Economic Performance and Value of Shopping Centers Dependent on Many Factors</I>

   The economic  performance and value of the Company's  shopping centers are dependent on various  factors.  Additionally,
these same factors will influence the Company's  decision  whether to go forward on the  development of new centers and may
affect the ultimate  economic  performance and value of projects under  construction  (see other risks  associated with the
development of new centers under "Business of the Company--Development of New Centers").  Such factors include:

   o   changes in the national, regional, and/or local economic climates,

   o   competition from other shopping  centers, discount  stores, outlet malls, discount shopping clubs,  direct mail, and
       the internet in attracting customers and tenants,

   o   increases in operating costs,

   o   the public perception of the safety of customers at the shopping centers,

   o   environmental or legal liabilities,

   o   availability and cost of financing, and

   o   uninsured losses, whether because of  unavailability  of  coverage or in excess of policy specifications and insured
       limits, including  those  resulting  from  wars, acts  of  terrorism, riots  or  civil  disturbances, or losses from
       earthquakes or floods.

In addition, the value of shopping centers may be adversely affected by:

   o   changes in government regulations, and

   o   changes in real estate zoning and tax laws.

Adverse changes in the economic performance and value of shopping centers would adversely affect the Company's income and
cash available to pay dividends.

<I>Third Party Interests in the Centers</I>

   Some of the shopping  centers  which the Company  develops and leases are  partially  owned by  non-affiliated  partners
through joint venture  arrangements.  As a result,  the Company may not be able to control all  decisions  regarding  those
shopping  centers and may be required to take actions that are in the  interest of the joint  venture  partners but not the
Company's best interests.

<I>Bankruptcy of Mall Tenants or Joint Venture Partners</I>

   The Company  could be adversely  affected by the  bankruptcy  of third  parties.  The  bankruptcy of a mall tenant could
result in the  termination  of its lease which would lower the amount of cash  generated by that mall.  In  addition,  if a
department  store operating an anchor at one of our shopping  centers were to go into bankruptcy and cease  operating,  its
closing may lead to reduced  customer  traffic and lower mall tenant sales which would, in turn,  affect the amount of rent
our tenants pay us. The  profitability  of shopping  centers held in a joint  venture  could also be adversely  affected by
the bankruptcy of one of the joint venture  partners if, because of certain  provisions of the bankruptcy laws, the Company
was unable to make important decisions in a timely fashion or became subject to additional liabilities.



                                                       8


<I>Investments in and Loans to Third Parties</I>

   The Company has occasionally made investments in technology  industry  companies to augment the services the Company can
provide to its tenants,  enhance the overall value of its shopping centers,  and earn financial  returns.  The Company also
occasionally  extends  credit to third parties in connection  with the sales of land or other transactions.  The Company is
exposed  to risk in the event the  values of its  investments  and/or its loans decrease due to overall market  conditions,
business  failure,  and/or other  nonperformance by the investees or counterparties.

<I>Third Party Contracts</I>

   The  Company  provides  property  management,  leasing,  development,  and  other  administrative  services  to  centers
transferred to GMPT,  other third parties and to certain Taubman  affiliates.  The contracts under which these services are
provided may be canceled or not renewed or may be  renegotiated  on terms less favorable to the Company.  Certain  overhead
costs allocated to these contracts would not be eliminated if the contracts were to be canceled or not renewed.

<I>Inability to Maintain Status as a REIT</I>

   o   The Company may not be able to maintain its status as a real estate  investment trust, or  REIT, for  Federal income
       tax purposes with the result that the income distributed to shareholders will not be deductible in computing taxable
       income and instead would be subject to tax at regular corporate rates. Although the Company believes it is organized
       and operates in a manner to maintain its REIT  qualification, many of the REIT requirements of the Internal  Revenue
       Code are very complex  and  have  limited  judicial  or  administrative  interpretations.  Changes  in  tax  laws or
       regulations  or  new  administrative  interpretations  and  court decisions may also affect the Company's ability to
       maintain REIT status in the future.  If the Company  fails to qualify as a REIT,  its income may also be subject  to
       the alternative minimum tax. If the Company does not maintain its REIT status in any year, it may be unable to elect
       to be treated as a REIT for the next four  taxable  years.  In  addition,  if the Company fails to meet the Internal
       Revenue Code's requirement that it distribute to shareholders at least 90% of otherwise  taxable income, the Company
       will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on a portion of its income.

   o   Although the Company currently intends to maintain  its status as a REIT, future  economic,  market,  legal, tax, or
       other considerations may cause it to determine that  it  would  be  in  the  Company's  and  its  shareholders' best
       interests to revoke its REIT election. As noted above, if the Company revokes its REIT election, it will not be able

   All of the Centers presently owned by the Company (not including option interests in the Development  Projects or any of
the real estate managed but not included in the Company's  portfolio) have been subject to environmental  assessments.  The
Company is not aware of any environmental  liability  relating to the Centers or any other property,  in which they have or
had an interest  (whether as an owner or operator) that the Company  believes,  would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's  business,  assets,  or results of  operations.  No  assurances  can be given,  however,  that all  environmental
liabilities  have been  identified  or that no prior owner,  operator,  or current  occupant  has created an  environmental
condition  not  known  to the  Company.  Moreover,  no  assurances  can be given  that  (i)  future  laws,  ordinances,  or
regulations will not impose any material  environmental  liability or that (ii) the current environmental  condition of the
Centers will not be affected by tenants and  occupants of the Centers,  by the  condition of  properties in the vicinity of
the Centers (such as the presence of underground storage tanks), or by third parties unrelated to the Company.

   There are asbestos  containing  materials  ("ACMs") at some of the older Centers,  primarily in the form of floor tiles,
roof coatings,  and mastics. The floor tiles, roof coatings,  and mastics are generally in good condition.  The Manager has
an operations and maintenance  program that details  operating  procedures with respect to ACMs prior to any renovation and
that requires periodic inspection for any change in condition of existing ACMs.

(1)  In 1998, the Company obtained a majority and controlling  interest in The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (TRG  or the
     Operating  Partnership). As a result, the Company began consolidating the Operating Partnership.  For 1997, amounts reflect the
     Company's interest in the Operating Partnership under the equity method.
(2)  In  August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire an additional  interest  in  one  of its Unconsolidated
     Joint  Ventures;  TRG became the 100%  owner of  Twelve  Oaks  Mall and  the  joint  venture  partner  became the 100% owner of
     Lakeside.  A gain on the transaction was recognized by the Company  representing the excess of the fair value over the net book
     basis of the Company's interest in Lakeside (see MD&amp;A - Other Transactions).
(3)  Extraordinary  items for 1998  through 2000  include  charges  related to the  extinguishment  of  debt,  primarily  consisting
     of prepayment premiums and the writeoff of deferred financing costs.
(4)  In January  2001,  the  Company  adopted  Statement  of  Financial   Accounting  Standard  No. 133  "Accounting  for Derivative
     Instruments and Hedging  Activities" and  its  amendments and   interpretations.  The Company recognized a loss as a transition
     adjustment to mark its share of interest rate agreements to fair value as of January 1, 2001.
(5)  Operating  statistics for 1997 include centers  transferred to General  Motors  pension trusts  in exchange for their interests
     in TRG.
(6)  Funds  from  Operations  is  defined  and  discussed  in MD&amp;A -  Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  - Funds  from  Operations.
     Funds from Operations does not represent cash flow from operations, as defined  by  generally  accepted accounting  principles,
     and  should  not  be  considered  to  be  an  alternative  to  net  income as a measure  of  operating  performance or  to cash
     flows as a measure of liquidity.

(8)  2000 statistics have been restated to include MacArthur Center, which opened in March 1999.
(9)  2001 average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy,  and  leased space for centers owned and open for all of 2001 and 2000 were 88.1%,
     88.8%, and 91.8%, respectively.
(10) Leased space comprises both occupied space and space that is leased but not yet occupied.

<B>Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</B>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
<U>FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</U>

   The following  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations  contains various
"forward-looking  statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,  and Section 21E
of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  These  forward-looking   statements  represent  the  Company's
expectations or beliefs concerning future events,  including the following:  statements  regarding future  developments and
joint  ventures,  rents and returns,  statements  regarding the  continuation of trends,  and any statements  regarding the
sufficiency of the Company's  cash balances and cash  generated  from operating and financing  activities for the Company's
future  liquidity and capital resource needs. The Company  cautions that although  forward-looking  statements  reflect the
Company's  good faith  beliefs and best  judgment  based upon  current  information,  these  statements  are  qualified  by
important  factors that could cause  actual  results to differ  materially  from those in the  forward-looking  statements,
including  those  risks,  uncertainties,  and  factors  detailed  from time to time in reports  filed with the SEC,  and in
particular those set forth under the headings "General Risks of the Company" and  "Environmental  Matters" in the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following  discussion  should be read in  conjunction  with the  accompanying  Consolidated
Financial Statements of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the Notes thereto.

<B>General Background and Performance Measurement</B>

   The Company owns a managing general  partner's  interest in The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership (the Operating
Partnership or TRG), through which the Company conducts all of its operations.  The Operating  Partnership owns,  develops,
acquires, and operates regional shopping centers nationally.  The Consolidated  Businesses consist of shopping centers that
are controlled by ownership or contractual  agreement,  development  projects for future regional shopping centers, and The
Taubman  Company LLC (the  Manager).  Shopping  centers that are not  controlled  and that are owned through joint ventures
with third parties (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.

   The operations of the shopping centers are best understood by measuring their performance as a whole,  without regard to
the  Company's  ownership  interest.  Consequently,  in addition to the  discussion of the  operations of the  Consolidated
Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are presented and discussed as a whole.

   During 2001, the Company opened four new shopping centers (Results of Operations-New  Center Openings).  Also, in August
2000, the Company completed a transaction to acquire an additional  interest in one of its  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures;
the Operating  Partnership  became the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks Mall and the joint venture  partner  became the 100% owner
of  Lakeside.  Additional  2001 and 2000  statistics  that exclude the new centers and Lakeside are provided to present the
performance of comparable centers.

<B>Current Operating Trends</B>

   In 2001, the regional shopping center  industry  has  been  affected  by the softening  of  the national economic cycle.
Economic pressures that affect consumer confidence, job growth, energy costs, and income  gains  can  affect  retail  sales
growth and impact the Company's ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates.  A number of regional
and national retailers  have  announced  store closings or filed for bankruptcy. During 2001, 4.5% of the Company's tenants
sought the protection of the bankruptcy laws, compared to 2.3% in 2000. The impact of a softening economy  on the Company's
current results of operations is  moderated by lease cancellation  income, which  tends to  increase  in down-cycles of the
economy.

   In addition to overall economic  pressures,  the events of September 11 had a negative impact on tenant sales subsequent
to  September.  Tenant sales per square foot in the fourth  quarter of 2001  decreased by 3.8%  compared to the same period
in 2000.  Although this was an improvement  from the 9.8% decrease in sales per square foot in the month of September,  the
fourth  quarter  decrease was  significantly  greater than the 0.3%  decrease in sales per square foot that the Company had
experienced  through August 2001. In addition,  fourth quarter  comparable center average  occupancy  declined by 1.7% from
the prior year.


                                                              17


   The tragic  events of September 11 will also have an impact on the  Company's  future  insurance  coverage.  The Company
presently  has  coverage  for  terrorist  acts in its  policies  that expire in April 2002.  The Company  expects that such
coverage will be excluded from its standard property policies at the Company's  renewal.  Based on preliminary  discussions
with its  insurance  agency,  such  coverage  will be  available  as a separate  policy with lower  limits than the present
coverage, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources-Covenants and Commitments".

   Given the state of the insurance  industry  prior to September 11, and the impact of September 11, the Company  believes
its premiums,  including the cost of a separate  terrorist  policy,  could increase by over 100% for property  coverage and
over 25% for liability  coverage.  These increases would impact the Company's annual common area maintenance  rates paid by
the  Company's  tenants by about 55 cents per square foot.  Total  occupancy  costs paid by tenants  signing  leases in the
Company's traditional centers are on average about $70 per square foot.

<B>Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues</B>

   Over the long term, the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important  determinant of revenues of the shopping
centers  because mall tenants  provide  approximately  90% of these  revenues and because mall tenant sales  determine  the
amount of rent,  percentage rent, and recoverable  expenses (together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford
to pay.  However,  levels of mall tenant  sales can be  considerably  more  volatile in the short run than total  occupancy
costs.

   The Company  believes  that the ability of tenants to pay  occupancy  costs and earn  profits  over long periods of time
increases as sales per square foot increase,  whether through inflation or real growth in customer  spending.  Because most
mall tenants have certain fixed  expenses,  the occupancy  costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable  are a
higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot.

   The following table summarizes  occupancy costs,  excluding  utilities,  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant
sales.

                                                                 2001             2000              1999

(1)  2000 sales per square foot has been restated to include MacArthur Center, which opened in March 1999.

   For the year ended December 31, 2001, for the first time in the Company's history as a public company,  sales per square
foot  decreased in  comparison  to the prior year,  reflecting  the current  difficult  retail  environment  as well as the
direct  impact of the events of September 11. The negative  sales trend  directly  impacts the amount of  percentage  rents
certain  tenants and anchors  pay. The effects of declines in sales  experienced  during 2001 on the  Company's  operations
are moderated by the relatively  minor share of total rents  (approximately  three  percent)  percentage  rents  represent.
However,  if lower levels of sales were to continue,  the  Company's  ability to lease  vacancies  and  negotiate  rents at
advantageous rates could be adversely affected.

<B>Rental Rates</B>

   As leases have expired in the shopping centers,  the Company has generally been able to rent the available space, either
to the existing tenant or a new tenant,  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired  leases.  In a period of
increasing  sales,  rents  on new  leases  will  tend to  rise as  tenants'  expectations  of  future  growth  become  more
optimistic.  In periods of slower growth or declining sales,  such as the Company is currently  experiencing,  rents on new
leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason.  However,  center revenues  nevertheless  increase as
older leases roll over or are  terminated  early and replaced with new leases  negotiated at current  rental rates that are
usually higher than the average rates for existing  leases.  The following  table contains  certain  information  regarding
per square foot minimum rent at the shopping centers that have been owned and open for at least two years.

(1)  2000 rent per square foot information has been  restated  to  include  MacArthur  Center, which  opened in March 1999.

   Generally,  the rent spread  between  opening and closing  stores is in the Company's  historic range of $5.00 to $10.00
per square foot.  This statistic is difficult to predict in part because the Company's  leasing  policies and practices may
result in early lease  terminations  with actual average closing rents per square foot which may vary from the average rent
per square foot of scheduled lease expirations.

<B>Occupancy</B>

   Historically,  annual average  occupancy has been within a narrow band. In the last ten years,  annual average occupancy
has ranged  between  84.9% and 89.4%.  Mall tenant  average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy,  and leased  space rates are as
follows:

                                                                 2001             2000              1999

   The lower occupancy and leased space in 2001 reflect the opening of the four new centers at occupancy  levels lower than
the average of the existing  portfolio.  A number of unanticipated  early lease terminations  accounted for the majority of
the decline in comparable center occupancy.

<B>Seasonality</B>

   The regional  shopping center  industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due
to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations  associated with the Easter holiday
and back-to-school  events.  While minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors,  most leases
are  scheduled  to expire in the first  quarter,  and the  majority  of new stores  open in the second  half of the year in
anticipation of the Christmas  selling  season.  Additionally,  most  percentage  rents are recorded in the fourth quarter.
Accordingly, revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.

    Because the  seasonality  of sales  contrasts  with the generally  fixed nature of minimum rents and  recoveries,  mall
tenant  occupancy  costs (the sum of minimum  rents,  percentage  rents,  and  expense  recoveries)  relative  to sales are
considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter.

<B>Results of Operations</B>

<I>New Center Openings</I>

   In March 2001, Dolphin Mall, a 1.3 million square foot value regional center, opened in Miami, Florida.  Dolphin Mall is
a 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture and is accounted for under the equity method. The Operating  Partnership will be
entitled to a preferred  return on approximately  $30 million of equity  contributions as of December 2001, which were used
to fund construction costs.

   The Shops at Willow  Bend,  a wholly owned  regional  center,  opened  August 3, 2001 in Plano,  Texas.  The 1.5 million
square foot center is anchored by Neiman Marcus,  Saks Fifth Avenue,  Lord &amp; Taylor,  Foley's,  and  Dillard's.  Saks Fifth
Avenue will open in 2004.

   International  Plaza,  a 1.25  million  square foot  regional  center,  opened  September  14,  2001 in Tampa,  Florida.
International  Plaza  is  anchored  by  Nordstrom,  Lord &amp;  Taylor,  Dillard's,  and  Neiman  Marcus.  The  Company  has an
approximately  26%  ownership  interest in the center.  However,  because the  Company  provided  approximately  53% of the
equity  funding for the project,  the Company  will  receive a  preferential  return.  The Company  expects to be initially
allocated  approximately  33% of the net operating  income of the project,  with an additional  7%  representing  return of
capital.  The  Operating  Partnership  will be  entitled  to a  preferred  return on  approximately  $19  million of equity
contributions as of December 2001, which were used to fund construction costs.

   The Mall at Wellington Green, a 1.3 million square foot regional center,  opened October 5, 2001 in Wellington,  Florida
and is initially anchored by Lord &amp; Taylor,  Burdines,  Dillard's,  and JCPenney. A fifth anchor,  Nordstrom,  is obligated
under the  reciprocal  easement  agreement to open within 24 months of the opening of the center and is presently  expected
to open in  2003.  The  center  is owned by a joint  venture  in which  the  Operating  Partnership  has a 90%  controlling
interest.

   Although  Dolphin Mall opened on schedule,  the center  encountered  significant  levels of tenant and  landlord-related
issues arising from the construction  process,  far exceeding those historically  experienced by the Company. The difficult
opening resulted in lower than expected  occupancy in 2001. In addition,  lower than anticipated  sales, in part due to the
effect of September 11 on major tourist  areas,  have caused  significant  tenant issues  resulting in early  terminations,
lower recoveries, and higher levels of uncollectible receivables.

   In addition,  general  economic  conditions have also affected the performance of Willow Bend and to a lesser extent the
other two new  centers.  Leased  space as of  December  31,  2001 at the four new  centers  was 75 to 80%,  lower  than the
Company would have previously  expected.  As a result,  the Company  presently  expects that the return on the four centers
will be  under 9% in  2002.  Over  100  additional  stores  remain  to be  leased  at  these  centers  in order to  achieve
stabilization.  Estimates  regarding returns on projects are  forward-looking  statements and certain  significant  factors
could cause the actual results to differ  materially,  including but not limited to: 1) actual results of negotiations with
tenants,  2) timing of tenant openings, and 3) early lease terminations and bankruptcies.

                                                           20


<I>Other Transactions</I>

   In October 2001, the Operating Partnership committed to a restructuring of its development  operations.  A restructuring
charge of $2.0 million was recorded  primarily  representing  the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations  of personnel.
Pursuant to the restructuring plan, 17 positions were eliminated within the development department.

   In April 2001,  the Operating  Partnership's  $10 million  investment  in Swerdlow was converted  into a loan which bore
interest at 12% and matured in December  2001.  This loan is  currently  delinquent  and is accruing  interest at 18%.  All
interest due through the December maturity date was received.  Although the Operating  Partnership expects to fully recover
the  amount due under this note  receivable,  the  Company  is  currently  in  negotiations  with  Swerdlow  regarding  the
repayment. An affiliate of Swerdlow is a partner in the Dolphin Mall joint venture.

   In August 2000,  the Company  completed a transaction  to acquire an additional  ownership in one of its  Unconsolidated
Joint  Ventures.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  the Operating  Partnership  became the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks Mall
and the joint venture  partner became the 100% owner of Lakeside,  subject to the existing  mortgage debt. The  transaction
resulted in a net payment to the joint venture partner of  approximately  $25.5 million in cash. The results of Twelve Oaks
have been  consolidated in the Company's  results  subsequent to the acquisition date (prior to that date,  Twelve Oaks was
accounted for under the equity method as an Unconsolidated  Joint Venture).  A gain of $85.3 million on the transaction was
recognized by the Company  representing  its share of the excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the Company's
interest in Lakeside, adjusted for the $25.5 million paid and transaction costs.

   During 2000,  the Operating  Partnership  recognized  its $9.5 million share of  extraordinary  charges  relating to the
Arizona  Mills and  Stamford  Town Center  refinancings,  which  consisted  of a  prepayment  premium and the  write-off of
deferred financing costs.

   In 1996,  the Operating  Partnership  entered into an agreement to lease  Memorial City Mall, a 1.4 million  square foot
shopping  center  located in  Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that  enabled  the  Operating
Partnership  to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities  and  terminate  the lease  obligation in the event such
redevelopment  opportunities  were not deemed to be  sufficient.  The Operating  Partnership  terminated  its Memorial City
lease on April 30, 2000.

   During October and November  2001, the Operating  Partnership  completed an $82.5 million  financing  secured by Regency
Square and closed on a new $275 million  line of credit.  The net  proceeds of these  financings  were used to pay off $150
million  outstanding  under  loans  previously  secured by Twelve Oaks Mall and the balance  under the  expiring  revolving
credit facility.  In May 2001, the Company closed on a $168 million construction loan for The Mall at Wellington Green.

   During  October 2000,  Arizona Mills  completed a $146 million  secured  refinancing of its existing  mortgage.  Also in
October  2000,  MacArthur  Center  completed  a  $145  million  secured  financing,  repaying  the  existing  $120  million
construction  loan.  The  remaining  net  proceeds  of  approximately  $23.9  million  were  distributed  to the  Operating
Partnership,  which  contributed  all of the equity funding for the  development of the center.  In January 2000,  Stamford
Town Center completed a $76 million secured  refinancing.  During 2000,  construction  facilities for $160 million and $220
million were obtained for The Mall at Millenia and The Shops at Willow Bend, respectively.

<I>Investments in Technology Businesses</I>

   During 2001, the Company committed to invest  approximately $2 million in Constellation Real Technologies LLC, a company
that forms and sponsors  real estate  related  internet,  e-commerce,  and  telecommunications  enterprises.  The Company's
investment was $0.5 million at December 31, 2001.

   In May 2000, the Company  acquired an approximately  6.8% interest in  MerchantWired,  LLC, a service company  providing
internet  and network  infrastructure  to shopping  centers and  retailers.  As of December  31,  2001,  the Company had an
investment of  approximately  $3.6 million in this venture and has guaranteed  obligations of  approximately  $3.8 million.
The principal  shareholder of  MerchantWired  has disclosed that the future  profitability of MerchantWired is dependent on
it  obtaining  outside  capital  and other  management  expertise;  there is no  assurance  as to its  success in doing so.
During  2001  and  2000,  the  Company  recognized  its  $2.4  million  (including  $0.6  million  of  real  estate-related
depreciation) and $0.5 million share of MerchantWired losses, respectively.



                                                           21


    In April 1999,  the Company  obtained a $7.4 million  preferred  investment  in  fashionmall.com,  Inc.,  an e-commerce
company originally organized to market, promote,  advertise,  and sell fashion apparel and related accessories and products
over the  internet.  In  2001,  fashionmall.com  significantly  scaled  back its  operations  and  experienced  significant
decreases  in operating  revenues.  Fashionmall.com  management  has  disclosed  that they have more cash than is needed to
fund current  operations and are  considering how best to use such cash,  including  making  acquisitions,  issuing special
dividends,  or finding  other  options to provide  opportunities  for  liquidity  to its  shareholders  at some time in the
future.  While the Company's  right to a preference in the event of a liquidation is not disputed,  and while there is more
than sufficient cash in fashionmall.com to fund the Company's  liquidation  preference,  the Company has been in settlement
discussions  with  fashionmall.com's  management to return the Company's  preferred  investment at a discount,  in order to
facilitate  these  potential  uses of the cash.  There is no  assurance  that the  settlement  discussions  will  achieve a
resolution  and/or  what their  ultimate  outcome  will be.  During  2001,  the Company  recorded a charge of $1.9  million
relating to its investment in fashionmall.com; the Company's investment was $5.5 million at December 31, 2001.

<I>New Accounting Pronouncements</I>

   Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 133 and its related amendments and interpretations,  which establish
accounting  and  reporting  standards  for  derivative  instruments.   All  derivatives,   whether  designated  in  hedging
relationships  or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  If the  derivative is designated as
a cash  flow  hedge,  the  effective  portions  of  changes  in the fair  value of the  derivative  are  recorded  in other
comprehensive  income (OCI) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects  earnings.  Ineffective
portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are  recognized  in the Company's  earnings as interest  expense.
The Company uses  derivative  instruments  primarily to manage  exposure to interest  rate risks  inherent in variable rate
debt and refinancings.  The Company  routinely uses cap, swap, and treasury lock agreements to meet these  objectives.  For
interest rate cap instruments  designated as cash flow hedges,  changes in the time value were excluded from the assessment
of hedge  effectiveness.  The swap  agreement on the Dolphin  construction  facility does not qualify for hedge  accounting
although its use is consistent with the Company's overall risk management  objectives.  As a result, the Company recognizes
its share of losses and income related to this agreement in earnings as the value of the agreement changes.

   The initial adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001 resulted in a reduction to income of  approximately  $8.4 million as
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting  principle and a reduction to OCI of $0.8 million.  These amounts represent
the transition  adjustments  necessary to mark the Company's  share of interest rate agreements to fair value as of January
1, 2001.

   In addition to the transition  adjustments,  the Company recognized a $3.3 million reduction of earnings during the year
ended December 31, 2001,  representing  unrealized  losses due to the decline in interest rates and the resulting  decrease
in  value  of  the  Company's  and  its  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures'  interest  rate  agreements.  Of  these  amounts,
approximately  $2.8 million  represents the change in value of the Dolphin swap agreement and the remainder  represents the
changes in time value of other instruments.

   As of December 31, 2001, the Company has $3.1 million of derivative  losses included in Accumulated OCI. Of this amount,
$2.8  million  relates to a realized  loss on a hedge of the  October  2001  Regency  Square  financing.  This loss will be
recognized as additional  interest  expense over the ten-year  term of the debt.  The remaining  $0.3 million of derivative
losses included in Accumulated OCI at December 31, 2001 relates to a hedge of the Dolphin Mall  construction  facility that
will be  recognized as a reduction of earnings  through its 2002  maturity  date.  The Company  expects that  approximately
$0.6 million will be  reclassified  from  Accumulated  OCI and recognized as a reduction of earnings during the next twelve
months.

   In October 2001, the Financial  Accounting  Standards Board issued Statement No. 144,  "Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived  Assets",  which  replaced  FASB  Statement No. 121,  "Accounting  for the  Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets and for Long-Lived  Assets to Be Disposed Of".  Statement 144 broadens the reporting of  discontinued  operations to
include disposals of operating  components;  each of the Company's  investments in an operating center is such a component.
The provisions of Statement 144 are effective for financial  statements  issued for fiscal years  beginning  after December
15, 2001 and generally  are to be applied  prospectively.  The  Statement is not expected to have a material  effect on the
financial  condition or results of  operations  of the Company;  however,  if the Company were to dispose of a center,  the
center's  results of  operations  would  have to be  separately  disclosed  as  discontinued  operations  in the  Company's
financial statements.

<I>Comparable Center Operations</I>

   The  performance  of the Company's  portfolio can be measured  through  comparisons of comparable  centers'  operations.
During 2001,  revenues  (excluding land sales) less operating costs  (operating and recoverable  expenses) of those centers
owned and open for the entire period  increased  approximately  two percent in  comparison to the same centers'  results in
2000.  This growth was  primarily due to increases in minimum  rents,  revenue from  advertising  space  arrangements,  and
lease  cancellation  income,  partially  offset by a decrease in percentage  rent and an increase in expenses.  The Company
expects that  comparable  center  operations  will increase  annually by two to three  percent.  This is a  forward-looking
statement and certain significant  factors could cause the actual results to differ materially;  refer to the General Risks
of the Company in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001.

<I>Other Income</I>

   The Company has certain additional sources of income beyond its rental revenues,  recoveries from tenants,  and revenues
from  management,  leasing,  and development  services,  as summarized in the following table. The Company expects that the
shopping  center-related  revenues,  such as income from parking  garages or  sponsorship  agreements,  will grow at a rate
slightly higher than the rate of inflation.  During 2001,  gains on peripheral land sales were less than the  approximately
$6 million  average of the  preceding  three  years;  the  Company  expects  that 2002 gains on land sales will return to a
range of $6 million to $7 million.  Interest  income in 2001 and 2000 exceeded  historical  averages;  the Company  expects
that 2002  interest  income will range  between $2 million and $3 million.  Lease  cancellation  income is dependent on the
overall  economy and  performance  of particular  retailers in specific  locations and is difficult to predict;  2001 lease
cancellation income  significantly  exceeded  historical  averages.  Estimates regarding  anticipated 2002 other income are
forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,  including
but not  limited  to: 1) actual  results  of  negotiations  with  tenants,  counterparties,  and  potential  purchasers  of
peripheral land, and 2) timing of transactions.

<I>Subsequent Events</I>

   In early 2002,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into a definitive  purchase and sale  agreement to acquire for $88
million a 50% general  partnership  interest in  SunValley  Associates,  a  California  general  partnership  that owns the
Sunvalley  Shopping Center located in Concord,  California.  The $88 million purchase price consists of $28 million of cash
and $60 million of existing  debt that  encumbers the  property.  The Company's  interest in the secured debt consists of a
$55 million  primary note bearing  interest at LIBOR plus 0.92% and a $5 million note bearing  interest at LIBOR plus 3.0%.
The notes mature in September 2003 and have two one-year  extension  options.  The center is also subject to a ground lease
that  expires in 2061.  The Manager has managed the property  since its  development  and will  continue to do so after the
acquisition.  The other 50% partner in the  property  is an entity  owned and  controlled  by Mr. A.  Alfred  Taubman,  the
Company's largest shareholder and recently retired Chairman of the Board of Directors.

   Also in early 2002,  the Company  entered  into  agreements  to sell its  interests  in LaCumbre  Plaza and Paseo Nuevo,
subject to satisfying closing  conditions,  for $77 million.  The centers are subject to ground leases and are unencumbered
by debt. The centers were purchased in 1996 for $59 million.

   These  transactions are expected to close during the first half of 2002, and the Company expects to use the net proceeds
from the sale of the two centers to fund the  acquisition of Sunvalley and pay down  borrowings  under the Company's  lines
of credit.  Assuming  the  operations  of these two centers are included in Funds from  Operations  for the period owned in
2002, the Company  expects that these  transactions  will have a neutral effect on Funds from Operations in 2002. This is a
forward-looking  statement and certain  significant  factors could cause the actual effect to differ materially,  including
but not limited to 1) the occurrence and timing of the  transactions,  2) actual  operations of the centers,  3) actual use
of proceeds, 4) actual transaction costs, and 5) resolution of closing conditions.

<I>Presentation of Operating Results</I>

   The  following  tables  contain  the  combined  operating  results  of the  Company's  Consolidated  Businesses  and the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Income  allocated to the minority  partners in the  Operating  Partnership  and preferred
interests is deducted to arrive at the results  allocable to the Company's  common  shareowners.  Because the net equity of
the  Operating  Partnership  is less than zero,  the income  allocated to the minority  partners is equal to their share of
distributions.  The net equity of these minority  partners is less than zero due to accumulated  distributions in excess of
net income  and not as a result of  operating  losses.  Distributions  to  partners  are  usually  greater  than net income
because net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization,  although  distributions were less than net
income during 2000 due to the gain on the  disposition of Lakeside  described  above.  Also,  losses  allocable to minority
partners in certain  consolidated joint ventures are added back to arrive at the net results of the Company.  The Company's
average  ownership  percentage of the Operating  Partnership was 62% and 63% for 2001 and 2000,  respectively.  The results
of Twelve Oaks Mall are included in the Consolidated  Businesses  subsequent to the closing of the transaction,  while both
Twelve Oaks Mall and Lakeside are included as Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for previous periods.

<U>Consolidated Businesses</U>

   Total  revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001 were $341.4  million,  a $39.5 million or 13.1% increase over 2000.
Minimum  rents  increased  $24.3 million of which $23.1 million was due to the openings of The Shops at Willow Bend and The
Mall at  Wellington  Green,  as well as the  inclusion  of Twelve Oaks Mall.  Minimum  rents also  increased  due to tenant
rollovers and new sources of rental income,  including  temporary  tenants and advertising space  arrangements,  offsetting
decreases  in rent caused by lower  occupancy.  Percentage  rents  decreased  due to  decreases  in tenant  sales.  Expense
recoveries  increased  primarily  due to  Willow  Bend,  Wellington  Green,  and  Twelve  Oaks.  Management,  leasing,  and
development  revenues increased  primarily due to leasing  commissions,  including those relating to two short-term leasing
contracts.  Other  revenue  increased  primarily  due to an increase in lease  cancellation  revenue and  interest  income,
partially offset by a decrease in gains on sales of peripheral land.

   Total operating costs were $307.6 million, a $45.3 million or 17.3% increase from 2000.  Recoverable  expenses increased
primarily due to Willow Bend,  Wellington  Green,  and Twelve Oaks. Other operating  expense  increased due to Willow Bend,
Wellington  Green,  and Twelve  Oaks,  as well as increases  in bad debt  expense,  marketing  expense,  professional  fees
relating to process  improvement  projects,  and losses relating to the investment in MerchantWired,  partially offset by a
decrease in the charge to operations for costs of  pre-development  activities.  During 2001, a $2.0 million  restructuring
loss was recognized,  which primarily represented the cost of certain involuntary terminations of personnel;  substantially
all  restructuring  costs had been paid by year-end.  The Company also  recognized  a $1.9 million  charge  relating to its
investment in  fashionmall.com,  Inc. General and  administrative  expense increased  primarily due to increases in payroll
costs.  Interest  expense  increased  primarily due to debt assumed and incurred  relating to Twelve Oaks and a decrease in
capitalized  interest  upon  opening  of  the  new  centers,  offset  by  decreases  due to  declines  in  interest  rates.
Depreciation expense increased primarily due to Willow Bend, Wellington Green, and Twelve Oaks.

<U>Unconsolidated Joint Ventures</U>

   Total  revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2001 were $238.4  million,  a $7.7  million or 3.3%  increase  from the
comparable  period of 2000.  Minimum rents  increased  primarily due to tenant  rollovers and new sources of rental income,
including  temporary  tenants  and  advertising  space  arrangements,  which  offset  decreases  in rent  caused  by  lower
occupancy.  Increases  in  minimum  rent due to  Dolphin  Mall and  International  Plaza  were  offset by  Twelve  Oaks and
Lakeside.  Expense  recoveries  decreased  primarily due to Twelve Oaks and Lakeside,  partially offset by Dolphin Mall and
International Plaza.  Other revenue increased primarily due to an increase in lease cancellation revenue.

   Total  operating  costs  increased by $24.7 million to $196.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2001.  Recoverable
expenses and depreciation  expense  increased  primarily due to Dolphin Mall and International  Plaza,  partially offset by
Twelve  Oaks  and  Lakeside.  Other  operating  expense  increased  primarily  due to the  openings  of  Dolphin  Mall  and
International  Plaza,  including  greater levels of bad debt expense at Dolphin Mall,  partially  offset by Twelve Oaks and
Lakeside.  Interest  expense  increased  due to a decrease  in  capitalized  interest  upon  opening  of  Dolphin  Mall and
International  Plaza and changes in the value of Dolphin  Mall's  swap  agreement,  partially  offset by  decreases  due to
Twelve Oaks and Lakeside and declines in interest rates.

   As a result of the foregoing,  income before extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle
of the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures  decreased by $16.8 million,  or 28.7%,  to $41.8 million.  The Company's  equity in
income before  extraordinary  items and cumulative  effect of change in accounting  principle of the  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures was $21.9 million, a 23.2% decrease from 2000.

<U>Net Income</U>

   As a result of the  foregoing,  the Company's  income before gain on  disposition  of interest in center,  extraordinary
items,  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle,  and minority and preferred interests decreased $10.8 million,
or 16.2%,  to $55.7  million  for the year ended  December  31,  2001.  During  2001,  a  cumulative  effect of a change in
accounting  principle of $8.4 million was recognized in connection  with the Company's  adoption of SFAS 133.  During 2000,
the Company  recognized an $85.3 million gain on the disposition of its interest in Lakeside,  and an extraordinary  charge
of $9.5 million related to the  extinguishment  of debt.  After  allocation of income to minority and preferred  interests,
net income (loss) allocable to common shareowners for 2001 was $(8.9) million compared to $86.4 million in 2000.

<B>Comparison of 2000 to 1999</B>

   Discussion  of  significant  transactions  and openings  occurring  in 2000  precedes  the  Comparison  of 2001 to 2000.
Significant 1999 items are described below.

   In December 1999, the Operating  Partnership acquired an additional 5% interest in Great Lakes Crossing for $1.2 million
in cash, increasing the Operating Partnership's interest in the center to 85%.

   In November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  acquired Lord Associates,  a retail leasing firm, for $2.5 million in cash
and $5 million in  partnership  units,  which are  subject to certain  contingencies.  In  addition,  $1.0  million of this
purchase price is contingent upon profits achieved on acquired leasing contracts.

   In March 1999,  MacArthur  Center, a 70% owned enclosed  super-regional  mall,  opened in Norfolk,  Virginia.  MacArthur
Center is owned by a joint venture in which the Operating  Partnership has a controlling  interest,  and  consequently  the
results of this center are consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

   In September and November  1999, the Operating  Partnership  completed  private  placements of its Series C and Series D
preferred  equity  totaling  $100  million,  with net  proceeds  used to pay down lines of credit.  In August  1999, a $177
million  refinancing of Cherry Creek was completed,  with net proceeds of $45.2 million being  distributed to the Operating
Partnership  and used to pay down  lines of  credit.  In April  1999  through  June  1999,  $520  million  of  refinancings
relating to The Mall at Short  Hills,  Biltmore  Fashion  Park,  and Great Lakes  Crossing  were  completed.  During  1999,
construction  facilities  for $194  million and $200  million  were  obtained  for  International  Plaza and Dolphin  Mall,
respectively.

<U>Consolidated Businesses</U>

   Total  revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $301.9  million,  a $44.3 million or 17.2% increase over 1999.
Minimum  rents  increased  $18.0  million of which $4.3 million was due to the opening of MacArthur  Center.  Minimum rents
also increased due to the inclusion of Twelve Oaks Mall,  tenant  rollovers,  and new sources of rental  income,  including
temporary  tenants and  advertising  space  arrangements.  Percentage  rents increased due to increases in tenant sales and
the  inclusion  of  Twelve  Oaks.  Expense  recoveries  increased  primarily  due to  MacArthur  Center  and  Twelve  Oaks.
Management,  leasing,  and  development  revenues  increased  primarily  due to  contracts  acquired  as part  of the  Lord
Associates  transaction,  partially  offset by decreases  due to a reduction in fees in certain  managed  centers,  and the
timing and  completion  status of certain  other  contracts  and  services.  Other  revenue  increased  primarily due to an
increase in gains on sales of peripheral land and interest  income,  partially  offset by a decrease in lease  cancellation
revenue.

   Total  operating  costs were $262.3  million,  a $25.3  million or 10.7%  increase from 1999.  Recoverable  expenses and
depreciation  and  amortization  increased  primarily  due to MacArthur  Center and Twelve Oaks.  Other  operating  expense
increased due to MacArthur  Center,  Twelve Oaks,  the Lord  Associates  transaction,  and an increase in bad debt expense,
offset by a decrease  in the  charge to  operations  for costs of  pre-development  activities.  Management,  leasing,  and
development costs increased  primarily due to the Lord Associates  contracts.  Interest expense increased  primarily due to
an increase in interest  rates and  borrowings,  including  debt assumed and incurred  related to Twelve Oaks. In addition,
interest expense  increased because of a decrease in capitalized  interest upon opening  MacArthur Center.  These increases
were offset by a reduction in interest expense on debt paid down with proceeds of the preferred equity offerings.

<U>Unconsolidated Joint Ventures</U>

   Total  revenues for the year ended  December 31, 2000 were $230.7  million,  a $21.3  million or 8.5%  decrease from the
comparable period of 1999.  Minimum rents and expense recoveries  decreased  primarily because the Twelve Oaks and Lakeside
results were only included  through the  transaction  date.  Other revenue  decreased  primarily due to a decrease in lease
cancellation revenue, partially offset by an increase in gains on sales of peripheral land.

   Total  operating  costs  decreased by $4.5 million to $172.0 million for the year ended  December 31, 2000.  Recoverable
expenses decreased  primarily due to Twelve Oaks and Lakeside.  Interest expense increased  primarily due to the additional
debt at Cherry Creek as well as increases in interest rates, partially offset by Twelve Oaks and Lakeside.

   As a result of the foregoing,  income before extraordinary items of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures decreased by $17.0
million,  or 22.5%,  to $58.6 million.  The Company's  equity in income before  extraordinary  items of the  Unconsolidated
Joint Ventures was $28.5 million, a 27.5% decrease from the comparable period in 1999.

<U>Net Income</U>

   As a result of the foregoing,  the Company's  income before gain on disposition,  extraordinary  items, and minority and
preferred  interests  increased $8.1 million,  or 13.9%, to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. The Company
recognized $9.5 million and $0.5 million in  extraordinary  charges related to the  extinguishment  of debt during 2000 and
1999,  respectively.  During 2000,  the Company  recognized  an $85.3  million gain on the  disposition  of its interest in
Lakeside.  After allocation of income to minority and preferred  interests,  net income allocable to common shareowners for
2000 was $86.4 million compared to $8.9 million in 1999.

<B>Liquidity and Capital Resources</B>

   In the following  discussion,  references  to beneficial  interest  represent the Operating  Partnership's  share of the
results  of its  consolidated  and  unconsolidated  businesses.  The  Company  does not have,  and has not had,  any parent
company  indebtedness;  all debt discussed  represents  obligations of the Operating  Partnership or its  subsidiaries  and
joint ventures.

   The Company  believes that its net cash provided by operating  activities,  distributions  from its joint ventures,  the
unutilized  portion of its credit  facilities,  and its ability to access the capital markets assure adequate  liquidity to
conduct its operations in accordance with its dividend, acquisition, and financing policies.

   As of December 31, 2001, the Company had a consolidated cash balance of $27.8 million.  Additionally,  the Company has a
secured  $275  million  line of credit.  This line had $205  million of  borrowings  as of December 31, 2001 and expires in
November 2004 with a one-year  extension  option.  The Company also has  available a second  secured bank line of credit of
up to $40 million.  The line had $12.0 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2001 and expires in June 2002.

<I>Summary of Investing Activities</I>

   Net cash used in investing  activities  was $240.7 million in 2001 compared to $219.7 million in 2000 and $197.4 million
in 1999.  Cash used in  investing  activities  was  impacted  by the  timing of capital  expenditures,  with  additions  to
properties in 2001, 2000, and 1999 for the  construction of MacArthur  Center,  The Mall at Wellington  Green, The Shops at
Willow Bend, as well as other  development  activities and other capital items.  During 2001, 2000, and 1999, $4.0 million,
$3.0 million,  and $7.4 million were invested in  technology-related  ventures,  respectively.  During 1999,  $11.1 million
was invested in Swerdlow  Real Estate  Group and Lord  Associates.  During 2000,  net  acquisition  costs of $23.6  million
were  incurred in connection  with the Lakeside and Twelve Oaks  transaction.  Net proceeds  from sales of peripheral  land
were $8.6 million,  $8.2  million,  and $1.8 million in 2001,  2000,  and 1999,  respectively.  Although 2001 gains on land
sales were less than the comparable  period in 2000,  net proceeds were higher in 2001 because  certain 2000 sales involved
larger land contracts.  Contributions to  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures were $55.9 million in 2001, $18.8 million in 2000,
and $36.8 million in 1999,  primarily  representing  funding for  construction  activities  at Dolphin Mall,  International
Plaza, and The Mall at Millenia.  Distributions  from  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures were primarily  consistent with 2000,
while 2000 decreased from 1999 due to the transfers of Lakeside and Twelve Oaks and excess  mortgage  refinancing  proceeds
received in 1999.

<I>Summary of Financing Activities</I>

   Financing  activities  contributed  cash of $128.8  million in 2001,  $99.7 million in 2000,  and $91.3 million in 1999.
Debt proceeds,  net of repayments and issuance costs, provided $242.7 million,  $231.2 million, and $100.9 million in 2001,
2000,  and 1999,  respectively.  In 1999, the Operating  Partnership  received $97.3 million from the issuance of preferred
equity.  Stock  repurchases of $22.9 million were made in connection with the Company's stock  repurchase  program in 2001,
a decrease of $1.3  million  from 2000.  The Company has  repurchased  $47.1  million of its common stock since it received
authorization  from the  Company's  Board of  Directors in March 2000 for  purchases  up to $50 million.  Issuance of stock
pursuant to the  Continuing  Offer related to the exercise of employee  options  contributed  $16.9  million in 2001,  $0.1
million in 2000, and $3.1 million in 1999.  Total dividends and  distributions  paid were $107.9  million,  $107.5 million,
and $100.1 million in 2001, 2000, and 1999, respectively.

<I>Beneficial Interest in Debt</I>

   At December 31, 2001, the Operating  Partnership's debt and its beneficial  interest in the debt of its Consolidated and
Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures totaled  $1,907.9  million with an average interest rate of 5.86% excluding  amortization of
debt issuance  costs and interest rate hedging  costs.  Debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs are reported as
interest  expense in the  results of  operations.  Amortization  of debt  issuance  costs  added  0.37% to TRG's  effective
interest  rate  during  2001.  Included  in  beneficial  interest in debt is debt used to fund  development  and  expansion
costs.  Beneficial  interest in assets on which  interest is being  capitalized  totaled  $121.4 million as of December 31,
2001.  Beneficial  interest in capitalized  interest was $29.5 million for 2001. The following  table presents  information
about the Company's beneficial interest in debt as of December 31, 2001.

(1)  Denotes weighted average interest rate before amortization of financing costs.
(2)  This  construction  debt at  a  50% owned  unconsolidated  joint venture is swapped at a rate of 6.14%  when  LIBOR is
     below 6.7%.
(3)  As provided for by certain debt agreements,  the Company  has  currently  locked  in an average all in rate of 4.7% on
     approximately  $490 million of floating rate debt into the fourth quarter of 2002 and an additional  $247 million that
     expires throughout the first three quarters of 2002.

<I>Sensitivity Analysis</I>

   The Company has exposure to interest  rate risk on its debt  obligations  and interest  rate  instruments.  Based on the
Operating  Partnership's  beneficial  interest in debt and interest  rates in effect at December 31, 2001,  excluding  debt
fixed under  long-term  LIBOR rate  contracts,  a one percent  increase or decrease in interest rates on this floating rate
debt would  decrease or increase  annual cash flows by  approximately  $4.0 million  and, due to the effect of  capitalized
interest,  annual earnings by approximately  $3.7 million.  Based on the Company's  consolidated debt and interest rates in
effect at  December  31,  2001,  a one  percent  increase  in  interest  rates  would  decrease  the fair  value of debt by
approximately  $43.2  million,  while a one percent  decrease in interest  rates would  increase  the fair value of debt by
approximately $46.4 million.

   In March 2002,  the Company  entered into a one year 4.3% swap agreement  based on a notional  amount of $100 million to
begin November 1, 2002, as a hedge of the Company's $275 million line of credit.

<I>Covenants and Commitments</I>

   Certain loan agreements contain various restrictive  covenants  including minimum net worth  requirements,  minimum debt
service and fixed charges  coverage ratios,  a maximum payout ratio on  distributions,  and a minimum debt yield ratio, the
latter being the most restrictive. The Operating Partnership is in compliance with all of its covenants.

   The Company's secured credit facilities contain customary covenants requiring the maintenance of comprehensive  all-risk
insurance on property securing each facility.  As a result of expected  exclusions or coverage  reductions in its insurance
policies upon renewal, the Company expects to purchase supplemental  coverage for terrorist acts at significant  additional
cost.  Although,  based on  preliminary  discussions  with its  insurance  agency and certain of its  lenders,  the Company
believes it will be able to purchase  satisfactory  additional  coverage at increased,  though not  prohibitive,  costs. No
assurances  can be given that such  coverage  will be adequate or that  mortgagees  will not require  coverage  beyond that
which is commercially  available at reasonable  rates. The Company's  inability to obtain such coverage or to do so only at
greatly increased costs may also negatively impact the availability and cost of future financing.

   Certain debt agreements contain  performance and valuation criteria that must be met for the loans to be extended at the
full principal amounts;  these agreements provide for partial  prepayments of debt to facilitate  compliance with extension
provisions.

   Payments of principal and interest on the loans in the following  table are  guaranteed by the Operating  Partnership as
of December 31,  2001.  All of the loan  agreements  provide for a reduction of the amounts  guaranteed  as certain  center
performance and valuation criteria are met.

(1)  An investor  in  the  International  Plaza  venture  has  indemnified  the  Operating  Partnership  to  the  extent of
     approximately 25% of the amounts  guaranteed.  Effective February 2002, the guarantee on the International  Plaza loan
     was reduced to 50%.

<I>Funds from Operations</I>

   A principal factor that the Company  considers in determining  dividends to shareowners is Funds from Operations  (FFO),
which is defined as income before  extraordinary  items, real estate  depreciation and amortization,  and the allocation to
the minority interest in the Operating  Partnership,  less preferred dividends and distributions.  Gains on dispositions of
depreciated  operating  properties  are  excluded  from  FFO.  In 2001,  a $1.9  million  charge  related  to a  technology
investment was also excluded.

    Funds from  Operations  does not represent  cash flows from  operations,  as defined by generally  accepted  accounting
principles,  and should not be considered to be an  alternative  to net income as an indicator of operating  performance or
to cash flows from  operations as a measure of  liquidity.  However,  the National  Association  of Real Estate  Investment
Trusts  suggests that Funds from Operations is a useful  supplemental  measure of operating  performance  for REITs.  Funds
from Operations as presented by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.

<I>Dividends</I>

   The Company pays regular quarterly dividends to its common and Series A preferred  shareowners.  Dividends to its common
shareowners  are at the  discretion  of the  Board of  Directors  and  depend on the cash  available  to the  Company,  its
financial condition,  capital and other requirements,  and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.  To
qualify as a REIT,  the Company must  distribute  at least 90% of its REIT taxable  income to its  shareowners,  as well as
meet certain  other  requirements.  Preferred  dividends  accrue  regardless of whether  earnings,  cash  availability,  or
contractual  obligations  were to prohibit the current  payment of dividends.  The  preferred  stock is callable in October
2002.  The Company has no present intention to redeem the preferred equity.

   On December 11, 2001, the Company  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.255 per common share payable January 22, 2002 to
shareowners  of record on December 31,  2001.  The Board of Directors  also  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.51875 per
share on the  Company's  8.3% Series A Preferred  Stock,  paid December 31, 2001 to  shareowners  of record on December 21,
2001.

   Common  dividends  declared  totaled  $1.005 per common share in 2001, of which $0.3075  represented  return of capital,
$0.6878  represented  ordinary income,  and $0.0097  represented  capital gain,  compared to dividends  declared in 2000 of
$0.985 per common  share,  of which  $0.4402  represented  return of capital and $0.4799  represented  ordinary  income and
$0.0649  represented  capital gain.  The tax status of total 2002 common  dividends  declared and to be declared,  assuming
continuation of a $0.255 per common share quarterly dividend,  is estimated to be approximately 28% return of capital,  and
approximately  72% ordinary  income.  Series A preferred  dividends  declared were $2.075 per  preferred  share in 2001 and
2000, of which $2.0549  represented  ordinary income and $0.0201  represented capital gains in 2001 and $1.9382 represented
ordinary  income and  $0.1368  represented  capital  gains in 2000.  The tax status of total 2002  dividends  to be paid on
Series A Preferred  Stock is  estimated  to be 100%  ordinary  income.  These are  forward-looking  statements  and certain
significant  factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,  including:  1) the amount of dividends declared,
2) changes in the Company's share of anticipated  taxable income of the Operating  Partnership due to the actual results of
the Operating  Partnership,  3) changes in the number of the Company's  outstanding  shares,  4) property  acquisitions  or
dispositions,  5) financing  transactions,  including refinancing of existing debt, 6) changes in interest rates, 7) amount
and nature of development activities, and 8) changes in the tax laws or their application.

   The annual  determination  of the Company's  common  dividends is based on anticipated  Funds from Operations  available
after preferred  dividends,  as well as financing  considerations and other appropriate  factors.  Further, the Company has
decided  that the  growth in common  dividends  will be less than the  growth in Funds from  Operations  for the  immediate
future.  Based on current tax laws and earnings  projections,  the Company expects that the growth in common dividends will
be less than the growth in Funds from Operations for at least three more years.

   Any  inability of the  Operating  Partnership  or its Joint  Ventures to secure  financing as required to fund  maturing
debts, capital expenditures and changes in working capital,  including development  activities and expansions,  may require
the utilization of cash to satisfy such obligations,  thereby possibly reducing  distributions to partners of the Operating
Partnership and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.

(1)  Costs are net of intercompany profits and are computed on an accrual basis.
(2)  Includes the Operating  Partnership's  share of construction  costs for The Mall  at  Wellington  Green (a  90%  owned
     consolidated  joint venture),  International  Plaza (a 26% owned  unconsolidated  joint venture),  Dolphin Mall (a 50%
     owned unconsolidated joint venture), and The Mall at Millenia (a 50% owned unconsolidated joint venture).
(3)  Includes costs related to The Mall at Wellington Green and The Shops at Willow Bend.
(4)  Includes costs related to International Plaza, Dolphin Mall, and The Mall at Millenia.

   The Operating  Partnership's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased during the year, excluding expansion
space and new  developments,  was $15.26 in 2001 and $16.39 in 2000.  In addition,  the  Operating  Partnership's  share of
capitalized  leasing costs in 2001,  excluding  new  developments,  was $8.7 million,  or $10.32 per square foot leased and
$7.6 million or $10.54 per square foot leased during the year in 2000.

   The Operating  Partnership  has entered into a 50% owned joint venture to develop The Mall at Millenia  currently  under
construction in Orlando,  Florida.  This project is expected to cost  approximately  $200 million and open in October 2002.
The Mall at Millenia will be anchored by Bloomingdale's, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus.

   Stony Point Fashion Park, a new 690,000 square foot open-air center under  construction in Richmond,  Virginia,  will be
anchored by Dillard's and Saks. The center is scheduled to open in September 2003.

   The Company's  approximately $22 million balance of development  pre-construction costs as of December 31, 2001 consists
primarily  of costs  relating  to a  project  in  Syosset,  New  York.  Both  Neiman  Marcus  and Lord &amp; Taylor  have  made
announcements  committing to the project.  The Company is currently  involved in a lawsuit to obtain the  necessary  zoning
approvals to move forward with the project.  Although  the Company  expects to be  successful  in this effort,  the process
may not be resolved in the near  future.  In addition,  if the  litigation  is  unsuccessful,  the Company  would expect to
recover substantially less than its cost in this project under possible alternative uses for the site.

   The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance to develop value super-regional  projects in
major  metropolitan  markets.  The amended  agreement,  which  expires in May 2008,  calls for the two companies to jointly
develop and own at least four of these centers,  each  representing  approximately  $200 million of capital  investment.  A
number of locations across the nation are targeted for future initiatives.

   The  following  table  summarizes  planned  capital  spending,  which is not  recovered  from  tenants  and  assumes  no
acquisitions during 2002:

   The Operating  Partnership  anticipates that  its share of costs for development  projects  scheduled to be completed in
2003 will be as much as $80 million in 2003.  Estimates of future capital  spending  include only projects  approved by the
Company's Board of Directors and,  consequently,  estimates will change as new projects are approved.  Estimates  regarding
capital  expenditures  presented  above are  forward-looking  statements  and certain  significant  factors could cause the
actual  results to differ  materially,  including  but not  limited to: 1) actual  results of  negotiations  with  anchors,
tenants, and contractors,  2) changes in the scope and number of projects, 3) cost overruns, 4) timing of expenditures,  5)
financing  considerations,  6) actual time to complete projects, 7) changes in economic climate, 8) competition from others
attracting tenants and customers, and 9) increases in operating costs.

<I>Cash Tender Agreement</I>

   A.  Alfred  Taubman  has the annual  right to tender to the  Company  units of  partnership  interest  in the  Operating
Partnership  (provided  that the  aggregate  value is at least $50  million) and cause the Company to purchase the tendered
interests at a purchase  price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the trading date  immediately  preceding  the
date of the tender (the Cash Tender  Agreement).  At A.  Alfred  Taubman's  election,  his family,  and certain  others may
participate in tenders.  The Company will have the option to pay for these interests from available  cash,  borrowed funds,
or from the  proceeds of an  offering of the  Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the Company  expects to finance  these
purchases  through  the sale of new shares of its stock.  The  tendering  partner  will bear all market  risk if the market
price at closing is less than the  purchase  price and will bear the costs of sale.  Any proceeds of the offering in excess
of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the Company.

   Based on a market  value at December  31, 2001 of $14.85 per common  share,  the  aggregate  value of  interests  in the
Operating  Partnership that may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was  approximately  $366 million.  The purchase
of these  interests  at December  31, 2001 would have  resulted in the Company  owning an  additional  30%  interest in the
Operating Partnership.

Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.


   We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. (the "Company") as of
December 31,  2001 and 2000, and the related consolidated  statements of operations,  shareowners' equity, and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2001.  Our audits also  included the  financial
statement  schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial  statements and financial  statement schedules
are the  responsibility of the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

   We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United  States of
America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether
the  financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An audit  includes  examining,  on a test  basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements.  An audit also includes  assessing
the accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion, such consolidated  financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial
position of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. as of December  31, 2001 and 2000,  and the results of its  operations  and its
cash flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2001 in  conformity  with  accounting
principles  generally  accepted in the United States of America.  Also, in our opinion,  such  financial  statement
schedules,  when considered in relation to the basic consolidated  financial  statements taken as a whole,  present
fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

   As discussed  in Note 2 to the  consolidated  financial  statements,  in 2001 the Company  changed its method of
accounting  for  derivative  instruments  to conform to  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 133, as
amended and interpreted.

                                        Three Years Ended December 31, 2001

<B>Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B>

Organization and Basis of Presentation

   Taubman  Centers,  Inc. (the Company or TCO), a real estate  investment  trust, or REIT, is the managing general
partner of The Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited  Partnership  (the  Operating  Partnership  or TRG).  The  Operating
Partnership  is  an  operating  subsidiary  that  engages  in  the  ownership,  management,  leasing,  acquisition,
development,   and  expansion  of  regional  retail  shopping   centers  and  interests   therein.   The  Operating
Partnership's  portfolio as of December 31, 2001  included 20 urban and suburban  shopping  centers in nine states.
Two additional centers are under construction in Florida and Virginia.

   The  consolidated  financial  statements  of the Company  include all  accounts of the  Company,  the  Operating
Partnership,  and its consolidated subsidiaries;  all intercompany balances have been eliminated.  Shopping centers
owned  through  joint  ventures  with third  parties  not  unilaterally  controlled  by  ownership  or  contractual
obligation (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method.

   The Company owns 99% of the voting stock of Taub-Co  (which holds an  approximately  98% interest in The Taubman
Company LLC (the  Manager)) and an  approximately  2% direct  interest in the Manager.  Prior to October 2001,  the
Company's  interest in Taub-Co was  non-voting.  Through these ownership  interests,  the Company has the perpetual
rights to receive over 99% of the economic  benefits and cash flows  generated  by the  Manager's  operations.  The
remaining  interest in the Manager is indirectly  owned by individuals who are members of the Board of Directors or
major  stockholders of the Company,  and who have contributed  nominal amounts of equity for their interests in the
Manager.  These  individuals'  interests are aligned with the interests of the  Company's  management.  The Manager
cannot  perform any services to entities in which the Company is not a  significant  investor  without the approval
of the Company.  The Company or its affiliates  have provided all of the operating  capital to the Manager.  All of
these  factors  resulted in the Company  having a controlling  financial  interest in Taub-Co and the Manager under
both the  current  and  prior  ownership  structures  and,  therefore,  the  operations  of the  Manager  have been
consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

   References  in  the  following  notes  to  "the  Company"  include  the  Operating  Partnership,   except  where
intercompany transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted.

   Dollar  amounts  presented in tables  within the notes to the  financial  statements  are stated in thousands of
dollars, except share data or as otherwise noted.

Revenue Recognition

   Shopping center space is generally leased to specialty  retail tenants under short and intermediate  term leases
which  are  accounted  for  as  operating  leases.  Minimum  rents  are  recognized  on the  straight-line  method.
Percentage rent is accrued when lessees' specified sales targets have been met. Expense  recoveries,  which include
an  administrative  fee,  are  recognized  as revenue in the period  applicable  costs are  chargeable  to tenants.
Management,  leasing,  and  development  revenue  is  recognized  as  services  are  rendered,  when  fees  due are
determinable,  and collectibility is reasonably assured.  Fees for management,  leasing,  and development  services
are established under contracts and are generally based on negotiated rates,  percentages of cash receipts,  and/or
actual compensation costs incurred.

Depreciation and Amortization

   Buildings,  improvements and equipment are depreciated on straight-line or  double-declining  balance bases over
the estimated useful lives of the assets,  which range from 3 to 50 years.  Tenant  allowances and deferred leasing
costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases.

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Capitalization

   Costs related to the  acquisition,  development,  construction,  and improvement of properties are  capitalized.
Interest costs are  capitalized  until  construction is  substantially  complete.  All properties,  including those
under  construction or development  and/or owned by Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures,  are reviewed for impairment on
an individual  basis  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate that their  carrying value may not be
recoverable.  Impairment  is  recognized  when the sum of expected cash flows  (undiscounted  and without  interest
charges) is less than the  carrying  value of the  property.  To the extent  impairment  has  occurred,  the excess
carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value is charged to income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

   Cash  equivalents  consist  of  highly  liquid  investments  with a  maturity  of 90 days or less at the date of
purchase.

Investments in Equity Securities

   The  Operating  Partnership  holds  nonmarketable   investments  in  equity  securities  in  certain  technology
businesses  (Note 10). These  investments  are reviewed for  other-than-temporary  declines in value when events or
circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts are not recoverable.

Deferred Charges

   Direct  financing  costs are deferred and amortized  over the terms of the related  agreements as a component of
interest  expense.  Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a  straight-line
basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred  charges are amortized on a  straight-line  basis
over the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

   Stock-based  compensation  plans are  accounted  for under  APB  Opinion  25,  "Accounting  for Stock  Issued to
Employees" and related interpretations, as permitted under FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation".

Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

   Effective  January 1, 2001, the Company  adopted SFAS 133  "Accounting  for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging
Activities" and its related  amendments and  interpretations,  which establish  accounting and reporting  standards
for derivative  instruments  (Note 2). All  derivatives,  whether  designated in hedging  relationships or not, are
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.  If a derivative  is  designated  as a cash flow hedge,  the effective
portions of changes in the fair value of the  derivative are recorded in other  comprehensive  income (OCI) and are
recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects  earnings.  Ineffective  portions of changes in the
fair value of a cash flow hedge are  recognized in the Company's  earnings as interest  expense.  For interest rate
cap  instruments  designated  as cash flow hedges,  changes in the time value are excluded  from the  assessment of
hedge effectiveness.

   The Company formally  documents all relationships  between hedging  instruments and hedged items, as well as its
risk management  objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions.  The Company assesses,  both
at the  inception  of the  hedge  and on an  ongoing  basis,  whether  the  derivatives  that are  used in  hedging
transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items.

Partners' Equity of TRG Allocable to Minority Partners

   Because the net equity of the  partnership  unitholders  is less than zero,  the interest of the  noncontrolling
unitholders  is  presented  as a zero  balance in the balance  sheet as of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000.
Also, the income  allocated to the  noncontrolling  unitholders in the Company's  financial  statements is equal to
their share of  distributions.  The net equity of the Operating  Partnership  unitholders is less than zero because
of accumulated  distributions  in excess of net income and not as a result of operating  losses.  Distributions  to
partners are usually  greater than net income because net income includes  non-cash  charges for  depreciation  and
amortization.  Distributions  were less than net income  during 2000 due to a non-cash gain on the  disposition  of
an interest in a center (Note 3).

Use of Estimates

   The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States of America  requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
of  assets,  liabilities,  and  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the date of the  financial
statements,  and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

   The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:

      The  carrying  value of cash and cash  equivalents,  accounts  and notes  receivable,  and  accounts  payable
      approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

      The fair value of mortgage notes and other notes payable is estimated based on quoted market prices
      if available,  or the amount the Company would pay to terminate the debt, with prepayment penalties,  if any,
      on the reporting date.

      The fair value of interest  rate hedging  instruments  is the amount that the Company would receive or pay to
      terminate the agreement at the reporting date.

Operating Segment

   The Company has one reportable  operating  segment;  it owns,  develops and manages regional  shopping  centers.
The shopping  centers are located in major  metropolitan  areas,  have similar  tenants (most of which are national
chains),  and share  common  economic  characteristics.  No single  retail  company  represents  10% or more of the
Company's revenues.

Reclassifications

   Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to 2001 classifications.

<B>Note 2 - Change in Accounting Principle</B>

   The Company uses  derivative  instruments  to manage  exposure to interest rate risks  inherent in variable rate
debt and  refinancings.  The  Company  routinely  uses cap,  swap,  and  treasury  lock  agreements  to meet  these
objectives.

   The initial  adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001  resulted in a reduction  to income of  approximately  $8.4
million as the cumulative  effect of a change in accounting  principle and a reduction to  accumulated  OCI of $0.8
million.  These amounts  represent the  transition  adjustments  necessary to mark the Company's  share of interest
rate agreements to fair value as of January 1, 2001.

   In addition to the transition  adjustments,  the Company  recognized a $3.3 million reduction of earnings during
the year ended December 31, 2001,  representing  unrealized  losses  primarily due to the decline in interest rates
and the  resulting  decrease  in value of the  Company's  and its  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures'  interest  rate
agreements.  Of this  amount,  approximately  $2.8  million  represents  the  change in value of the  Dolphin  swap
agreement and the remainder represents the changes in time value of cap instruments.

   As of December 31, 2001,  the Company has $3.1 million of  derivative  losses  included in  Accumulated  OCI. Of
this amount,  $2.8 million  relates to a realized  loss on a hedge of the October  2001 Regency  Square  financing.
This loss will be  recognized  as additional  interest  expense over the ten-year  term of the debt.  The remaining
$0.3  million of  derivative  losses  included in  Accumulated  OCI at December  31, 2001 relates to a hedge of the
Dolphin Mall  construction  facility that will be  recognized as a reduction of earnings  through its 2002 maturity
date.  The  Company  expects  that  approximately  $0.6  million  will be  reclassified  from  Accumulated  OCI and
recognized as a reduction of earnings during the next twelve months.

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

   The swap agreement on the Dolphin  construction  facility does not qualify for hedge accounting although its use
is consistent  with the Company's  overall risk  management  objectives.  As a result,  the Company  recognizes its
share of losses and income related to this agreement in earnings as the value of the agreement changes.

<B>Note 3 - Twelve Oaks and Lakeside Transaction</B>

   In August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire  an  additional  ownership  in one of its
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Under  the terms of the  agreement,  the  Operating  Partnership  became  the 100
percent  owner of Twelve  Oaks Mall,  and its joint  venture  partner  became the 100  percent  owner of  Lakeside,
subject to the existing  mortgage debt. The  transaction  resulted in a net payment to the joint venture partner of
approximately  $25.5 million in cash. The  acquisition of the additional  interest in Twelve Oaks was accounted for
as a purchase.  A gain of $85.3 million on the transaction was recognized by the Company,  representing  the excess
of the fair value over the net book basis of the  Company's  interest in Lakeside,  adjusted for the $25.5  million
paid and  transaction  costs.  The  Company's  gain on the  transaction  differed  from  the  $116.5  million  gain
recognized by the Operating Partnership due to  the Company's $31.2 million additional basis in Lakeside.

<B>Note 4 - Restructuring</B>

   In October 2001,  the Operating  Partnership  committed to a  restructuring  of its  development  operations.  A
restructuring  charge of  approximately  $2.0  million  was  recorded  during the year  ended  December  31,  2001,
primarily  representing the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations of personnel.  Pursuant to the restructuring
plan, 17 positions were  eliminated  within the  development  department.  Substantially  all of the  restructuring
costs were paid during 2001.

<B>Note 5 - Income Taxes</B>

   The  Company  operates in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the  provisions  of the  Internal  Revenue
Code;  therefore,  applicable  taxable income is included in the taxable income of its  shareowners,  to the extent
distributed  by the Company.  To qualify as a REIT,  the Company must  distribute  at least 90% of its REIT taxable
income to its  shareowners  and meet certain other  requirements.  Additionally,  no provision for income taxes for
consolidated partnerships has been made, as such taxes are the responsibility of the individual partners.

   In connection  with the Tax Relief  Extension Act of 1999,  the Company made Taxable REIT  Subsidiary  elections
for all of its  corporate  subsidiaries.  The  elections,  effective  for  January 1, 2001,  were made  pursuant to
section  856(I) of the Internal  Revenue Code.  The Company's  Taxable REIT  Subsidiaries  are subject to corporate
level income taxes which are provided for in the Company's financial statements.

   Deferred tax assets and liabilities  reflect the impact of temporary  differences  between the amounts of assets
and  liabilities for financial  reporting  purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax
laws.  Deferred  tax assets are reduced by a valuation  allowance to the amount  where  realization  is more likely
than not assured after considering all available  evidence.  The Company's temporary  differences  primarily relate
to deferred compensation and depreciation.  During the year ended December 31, 2001,  utilization of a deferred tax
asset reduced the Company's  federal  income tax expense from its taxable REIT  subsidiaries  to $0.1 million.  For
the year ended December 31, 2001,  state income tax expense from the Company's  taxable REIT  subsidiaries was $0.5
million.  As of December 31, 2001,  the Company had a net  deferred  tax asset of $4.4  million,  after a valuation
allowance of $7.1 million.

   In September  2001,  International  Plaza,  a 1.25 million  square foot center opened in Tampa,  Florida.  As of
December 31, 2001, the Operating  Partnership has a preferred  investment in International  Plaza of $19.1 million,
on which an annual preferential return of 8.25% will accrue.

   In March 2001,  Dolphin  Mall,  a 1.3 million  square  foot  regional  center  opened in Miami,  Florida.  As of
December 31, 2001, the Operating  Partnership has a preferred  investment in Dolphin Mall of $29.6 million on which
an annual preferential return of 16.0% will accrue.

   In addition to the preferred  return on its investments in  International  Plaza and Dolphin Mall, the Operating
Partnership  will receive a return of its  preferred  investments  before any  available  cash will be utilized for
distributions to non-preferred partners.

   In April 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to develop The Mall at Millenia in Orlando,  Florida.  This
1.2 million square foot center is expected to open in October  2002.

   During  2001,  the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  recognized a  cumulative  effect of a change in  accounting
principle  in  connection  with  their  adoption  of SFAS 133 (Note  2).  This  cumulative  effect  represents  the
transition  adjustment  necessary to mark  interest  rate  agreements  to fair value as of January 1, 2001.  During
2000 and 1999, the Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures incurred  extraordinary  charges related to the extinguishment of
debt, primarily consisting of prepayment premiums and the writeoff of deferred financing costs.

   The Company's  carrying value of its Investment in  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures differs from its share of the
partnership  equity  reported in the combined  balance sheet of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures due to (i) the
Company's cost of its investment in excess of the historical net book values of the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures
and (ii) the Operating  Partnership's  adjustments to the book basis,  including  intercompany  profits on sales of
services that are capitalized by the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures.  The Company's  additional basis allocated to
depreciable assets is recognized on a straight-line  basis over 40 years. The Operating  Partnership's  differences
in bases are amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.

   Combined  balance  sheet and  results  of  operations  information  are  presented  in the  following  table (in
thousands) for all Unconsolidated Joint Ventures,  followed by the Operating  Partnership's  beneficial interest in
the  combined  information.  Beneficial  interest is  calculated  based on the  Operating  Partnership's  ownership
interest in each of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  The accounts of Lakeside and Twelve Oaks Mall,  formerly
50% Unconsolidated Joint Ventures, are included in these results through the date of the transaction (Note 3).

   The  properties  balances as of December 31, 2001 above reflect the 2001 openings of The Shops at Willow Bend, a
1.5  million  square foot center in Plano,  Texas,  and The Mall at  Wellington  Green,  a 1.3 million  square foot
center in Wellington,  Florida.  Construction in process  includes costs related to the construction of Stony Point
Fashion Park,  additional  phases of construction at The Shops at Willow Bend and The Mall at Wellington Green, and
expansions and improvements at various other centers.

   Depreciation  expense  for  2001,  2000,  and  1999  was  $63.0  million,  $52.5  million,  and  $47.9  million,
respectively.  The  charge  to  operations  in 2001,  2000,  and 1999 for  costs of  unsuccessful  and  potentially
unsuccessful pre-development activities was $6.6 million, $7.5 million, and $10.1 million, respectively.

   The balance of development  pre-construction  costs as of December 31, 2001 consists primarily of costs relating
to a project in Syosset,  New York.  Both Neiman  Marcus and Lord &amp; Taylor have made  announcements  committing  to
the  project.  The Company is  currently  involved in a lawsuit to obtain the  necessary  zoning  approvals to move
forward with the project.  Although the Company  expects to be  successful  in this effort,  the process may not be
resolved  in the near  future.  In  addition,  if the  litigation  is  unsuccessful,  the Company  would  expect to
recover substantially less than its cost in this project under possible alternative uses for the site.

   In April 2001,  the $10 million  investment in Swerdlow  (Note 10) was converted  into a note  receivable  which
bore interest at 12% and matured in December 2001.  This loan is currently  delinquent and is accruing  interest at
18%.  All interest  due through the  December  maturity  date was  received.  Although  the  Operating  Partnership
expects to fully recover the amount due under this note receivable,  the Company is currently in negotiations  with
Swerdlow regarding the repayment.  An affiliate of Swerdlow is a partner in the Dolphin Mall joint venture.

   During 2001, the Company  committed to funding  approximately  $2 million in  Constellation  Real  Technologies,
LLC,  a  company  that  forms  and  sponsors  real  estate-related  internet,  e-commerce,  and  telecommunications
enterprises. The Company's investment was $0.5 million at December 31, 2001.

   In May 2000,  the Company  acquired an  approximately  6.8% interest in  MerchantWired,  LLC, a service  company
providing  internet and network  infrastructure  to shopping  centers and  retailers.  As of December 31, 2001, the
Company had an  investment  of  approximately  $3.6  million in this  venture  and has  guaranteed  obligations  of
approximately   $3.8  million.   The  principal   shareholder  of  MerchantWired  has  disclosed  that  the  future
profitability of MerchantWired is dependent on it obtaining outside capital and other management  expertise;  there
is no assurance as to its success in doing so. The Company  accounts for its  investment  in  MerchantWired  on the
equity  method.  During  2001 and  2000,  the  Company  recognized  its $2.4  million  and  $0.5  million  share of
MerchantWired losses, respectively.

   In November 1999, the Operating  Partnership acquired Lord Associates,  a retail leasing firm, for approximately
$7.5  million,  representing  $2.5  million  in cash and  435,153  partnership  units  (and an equal  number of the
Company's Series B  Non-Participating  Convertible  Preferred Stock). The units and stock are being released over a
five-year  period,  with  $0.9  million  and  $1.1  million  of  units  having  been  released  in 2001  and  2000,
respectively.  The owner of the partnership  units is not entitled to distributions or income  allocations,  and an
affiliate of the  Operating  Partnership  has voting rights to the stock,  until release of the units.  Of the cash
purchase  price,  approximately  $1.0  million was paid at closing and $1.5  million  will be paid over five years;
$1.0 million of the purchase price is contingent upon profits  achieved on acquired  leasing  contracts.  The final
65,271  partnership  units are collateral if the profit  contingency is not met. The acquisition of Lord Associates
was  accounted  for as a  purchase  (cost  amortized  over five  years),  with the  results of  operations  of Lord
Associates being included in the income statement of the Company  subsequent to the acquisition  date. During 2001,
68,000  partnership  units were  exchanged  by the owner for common  stock  under the  Continuing  Offer (Note 16).
Also, an equal number of Series B preferred  shares were  converted to shares of the Company's  common stock at the
Series B conversion ratio (Note 15).

   In  September  1999,  the Company  acquired an  approximately  5% interest  in  Swerdlow  Real Estate  Group,  a
privately  held real estate  investment  trust,  for  approximately  $10  million.  In April 2001,  the $10 million
investment in Swerdlow was converted into a note receivable (Note 9).

   In April  1999,  the  Company  obtained  a $7.4  million  preferred  investment  in  fashionmall.com,  Inc.,  an
e-commerce  company  originally  organized to market,  promote,  advertise,  and sell  fashion  apparel and related
accessories  and products over the internet.  In 2001,  fashionmall.com  significantly  scaled back its  operations
and experienced  significant  decreases in operating revenues.  Fashionmall.com  management has disclosed that they
have more cash than is needed to fund current  operations and are considering how best to use such cash,  including
making  acquisitions,  issuing special dividends,  or finding other options to provide  opportunities for liquidity
to its  shareholders  at some time in the  future.  While the  Company's  right to a  preference  in the event of a
liquidation  is not  disputed,  and  while  there  is more  than  sufficient  cash in  fashionmall.com  to fund the
Company's  liquidation  preference,   the  Company  has  been  in  settlement  discussions  with  fashionmall.com's
management  to return the Company's  preferred  investment at a discount,  in order to facilitate  these  potential
uses of the cash.  There is no assurance  that the  settlement  discussions  will achieve a resolution  and/or what
their  ultimate  outcome will be. The Company  accounts for its investment in  fashionmall.com  on the cost method.
During 2001,  the Company  recorded a charge of $1.9 million  relating to its  investment in  fashionmall.com;  the
Company's investment was $5.5 million at December 31, 2001.

<B>Note 12 - Leases</B>

Operating Leases

   Shopping  center space is leased to tenants and certain  anchors  pursuant to lease  agreements.  Tenant  leases
typically  provide for  guaranteed  minimum rent,  percentage  rent,  and other charges to cover certain  operating
costs.  Future minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 2001 for operating  centers,  assuming
no new or renegotiated leases or option extensions on anchor agreements, is summarized as follows:

                                      2002                           $197,445

   Certain  shopping  centers,  as lessees,  have ground leases expiring at various dates through the year 2065. In
addition,  the Company  leases its office  facilities.  Rental  payments  under ground and office  leases were $7.9
million in 2001,  $7.5  million in 2000,  and $7.0  million in 1999.  Included in these  amounts are related  party
office rental payments of $2.7 million in each year.

   The table above  includes $2.8 million,  $2.8 million,  $2.8 million,  and $0.9 million of related party amounts
in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005.

Memorial City Mall Lease

   In 1996, the Operating  Partnership  entered into an agreement to lease Memorial City Mall, a 1.4 million square
foot  shopping  center  located in Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that enabled the
Operating  Partnership to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities and terminate the lease obligations in
the event  such  redevelopment  opportunities  were not  deemed to be  sufficient.  In April  2000,  the  Operating
Partnership terminated the lease.

<B>Note 13 - Transactions with Affiliates</B>

   The revenue from management,  leasing,  and development  services includes $4.1 million,  $4.2 million, and $2.5
million from  transactions  with  affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2001,  2000, and 1999,  respectively.
Accounts  receivable  from  related  parties  include  amounts  due from  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  or other
affiliates of the Company,  primarily  relating to services  performed by the Manager (Note 14). These  receivables
include certain amounts due to the Manager related to reimbursement of third-party (non-affiliated) costs.

   During 1997, the Operating  Partnership  acquired an option from a related party to purchase certain real estate
on which the Operating  Partnership  was  exploring the  possibility  of developing a shopping  center.  The option
agreement  required  option  payments of $150  thousand  during each of the first five years,  $400 thousand in the
sixth year, and $500 thousand in the seventh year.  Through  December 31, 2000, the Operating  Partnership had made
payments of $450  thousand.  In 2000,  the  Operating  Partnership  decided not to go forward  with the project and
reached an agreement with the optionor to be reimbursed,  at the time of the sale or lease of the real estate,  for
an amount  equal to the lesser of 50% of the  project  costs to date or $350  thousand.  Under the  agreement,  the
Operating  Partnership's  obligation to make further  option  payments was  suspended.  The  Operating  Partnership
expects to receive $350  thousand in total  reimbursements  and after  receipt of such  amount,  the option will be
terminated. A sale of the property is not anticipated to take place before 2003.

   Other related party transactions are described in Notes 9, 12, and 14.

<B>Note 14 - The Manager</B>

   The Taubman Company LLC (the Manager),  which is 99% beneficially owned by the Operating  Partnership,  provides
property  management,  leasing,  development,  and other  administrative  services  to the  Company,  the  shopping
centers,  and Taubman affiliates.  In addition,  the Manager provides services to centers transferred to GMPT under
management agreements cancelable with 90 days notice, and services to other third parties.

   The Manager has a  voluntary  retirement  saving plan  established  in 1983 and amended and  restated  effective
January 1, 1994 (the Plan).  The Plan is qualified in accordance  with Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code
(the Code).  The Manager  contributes an amount equal to 2% of the qualified  wages of all qualified  employees and
matches  employee  contributions  in excess of 2% up to 7% of qualified  wages.  In addition,  the Manager may make
discretionary  contributions  within the limits  prescribed by the Plan and imposed in the Code.  Costs relating to
the Plan were $1.7 million in 2001, $1.9 million in 2000, and $1.6 million in 1999.

                             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

   The  Operating  Partnership  has an  incentive  option plan for  employees  of the  Manager.  Incentive  options
generally  become  exercisable  to the extent of  one-third  of the units on each of the third,  fourth,  and fifth
anniversaries of the date of grant.  Options expire ten years from the date of grant.  The Operating  Partnership's
units issued in  connection  with the incentive  option plan are  exchangeable  for shares of the Company's  common
stock under the Continuing Offer (Note 16).

   In December  2001,  the Company  amended the plan to allow  vested unit  options to be  exercised  by  tendering
mature  units  with a market  value  equal  to the  exercise  price of the unit  options.  In  December  2001,  the
Company's  chief  executive  officer  executed  a  unit  option  deferral  election  with  regard  to  options  for
approximately  three million  units at an exercise  price of $11.14 per unit due to expire in November  2002.  This
election  will allow him to defer the  receipt of the net units he would  receive  upon  exercise.  These  deferred
option units will remain in a deferred  compensation  account until Mr. Taubman's  retirement or ten years from the
date of  exercise.  Beginning  with the ten year  anniversary  of the date of exercise,  the  deferred  partnership
units will be paid in ten annual installments.

   As the Company declares  distributions,  the deferred option units will receive their proportionate share of the
distributions  in the form of cash payments.  The deferred  option units will ultimately be settled by the delivery
of a fixed number of units to the chief executive officer.  The balance in the deferred  compensation  account will
be classified as a component of shareholders' equity in the consolidated balance sheet.

   A summary  of the  status of the plan for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2001 is
presented below:

   Options  outstanding at December 31, 2001 have a remaining  weighted-average  contractual  life of 2.7 years and
range in  exercise  price  from $9.39 to  $13.89.  The  weighted  average  fair  value per unit of options  granted
during 2000 and 1999 was $1.40 and $1.24,  respectively.  There were no options granted in 2001. The Company used a
binomial  option pricing model to determine the grant date fair values based on the following  assumptions for 2000
and 1999,  respectively:  volatility rates of 21.0% and 20.4%,  risk-free rates of return of approximately 6.4% and
5.3%, and dividend yields of approximately 8.6% and 7.8%.

   The Company  applies APB Opinion 25 and related  interpretations  in accounting for the plan. The exercise price
of all options outstanding granted under the plan was equal to market value on the date of grant.  Accordingly,  no
compensation  expense has been recognized for the plan. Had  compensation  cost for the plan been determined  based
on the fair value of the options at the grant  dates,  consistent  with the method of FAS  Statement  123,  the pro
forma effect on the Company's earnings and earnings per share would have been  approximately $0.2 million,  or less
than $0.01 per share in 2001,  approximately $0.2 million,  or less than $0.01 per share in 2000, and approximately
$0.7 million, or $0.01 per share in 1999.

   Currently,  options for 6.2 million Operating Partnership units may be issued under the plan,  substantially all
of which have been issued.  However,  if the holder of an option elects to pay the exercise  price by  surrendering
partnership  units,  only those units issued to the holder in excess of the number of units surrendered are counted
for purposes of determining the remaining number of units available for future grants under the plan.

criteria.

<B>Note 15 - Common and Preferred Stock and Equity of TRG</B>

   The 8.3% Series A Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock  (Series A Preferred  Stock) has no stated  maturity,
sinking  fund,  or mandatory  redemption  and is not  convertible  into any other  securities  of the Company.  The
Series A Preferred  Stock has a liquidation  preference of $200 million ($25 per share).  Dividends are  cumulative
and  accrue at an annual  rate of 8.3% and are  payable  in  arrears  on or  before  the last day of each  calendar
quarter.  All  accrued  dividends  have been paid.  The Series A  Preferred  Stock can be  redeemed  by the Company
beginning  in October 2002 at $25 per share plus any accrued  dividends.  The  redemption  price can be paid solely
out of the sale of capital  stock of the  Company.  The Company  owns a  corresponding  Series A  Preferred  Equity
interest  in the  Operating  Partnership  that  entitles  the Company to income and  distributions  (in the form of
guaranteed payments) in amounts equal to the dividends payable on the Company's Series A Preferred Stock.

   The  Company  is  obligated  to issue  to the  minority  interest,  upon  subscription,  one  share of  Series B
Non-Participating  Convertible  Preferred  Stock (Series B Preferred  Stock) for each of the Operating  Partnership
units held by the  minority  interest.  Each share of Series B Preferred  Stock  entitles the holder to one vote on
all matters submitted to the Company's  shareholders.  The holders of Series B Preferred Stock,  voting as a class,
have the right to designate up to four  nominees  for election as directors of the Company.  On all other  matters,
including the election of directors,  the holders of Series B Preferred  Stock will vote with the holders of common
stock.  The  holders  of Series B  Preferred  Stock are not  entitled  to  dividends  or  earnings.  Under  certain
circumstances,  the Series B  Preferred  Stock is  convertible  into  common  stock at a ratio of 14,000  shares of
Series B Preferred Stock for one share of common stock.

   In September 1999 and November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  completed private  placements of $75 million 9%
Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Partnership  Equity  (Series C Preferred  Equity) and $25 million 9%  Cumulative
Redeemable  Preferred  Partnership Equity (Series D Preferred Equity),  respectively.  Both the Series C and Series
D  Preferred  Equity  were  purchased  by  institutional  investors,  and have a fixed 9%  coupon  rate,  no stated
maturity, sinking fund, or mandatory redemption requirements.

   The holders of Series C Preferred  Equity have the right,  beginning in 2009, to exchange  $37.50 in liquidation
value of such  equity for one share of Series C  Preferred  Stock.  The  holders of the Series D  Preferred  Equity
have the right,  beginning in 2009, to exchange $100 in liquidation  value of such equity for one share of Series D
Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock are  substantially  similar
to those of the Series C Preferred  Equity and Series D Preferred  Equity.  Like the Series A Preferred  Stock, the
Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock are non-voting.

   In March 2000,  the Company's  Board of Directors  authorized the purchase of up to $50 million of the Company's
common stock in the open market.  The stock may be purchased from time to time as market  conditions  warrant.  For
each share of the Company's stock  repurchased,  an equal number of the Company's  Operating  Partnership units are
redeemed.  As of December  31,  2001,  the Company had  purchased,  and the  Operating  Partnership  had  redeemed,
approximately  4.1 million  shares and units for  approximately  $47.1 million.  Existing lines of credit  provided
funding for the purchases.

<B>Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies</B>

   At the time of the Company's  initial public offering (IPO) and  acquisition of its partnership  interest in the
Operating  Partnership,  the Company entered into an agreement (the Cash Tender  Agreement) with A. Alfred Taubman,
who owns an interest in the Operating  Partnership,  whereby he has the annual right to tender to the Company units
of partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership  (provided that the aggregate value is at least $50 million)
and cause the Company to purchase the tendered  interests  at a purchase  price based on a market  valuation of the
Company on the trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender.  The Company  will have the option to
pay for these interests from available  cash,  borrowed funds, or from the proceeds of an offering of the Company's
common  stock.  Generally,  the Company  expects to finance these  purchases  through the sale of new shares of its
stock.  The  tendering  partner  will bear all market risk if the market price at closing is less than the purchase
price and will bear the costs of sale.  Any proceeds of the  offering in excess of the  purchase  price will be for
the sole benefit of the Company.  At A. Alfred  Taubman's  election,  his family and certain others may participate
in tenders.

   Based on a market value at December 31, 2001 of $14.85 per common  share,  the  aggregate  value of interests in
the Operating  Partnership  that may be tendered under the Cash Tender  Agreement was  approximately  $366 million.
The purchase of these  interests at December 31, 2001 would have resulted in the Company  owning an additional  30%
interest in the Operating Partnership.

   The  Company has made a  continuing,  irrevocable  offer to all present  holders  (other than  certain  excluded
holders,  including A. Alfred  Taubman),  assignees of all present  holders,  those future  holders of  partnership
interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  as the  Company  may,  in its sole  discretion,  agree to include in the
continuing  offer,  and all existing and future optionees under the Operating  Partnership's  incentive option plan
to  exchange  shares of common  stock for  partnership  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  (the  Continuing
Offer).  Under the Continuing Offer agreement,  one unit of the Operating  Partnership interest is exchangeable for
one share of the Company's common stock.

   Shares of common stock that were acquired by General  Motors  pension  trusts in connection  with the IPO may be
sold through a registered  offering.  Pursuant to a registration  rights agreement with the Company,  the owners of
these  shares have the annual  right to cause the  Company to register  and  publicly  sell their  shares of common
stock  (provided  that the shares have an  aggregate  value of at least $50  million  and subject to certain  other
restrictions).  All expenses of such a  registration  are to be borne by the Company,  other than the  underwriting
discounts or selling commissions, which will be borne by the exercising party.

   The  Company  is  currently  involved  in  certain  litigation  arising  in the  ordinary  course  of  business.
Management  believes  that this  litigation  will not have a material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  financial
statements.

   Refer to Note 10 for  commitments  relating to certain  investments in technology  businesses.  Refer to Note 11
for the Operating Partnership's guarantees of certain debt.

<B>Note 17 - Earnings Per Share</B>

   Basic  earnings per common share are  calculated by dividing  earnings  available to common  shareowners  by the
average  number of common  shares  outstanding  during each  period.  For diluted  earnings per common  share,  the
Company's  ownership  interest in the Operating  Partnership  (and  therefore  earnings) are adjusted  assuming the
exercise of all options for units of partnership interest under the Operating  Partnership's  incentive option plan
having  exercise  prices less than the average market value of the units using the treasury  stock method.  For the
years ended  December 31, 2001,  2000,  and 1999,  options for 0.6 million,  4.5 million,  and 0.7 million units of
partnership interest with average exercise prices of $13.30, $11.99, and $13.38,  respectively,  were excluded from
the  computation of diluted  earnings per share because the options'  exercise prices were greater than the average
market price for the period calculated.

<B>Note 20 - New Accounting Principle</B>

   In  October 2001, the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  Statement  No. 144, "Accounting  for the
Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", which replaced FASB Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment
of Long-Lived  Assets  and  for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of".  Statement  144  broadens  the  reporting  of
discontinued operations to include disposals of operating  components; each  of  the  Company's  investments in  an
operating  center  is  such  a  component.  The provisions of  Statement 144 are effective for financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning  after  December 15, 2001 and  generally are  to  be applied prospectively.   The
Statement is not expected to have a material effect on the  financial  condition  or  results  of operations of the
Company; however, if the Company were to dispose of a center, the center's  results of  operations would have to be
separately disclosed as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements.

<B>Note 21 - Subsequent Events</B>

   In early 2002, the Operating  Partnership  entered into a definitive  purchase and sale agreement to acquire for
$88 million a 50% general  partnership  interest in SunValley  Associates,  a California  general  partnership that
owns the Sunvalley Shopping Center located in Concord,  California.  The $88 million purchase price consists of $28
million of cash and $60 million of  existing  debt that  encumbers  the  property.  The  Company's  interest in the
secured debt  consists of a $55 million  primary  note  bearing  interest at LIBOR plus 0.92% and a $5 million note
bearing  interest at LIBOR plus 3.0%. The notes mature in September 2003 and have two one-year  extension  options.
The center is also subject to a ground lease that expires in 2061.  The Manager has managed the property  since its
development  and will continue to do so after the  acquisition.  Although the Operating  Partnership  is purchasing
its interest in Sunvalley  from an unrelated  third party,  the other partner is an entity owned and  controlled by
Mr. A. Alfred Taubman, the Company's largest shareholder and recently retired Chairman of the Board of Directors.

   Also in early 2002,  the Company  entered into  agreements  to sell its  interests  in LaCumbre  Plaza and Paseo
Nuevo,  subject to satisfying  closing  conditions,  for $77 million.  The centers are subject to ground leases and
are unencumbered by debt. The centers were purchased in 1996 for $59 million.

   These  transactions  are expected to close during the first half of 2002, and the Company expects to use the net
proceeds from the sale of the two centers to fund the  acquisition of Sunvalley and pay down  borrowings  under the
Company's lines of credit.

    In March 2002,  the Company  entered into a one-year  4.3% swap  agreement  based on a notional  amount of $100
million to begin November 1, 2002, as a hedge of the Company's $275 million line of credit.

                                           INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.

   We have  audited the  accompanying  combined  balance  sheets of  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures of The Taubman
Realty Group Limited  Partnership (the  "Partnership") (a consolidated  subsidiary of Taubman Centers,  Inc.) as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the related  combined  statements of operations,  partnership  equity  (accumulated
deficiency  in assets),  and cash flows for each of the three years in the period  ended  December  31,  2001.  Our
audits  also  included  the  financial  statement  schedules  listed  in the  Index  at Item  14.  These  financial
statements  and  financial  statement  schedules  are  the  responsibility  of the  Partnership's  management.  Our
responsibility  is to express an opinion on the financial  statements and financial  statement  schedules  based on
our audits.

   We conducted  our audits in  accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally  accepted in the United  States of
America.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether
the  financial  statements  are free of  material  misstatement.  An audit  includes  examining,  on a test  basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements.  An audit also includes  assessing
the accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates made by management,  as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

   In our opinion,  such combined  financial  statements  present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the combined
financial  position of  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures of The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited  Partnership  as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000,  and the combined  results of their  operations  and their combined cash flows for each
of the three years in the period  ended  December  31, 2001 in  conformity  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted  in the United  States of  America.  Also,  in our  opinion,  such  financial  statement  schedules,  when
considered  in relation  to the basic  combined  financial  statements  taken as a whole,  present  fairly,  in all
material respects, the information set forth therein.

   As discussed in Note 2 to the combined financial  statements,  in 2001 the Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures of The
Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership  changed their method of accounting for derivative  instruments to conform
to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, as amended and interpreted.

Basis of Presentation

   The Taubman  Realty Group  Limited  Partnership  (TRG),  a  consolidated  subsidiary of Taubman  Centers,  Inc.,
engages in the ownership,  management, leasing, acquisition,  development and expansion of regional retail shopping
centers and interests  therein.  TRG has engaged the Manager (The Taubman Company LLC, which is  approximately  99%
beneficially  owned by TRG) to provide most property  management and leasing  services for the shopping centers and
to provide corporate,  development,  and acquisition  services.  For financial statement  reporting  purposes,  the
accounts of shopping  centers that are not  controlled and that are owned through joint ventures with third parties
(Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures)  have been combined in these  financial  statements.  Generally,  net profits and
losses  of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  are  allocated  to TRG and the  outside  partners  (Joint  Venture
Partners) in accordance with their ownership percentages.

   Dollar  amounts  presented  in tables  within  the notes to the  combined  financial  statements  are  stated in
thousands.

   In September  2001,  International  Plaza, a 1.25 million square foot center,  opened in Tampa,  Florida.  As of
December 31, 2001, TRG has a preferential  investment in International  Plaza of $19.1 million,  on which an annual
preferential return of 8.25% will accrue.

   In March 2001,  Dolphin  Mall,  a 1.3 million  square foot  regional  center,  opened in Miami,  Florida.  As of
December  31,  2001,  TRG has a  preferred  investment  in  Dolphin  Mall of $29.6  million,  on  which  an  annual
preferential return of 16.0% will accrue.

   In addition to the preferred  returns on its  investments  in  International  Plaza and Dolphin  Mall,  TRG will
receive a return of its preferred  investments  before any  available  cash will be utilized for  distributions  to
non-preferred partners.

   In August 2000,  TRG completed a  transaction  to acquire an  additional  interest in one of its  Unconsolidated
Joint  Ventures.  Under the terms of the  agreement,  TRG became  the 100% owner of Twelve  Oaks Mall and its joint
venture  partner  became the 100% owner of  Lakeside,  subject to the existing  mortgage  debt ($50 million and $88
million at Twelve Oaks and Lakeside,  respectively.)  The results of the transferred  centers are included in these
statements  through  the date of the  transaction.  At the date of the  transaction,  the  combined  book values of
these centers' assets and liabilities were $66.6 million and $146.8 million, respectively.

   In April 2000,  TRG entered  into an  agreement  to develop The Mall at Millenia in Orlando,  Florida.  This 1.2
million square foot center is expected to open in October 2002.

Revenue Recognition

   Shopping center space is generally leased to specialty  retail tenants under short and intermediate  term leases
which  are  accounted  for  as  operating  leases.  Minimum  rents  are  recognized  on the  straight-line  method.
Percentage  rent is accrued  when  lessees'  specified  sales  targets  have been met.  Expense  recoveries,  which
include an administrative fee, are recognized as revenue in the period applicable costs are chargeable to tenants.

Depreciation and Amortization

   Buildings,  improvements and equipment,  stated at cost, are depreciated on  straight-line  or  double-declining
balance bases over the estimated  useful lives of the assets that range from 3 to 55 years.  Tenant  allowances and
deferred leasing costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases.

Capitalization

   Costs related to the  acquisition,  development,  construction,  and improvement of properties are  capitalized.
Interest costs are  capitalized  until  construction is  substantially  complete.  All properties,  including those
under  construction or development,  are reviewed for impairment on an individual  basis whenever events or changes
in  circumstances  indicate that their carrying  value may not be  recoverable.  Impairment is recognized  when the
sum of expected  cash flows  (undiscounted  and without  interest  charges) is less than the carrying  value of the
property.  To the extent  impairment  has occurred,  the excess  carrying  value of the property over its estimated
fair value is charged to income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

   Cash  equivalents  consist  of  highly  liquid  investments  with a  maturity  of 90 days or less at the date of
purchase.

Deferred Charges

   Direct  financing  costs are deferred and amortized  over the terms of the related  agreements as a component of
interest  expense.  Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a  straight-line
basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred  charges are amortized on a  straight-line  basis
over the terms of the agreements to which they relate.

Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

   Effective  January 1, 2001, the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  adopted SFAS 133,  "Accounting  for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging  Activities" and its related  amendments and  interpretations,  which establish  accounting
and  reporting  standards for  derivative  instruments  (Note 2). All  derivatives,  whether  designated in hedging
relationships  or not, are recorded on the balance  sheet at fair value.  If a derivative  is  designated as a cash
flow  hedge,  the  effective  portions  of  changes  in the fair  value of the  derivative  are  recorded  in other
comprehensive  income (OCI) and are  recognized  in the income  statement  when the hedged item  affects  earnings.
Ineffective  portions  of changes in the fair value of a cash flow hedge are  recognized  in  earnings  as interest
expense.  For  interest  rate cap  instruments  designated  as cash  flow  hedges,  changes  in the time  value are
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

   TRG formally  documents all  relationships  between  hedging  instruments  and hedged items, as well as its risk
management  objectives  and  strategies  for  undertaking  various hedge  transactions.  TRG assesses,  both at the
inception  of the hedge and on an ongoing  basis,  whether the  derivatives  are used in hedging  transactions  are
highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged items.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

   The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments:

      The  carrying  value of cash and cash  equivalents,  accounts  and notes  receivable,  and  accounts  payable
      approximates fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.

      The fair value of mortgage  notes and other  notes  payable is  estimated  based on quoted  market  prices if
         available,  or the  amount  the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  would pay to  terminate  the debt,  with
         prepayment penalties, if any, on the reporting date.

      The fair value of interest  rate hedging  instruments  is the amount the  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture would
         pay or receive to terminate the agreement at the reporting date.

Use of Estimates

   The  preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with accounting  principles  generally  accepted in the
United States of America  requires  management to make estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts
of  assets  and  liabilities,  disclosure  of  contingent  assets  and  liabilities  at the  date of the  financial
statements,  and the reported  amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting  period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

<B>Note 2 - Change in Accounting Principle</B>

   The  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  use  derivative  instruments  to manage  exposure to  interest  rate risks
inherent in variable rate debt and  refinancings.  Cap,  swap,  and treasury lock  agreements are routinely used to
meet these  objectives.  The swap  agreement  on the  Dolphin  construction  facility  does not  qualify  for hedge
accounting  although its use is  consistent  with overall risk  management  objectives.  As a result,  Dolphin Mall
recognizes  its share of losses and income  related to this  agreement  in earnings  as the value of the  agreement
changes.

   The initial  adoption of SFAS 133 on January 1, 2001  resulted in a reduction  to income of  approximately  $3.3
million as the cumulative  effect of a change in accounting  principle and a reduction to  accumulated  OCI of $1.6
million.  These amounts  represent the transition  adjustments  necessary to mark interest rate  agreements to fair
value as of January 1, 2001.

   In addition to the transition  adjustments,  unrealized losses of $5.9 million were recognized as a reduction of
earnings  during  the year ended  December  31,  2001,  primarily  due to the  decline  in  interest  rates and the
resulting  decrease in value of interest rate agreements.  Of this amount,  approximately  $5.6 million  represents
the change in value of the Dolphin swap  agreement  and the remainder  represents  the changes in time value of cap
instruments.

   As of December 31,  2001,  $0.7  million of  derivative  losses are  included in  Accumulated  OCI.  This amount
relates to a hedge of the Dolphin Mall  construction  facility  that will be  recognized as a reduction of earnings
through its 2002 maturity date.

   Mortgage  debt is  collateralized  by  properties  with a net book value of $1.1  billion and $0.9 billion as of
December 31, 2001 and 2000.

   The maximum  availability on The Mall at Millenia  construction  facility is $160.4 million.  TRG has guaranteed
the payment of 50% of the principal and interest.  The rate and the amount  guaranteed  may be reduced once certain
performance and valuation criteria are met.  The loan provides for two one-year extension options.

   The maximum  availability  on the Dolphin Mall  construction  facility is $200 million and its rate decreases to
LIBOR plus 1.75% when a certain  coverage ratio is met. TRG has  guaranteed  the payment of 50% of any  outstanding
principal  balance  and  100% of all  accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  The  guaranty  will be  reduced  as  certain
performance conditions are met. The maturity date may be extended one year.

   The maximum  availability on the International  Plaza  construction  facility is $193.5 million.  The loan has a
one-year  extension  option.  TRG has guaranteed the payment 100% of the principal and interest;  however,  another
investor in the venture has  indemnified  TRG to the extent of 25% of the amounts  guaranteed.  The loan  agreement
provides for  reductions of the rate and the amount  guaranteed  as certain  center  performance  criteria are met.
This guarantee was reduced to 50% in February 2002.

   The Stamford  mortgage may be extended  twice to August 2004.  The Westfarms  mortgages due in 2002 are expected
to be refinanced at maturity.

   Certain  debt  agreements  contain  performance  and  valuation  criteria  that  must be met for the loans to be
extended at the full principal  amounts;  these  agreements  provide for partial  prepayments of debt to facilitate
compliance with extension provisions.

   Scheduled principal payments on mortgage debt are as follows as of December 31, 2000:

<B>Note 6 - Leases and Other Commitments</B>

   Shopping  center space is leased to tenants and certain  anchors  pursuant to lease  agreements.  Tenant  leases
typically  provide for  guaranteed  minimum rent,  percentage  rent,  and other charges to cover certain  operating
costs.  Future minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 2001 for operating  centers,  assuming
no new or renegotiated leases or option extensions on anchor agreements, is summarized as follows:

                                 2002                  $      161,398

   One  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture,  as lessee,  has a ground  lease  expiring  in 2083 with its Joint  Venture
Partner.  Rental  payments  under the lease were $2.0  million in 2001,  2000 and 1999.  TRG is entitled to receive
preferential  distributions  equal to 75% of each payment.  Approximately 25% of the ground lease payments over the
term of the lease,  on a  straight-line  basis,  are  recognized  as ground rent  expense,  with 75% of the current
payment accounted for as a distribution to the Joint Venture Partner.

   The  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture that owns  International  Plaza is the lessee under a ground lease  agreement
that expires in 2080. The lease  requires  annual  payments of  approximately  $0.1 million and additional  rentals
based on the  leasable  area of the center as defined in the  agreement;  such  additional  rentals were $49,000 in
2001.

   The following is a schedule of future minimum rental payments required under operating leases:

Special Tax Assessment

   Dolphin Mall is  subject to annual special tax assessments for certain  infrastructure  improvements  related to
the property.  The annual  assessments will be based on allocations of the cost of the  infrastructure  between the
properties  that  benefit.   Presently,  the  total  allocation  of  cost  to  Dolphin  Mall  is  estimated  to  be
approximately  $65.3 million with  a  first annual  assessment of  approximately  $2.4 million.  A portion of these
assessments is expected to be recovered from tenants.

   Certain  entities   related   to  TRG or  its   joint   venture  partners  provided  management,   leasing   and
development  services to Arizona Mills,  L.L.C., Dolphin Mall  Associates Limited  Partnership, and  Forbes Taubman
Orlando L.L.C.  Charges from these entities were $5.6 million, $4.0 million,  and  $4.2 million in 2001,  2000, and
1999, respectively.

   Westfarms  previously  loaned  $2.4  million to one of its Joint  Venture  Partners  to  purchase a portion of a
deceased  Joint Venture  Partner's  interest.  The note bore interest at  approximately  7.9% and required  monthly
principal  payments of $25  thousand,  plus accrued  interest.  The balance was paid off in 2001.  Interest  income
related to the loan was approximately $0.1 million in 2000 and 1999.

   Another related party transaction is described in Note  5.

<B>Note 8 - New Accounting Principle</B>

   In October  2001,  the Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement  No. 144,  "Accounting  for the
Impairment  or Disposal of  Long-Lived  Assets",  which  replaced  FASB  Statement  No.  121,  "Accounting  for the
Impairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets and for  Long-Lived  Assets to Be  Disposed  Of."  Statement  144  broadens  the
reporting of discontinued  operations to include  disposals of operating  components;  each of TRG's investments in
an operating  center is such a component.  The  provisions of Statement 144 are effective for financial  statements
issued for fiscal years  beginning  after  December 15, 2001 and  generally  are to be applied  prospectively.  The
Statement is not expected to have a material  effect on the  financial  condition or results of  operations  of the
Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures;  however,  if TRG were to dispose of a center,  the center's  results of operations
would have to be separately disclosed as discontinued operations in the financial statements.

     SECTION  2.01.  <U>The  Loans</U>.  Subject  to the terms and  conditions  of this
Agreement,  each of the Banks severally  agrees to make a loan to Borrower (each
such loan by a Bank, a "Loan"; such loans,  collectively,  the "Loans") pursuant
to which each Bank shall from

                                       16

time to time advance and re-advance to Borrower an amount equal to the excess of
the  amount of such  Bank's  Loan  Commitment  over the  amount of all  previous
advances made by such Bank under its Loan  Commitment  which remain unpaid.  For
purposes of the immediately  preceding sentence,  a Bank's Pro Rata Share of the
amount of outstanding  Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be advanced.  Within
the limits set forth  herein,  Borrower  may borrow from time to time under this
Section  2.01 and prepay from time to time  pursuant to Section  2.10  (subject,
however,  to the  restrictions  on  prepayment  set forth in such  Section)  and
thereafter re-borrow pursuant to this Section 2.01.

     The Loans may be outstanding as (1) Base Rate Loans, (2) LIBOR Loans or (3)
a  combination   of  the   foregoing,   as  Borrower   shall  elect  and  notify
Administrative  Agent in accordance  with Section 2.15.  The LIBOR Loan and Base
Rate Loan of each Bank shall be  maintained  at such Bank's  Applicable  Lending
Office for its LIBOR Loan and Base Rate Loan, respectively.

     The obligations of the Banks under this Agreement are several,  and no Bank
shall be responsible  for the failure of any other Bank to make any advance of a
Loan to be made by such other Bank. However, the failure of any Bank to make any
advance of the Loan to be made by it  hereunder on the date  specified  therefor
shall not  relieve any other Bank of its  obligation  to make any advance of its
Loan specified hereby to be made on such date.

     SECTION  2.02.  <U>Purpose</U>.  Borrower  shall use the proceeds of the Loans for
general  partnership  purposes of Borrower and its  Consolidated  Businesses and
UJVs,  including costs incurred in connection with acquisitions.  All or part of
the Initial  Advance  shall be used to repay all sums owing  under the  Existing
Credit  Facility and to  refinance  the  existing  indebtedness  relating to the
Properties.  In no event  shall  proceeds  of the Loans be used for any  illegal
purpose or for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental or ultimate, of buying
or carrying "margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U.

     SECTION 2.03. <U>Advances,  Generally</U>.  The Initial Advance shall be made upon
satisfaction  of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01.  Subsequent  advances
shall be made no more frequently than weekly upon satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Section 4.02. The amount of each advance  subsequent to the Initial
Advance  shall  be in  the  minimum  amount  of  $2,000,000  (unless  less  than
$2,000,000  is available  for  disbursement  pursuant to the terms hereof at the
time of any  subsequent  advance,  in which case the  amount of such  subsequent
advance shall be equal to such remaining availability) and in integral multiples
of $100,000 above such amount.

     SECTION  2.04.   <U>Procedures   for  Advances</U>.   Borrower   shall  submit  to
Administrative  Agent a  request  for  each  advance  hereunder,  in the form of
EXHIBIT G, stating the amount  requested  and  certifying  the purpose for which
such advance is to be used, no later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago  time) on the date
(x) in the case of LIBOR Loans,  three (3) Banking Days,  and (y) in the case of
Base Rate  Loans,  one (1)  Banking  Day prior to the date the  advance is to be
made.  Administrative  Agent,  upon its  receipt and  approval of the  requisite
documents  for the  advance,  will so notify the Banks either by telephone or by
facsimile. Not later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) on the date of each advance,
each Bank  shall,  through  its  Applicable  Lending  Office and  subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, make the amount to be advanced

                                       17

by it on such day available to Administrative  Agent, at Administrative  Agent's
Office and in  immediately  available  funds for the  account of  Borrower.  The
amount so received by Administrative  Agent shall,  subject to the conditions of
this Agreement,  be made available to Borrower,  in immediately available funds,
by Administrative Agent's either, at Borrower's option,  crediting an account of
Borrower  designated by Borrower and  maintained  with  Administrative  Agent at
Administrative  Agent's  Office or wiring  said  amount to  another  account  of
Borrower designated by it in its request for advance.

     SECTION 2.05. <U>Additional Conditions to Advances</U>.  Each advance of the Loans
shall be subject,  in addition to the other limitations and conditions set forth
herein, to, at Administrative Agent's request, Administrative Agent's receipt of
a certificate,  of the sort required by paragraph  (3)(b) of Section 6.09, which
shall  demonstrate  Borrower's  compliance,  as of the end of the most  recently
ended calendar  quarter for which  financial  results are required  hereunder to
have been  reported by Borrower (and taking into account  pro-forma  adjustments
for all  acquisitions  and  Dispositions  subsequent  to the end of such quarter
required to be reported  pursuant to paragraph  (6) of Section  6.09),  with all
covenants  enumerated in said  paragraph  (3)(b),  assuming that the amount that
will be outstanding  under the Loans following the making of the advance that is
being  requested  was  outstanding  as of the end of such  most  recently  ended
calendar quarter.

     For purposes of the definition of "Applicable  Margin" in Section 1.01, the
Property Debt Yield shall be adjusted in accordance with the foregoing  covenant
compliance  calculations  as of the date of each  advance  of the Loans and upon
each acquisition and Disposition  required to be reported  pursuant to paragraph
(6) of Section 6.09.

     SECTION 2.06. <U>Interest Periods;  Renewals</U>.  In the case of the LIBOR Loans,
Borrower shall select an Interest  Period of any duration in accordance with the
definition  of  Interest  Period  in  Section  1.01,  subject  to the  following
limitations:  (1) no Interest Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date, (2) if
an Interest  Period would end on a day which is not a Banking Day, such Interest
Period shall be extended to the next Banking Day,  unless such Banking Day would
fall in the next calendar  month,  in which event such Interest Period shall end
on the immediately preceding Banking Day and (3) only five (5) discrete segments
of a Bank's Loan bearing  interest at a LIBOR  Interest  Rate,  for a designated
Interest Period, pursuant to a particular Election,  Conversion or Continuation,
may be  outstanding  at any one time (each  such  segment  of each  Bank's  Loan
corresponding to a proportionate segment of each of the other Banks' Loans).

     Upon notice to Administrative  Agent as provided in Section 2.15,  Borrower
may Continue  any LIBOR Loan on the last day of the Interest  Period of the same
or different  duration in accordance  with the  limitations  provided  above. If
Borrower  shall  fail  to  give  notice  to  Administrative   Agent  of  such  a
Continuation, such LIBOR Loan shall automatically become a Base Rate Loan on the
last day of the current Interest Period.

     SECTION 2.07. <U>Interest</U>. Borrower shall pay interest to Administrative Agent
for the account of the applicable Bank on the  outstanding and unpaid  principal
amount of the Loans, at a rate per annum as follows:  (1) for Base Rate Loans at
a rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin and (2) for LIBOR Loans
at a rate equal to the applicable

                                       18

LIBOR Interest Rate plus the Applicable Margin. In addition,  from and after the
occurrence of an Event of Default,  the outstanding and unpaid  principal amount
of the Loans shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

     The interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall change, without notice or demand
of any kind,  effective  as of the day when the Base Rate  changes.  Interest on
Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans shall not exceed the  maximum  amount  permitted
under applicable law. Interest shall be calculated for the actual number of days
elapsed on the basis of, in the case of Base Rate Loans and LIBOR  Loans,  three
hundred sixty (360) days.

     Accrued  interest shall be due and payable in arrears upon and with respect
to any payment or  prepayment  of principal and on the first Banking Day of each
calendar month;  provided,  however,  that interest accruing at
the Default Rate shall be due and payable on demand.

     SECTION 2.08.  <U>Fees</U>. (a) Borrower shall,  during the term of the Loans, pay
to  Administrative  Agent  for the  account  of each  Bank a  facility  fee (the
"Facility Fee") computed on the daily Loan Commitment of such Bank (irrespective
of usage), at a rate per annum equal to 0.15%, calculated on the basis of a year
of three hundred  sixty (360) days for the actual  number of days  elapsed.  The
accrued facility fee shall be due and payable  quarterly in arrears on the first
Banking Day of February,  May,  August and November of each year,  commencing on
the first such date  after the  Closing  Date,  and upon the  Maturity  Date (as
stated,  by  acceleration  or  otherwise)  or  earlier  termination  of the Loan
Commitments.

     (b) Borrower  shall pay to  Administrative  Agent,  for the accounts of the
parties specified therein, the fees provided for, on the dates specified, in the
Supplemental Fee Letter.

     SECTION 2.09.  <U>Notes</U>. The Loan made by each Bank under this Agreement shall
be evidenced by, and repaid with interest in accordance  with, a promissory note
of Borrower in the form of EXHIBIT C duly completed and executed by Borrower, in
a principal  amount equal to such Bank's Loan  Commitment,  payable to such Bank
for the account of its  Applicable  Lending  Office (each such note, as the same
may hereafter be amended, modified,  extended,  severed, assigned,  substituted,
renewed or restated from time to time, including any substitute note(s) pursuant
to Section 2.19,  3.07 or 12.05,  a "Note";  all such notes,  collectively,  the
"Notes").  The Notes shall  mature,  and all  outstanding  principal and accrued
interest and other sums thereunder  shall be paid in full, on the Maturity Date,
as the same may be accelerated.

     Each Bank is hereby  authorized  by  Borrower  to endorse  on the  schedule
attached to the Notes held by it, the amount of each  advance,  and each payment
of  principal  received by such Bank for the account of its  Applicable  Lending
Office(s) on account of its Loan,  which  endorsement  shall,  in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive as to the outstanding  balance of the Loan made by
such Bank.  The failure by any Bank to make such  notations  with respect to its
Loan or each  advance  or  payment  shall  not  limit or  otherwise  affect  the
obligations of Borrower under this Agreement,  the Notes or otherwise in respect
of the Loans.

     In case of any loss,  theft,  destruction or mutilation of any Bank's Note,
Borrower  shall,  upon its receipt of an affidavit of an officer of such Bank as
to  such  loss,   theft,   destruction

                                       19

or  mutilation  and  an  appropriate  indemnification  (in  form  and  substance

Commitments,  in whole or in part, from time to time, provided that (1) Borrower
shall give notice of each such termination to Administrative  Agent,  specifying
the amount of the  termination,  no later then 10:00 a.m.  (Chicago time) on the
date which is fifteen (15) days prior to the  effectiveness  of such termination
(a copy of which notice  Administrative Agent shall promptly send to each Bank),
(2) the Loan  Commitments  of each of the Banks must be  terminated  ratably and
simultaneously with those of the other Banks and (3) each partial termination of
the Loan Commitments as a whole (and  corresponding  reduction of the Total Loan
Commitment) shall be in an integral multiple of $1,000,000.

     (b) The Loan Commitments, to the extent terminated, may not be reinstated.

     SECTION  2.12. <U> Method of Payment</U>.  Borrower  shall make each payment under
this  Agreement and under the Notes not later than 11:00 a.m.  (Chicago time) on
the date when due in Dollars to Administrative  Agent at Administrative  Agent's

the day of its receipt of each such  payment,  cause to be  distributed  to each
Bank (1) such Bank's  appropriate  share (based upon the respective  outstanding
principal  amounts and rate(s) of interest  under the Notes of the Banks) of the
payments of principal  and interest in like funds for the account of such Bank's
Applicable  Lending Office and (2) fees payable to such Bank in accordance  with
the terms of this Agreement.  In the event payments  received by  Administrative
Agent from Borrower  before 11:00 a.m.  (Chicago  time) are not  distributed  by
Administrative Agent to a Bank on the day of its receipt thereof, Administrative
Agent shall pay interest on such Bank's appropriate share thereof at the Federal
Funds  Rate  until   distributed  to  such  Bank.   Borrower  hereby  authorizes
Administrative  Agent and the Banks, if and to the extent payment by Borrower is
not made when due under this  Agreement or under the Notes,  to charge from time
to time against any account Borrower maintains with Administrative  Agent or any
Bank any amount so due to Administrative Agent and/or the Banks.

     Except to the extent otherwise provided herein,  whenever any payment to be
made  under  this  Agreement  or under the Notes is due on any day other  than a
Banking Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding  Banking Day, and
such extension of time shall in such case be included in the  computation of the
payment of interest and other fees, as the case may be.

                                       21

     SECTION  2.17.  <U>Letters of Credit</U>.  (a) Borrower  may  request,  in lieu of
advances   of   proceeds  of  the  Loans,   that   Administrative   Agent  issue
unconditional,  irrevocable  standby  letters  of credit  (each,  a  "Letter  of
Credit")  for the  account  of  Borrower,  payable  by  sight  drafts,  for such
beneficiaries and with such other terms as Borrower shall specify.

     (b) The amount of any  Letter of Credit  shall not exceed the lesser of (1)
$50,000,000  less the  amount of all other  Letters  of Credit  then  issued and
outstanding or (2) the amount available for disbursement to Borrower  hereunder,
it being  understood  that the  amount  of each  Letter  of  Credit  issued  and
outstanding  shall  effect  a  reduction,  by an  equal  amount,  of the  amount
available for disbursement hereunder as provided in Section 2.01.

     (c) The amount of each  Letter of Credit  shall be  further  subject to the
limitations  applicable to amounts of advances set forth in Section 2.03 and the
procedures  for the  issuance of each Letter of Credit  shall be the same as the
procedures  applicable  to the  making  of  advances  as set  forth in the first
sentence of Section 2.04. Upon  Administrative  Agent's receipt of a request for
the  issuance  of, and upon its  issuance  of, each  Letter of Credit,  it shall
promptly notify each of the Banks.

     (d)  Administrative  Agent's  issuance  of each  Letter of Credit  shall be
subject  to  Borrower's   satisfaction  of  all  conditions   precedent  to  its
entitlement to an advance of proceeds of the Loans.

     (e) Each Letter of Credit  shall have an  expiration  date of no later than
the  earlier of one (1) month prior to the  Maturity  Date or one (1) year after
the date of its issuance.

     (f) In connection with, and as a further condition to the issuance of, each
Letter of Credit,  Borrower shall execute and deliver to Administrative Agent an
application  for the Letter of Credit on  Administrative  Agent's  standard form
therefor,  together  with such  other  documents,  opinions  and  assurances  as
Administrative Agent shall reasonably require.

     (g) In connection with each Letter of Credit,  Borrower hereby covenants to
pay to  Administrative  Agent the  following  fees,  each  payable  quarterly in
arrears  (on the  first  Banking  Day of each  calendar  quarter  following  the
issuance  of the  Letter of  Credit):  (i) a fee for the  account  of the Banks,
computed daily on the amount of the Letter of Credit issued and outstanding at a
rate per annum equal to the "Banks' L/C Fee Rate" (as  hereinafter  defined) and
(ii) a fee for Administrative Agent's own account,  computed daily on the amount
of the Letter of Credit  issued and  outstanding  at a rate per annum of 0.125%.
For  purposes of this  Agreement,  the "Banks' L/C Fee Rate" shall mean,  at any
time, a rate per annum equal to the  Applicable  Margin for LIBOR  Loans.  It is
understood and agreed that the last installment of the fees provided for in this
paragraph (g) with respect to any  particular  Letter of Credit shall be due and
payable on the first day of the calendar quarter following the return,  undrawn,
or  cancellation  of such  Letter of Credit.  In  addition,  Borrower  shall pay
Administrative Agent's customary  administrative fees and expenses in connection
with the issuance, extension, amendment, drawing and cancellation of all Letters
of Credit.

     (h) Immediately upon notice from Administrative  Agent of any drawing under
a Letter of Credit, each Bank shall,  notwithstanding the existence of a Default
or Event of

                                       22

Default or the  non-satisfaction of any conditions precedent to the making of an
advance of the Loans,  advance  proceeds of its Loan,  in an amount equal to its
Pro Rata Share of such drawing,  which  advance shall be made to  Administrative
Agent to reimburse  Administrative Agent, for its own account, for such drawing.
Each Bank further acknowledges that its obligation to fund its Pro Rata Share of
drawings  under  Letters  of  Credit  as  aforesaid  shall  survive  the  Banks'
termination of this Agreement or enforcement of remedies  hereunder or under the
other Loan  Documents.  In the event that any Loan cannot for any reason be made
on the date otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result
of  the  commencement  of  a  proceeding  under  any  applicable  bankruptcy  or
insolvency Law with respect to Borrower or any Mortgagor),  then each Bank shall
purchase  (on or as of the date such Loan would  otherwise  have been made) from
Administrative Agent a participation  interest in any unreimbursed drawing in an
amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of such unreimbursed drawing.

     (i)  Upon the  occurrence  of an Event of  Default  and at the  request  of
Administrative  Agent, Borrower shall (i) deposit with Administrative Agent cash
collateral in the amount of all the  outstanding  Letters of Credit,  which cash
collateral  shall be held by  Administrative  Agent as security  for  Borrower's
obligations  in  connection  with the  Letters  of Credit and (ii)  execute  and
deliver to Administrative  Agent such documents as Administrative Agent requests
to confirm and perfect the assignment of such cash collateral to  Administrative
Agent.

     The parties  hereto  acknowledge  that letter of credit no.  7405743 in the
amount of $3,508,171 issued by Bank of America, N.A., for Borrower's account, to
US Bank  Trust  National  Association  on  September  14,  2001,  as  amended by
amendment  dated  November  2,  2001,  constitutes  a Letter of  Credit  for all
purposes under this Agreement.

     SECTION 2.18.  <U>Extension Of Maturity</U>.  Borrower  shall have the option (the
"Extension Option") to extend the original Maturity Date for a period of one (1)
year.  Subject to the  conditions  set forth  below,  Borrower  may exercise the
Extension Option by delivering a notice to  Administrative  Agent between thirty
(30) and ninety  (90) days  prior to the  original  Maturity  Date (a "Notice to
Extend"), stating that Borrower has elected to extend the original Maturity Date
for one (1) year.  Borrower's  right to exercise the  Extension  Option shall be
subject to the following terms and conditions: (i) there shall exist no Event of
Default  on  both  the  date   Borrower   delivers   the  Notice  to  Extend  to
Administrative Agent and on the original Maturity Date, (ii) Borrower shall have
paid, no later than one (1) Banking Day prior to the original  Maturity Date, to
Administrative  Agent, for the account of each Bank, a non-refundable  extension
fee equal to 0.20% of such Bank's Loan  Commitment,  (iii)  Borrower shall be in
compliance  with the covenants  contained in Articles VII and VIII, as evidenced
by a certificate  from Borrower of the sort required by paragraph (3) of Section
6.09 (based on financial  results for the most recent calendar quarter for which
Borrower  is  required  to report  financial  results)  and (iv) the Total  Loan
Commitment does not exceed 65% of the "as is" value of the relevant  Mortgagor's
interest in the Property or Properties  then securing the Loans (as reflected in
an update to the  appraisal(s)  delivered  pursuant to paragraph  (7) of Section
4.01 or subparagraph (b)(vi) of Section 12.06, as the case may be, which updated
appraisal(s) shall be commissioned by Administrative Agent at Borrower's expense
and shall be  satisfactory  to the Required  Banks),  it being  understood  that
Borrower  may  comply  with  the  condition  set  forth in this  clause  (iv) by
exercising its right to terminate  unused Loan  Commitments  in accordance  with
Section 2.11.

                                       23

     SECTION 2.19.  <U>Additional  Loan  Commitments</U>.  (a) At any time prior to the
second anniversary of the date of this Agreement,  Borrower may request that (i)
the Banks increase their  respective Loan  Commitments  and/or (ii) New Banks be
procured,  so as to increase the Total Loan Commitment by an aggregate amount of
up to $25,000,000  (the  "Accordion  Amount"),  all as provided in this Section.
Such  increase  shall be  conditioned  on  Borrower's  addition of a Property as
security for the payment and  performance of the  Obligations in accordance with
Section   12.06.   Borrower   shall  make  such  request  by  giving  notice  to
Administrative  Agent,  which notice shall  identify the property  that Borrower
proposes to add as a Property and shall be  accompanied  by such  documents  and
information  with  respect  to  such  property  as  Administrative  Agent  shall
reasonably request. Upon receipt of such notice,  documents and information from
Borrower,  Administrative  Agent  shall  promptly  send  copies  thereof to each
then-existing  Bank (each, an "Existing  Bank") and shall request that each Bank
notify  Administrative  Agent as to  whether  or not it agrees  to  accept  such
property  (the  "Property  Approval  Request")  and  whether or not it agrees to
increase its Loan Commitment by its Pro Rata Share of the Accordion  Amount upon
the addition of such  property as a Property in  accordance  with Section  12.06
(the "Commitment  Increase  Request").  Each Bank shall have a period of fifteen
(15)  business  days from its receipt of the Property  Approval  Request and the
Commitment Increase Request to notify  Administrative  Agent whether or not such
Bank agrees to (i) accept the proposed  property  and/or (ii)  increase its Loan
Commitment as aforesaid. Any Bank that fails to respond to the Property Approval
Request or the Commitment Increase Request within such fifteen (15)-business day
period will be deemed not to have agreed to accept the proposed  property or not
to have agreed to  increase  its Loan  Commitment,  as the case may be. Upon its
receipt  of such  notices  from  all of the  Banks,  and in any  event  upon the
expiration of such fifteen  (15)-business day period,  Administrative Agent will
notify (the "Bank Response Notice") Borrower and the Banks as to (x) which Banks
have  approved  and which  Banks  have not  approved  (or are deemed not to have
approved)  the  proposed  property  and (y) which  Banks have agreed to increase
their  respective Loan  Commitments as aforesaid and which Banks have not agreed
(or are deemed not to have agreed) to increase their respective Loan Commitments
as aforesaid.

          (A) If any Bank (each, a "Disapproving Bank") shall not agree or shall
     be deemed not to have agreed to accept the proposed property, such property
     will not be added as a Property and the proposed increase in the Total Loan
     Commitment will not be consummated,  subject,  however, to Borrower's right
     to substitute  another  financial  institution  for a Disapproving  Bank in
     accordance with the provisions of paragraph (d) below.

          (B) If all Banks agree to accept the  proposed  property and all Banks
     elect to increase  their  respective  Loan  Commitments by amounts equal to
     their  respective  Pro  Rata  Shares  of the  Accordion  Amount,  the  Loan
     Commitment of each Bank will be so increased, and the parties shall proceed
     in accordance with paragraph (b) below.

          (C) If all Banks agree to accept the proposed  property,  but any Bank
     (any such Bank, a  "Declining  Bank") shall not elect or shall be deemed to
     have  elected not to increase its Loan  Commitment  as  aforesaid,  (i) the
     amount of such Declining Bank's Loan Commitment shall be unchanged and (ii)
     Borrower  shall,  at its  option  (to be

                                       24

     promptly  exercised by notice to Administrative  Agent) either (x) withdraw
     its request to add a property and increase  the Total Loan  Commitment,  in
     which  case  the  increase  to  the  Total  Loan  Commitment  will  not  be
     consummated,  (y) accept an  increase  in the Total Loan  Commitment  in an
     amount equal to the Accordion Amount less the Shortfall (as defined below),
     in which case the Banks who agreed to increase their  commitments  shall do
     so and the parties shall proceed in accordance  with paragraph (b) below or
     (z)  request  that  Administrative  Agent (1)  solicit  from the Banks that
     elected to increase their respective Loan Commitments a further increase in
     their Loan  Commitments in an aggregate  amount equal to all or any portion
     of the  aggregate  amount of the  Declining  Banks' Pro Rata  Shares of the
     requested  increase (the "Shortfall")  and/or (2) submit to Borrower a list
     of proposed  syndicate  members that are not then a party to this Agreement
     ("New Banks") to Borrower for its review and approval (such approval not to
     be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed)  in  order  to  obtain  additional
     commitments in an amount equal to the Shortfall.  Administrative Agent will
     promptly  undertake the action directed by Borrower.  Administrative  Agent
     will consult with Borrower and Borrower will cooperate with  Administrative
     Agent in the latter's  solicitation of Loan  Commitments from New Banks. If
     any of the Existing Banks agrees to increase its Loan Commitment and/or New
     Banks  agree to make Loan  Commitments,  then the parties  will  proceed in
     accordance with paragraph (b) below.

     (b) In connection with increases to the Loan  Commitments of some or all of
the Existing  Banks as provided in paragraph (a) above,  Borrower  shall execute
supplemental  Notes (the "Supplemental  Notes")  evidencing such increases,  and
Borrower,   Administrative   Agent  and  the  Banks  shall  execute  such  other
confirmatory  modifications  to this  Agreement  as  Administrative  Agent shall
reasonably  request.  In connection with the addition of New Banks as Banks as a
result of  solicitations  by  Administrative  Agent as provided in paragraph (a)
above,  Borrower,  Administrative  Agent  and  each New Bank  shall  execute  an
Acceptance  Letter in the form of EXHIBIT H (an "Acceptance  Letter"),  Borrower
shall  execute  a Note to each New Bank in the  amount  of the New  Bank's  Loan
Commitment (a "New Note") and Borrower, Administrative Agent and the Banks shall
execute such  confirmatory  modifications  to this  Agreement as  Administrative
Agent shall reasonably  request,  whereupon the New Bank shall become,  and have
the rights and  obligations  of, a "Bank",  with a Loan Commitment in the amount
set forth in such Acceptance  Letter.  The Banks shall have no right of approval
with  respect  to a New  Bank's  becoming  a Bank  or  the  amount  of its  Loan
Commitment.  Each  Supplemental  Note and New Note shall constitute a "Note" for
all purposes of this Agreement.

     (c) If at the time a New Bank becomes a Bank (or an Existing Bank increases
its Loan Commitment) pursuant to this Section there is any principal outstanding
under  the  Notes  of the  Existing  Banks,  such New  Bank  (or  Existing  Bank
increasing its Loan Commitment)  shall remit to  Administrative  Agent an amount
equal to the  Outstanding  Percentage (as defined below)  multiplied by the Loan
Commitment of the New Bank (or the amount of the increase in the Loan Commitment
of an Existing  Bank  increasing  its Loan  Commitment),  which  amount shall be
deemed  advanced under the Loan of the New Bank (or the Existing Bank increasing
its Loan Commitment). Administrative Agent shall pay such amount to the Existing
Banks in  accordance  with the Existing  Banks'  respective  Pro Rata Shares (as
calculated  immediately  prior to the admission of the New Bank (or the increase
in an Existing  Bank's  Loan  Commitment)),  and such

                                       25

payment shall effect an automatic reduction of the outstanding principal balance
under the respective  Notes of the Existing Banks. For purposes of this Section,
the  term  "Outstanding  Percentage"  means  the  ratio  of  (i)  the  aggregate
outstanding principal amount under the Notes of the Existing Banks,  immediately
prior to the  admission of the New Bank (or the increase in the Loan  Commitment
of an Existing  Bank),  to (ii) the  aggregate  of the Loan  Commitments  of the
Existing Banks (as increased  pursuant to this Section,  if applicable)  and the
New Bank.

     (d) In the event there is only one Disapproving Bank,  Borrower may, within
thirty (30) days of its receipt of the Bank Response Notice from  Administrative
Agent, give notice (a "Substitution  Notice") to Administrative  Agent (who will
promptly forward a copy thereof to each Bank) of Borrower's intention to replace
the Disapproving Bank with another  financial  institution that would accept the
proposed  property as a Property  (the  "Substitute  Bank")  designated  in such
Substitution Notice.

     If Administrative  Agent shall,  within ten (10) days of its receipt of the
Substitution Notice,  notify Borrower and each Bank in writing that the proposed
Substitute Bank is reasonably  satisfactory to  Administrative  Agent,  then the
Disapproving  Bank shall, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist,
assign its Note and all of its rights and  obligations  under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents to the Substitute  Bank, and the Substitute  Bank shall
assume  all  of  such  rights  and   obligations,   pursuant  to  an  agreement,
substantially in the form of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, executed by
the  Disapproving  Bank  and  the  Substitute  Bank.  In  connection  with  such
assignment and  assumption,  the Substitute  Bank shall pay to the  Disapproving
Bank an amount equal to the outstanding  principal amount under the Disapproving
Bank's Note and all interest  accrued thereon,  plus all other amounts,  if any,
then due and payable to the  Disapproving  Bank. Upon the effective date of such
assignment  and   assumption   and  the  payment  by  the  Substitute   Bank  to
Administrative  Agent of a fee, for Administrative  Agent's own account,  in the
amount  of  $3,500,  the  Substitute  Bank  shall  become  a Bank  Party to this
Agreement and shall have all the rights and  obligations  of a Bank as set forth
in such Assignment and Assumption Agreement,  and the Disapproving Bank shall be
released from its obligations hereunder, and no further consent or action by any
party shall be required.  Upon the  consummation  of any assignment  pursuant to
this  Section,  a  substitute  Note  shall be issued to the  Substitute  Bank by
Borrower  in  exchange  for the  return of the  Disapproving  Bank's  Note.  The
obligations evidenced by such substitute Note shall constitute "Obligations" for
all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall be secured
by the Mortgages.  In connection  with  Borrower's  execution of such substitute
Note as aforesaid,  Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent such evidence
of the due authorization,  execution and delivery of the substitute Note and any
related  documents  as  Administrative  Agent  may  reasonably  request.  If the
Substitute  Bank is not  incorporated  under the Laws of the United  States or a
state thereof,  it shall,  prior to the first date on which interest or fees are
payable hereunder for its account,  deliver to Borrower and Administrative Agent
certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States
federal income taxes in accordance with Section 10.13. Borrower,  Administrative
Agent and the Banks shall execute such  modifications  to the Loan  Documents as
shall be reasonably required in connection with and to effectuate the foregoing.

     (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provision of this Section:

                                       26

          (i)  Borrower  shall have a period of thirty (30) days after such time
     as some or all of the  Existing  Banks have agreed to  increase  their Loan
     Commitments or New Banks have agreed to make Loan Commitments,  as the case
     may be, in which to satisfy the  conditions  precedent to the addition of a
     proposed property as a Property set forth in Section 12.06, and if Borrower
     shall fail to satisfy such  conditions  within such period,  Administrative
     Agent will so notify  Borrower and each of the Banks and such property will
     not be added as a  Property  and the  proposed  increase  in the Total Loan
     Commitment will not be consummated; and

          (ii) if any proposed increase in the Total Loan Commitment pursuant to
     this  Section  is not  consummated  (because a property  is  rejected  as a
     Property  or  otherwise),  Borrower  shall  retain  the  right  at any time
     thereafter to propose a property as an  additional  Property and to seek to
     increase the Total Loan Commitment as provided in this Section.


                                  ARTICLE III

                       YIELD PROTECTION; ILLEGALITY; ETC.

     SECTION 3.01.  <U>Additional  Costs</U>.  Borrower shall pay directly to each Bank
from time to time on  demand  such  amounts  as such  Bank may  determine  to be
necessary to compensate it for any  increased  costs which such Bank  determines
are attributable to its making or maintaining a LIBOR Loan, or its obligation to
make or maintain a LIBOR Loan, or its  obligation to Convert a Base Rate Loan to
a LIBOR Loan hereunder,  or any reduction in any amount  receivable by such Bank
hereunder in respect of its LIBOR Loan or such  obligations  (such  increases in
costs and  reductions  in amounts  receivable  being herein  called  "Additional
Costs"), in each case resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

          (1) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts  payable to such Bank
     under this  Agreement or the Notes in respect of any such LIBOR Loan (other
     than changes in the rate of general  corporate,  franchise,  branch profit,
     net  income or other  income  tax  imposed  on such Bank or its  Applicable
     Lending  Office by the  jurisdiction  in which such Bank has its  principal
     office or such Applicable Lending Office); or

          (2) (other than to the extent the LIBOR Reserve  Requirement  is taken
     into  account  in  determining  the LIBOR Rate at the  commencement  of the
     applicable  Interest  Period)  imposes or  modifies  any  reserve,  special
     deposit, deposit insurance or assessment, minimum capital, capital ratio or
     similar  requirements  relating to any extensions of credit or other assets
     of, or any deposits with or other  liabilities of, such Bank (including any
     LIBOR Loan or any deposits referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Interest
     Rate" in Section  1.01),  or any  commitment of such Bank  (including  such
     Bank's Loan Commitment hereunder); or

          (3) imposes any other condition  affecting this Agreement or the Notes
     (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities).

                                       27

     Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  in the event that any Bank determines that
it shall incur  Additional  Costs in  maintaining a LIBOR Loan,  such Bank shall
provide notice thereof to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative  Agent), which
notice shall include the dollar  amount of the  Additional  Costs,  and Borrower
shall have the option,  which option must be  exercised  within five (5) Banking
Days of  Borrower's  receipt  of such  notice,  to prepay  such LIBOR Loan or to
Convert  such  LIBOR  Loan  into a Base  Rate  Loan,  subject,  however,  to the
provisions of Section 3.05.

     Without  limiting the effect of the  provisions  of the first  paragraph of
this Section,  in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory  Change,  any Bank
either (1) incurs  Additional  Costs based on or measured by the excess  above a
specified level of the amount of a category of deposits or other  liabilities of
such Bank which includes  deposits by reference to which the LIBOR Interest Rate
is determined as provided  herein or a category of extensions of credit or other
assets of such Bank which includes loans based on the LIBOR Interest Rate or (2)
becomes  subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities
or assets which it may hold,  then, if such Bank so elects by notice to Borrower
(with a copy to  Administrative  Agent),  the  obligation of such Bank to permit
Elections of, to Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into, LIBOR Loans shall
be suspended (in which case the  provisions of Section 3.04 shall be applicable)
until such Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect.

     Determinations  and  allocations  by a Bank for purposes of this Section of
the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to the first or second paragraph of
this Section,  on its costs or rate of return of making or maintaining  its Loan
or  portions  thereof or on amounts  receivable  by it in respect of its Loan or
portions  thereof,  and the amounts  required to compensate such Bank under this
Section, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

     To the extent that changing the jurisdiction of a Bank's Applicable Lending
Office  would have the effect of  minimizing  Additional  Costs,  each such Bank
shall use reasonable efforts to make such a change, provided that same would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to each such Bank.

     No Bank shall be entitled  to any  compensation  pursuant  to this  Section
relating  to any period  more than  ninety  (90) days  prior to the date  notice
thereof is given to Borrower by such Bank.

     SECTION 3.02. <U>Limitation on Types of Loans</U>. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the determination of the LIBOR Interest Rate
for any Interest Period:

          (1)  Administrative  Agent determines  (which  determination  shall be
     conclusive)  that  quotations of interest  rates for the relevant  deposits
     referred to in the definition of "LIBOR  Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 are
     not being provided in the relevant  amounts or for the relevant  maturities
     for  purposes  of  determining  rates of  interest  for the LIBOR  Loans as
     provided herein; or

          (2) a Bank determines  (which  determination  shall be conclusive) and
     promptly notifies  Administrative Agent that the relevant rates of interest
     referred to in the definition

                                       28

     of "LIBOR  Interest  Rate" in Section 1.01 upon the basis of which the rate
     of interest for LIBOR Loans for such Interest Period is to be determined do
     not adequately  cover the cost to such Bank of making or  maintaining  such
     LIBOR Loan for such Interest Period;

then Administrative Agent shall give Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long
as  such  condition  remains  in  effect,  the  Banks  (or,  in the  case of the
circumstances  described in clause (2) above,  the affected Bank) shall be under
no  obligation  to permit  Elections of LIBOR Loans,  to Convert Base Rate Loans
into LIBOR Loans or to  Continue  LIBOR Loans and  Borrower  shall,  on the last
day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the affected outstanding LIBOR
Loans,  either (x) prepay the  affected  LIBOR Loans or (y) Convert the affected
LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.13.

     SECTION  3.03.  <U>Illegality</U>.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this
Agreement,  in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable
Lending  Office  to  honor  its  obligation  to make or  maintain  a LIBOR  Loan
hereunder,  to allow Elections or  Continuations of a LIBOR Loan or to Convert a
Base  Rate  Loan  into a LIBOR  Loan,  then  such  Bank  shall  promptly  notify
Administrative  Agent and Borrower thereof and such Bank's obligation to make or
maintain a LIBOR Loan, or to permit Elections or Continuations  of, to Continue,
or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into, a LIBOR Loan shall be suspended (in which
case the provisions of Section 3.04 shall be applicable) until such time as such
Bank may again make and maintain a LIBOR Loan.

     SECTION 3.04.  <U>Treatment of Affected  Loans</U>. If the obligations of any Bank
to permit an Election of a LIBOR Loan, to Continue its LIBOR Loan, or to Convert
its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan, are suspended pursuant to Sections 3.01 or
3.03 (each LIBOR Loan so affected being herein called an "Affected Loan"),  such
Bank's Affected Loan shall be  automatically  Converted into a Base Rate Loan on
the last day of the then current  Interest  Period for the Affected Loan (or, in
the case of a Conversion required by Sections 3.01 or 3.03, on such earlier date
as such Bank may specify to Borrower).

     To the extent that such Bank's  Affected  Loan has been so  Converted,  all
payments and  prepayments of principal  which would otherwise be applied to such
Bank's  Affected  Loan shall be  applied  instead to its Base Rate Loan and such
Bank shall have no obligation to Convert its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan.

     In the event  that the  conditions  giving  rise to the  suspension  of any
Bank's  obligations to permit an Election of a LIBOR Loan, to Continue its LIBOR
Loan,  or to Convert  its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan shall cease to exist,
such Bank shall  provide  Borrower  with  prompt  notice of same (with a copy to
Administrative  Agent),  and such Bank  shall  again be  obligated  to permit an
Election of a LIBOR Loan,  to  Continue  its LIBOR Loan,  or to Convert its Base
Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan in accordance with this Agreement.

     SECTION 3.05.  <U>Certain  Compensation</U>.  Borrower shall pay to Administrative
Agent for the  account of the  applicable  Bank,  upon the  request of such Bank
through  Administrative Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in
the  reasonable  opinion of such Bank) to  compensate  it for any loss,  cost or
expense which such Bank determines is attributable to:

          (1) any payment,  prepayment,  Conversion or  Continuation  of a LIBOR
     Loan made by such Bank on a date other  than the last day of an  applicable
     Interest Period, whether by reason of acceleration or otherwise; or

          (2) any  failure by  Borrower  for any reason to Convert or Continue a
     LIBOR Loan to be Converted or Continued by such Bank on the date  specified
     therefor in the relevant notice under Section 2.15; or

          (3) any  failure by  Borrower to borrow (or to qualify for a borrowing
     of) a LIBOR  Loan  which  would  otherwise  be made  hereunder  on the date
     specified  in the  relevant  Election  notice  under  Section 2.15 given or
     submitted by Borrower.

     Without limiting the foregoing,  such compensation  shall include an amount
equal to the present value (using as the discount rate an interest rate equal to
the rate  determined  under clause (2) below) of the excess,  if any, of (1) the
amount of interest which otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so
paid, prepaid, Converted or Continued (or not Converted,  Continued or borrowed)
for the  period  from  the  date  of such  payment,  prepayment,  Conversion  or
Continuation (or failure to Convert,  Continue or borrow) to the last day of the
then  current  applicable  Interest  Period  (or,  in the case of a  failure  to
Convert,  Continue or borrow, to the last day of the applicable  Interest Period
which  would have  commenced  on the date  specified  therefor  in the  relevant
notice) at the  applicable  rate of  interest  for the LIBOR Loan  provided  for
herein, over (2) the amount of interest (as reasonably  determined by such Bank)
based  upon the  interest  rate  which  such Bank  would  have bid in the London
interbank market for Dollar deposits,  for amounts  comparable to such principal
amount and maturities  comparable to such period. A determination of any Bank as
to the amounts  payable  pursuant to this  Section  shall be  conclusive  absent
manifest error.

     SECTION 3.06.  <U>Capital  Adequacy</U>.  If any Bank shall have determined  that,
after the date hereof,  the adoption of any  applicable  law, rule or regulation
regarding  capital  adequacy,  or  any  change  therein,  or any  change  in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority,  central
bank or comparable  agency  charged with the  interpretation  or  administration
thereof,  or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law) of any such  Governmental  Authority,  central  bank or
comparable  agency,  has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on  capital  of such  Bank  (or its  Parent)  as a  consequence  of such  Bank's
obligations  hereunder  to a level  below that  which such Bank (or its  Parent)
could have achieved but for such adoption,  change, request or directive (taking
into  consideration  its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount
deemed by such Bank to be material,  then from time to time, within fifteen (15)
days after demand by such Bank (with a copy to Administrative  Agent),  Borrower
shall pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Bank (or its Parent) for such  reduction.  A

                                       30

certificate of any Bank claiming compensation under this Section,  setting forth
in reasonable  detail the basis  therefor,  shall be conclusive  absent manifest
error.

     SECTION 3.07.  <U>Replacement of Banks</U>.  If any Bank (an "Affected  Bank") (i)
makes demand upon  Borrower  for (or if Borrower is  otherwise  required to pay)
Additional  Costs pursuant to Section 3.01 or (ii) gives notice to Borrower that
such Bank is unable to make or  maintain a LIBOR Loan as a result of a condition
described in Section 3.03 or clause (2) of Section 3.02,  Borrower  may,  within
ninety (90) days of receipt of such demand or notice (or the  occurrence of such
other event causing  Borrower to be required to pay Additional  Costs or causing
said Section 3.03 or clause (2) of Section 3.02 to be  applicable),  as the case
may be, give notice (a "Replacement Notice") to Administrative Agent (which will
promptly  forward a copy of such  notice to each Bank) of  Borrower's  intention
either  (x) to prepay in full the  Affected  Bank's  Note and to  terminate  the
Affected  Bank's entire Loan Commitment or (y) to replace the Affected Bank with
another  financial  institution  (the  "Replacement  Bank")  designated  in such
Replacement Notice.

     In the event  Borrower  opts to give the notice  provided for in clause (x)
above,  and if the Affected  Bank shall not agree within thirty (30) days of its
receipt thereof to waive the payment of the Additional  Costs in question or the
effect of the  circumstances  described in Section 3.03 or clause (2) of Section
3.02, then, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall exist,  Borrower may
(notwithstanding  the provisions of clause (2) of Section 2.11(a)) terminate the
Affected Bank's entire Loan Commitment, provided that in connection therewith it
pays to the  Affected  Bank all  outstanding  principal  and  accrued and unpaid
interest under the Affected  Bank's Note,  together with all other  amounts,  if
any, due from  Borrower to the Affected  Bank,  including  all amounts  properly
demanded and unreimbursed under this Article III.

     In the event  Borrower  opts to give the notice  provided for in clause (y)
above,  and if (i)  Administrative  Agent shall,  within thirty (30) days of its
receipt of the Replacement Notice, notify Borrower and each Bank in writing that
the proposed Replacement Bank is reasonably satisfactory to Administrative Agent
and (ii) the Affected Bank shall not,  prior to the end of such thirty  (30)-day
period,  agree to waive the payment of the  Additional  Costs in question or the
effect of the  circumstances  described in Section 3.03 or clause (2) of Section
3.02,  then the Affected  Bank shall,  so long as no Default or Event of Default
shall exist,  assign its Note and all of its rights and  obligations  under this
Agreement  and  the  other  Loan  Documents  to the  Replacement  Bank,  and the
Replacement Bank shall assume all of the Affected Bank's rights and obligations,
pursuant  to an  agreement,  substantially  in the  form  of an  Assignment  and
Assumption Agreement, executed by the Affected Bank and the Replacement Bank. In
connection with such assignment and assumption,  the Replacement  Bank shall pay
to the Affected Bank an amount equal to the outstanding  principal  amount under
the  Affected  Bank's Note plus all  interest  accrued  thereon,  plus all other
amounts,  if any (other than the  Additional  Costs in  question),  then due and
payable to the Affected Bank; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that prior to or simultaneously
with any such  assignment  and  assumption,  Borrower  shall  have  paid to such
Affected Bank all amounts properly demanded and unreimbursed  under this Article
III. Upon the effective  date of such  assignment and assumption and the payment
by the Replacement  Bank to  Administrative  Agent of a fee, for  Administrative
Agent's own account,  in the amount of $3,500, the Replacement Bank shall become
a Bank Party to this Agreement and shall have all the rights and  obligations of
a Bank as set  forth  in  such  Assignment  and  Assumption  Agreement,

                                       31

and the Affected Bank shall be released from its obligations  hereunder,  and no
further consent or action by any party shall be required.  Upon the consummation
of any assignment pursuant to this Section, a substitute Note shall be issued to
the  Replacement  Bank by  Borrower,  in exchange for the return of the Affected
Bank's Note. The obligations evidenced by such substitute Notes shall constitute
"Obligations"  for all purposes of this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents
and shall be secured by the Mortgages.  In connection with Borrower's  execution
of substitute Notes as aforesaid, Borrower shall deliver to Administrative Agent
such evidence of the due authorization, execution and delivery of the substitute
Notes and any related documents as Administrative  Agent may reasonably request.
If the Replacement Bank is not incorporated  under the Laws of the United States
or a state thereof,  it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees
are payable  hereunder for its account,  deliver to Borrower and  Administrative
Agent  certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 10.13.

     Borrower,   Administrative   Agent  and  the  Banks  shall   execute   such
modifications  to  the  Loan  Documents  as  shall  be  reasonably  required  in
connection with and to effectuate the foregoing.

                                   ARTICLE IV

The  obligation  of each Bank to make  advances of the Loans  subsequent  to the

     satisfied as of the date of the advance;

          (2) No  Default  or  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
     continuing  as of the date of the advance,  or would result from the making
     thereof; and

          (3) Administrative  Agent shall have received a request for an advance
     in accordance with Section 2.04.

     SECTION  4.03.  <U>Deemed  Representations</U>.  Each request by Borrower for, and
acceptance  by Borrower  of, an advance of proceeds of the Loans or the issuance
of a Letter of Credit shall constitute a representation and warranty by Borrower
and each Mortgagor that, as of both the date of such request and the date of the
advance or issuance,  as the case may be, (1) no Default or Event of Default has
occurred  and is  continuing  or would  result from the making of the advance or
issuance  of the  Letter of Credit  and (2) if any  representation  or  warranty
contained in this  Agreement or the other Loan Documents is untrue or incorrect,
the condition giving rise to such  untruthfulness or incorrectness is not likely
to result in a Material Adverse Change.

                                   ARTICLE V

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

     Borrower  represents and warrants to Administrative  Agent and each Bank as
follows:

     SECTION  5.01.  <U>Due  Organization</U>.  Borrower  and each  Mortgagor  are duly
organized,  validly existing and (if applicable) in good standing under the Laws
of the respective  jurisdictions of their organization,  have the partnership or

     SECTION 5.02. <U>Power and Authority; No Conflicts;  Compliance With Laws</U>. The
execution and delivery of, and the performance of the obligations required to be

Borrower's  knowledge,  Borrower and each  Mortgagor are in compliance  with all

Material Adverse Change to occur.

     SECTION  5.03.  <U>Legally  Enforceable  Agreements</U>.  Each Loan  Document is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower and/or the applicable Mortgagor,

pay when due any amounts which may become  payable under the Notes or other Loan
Documents  or to  otherwise  pay and perform  their  respective  obligations  in
connection  with the  Loans;  nor,  to  Borrower's  knowledge,  are any  Actions
threatened  which  would,  if  adversely  determined,  substantially  impair the
ability of  Borrower  or any  Mortgagor  to pay when due any  amounts  which may
become  payable under the Notes or other Loan  Documents or to otherwise pay and
perform their respective obligations in connection with the Loans.

     SECTION 5.05. <U>Good Title to Properties</U>. Borrower and each of its Affiliates
(including each  Mortgagor) have good,  marketable and legal title to all of the

limitation,  those reflected in the financial  statements referred to in Section
5.13) and, in the case of all of Borrower's  shopping  center  properties,  only
with exceptions which do not materially  detract from the value

                                       37

of such property or assets or the use thereof in Borrower's and such Affiliate's
business,  and except to the extent that any such  properties  and assets (other
than the Properties)  have been encumbered or disposed of since the date of such
financial statements without violating any of the covenants contained in Article
VII or VIII or elsewhere in this  Agreement.  Borrower and its Affiliates  enjoy

(federal,  state  and  local)  required  to be filed  and have  paid all  taxes,
assessments and governmental charges and levies shown as due and payable thereon
without the imposition of a penalty, including interest and penalties, except to
the extent they are the subject of a Good Faith Contest.

     SECTION 5.07.  <U>ERISA</U>.  Borrower and each Mortgagor are in compliance in all
material respects with all applicable  provisions of ERISA. Neither a Reportable
Event nor a Prohibited  Transaction  has occurred  with respect to any Plan;  no
notice  of  intent  to  terminate  a Plan has been  filed  nor has any Plan been
terminated  within  the past  five  (5)  years;  no  circumstance  exists  which

Affiliates  have not  completely or partially  withdrawn  under Sections 4201 or

with respect to any Plan  established or maintained by each; and Borrower,  each
Mortgagor and the ERISA  Affiliates  have not incurred any liability to the PBGC
under ERISA.  No part of the funds to be used by Borrower in satisfaction of its
obligations  under this  Agreement  constitute  "plan  assets" of any  "employee
benefit plan" within the meaning of ERISA or of any "plan" within the meaning of
Section  4975(e)(1) of the Code, as interpreted by the Internal  Revenue Service
and the U.S. Department of Labor in rules, regulations, releases or bulletins or
as  interpreted  under  applicable  case law.  Neither the  extension  of credit

Documents constitutes a Prohibited Transaction.

     SECTION 5.08. <U>No Default on Outstanding  Judgments or Orders</U>.  Borrower and
each Mortgagor have satisfied all judgments which are not being appealed and are
not in default with respect to any judgment,  order, writ,  injunction,  decree,

or instrument or subject to any partnership, trust or other restriction which is
likely  to  result  in a  Material  Adverse  Change.  To the best of  Borrower's

Commerce  Act,  the Federal  Powers Act or any Law limiting its ability to incur
indebtedness for money borrowed as contemplated hereby.

     SECTION  5.11.  <U>Environmental   Protection</U>.   To  the  best  of  Borrower's
knowledge,  none  of  Borrower's  or its  Affiliates'  properties  contains  any
Hazardous  Materials that, under any Environmental Law currently in effect,  (1)

a Material Adverse Change or (2) is likely to result in the imposition of a Lien
on any  assets of  Borrower  or its  Affiliates,  in each  case if not  properly
handled in accordance with applicable Law. To the best of Borrower's  knowledge,
neither it nor any of its  Affiliates  nor any  portion of any  Property  or the
Improvements thereon is in violation of, or subject to any existing,  pending or
threatened  investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Authority under, any
Environmental  Law. Except for matters,  claims,  conditions or circumstances as
may be disclosed in the reports  delivered  pursuant to paragraph (9) of Section
4.01,  Borrower is not aware of any matter,  claim,  condition  or  circumstance
which would  reasonably  cause a Person to make further  inquiry with respect to
such  matters in order to  ascertain  whether any  Hazardous  Materials or their
effects have been  disposed of or released on or to any portion of any Property,
the  Improvements  thereon or any surrounding  areas;  neither  Borrower nor any
Mortgagor is required by any  Environmental Law to obtain any permits or license
to construct or use any improvements, fixtures, or equipment with respect to any
Property,  or if such permit or license is required it has been  obtained;  and,
except as may be disclosed in the reports delivered pursuant to paragraph (9) of
Section  4.01,  to the  best of  Borrower's  knowledge,  the  prior  use of each
Property has not resulted in the disposal or release of any Hazardous  Materials
on or to any portion of the  Property or any  surrounding  areas in violation of
applicable Law.

     SECTION  5.12.  <U>Solvency</U>.   Borrower  and  each  Mortgagor  are,  and  upon
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents and any other documents,  instruments or agreements  relating thereto,
will be, Solvent.

     SECTION  5.13.  <U>Financial  Statements</U>.   The  TRG  Consolidated   Financial
Statements,  TCI Financial  Statements and Mortgagor  Financial  Statements most
recently  delivered to the Banks  pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are in
all  material  respects  complete and correct and fairly  present the  financial
condition of the subjects thereof as of the dates of and for the periods covered
by such statements,  all in accordance with GAAP, and there has been no Material
Adverse Change since the date of such most recently  delivered TRG  Consolidated
Financial   Statements,   TCI  Financial   Statements  or  Mortgagor   Financial
Statements,  as the case may be, and no  borrowings  which  might give rise to a
Lien or claim  against all or any portion of the  Mortgaged  Property  under any
Mortgage  or against  the  proceeds  of the Loans have been made by  Borrower or
others since the dates of such most recently delivered financial statements.

     SECTION  8.02.   <U>Certain  Pro-Forma   Adjustments</U>.   For  purposes  of  the
calculation of the financial  covenants set forth in Section 8.01, the following
adjustments  shall  be made  in the  case of  each  property  acquired,  or each
"property put into service",  or each property  disposed of, by Borrower  during
the applicable test period:

          (1) In the case of each  property  acquired or put into  service,  the
     contribution of said property to  Capitalization  Value shall be the lesser
     of (a) such property's contribution to Combined EBITDA, annualized based on
     Borrower's  period of ownership or  operation,  divided by 8.00% or (b) the
     acquisition  cost or cost of the  property.  In the  case of each  property
     disposed of by Borrower  during the applicable  test period,  such property
     shall be deemed to have made no  contribution to  Capitalization  Value for
     the applicable twelve (12)-month period.

          (2) In the case of each  property  acquired or put into  service,  the
     contribution  of said  property to Combined  EBITDA shall be an  annualized
     amount based upon the period of Borrower's  ownership or operation.  In the
     case of each property  disposed of by Borrower  during the applicable  test
     period,  such  property  shall be deemed to have  made no  contribution  to
     Combined EBITDA for the applicable twelve (12)-month period.

          (3) In the case of each  property  acquired or put into  service,  the
     contribution of said property to Interest Expense for the applicable twelve
     (12)-month period shall be equal to actual interest expense with respect to
     the Debt incurred or assumed in connection with the  acquisition,  from the
     date of the acquisition or the date the asset is put into service until the
     end of such  twelve  (12)-month  period,  annualized.  In the  case of each
     property disposed of during the applicable test period, such property shall
     be deemed to have made no contribution to Interest Expense for such period.

     In addition,  if any Debt of Borrower is  refinanced  during an  applicable
test period,  the calculation of Interest  Expense shall be adjusted as follows.
The  contribution  of the Debt that was  refinanced to Interest  Expense for the
applicable twelve (12)-month period shall be equal to actual interest expense on
the refinanced  Debt from the date of the  refinancing to the end of such twelve
(12)-month period, annualized.

     As used in this Section 8.02,  the term  "property put into service"  means
any  property  that has been  opened to the  public for  business  and which has
generated revenues for a period of at least thirty (30) days.

     due date of such  interest;  or fail to pay any fee or any other amount due
     under this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document or the  Supplemental  Fee
     Letter as and when due and such  failure to pay shall  continue  unremedied
     for two (2) days after  notice by  Administrative  Agent of such failure to
     pay; or

          (2)  If  any  representation  or  warranty  made  by  Borrower  or any
     Mortgagor in any Loan  Document or which is  contained in any  certificate,

     or in connection with a Loan Document shall prove to have been incorrect in
     any material respect on or as of the date made or deemed made; or

          (3) If (a)  Borrower  shall  fail to  perform  or  observe  any  term,
     covenant  or  agreement  contained  in Article  VII or Article  VIII or (b)

     covenant or agreement  contained  in Article VI or  otherwise  contained in
     this Agreement (other than obligations  specifically  referred to elsewhere

     notice by  Administrative  Agent to Borrower  thereof (or such shorter cure
     period  as  may  be  expressly  prescribed  in  the  applicable  document);
     <U>provided</U>,  <U>however</U>,  that if any such default under clause (b) above cannot
     by its nature be cured within such thirty (30) day, or shorter, as the case
     may be, grace period and so long as Borrower or the  applicable  Mortgagor,
     as the case may be, shall have  commenced cure within such thirty (30) day,
     or  shorter,  as the case may be,  grace  period  and  shall,  at all times
     thereafter,  diligently  prosecute the same to completion,  Borrower or the
     applicable Mortgagor,  as the case may be, shall have an additional period,
     not to exceed sixty (60) days, to cure such default; in no event,  however,
     is the foregoing intended to effect an extension of the Maturity Date; or

     scheduled  maturity,   required   prepayment,   acceleration,   demand,  or
     otherwise)  or (b) to perform or observe any material  term,  covenant,  or
     condition under any agreement or instrument relating to any such Debt, when
     required to be  performed  or  observed,  if the effect of such  failure to
     perform or  observe is to  accelerate,  or to permit the  acceleration  of,
     after the  giving of

                                       49

     notice or the lapse of time,  or both  (other than in cases  where,  in the
     judgment of the Required Banks,  meaningful discussions likely to result in
     (i) a waiver or cure of the failure to perform or observe or (ii) otherwise
     averting such acceleration are in progress between Borrower and the obligee
     of such  Debt),  the  maturity  of such  Debt,  or any such  Debt  shall be
     declared to be due and payable,  or required to be prepaid (other than by a
     regularly scheduled or otherwise required prepayment),  prior to the stated
     maturity thereof; or

          (5) If any Mortgagor,  TCI, Borrower,  or any Affiliate(s) (other than
     any Mortgagor) of Borrower to which  $100,000,000  or more in the aggregate
     of  Capitalization  Value is attributable,  shall: (a) generally not, or be

     money in excess of $10,000,000 in the aggregate  shall be rendered  against
     Borrower, TCI or any Mortgagor,  and any such judgments,  decrees or orders
     shall  continue  unsatisfied  and in effect  for a period  of  thirty  (30)

as its agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document with such powers as are
specifically  delegated to  Administrative  Agent by the terms of this Agreement
and any other Loan  Document,  together with such other powers as are reasonably
incidental   thereto.   Administrative   Agent   shall   have   no   duties   or
responsibilities  except those  expressly  set forth in this  Agreement

                                       51

and any other Loan  Document or required by law, and shall not by reason of this
Agreement  be a  fiduciary  or trustee  for any Bank  except to the extent  that
Administrative  Agent acts as an agent with respect to the receipt or payment of
funds (nor shall  Administrative  Agent have any fiduciary  duty to Borrower nor
shall any Bank  have any  fiduciary  duty to  Borrower  or to any  other  Bank).
Administrative  Agent shall not be  responsible  to the Banks for any  recitals,
statements,  representations  or  warranties  made by Borrower  or any  officer,
partner or official of Borrower or any other Person  contained in this Agreement
or any  other  Loan  Document,  or in  any  certificate  or  other  document  or
instrument  referred  to or  provided  for in, or received by any of them under,
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or for the value, legality, validity,
effectiveness,  genuineness,  enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan  Document  or any other  document  or  instrument  referred to or
provided  for herein or  therein,  for the  perfection  or  priority of any Lien
securing the  Obligations or for any failure by Borrower or any other obligor to
perform any of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. Administrative Agent may
employ agents and attorneys-in-fact  and shall not be responsible,  except as to
money or securities  received by it or its authorized agents, for the negligence
or  misconduct  of any such  agents  or  attorneys-in-fact  selected  by it with
reasonable  care.  Neither  Administrative  Agent  nor  any  of  its  directors,
officers,  employees  or agents  shall be liable or  responsible  for any action
taken or  omitted  to be taken by it or them  hereunder  or under any other Loan
Document or in  connection  herewith or  therewith,  except for its or their own
gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Borrower shall pay any fee agreed to by
Borrower  and  Administrative  Agent  with  respect  to  Administrative  Agent's
services hereunder.

     SECTION 10.02. <U>Reliance by Administrative Agent</U>. Administrative Agent shall
be  entitled  to rely  upon any  certification,  notice  or other  communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to
be genuine  and  correct  and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the
proper  Person or Persons,  and upon  advice and  statements  of legal  counsel,
independent  accountants  and other experts  selected by  Administrative  Agent.
Administrative Agent may deem and treat each Bank as the holder of the Loan made
by it for all purposes  hereof and shall not be required to deal with any Person
who has acquired a Participation in any Loan or Participation from a Bank. As to
any matters  not  expressly  provided  for by this  Agreement  or any other Loan
Document,  Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting,
or in refraining from acting,  hereunder in accordance with instructions  signed
by the Required  Banks,  and such  instructions  of the  Required  Banks and any
action taken or failure to act pursuant  thereto  shall be binding on all of the
Banks and any other holder of all or any portion of any Loan or Participation.

     SECTION 10.03.  <U>Defaults</U>.  Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of the  occurrence of a Default or Event of Default  (other than those
relating to the payment of principal or interest)  unless  Administrative  Agent
has received notice from a Bank or Borrower  specifying such Default or Event of
Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default." In the event that
Administrative  Agent  receives such a notice of the  occurrence of a Default or
Event of Default,  Administrative  Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the
Banks.  Administrative  Agent,  following  consultation  with the  Banks,  shall
(subject to Section  10.07) take such  action  with  respect to such  Default or
Event of  Default  which is  continuing,  or with  respect  to the  exercise  of
remedies,  including with respect to realization on, or operation or disposition
of, any Collateral,  as shall be directed by the Required Banks;  provided that,
unless and until  Administrative  Agent  shall have  received  such  directions,

                                       52

Administrative  Agent may take such action,  or refrain from taking such action,
with respect to such  Default or Event of Default as it shall deem  advisable in
the best interest of the Banks; and provided further that  Administrative  Agent
shall not send a notice of Default  or  acceleration  to  Borrower  without  the
approval  of the  Required  Banks.  In no event  shall  Administrative  Agent be
required to take any such action which it determines to be contrary to law.

     SECTION 10.04.  <U>Rights of  Administrative  Agent as a Bank</U>. With respect to
its Loan  Commitment  and the Loan provided by it,  Administrative  Agent in its
capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have the same rights and powers  hereunder as
any  other  Bank and may  exercise  the same as  though  it were not  acting  as
Administrative  Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall,  unless the context
otherwise  indicates,  include  Administrative  Agent in its capacity as a Bank.
Administrative  Agent and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor
to any Bank)  accept  deposits  from,  lend money to (on a secured or  unsecured
basis),  and generally  engage in any kind of banking,  trust or other  business
with  Borrower  (and any  Affiliates  of  Borrower)  as if it were not acting as
Administrative Agent.

     SECTION   10.05.   <U>Sharing  of  Costs  by  Banks;   Indemnification   of
Administrative  Agent</U>.  Each Bank agrees to pay its ratable share,  based on
the  respective  outstanding  principal  balances  under  its Note and the other
Notes,  of any expenses  incurred (and not paid or reimbursed by Borrower  after
demand for payment is made by Administrative Agent) by or on behalf of the Banks
in  connection  with  any  Default  or  Event  of  Default,  including,  without
limitation,  costs of  enforcement of the Loan Documents and any advances to pay
taxes or insurance premiums or otherwise to preserve the Lien of any Mortgage or
to preserve or protect any Mortgaged Property.  In the event a Bank fails to pay
its share of expenses as  aforesaid,  and all or a portion of such unpaid amount
is paid by Administrative  Agent and/or one or more of the other Banks, then the
defaulting  Bank shall reimburse  Administrative  Agent and/or the other Bank(s)
for the  portion of such unpaid  amount paid by it or them,  as the case may be,
together  with  interest  thereon  at the Base Rate from the date of  payment by
Administrative Agent and/or the other Bank(s). In addition,  each Bank agrees to
indemnify Administrative Agent (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 12.04
or under the other  applicable  provisions  of any Loan  Document,  but  without
limiting  the  obligations  of  Borrower  under  Section  12.04  or  such  other
provisions),  for its Pro Rata  Share of any and all  liabilities,  obligations,
losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or
disbursements  of any  kind and  nature  whatsoever  which  may be  imposed  on,
incurred by or asserted against  Administrative  Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of this  Agreement,  any other Loan Document or any other  documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which Borrower is
obligated to pay under Section 12.04 or under any other applicable provisions of
any Loan  Document) or the  enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or
of any such other  documents or  instruments;  <U>provided</U>, <U> however</U>,  that no Bank
shall be liable for (1) any of the  foregoing  to the extent they arise from the
gross negligence or willful  misconduct of the party to be indemnified,  (2) any
loss of principal or interest with respect to Administrative Agent's Loan or (3)
any loss suffered by  Administrative  Agent in  connection  with a swap or other
interest rate hedging arrangement entered into with Borrower.

     SECTION 10.06.  <U>Non-Reliance on Administrative  Agent and Other Banks</U>. Each
Bank agrees that it has,  independently  and without reliance on  Administrative
Agent or any

                                       53

other  Bank,  and  based on such  documents  and  information  as it has  deemed
appropriate,  made its own  analysis  of the  Collateral  and of the  credit  of
Borrower and each  Mortgagor,  and its own decision to enter into this Agreement
and that it will,  independently and without reliance upon Administrative  Agent
or any other Bank, and based on such documents and  information as it shall deem
appropriate  at the time,  continue to make its own  analysis  and  decisions in
taking or not taking  action under this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document.
Administrative  Agent shall not be  required  to keep itself  informed as to the
performance  or observance by Borrower or any Mortgagor of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document or any other document  referred to or provided for herein or
therein  or to  inspect  the  properties  (including,  without  limitation,  any
Property) or books of Borrower or any Mortgagor. Except for notices, reports and
other documents and information  expressly required to be furnished to the Banks
by Administrative Agent hereunder,  Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or  responsibility  to  provide  any Bank with any  credit or other  information
concerning  the  affairs,  financial  condition  or  business of  Borrower,  any
Mortgagor or any other  Affiliate of Borrower which may come into the possession
of Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates. Administrative Agent shall not
be required to file this  Agreement,  any other Loan Document or any document or
instrument  referred  to herein or  therein,  for record or give  notice of this
Agreement,  any other Loan  Document or any document or  instrument  referred to
herein or therein, to anyone.

     SECTION 10.07.  <U>Failure of  Administrative  Agent to Act</U>. Except for action
expressly required of Administrative Agent hereunder, Administrative Agent shall
in all cases be fully  justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder  unless
it shall have received further assurances (which may include cash collateral) of
the  indemnification  obligations of the Banks under Section 10.05 in respect of
any and all  liability  and  expense  which may be  incurred  by it by reason of
taking or  continuing  to take any such action.  If any  indemnity  furnished to
Administrative  Agent for any purpose  shall,  in the opinion of  Administrative
Agent, be insufficient or become impaired,  Administrative Agent may call for an
additional indemnity and cease, or not commence,  the action indemnified against
until such additional indemnity is furnished.

     SECTION   10.08.   <U>Resignation   or   Removal  of   Administrative   Agent</U>.
Administrative  Agent hereby  agrees not to  unilaterally  resign  except in the
event it becomes an Affected  Bank and is removed or replaced as a Bank pursuant
to  Section   3.07,   in  which  event  it  shall  have  the  right  to  resign.
Administrative  Agent may be removed  at any time with or  without  cause by the
Required  Banks,  provided  that  Borrower and the other Banks shall be promptly
notified thereof. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Required Banks shall
have the right to  appoint a  successor  Administrative  Agent  which  successor
Administrative  Agent,  so long as it is  reasonably  acceptable to the Required
Banks,  shall be that Bank then  having  the  greatest  Loan  Commitment.  If no
successor  Administrative  Agent shall have been so  appointed  by the  Required
Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the
Required Banks' removal of the retiring  Administrative Agent, then the retiring
Administrative   Agent  may,  on  behalf  of  the  Banks,  appoint  a  successor
Administrative Agent, which shall be one of the Banks. The Required Banks or the
retiring Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall upon the appointment of
a  successor  Administrative  Agent  promptly so notify  Borrower  and the other
Banks. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative  Agent hereunder
by a successor  Administrative Agent, such successor  Administrative Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,  powers,  privileges
and duties of the retiring Administrative

                                       54

Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties
and obligations  hereunder.  After any retiring  Administrative  Agent's removal
hereunder  as  Administrative  Agent,  the  provisions  of this  Article X shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

     SECTION  10.09.  <U>Amendments  Concerning  Agency  Function</U>.  Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Administrative Agent shall
not be  bound by any  waiver,  amendment,  supplement  or  modification  of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document  which affects its duties,  rights,  and/or
functions  hereunder or thereunder  unless it shall have given its prior written
consent thereto.

     SECTION 10.10.  <U>Liability of  Administrative  Agent</U>.  Administrative  Agent
shall not have any liabilities or responsibilities to Borrower on account of the
failure  of any Bank to  perform  its  obligations  hereunder  or to any Bank on
account of the failure of Borrower to perform its obligations hereunder or under
any other Loan Document.

     SECTION 10.11. <U>Transfer of Agency Function</U>. Without the consent of Borrower
or any Bank,  Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time transfer
its functions as  Administrative  Agent hereunder to any of its offices wherever
located in the United States,  provided that Administrative Agent shall promptly
notify Borrower and the Banks thereof.

     SECTION 10.12.  <U>Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative  Agent  Adjustments</U>.
(a) Unless  Administrative  Agent  shall  have  received  notice  from a Bank or
Borrower  (either one as  appropriate  being the  "Payor")  prior to the date on
which such Bank is to make  payment  hereunder  to  Administrative  Agent of the
proceeds of a Loan or Borrower is to make payment to  Administrative  Agent,  as
the case may be (either such payment being a "Required  Payment"),  which notice
shall be  effective  upon  receipt,  that the Payor  will not make the  Required
Payment in full to Administrative  Agent,  Administrative  Agent may assume that
the Required Payment has been made in full to Administrative Agent on such date,
and Administrative  Agent in its sole discretion may, but shall not be obligated
to, in reliance upon such assumption,  make the amount thereof  available to the
intended  recipient on such date.  If and to the extent the Payor shall not have
in fact so made  the  Required  Payment  in full to  Administrative  Agent,  the
recipient  of such  payment  shall repay to  Administrative  Agent  forthwith on
demand such amount made available to it together with interest thereon, for each
day from the date such  amount was so made  available  by  Administrative  Agent
until the date  Administrative  Agent recovers such amount, at the Federal Funds
Rate for three (3) Banking Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.

     (b) If,  after  Administrative  Agent  has paid  each  Bank's  share of any
payment  received  or applied by  Administrative  Agent in respect of the Loans,
that  payment  is  rescinded  or must  otherwise  be  returned  or paid  over by
Administrative  Agent,  whether  pursuant to any  bankruptcy or insolvency  Law,
sharing of payments clause of any loan agreement or otherwise,  such Bank shall,
at Administrative Agent's request,  promptly return its share of such payment or
application to  Administrative  Agent,  together with such Bank's  proportionate
share of any  interest or other  amount  required  to be paid by  Administrative
Agent with respect to such payment or  application.  In addition,  if a court of
competent jurisdiction shall adjudge that any

                                       55

amount received and distributed by  Administrative  Agent is to be repaid,  each
Person to whom any such distribution  shall have been made shall either repay to
Administrative  Agent its share of the amount so  adjudged to be repaid or shall
pay over the same in such manner and to such Persons as shall be  determined  by
such court.

     SECTION 10.13.  <U>Withholding Taxes</U>. Each Bank represents that it is entitled
to receive any payments to be made to it hereunder  without the  withholding  of
any tax and will  furnish to  Administrative  Agent such forms,  certifications,
statements and other documents as  Administrative  Agent or Borrower may request
from time to time to evidence such Bank's  exemption from the withholding of any
tax imposed by any jurisdiction or to enable Administrative Agent to comply with
any  applicable  Laws  relating  thereto.  Without  limiting  the  effect of the
foregoing,  if any Bank is not created or organized under the Laws of the United
States or any state thereof,  such Bank will furnish to  Administrative  Agent a
U.S.  Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI in respect of all payments to be made
to such Bank by Borrower or  Administrative  Agent under this  Agreement  or any
other Loan Document or a U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN  establishing
such Bank's complete  exemption from United States withholding tax in respect of
payments to be made to such Bank by Borrower or Administrative  Agent under this
Agreement  or any other  Loan  Document,  or such other  forms,  certifications,
statements or documents, duly executed and completed by such Bank as evidence of
such Bank's  exemption from the  withholding  of U.S. tax with respect  thereto.
Administrative  Agent shall not be obligated  to make any payments  hereunder to
such Bank in respect of any Loan or Participation or such Bank's Loan Commitment
or obligation to purchase Participations until such Bank shall have furnished to
Administrative Agent the requested form, certification, statement or document.

     SECTION 10.14. <U>Pro Rata Treatment</U>. Except to the extent otherwise provided,
each  advance  of  proceeds  of the  Loans  shall be made by the  Banks  ratably
according to the amounts of their respective Loan Commitments.

     SECTION  10.15.  <U>Sharing of Payments  Among  Banks</U>.  If a Bank shall obtain
payment of any  principal  of or  interest  on any Loan made by it  through  the
exercise of any right of setoff,  banker's lien,  counterclaim,  or by any other
means  (including  direct  payment),  and  such  payment  results  in such  Bank
receiving a greater payment than it would have been entitled to had such payment
been paid directly to  Administrative  Agent for disbursement to the Banks, then
such Bank shall promptly  purchase for cash from the other Banks  Participations
in the  Loans  made by the other  Banks in such  amounts,  and make  such  other
adjustments  from  time to time as  shall be  equitable  to the end that all the
Banks shall share  ratably  the benefit of such  payment.  To such end the Banks
shall  make  appropriate   adjustments   among  themselves  (by  the  resale  of
Participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored.  Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a Participation in the
Loans made by other  Banks may  exercise  all rights of setoff,  banker's  lien,
counterclaim  or similar  rights  with  respect to such  Participation.  Nothing
contained  herein  shall  require any Bank to  exercise  any such right or shall
affect the right of any Bank to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising,
any such right with respect to any other indebtedness of Borrower.

     SECTION 10.16. <U>Possession of Documents</U>.  Each Bank shall keep possession of
its own Note(s).  Administrative  Agent shall hold all the other Loan  Documents

                                       56

and related  documents  in its  possession  and  maintain  separate  records and
accounts   with  respect   thereto,   and  shall  permit  the  Banks  and  their
representatives  access at all reasonable  times to inspect such Loan Documents,
related documents, records and accounts.

     SECTION 10.17. <U>Minimum Commitment by Administrative Agent</U>.  Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 12.05,  Administrative  Agent agrees, so long as there
exists no Event of Default,  to maintain a Loan  Commitment in an amount no less
than  $15,000,000,  and further  agrees to hold and not to participate or assign
any of such amount other than an assignment to a Federal  Reserve Bank or to the
Parent or a majority-owned subsidiary of Administrative Agent.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                              NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS

     SECTION 11.01.  <U>Absolute and Unconditional  Obligations</U>.  Borrower and each
Mortgagor  acknowledge and agree that their  obligations  and liabilities  under
this  Agreement  and  under the  other  Loan  Documents  shall be  absolute  and
unconditional  irrespective of (1) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
of the Obligations,  any Loan Documents, or any agreement or instrument relating
thereto,  (2) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment  of, or in any
other term in respect of, all or any of the Obligations,  or any other amendment
or waiver of or consent to any  departure  from any Loan  Documents or any other
documents  or  instruments  executed  in  connection  with  or  related  to  the
Obligations,  (3) any exchange or release of any  Collateral,  or any release of
any  other  Person  from  all  or  any  of the  Obligations  or  (4)  any  other
circumstances  which might  otherwise  constitute a defense  available  to, or a
discharge of, Borrower or any other Person in respect of the Obligations.

     The Obligations  shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by
any Bank or any other Person at any time of any right or remedy against Borrower
or any other Person which may be or become  liable in respect of all or any part
of the  Obligations or against any Collateral or guarantee  therefor or right of
setoff with respect thereto.

     SECTION 11.02.  <U>Non-Recourse</U>.  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in any of the other Loan Documents, or in any other
instruments,  certificates,  documents or agreements executed in connection with
the Loans (all of the  foregoing,  for  purposes  of this  Section,  hereinafter
referred to,  individually and collectively,  as the "Relevant  Documents"),  no
recourse  under or upon any  Obligation,  representation,  warranty,  promise or
other matter whatsoever shall be had against any of the constituent  partners of
Borrower or their  successors  or assigns (said  constituent  partners and their
successors and assigns,  for purposes of this Section,  hereinafter referred to,
individually and collectively,  as the "TRG Partners"),  and each Bank expressly
waives and releases,  on behalf of itself and its  successors  and assigns,  all
right to assert any liability  whatsoever  under or with respect to the Relevant
Documents  against,  or to satisfy any claim or  obligation  arising  thereunder
against,  any of the TRG  Partners  or out of any  assets  of the TRG  Partners,
<U>provided</U>,  <U>however</U>,  that nothing in this Section shall be deemed to (1) release
Borrower from any personal  liability pursuant to, or from any of its respective
obligations  under, the Relevant  Documents,  or from personal liability for its
fraudulent  actions or  fraudulent  omissions,  (2) release any TRG Partner from
personal

                                       57

liability for its or his own  fraudulent  actions or fraudulent  omissions,  (3)
constitute a waiver of any obligation  evidenced or secured by, or contained in,
the Relevant  Documents or affect in any way the validity or  enforceability  of
the Relevant Documents or (4) limit the right of Administrative Agent and/or the
Banks to proceed  against or realize upon all or any part of the  Collateral  or
any and all of the  assets of  Borrower  (notwithstanding  the fact that the TRG
Partners have an ownership interest in Borrower and, thereby, an interest in the
assets of  Borrower)  or to name  Borrower  (or, to the extent that the same are
required by applicable law or are determined by a court to be necessary  parties
in connection with an action or suit against  Borrower or all or any part of the
Collateral,  any of the TRG  Partners) as a party  defendant  in, and to enforce
against all or any part of the Collateral and/or assets of Borrower any judgment
obtained by Administrative Agent and/or the Banks with respect to, any action or
suit under the Relevant  Documents so long as no judgment shall be taken (except
to the extent taking a judgment is required by applicable law or determined by a
court to be necessary to preserve  Administrative  Agent's  and/or Banks' rights
against  Borrower or all or any part of the  Collateral,  but not  otherwise) or
shall be enforced  against the TRG Partners,  their  successors and assigns,  or
their assets.

     (b)  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary  contained  in the Relevant
Documents, no recourse under or upon any Obligation,  representation,  warranty,
promise or other matter  whatsoever  shall be had against any of the constituent
partners or members  (other than Borrower and, in such case,  only to the extent
provided in paragraph (a) above) of any Mortgagor or their respective successors
or assigns (said constituent partners or members (other than Borrower) and their
respective  successors  and assigns,  for purposes of this Section,  hereinafter
referred to,  individually and  collectively,  as the "Mortgagor  Partners") and
each Bank expressly waives and releases,  on behalf of itself and its successors
and assigns,  all right to assert any liability whatsoever under or with respect
to the Relevant Documents against, or to satisfy any claim or obligation arising
thereunder  against,  any of the Mortgagor  Partners or out of any assets of the
Mortgagor  Partners,  <U>provided</U>,  <U>however</U>,  that nothing in this Section shall be
deemed to (1) release any Mortgagor from any personal  liability pursuant to, or
from any of its respective  obligations under, the Relevant  Documents,  or from
personal  liability  for its  fraudulent  actions or fraudulent  omissions,  (2)
release  any  Mortgagor  Partner  from  personal  liability  for  its or his own
fraudulent  actions or  fraudulent  omissions,  (3)  constitute  a waiver of any
obligation  evidenced or secured by, or contained in, the Relevant  Documents or
affect in any way the validity or  enforceability  of the Relevant  Documents or
(4) limit the right of Administrative  Agent and/or the Banks to proceed against
or realize upon all or any part of the  Collateral  or any and all of the assets
of any Mortgagor  (notwithstanding  the fact that the Mortgagor Partners have an
ownership interest in such Mortgagor and, thereby,  an interest in the assets of
such  Mortgagor) or to name any  Mortgagor  (or, to the extent that the same are
required by applicable law or are determined by a court to be necessary  parties
in connection with an action or suit against  Borrower,  Mortgagor or all or any
part of the Collateral,  any of the Mortgagor Partners) as a party defendant in,
and to enforce  against all or any part of the  Collateral  and/or assets of any
Mortgagor any judgment  obtained by  Administrative  Agent and/or the Banks with
respect  to,  any  action or suit  under the  Relevant  Documents  so long as no
judgment  shall be taken  (except to the extent taking a judgment is required by
applicable   law  or   determined  by  a  court  to  be  necessary  to  preserve
Administrative  Agent's and/or Banks' rights against Borrower,  any Mortgagor or
all or any part of the  Collateral,  but not  otherwise)  or  shall be  enforced
against the Mortgagor Partners, their successors and assigns, or their assets.

                                       58

                                  ARTICLE XII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

     SECTION 12.01.  <U>Binding Effect of Request for Advance</U>. By its acceptance of
any advance of proceeds of the Loans  under this  Agreement,  Borrower  shall be
bound in all  respects by the request  for  advance  submitted  on its behalf in
connection  therewith  with the same force and effect as if Borrower  had itself
executed  and  submitted  the request for advance and whether or not the request
for advance is executed and/or submitted by an authorized person.

     SECTION 12.02.  <U>Amendments and Waivers</U>.  No amendment or material waiver of
any  provision of this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document nor consent to any
material  departure by Borrower,  any Mortgagor or any other obligor  therefrom,
shall in any event be  effective  unless the same shall be in writing and signed
by the Required Banks and,  solely for purposes of its  acknowledgment  thereof,
Administrative Agent, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in
the specific  instance and for the specific  purpose for which given,  <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>,  that no  amendment,  waiver or consent  shall,  unless in writing  and
signed by all the Banks do any of the following: (1) reduce the principal of, or
interest  on,  the  Notes or any fees due  hereunder  or any  other  amount  due
hereunder or under any other Loan Document;  (2) postpone any date fixed for any
payment of principal  of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees due hereunder or
under any other Loan Document, or waive any default in the payment of principal,
interest or any other amount due hereunder or under any other Loan Document; (3)
change the definition of Required Banks; (4) amend this Section, Section 2.19 or
any other  provision  requiring  the consent or agreement of all the Banks;  (5)
waive any default under paragraph (5) of Section 9.01; (6) release any Mortgagor
from its  obligations  under the Guaranty,  release any material  portion of the
Collateral,  or  subordinate  the  Banks'  Lien on any  material  portion of the
Collateral to a Lien to secure any Debt other than the Loans, other than, in any
such case, in accordance with the provisions of Loan Documents;  or (7) increase
the Total Loan  Commitment,  other than in  accordance  with Section  2.19.  Any
advance of  proceeds of the Loans made prior to or without  the  fulfillment  by
Borrower of all of the  conditions  precedent  thereto,  whether or not known to
Administrative  Agent  and the  Banks,  shall  not  constitute  a waiver  of the
requirement that all conditions,  including the non-performed conditions,  shall
be  required  with  respect  to all future  advances.  No failure on the part of
Administrative  Agent or any Bank to exercise,  and no delay in exercising,  any
right  hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof or  preclude  any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

     Except  to  the  extent  otherwise   provided  in  Section  2.19,  (1)  all
communications  from  Administrative  Agent to the Banks  requesting  the Banks'
determination,  consent,  approval or disapproval (x) shall be given in the form
of a written  notice to each  Bank,  (y) shall be  accompanied  by or  include a
description  or copy of the  matter  or thing as to  which  such  determination,
approval,   consent  or   disapproval   is  requested   and  (z)  shall  include
Administrative  Agent's recommended course of action or determination in respect
thereof;  (2) each Bank shall reply  promptly,  but in any event within ten (10)
business  days (or five (5)  business  days  with  respect  to any  decision  to
accelerate  or stop  acceleration  of the Loans)  after  receipt of the  request
therefor by  Administrative  Agent (the "Bank Reply  Period");  and (3) unless a
Bank shall give written  notice to  Administrative  Agent that it objects to the
recommendation or determination of

                                       59

Administrative  Agent (together with a written explanation of the reasons behind
such objection) within the Bank Reply Period,  such Bank shall be deemed to have
approved or consented to such recommendation or determination.

     SECTION 12.03. <U>Usury</U>. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding,  the
obligations  of Borrower  under this Agreement and the Notes shall be subject to
the  limitation  that  payments of interest  shall not be required to the extent
that receipt thereof would be contrary to provisions of Law applicable to a Bank
limiting rates of interest which may be charged or collected by such Bank.

     SECTION  12.04.  <U>Expenses;  Indemnification</U>.  Borrower  agrees to reimburse
Administrative Agent on demand for all reasonable costs,  expenses,  and charges
including,  without  limitation,  all reasonable  fees and charges of engineers,
appraisers  and other  consultants  (provided such other  consultants  have been
engaged with Borrower's consent, not to be unreasonably  withheld or delayed; it
being  understood,  however,  that Borrower  shall have no such right of consent
during the existence of an Event of Default) and external legal counsel incurred
by  Administrative  Agent in connection  with the Loans and to reimburse each of
the Banks for reasonable  legal costs,  expenses and charges incurred by each of
the Banks in connection  with the  performance or enforcement of this Agreement,
the Notes, or any other Loan Documents;  <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Borrower is not
responsible  for costs,  expenses  and charges  incurred by the Bank  Parties in
connection  with the day-to-day  administration  or the syndication of the Loans
(except as otherwise  provided in the Supplemental Fee Letter).  Borrower agrees
to indemnify Administrative Agent and each Bank and their respective Affiliates,
controlling  Persons,  directors,  officers,  employees  and  agents  (each,  an
"Indemnified  Party") from, and hold each of them harmless against,  any and all
losses, liabilities,  claims, damages or expenses, joint or several, incurred by
any of them arising out of or by reason of (x) any claims by brokers due to acts
or  omissions  by  Borrower  or (y)  any  third-party  claims  relating  to this
Agreement,  the Loans,  the use of proceeds of the Loans, and the performance by
BAC (including as Administrative Agent) or any of its Affiliates of the services
contemplated by this Agreement or the Supplemental Fee Letter, and Borrower will
reimburse any Indemnified Party for any and all reasonable  expenses  (including
reasonable  counsel fees and expenses) as they are incurred in  connection  with
the  investigation of or preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened
claim  or any  action  or  proceeding  arising  therefrom,  whether  or not such
Indemnified Party is a party and whether or not such claim, action or proceeding
is  initiated  or  brought  to be by or on  behalf  of  Borrower  or  any of its
Affiliates and whether or not any of the transactions  contemplated hereby or by
the  Supplemental  Fee  Letter are  consummated  or this  Agreement  or the Loan
Commitments  are  terminated.  Borrower  will not be liable under the  foregoing
indemnification  provision to an Indemnified  Party to the extent that any loss,
claim, damage,  liability or expense is found in a final non-appealable judgment
by a court of competent  jurisdiction  to have  resulted  from such  Indemnified
Party's bad faith or gross negligence or breach of this Agreement.

     In any such action or  proceeding  Borrower  shall have the right to assume
the defense thereof and select counsel  reasonably  acceptable to BAC; <U>provided</U>,
<U>however</U>,  that in no event will such counsel,  without the prior written consent
of BAC, not to be unreasonably withheld, be counsel to Borrower or to any of its
Affiliates.

                                       60

     Borrower  also agrees that no  Indemnified  Party shall have any  liability
(whether  direct or indirect,  in contract or tort or  otherwise) to Borrower or
its creditors related to or arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
the Supplemental Fee Letter, the Loans, the use of proceeds of the Loans, any of
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby or by the Supplemental Fee Letter or any
related  transaction  or the  performance  by BAC  (including as  Administrative
Agent) or any of its Affiliates of the services  contemplated  by this Agreement
or the  Supplemental  Fee  Letter,  except to the extent  that any loss,  claim,
damage or  liability is found in a final  non-appealable  judgment by a court of
competent  jurisdiction to have resulted from such Indemnified Party's bad faith
or gross negligence or breach of this Agreement.

     Borrower agrees that, without BAC's prior written consent,  which shall not
be unreasonably withheld, Borrower will not settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened  claim,  action or proceeding
in  respect  of which  indemnification  has been or could be  sought  under  the
indemnification  provisions of this  Agreement  (whether or not BAC or any other
Indemnified  Party is an  actual or  potential  party to such  claim,  action or
proceeding),  unless such  settlement,  compromise  or consent  (i)  includes an
unconditional written release, in form and substance reasonably  satisfactory to
the Indemnified  Parties,  of each Indemnified  Party from all liability arising
out of such claim,  action or proceeding and (ii) does not include any statement
as to an  admission of fault,  culpability  or failure to act by or on behalf of
any Indemnified Party.

     No Indemnified  Party shall,  without the prior consent of Borrower (not to
be  unreasonably  withheld or delayed)  settle or compromise any action or claim
for which indemnity has been or could be sought hereunder.

     If (a) an  Indemnified  Party is  requested  to appear as a witness  in any
action  brought by or on behalf of Borrower or any of its  Affiliates  or (b) an
Indemnified  Party is  required  to appear as a witness  in any  action  brought
against Borrower or any of Affiliates, in either case, in which such Indemnified
Party is not named as a defendant, Borrower agrees to reimburse such Indemnified
Party  for all  reasonable  expenses  incurred  by it in  connection  with  such
Indemnified  Party's  appearing  and  preparing  to  appear  as such a  witness,
including,  without  limitation,  the reasonable fees and  disbursements  of its
legal  counsel,  and to  compensate  such  Indemnified  Party in an amount to be
reasonable and mutually agreed upon.

     The  obligations of Borrower under this Section and under Article III shall
survive the repayment of all amounts due under or in connection  with any of the
Loan Documents and the termination of the Loans.

     SECTION 12.05. <U>Assignment;  Participation</U>.  This Agreement shall be binding
upon, and shall inure to the benefit of,  Borrower,  Administrative  Agent,  the
Banks and their respective  successors and permitted  assigns.  Borrower may not
assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder.

     Any Bank may at any time grant to one or more  banks or other  institutions
(each,  a   "Participant")   participating   interests  in  its  Loan  (each,  a
"Participation")  subject,  provided  there  exists  no  Event  of  Default,  to
Borrower's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
In the  event of any such  grant by a Bank of a  Participation,  whether  or not

                                       61

Borrower  or  Administrative  Agent was given  notice,  such Bank  shall  remain
responsible for the performance of its obligations  hereunder,  and Borrower and
Administrative  Agent shall  continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank
in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations  hereunder.  Any agreement
pursuant to which any Bank may grant a  Participation  shall  provide  that such
Bank shall retain the sole right and  responsibility  to enforce the obligations
of Borrower  hereunder  and under any other Loan  Document,  including,  without
limitation,  the right to approve any amendment,  modification  or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document;  <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that
such  participation  agreement  may provide that such Bank will not agree to any
modification,  amendment  or waiver  described in clauses (1) through (6) in the
first paragraph of Section 12.02 without the consent of the Participant.

     Any Bank may at any time assign to any bank or other  institution  with the
consent,  provided there exists no Event of Default, of Administrative Agent and
of Borrower,  which consents shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (such
assignee, a "Consented Assignee"), or to one or more banks or other institutions
which are majority owned subsidiaries of a Bank or to the Parent of a Bank or to
a Related Entity (each  Consented  Assignee,  subsidiary  bank or institution or
Related  Entity,  an  "Assignee")  all, or a  proportionate  part of all, of its
rights and obligations  under this Agreement and its Note(s),  and such Assignee
shall assume rights and  obligations,  pursuant to an Assignment  and Assumption
Agreement  executed by such Assignee and the assigning  Bank,  provided that, in
each  case,  after  giving  effect  to  such  assignment,  the  Assignee's  Loan
Commitment,  and, in the case of a partial assignment, the assigning Bank's Loan
Commitment, each will be equal to or greater than $5,000,000. Upon (i) execution
and delivery of such instrument, (ii) payment by such Assignee to the Bank of an
amount equal to the purchase price agreed between the Bank and such Assignee and
(iii)  at   Administrative   Agent's   option,   payment  by  such  Assignee  to
Administrative  Agent of a fee, for Administrative  Agent's own account,  in the
amount of $3,500,  on account of  Administrative  Agent's  fees and  expenses in
connection  with such  assignment,  such Assignee  shall be a Bank Party to this
Agreement and shall have all the rights and  obligations  of a Bank as set forth
in such  Assignment  and Assumption  Agreement,  and the assigning Bank shall be
released  from its  obligations  hereunder  to a  corresponding  extent,  and no
further consent or action by any party shall be required.  Upon the consummation
of any assignment  pursuant to this paragraph,  substitute Notes shall be issued
to the  assigning  Bank (in the case of a partial  assignment)  and  Assignee by
Borrower,  in exchange for the return of the original  Note(s).  The obligations
evidenced  by such  substitute  Notes  shall  constitute  "Obligations"  for all
purposes of this  Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall be secured by
the Mortgages.  In connection with Borrower's  execution of substitute  Notes as
aforesaid,  Borrower shall deliver to Administrative  Agent such evidence of the
due  authorization,  execution  and  delivery  of the  substitute  Notes and any
related  documents  as  Administrative  Agent  may  reasonably  request.  If the
Assignee  is not  incorporated  under the Laws of the  United  States or a state
thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable
hereunder  for  its  account,  deliver  to  Borrower  and  Administrative  Agent
certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States
federal income taxes in accordance with Section 10.13.

     Any Bank may at any time  freely  assign  all or any  portion of its rights
under this Agreement and its Notes to a Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment
shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

                                       62

     Borrower   recognizes   that  in  connection   with  a  Bank's  selling  of
Participations  or making of assignments,  any or all  documentation,  financial
statements,  appraisals and other data, or copies thereof,  relevant to Borrower
or the  Loans  may be  exhibited  to and  retained  by any such  Participant  or
Assignee or prospective Participant or Assignee. In addition, such documentation
etc. may be exhibited to and retained by  Affiliates  of a Bank.  In  connection
with a Bank's  delivery of any financial  statements  and appraisals to any such
Participant or Assignee or prospective  Participant or Assignee, such Bank shall
also deliver its standard confidentiality statement indicating that the same are
delivered on a  confidential  basis.  Borrower  agrees to provide all assistance
reasonably  requested  by a Bank to enable such Bank to sell  Participations  or
make  assignments of its Loan as permitted by this Section.  Each Bank agrees to
provide Borrower with notice of all Participations sold by such Bank.

     SECTION 12.06.  <U>Addition and Release of Properties</U>.  (a) (a) Subject to the
conditions set forth below in this Section, Borrower shall have the right to (1)
cause a  shopping  center  property  that is  wholly  owned by a Person in which
Borrower  owns,  directly  or  indirectly,  a 100%  beneficial  and  controlling
interest  and that is approved by all of the Banks,  in their sole and  absolute
discretion, to be encumbered by a Mortgage and thereby become a Property and (2)
obtain the  release of a Property  (other than  Twelve  Oaks) from the  Mortgage

calendar quarter for which financial results are required hereunder to have been
reported by  Borrower,  as  adjusted  (if  applicable)  by all  acquisitions  or
Dispositions of assets subsequent to the end of such quarter as required by this
Agreement  and taking into account the effects of the addition or release of the
Property).

     (b) The  addition of a property as a Property  shall only be in  connection

     appropriate land records, together with executed financing statements under
     the  Uniform  Commercial  Code of all  jurisdictions  necessary  or, in the

     personal property created by said  mortgage/deed of trust, (y) an indemnity
     agreement regarding Hazardous Materials, duly executed by Borrower and said
     owner and (z) a guaranty of payment of Borrower's obligations hereunder and

     trust,  indemnity  and  guaranty  to be  substantially  in the  form of the
     Mortgages,   Indemnities  and  Guaranty  with  respect  to  the  Properties
     initially  given as  security  for the  Loans  but  with  such  changes  as
     Administrative Agent reasonably deems necessary or advantageous under local
     law or in connection with the particular Property);

     Administrative Agent may reasonably request;

          (vi)  Administrative  Agent shall have  received (x) each of the items

     hereunder to have been reported by Borrower, as adjusted (if applicable) by
     all  acquisitions or  Dispositions of assets  subsequent to the end of such
     quarter as required by this  Agreement and taking into account the addition
     of the proposed Property) with the covenants of Borrower enumerated in said
     clause (b);

          (viii)  Administrative Agent shall have received such other documents,
     opinions   (including  opinions  of  counsel)  and  assurances  as  it  may

     reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses in connection  with the addition of the
     proposed Property, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel.

     (c) The release of any Property shall only be in connection with Borrower's

to the satisfaction of the following conditions:

          (i) There shall exist no Default or Event of Default;

          (ii) Administrative Agent shall have received at least forty-five (45)
     days' prior notice of the date of the proposed release;

                                       64

     which  financial  results are required  hereunder to have been  reported by
     Borrower  (and taking into account the release of the  Property),  with the
     covenants of Borrower enumerated in said clause (b) (if necessary, Borrower
     may make a payment in reduction of the outstanding principal balance of the
     Notes in an amount such that said covenants are complied with);

          (iv) The Total  Loan  Commitment  does not  exceed  65% of the "as is"

     Properties  which will remain as security for the Loans,  as evidenced,  at
     the  option  of the  Required  Banks,  by an  update  to  the  appraisal(s)
     delivered pursuant to paragraph (7) of Section 4.01 or subparagraph (b)(vi)
     of this Section,  as the case may be, which updated  appraisal(s)  shall be

     satisfactory to the Required Banks; and

          (v)   Administrative   Agent  shall  have  received   payment  of  its
     out-of-pocket   expenses  in  connection   with  such  release,   including

     Upon the release of a Property as aforesaid,  the relevant  Mortgagor shall
be released and discharged automatically from its obligations under the Guaranty
and under the Indemnity executed by it, and Administrative Agent shall deliver a
letter to such Mortgagor confirming said release and discharge.

     SECTION 12.07. <U>Documentation Satisfactory</U>.  All documentation required from
or to be submitted on behalf of Borrower in connection  with this  Agreement and
the documents  relating hereto shall be subject to the prior approval of, and be
satisfactory in form and substance to,  Administrative  Agent,  its counsel and,
where  specifically  provided  herein,  the Banks.  In addition,  the persons or
parties  responsible  for the execution and delivery of, and signatories to, all
of such  documentation,  shall be acceptable to, and subject to the approval of,
Administrative Agent and its counsel and the Banks.

     SECTION 12.08.  <U>Notices,  Etc</U>. Except as expressly provided otherwise,  all
notices,  demands,  consents,  approvals  and  statements  required or permitted
hereunder  shall be in  writing  and shall be  deemed to have been  sufficiently
given or served for all purposes when presented personally, three (3) days after
mailing by registered or certified mail,  postage prepaid,  or one (1) day after
delivery to a nationally recognized overnight courier service providing evidence
of the date of delivery,  addressed  to a party at its address on the  signature
page hereof or of the applicable Assignment and Assumption Agreement, or at such
other  address of which a party shall have notified the party giving such notice
in writing in accordance with the foregoing requirements.

     SECTION 12.09. <U>Setoff</U>. In addition to (and without limitation of) any right
of setoff,  bankers' lien or  counterclaim a Bank may otherwise  have, each Bank
shall be entitled,  but only with the prior  consent of the Required  Banks,  to
offset balances (general or special, time or demand,  provisional or final) held
by it for the account of Borrower at any of such Bank's  offices,  in Dollars or
in any other currency, against any amount payable by Borrower to such Bank under
this  Agreement or such Bank's Notes,  or any other Loan  Document  which is not
paid

                                       65

when due  (regardless  of whether such  balances are then due to  Borrower),  in
which case it shall promptly notify Borrower and  Administrative  Agent thereof;
provided  that such  Bank's  failure  to give such  notice  shall not affect the
validity  thereof.  Payments  by  Borrower  hereunder  or under the  other  Loan
Documents shall be made without setoff or counterclaim.

     SECTION  12.10.<U>Gross-Up for Taxes</U>. All payments made by Borrower under this
Agreement  and the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without  deduction
or  withholding  for or on account  of, any present or future  income,  stamp or
other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings,
now or  hereafter  imposed,  levied,  collected,  withheld  or  assessed  by any
Governmental  Authority,  excluding  income  taxes and  franchise or other taxes
(imposed in lieu of income taxes)  imposed on a Bank as a result of a present or
former  connection  between such Bank and the  jurisdiction of the  Governmental
Authority  imposing such tax or any political  subdivision  or taxing  authority
thereof or therein  (other  than any such  connection  arising  solely from such
Bank's having  executed,  delivered or performed its  obligations  or received a
payment  under,  or  enforced,   this  Agreement  or  its  Note).  If  any  such
non-excluded  taxes,  levies,  imposts,  duties,  charges,  fees,  deductions or
withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to be withheld from any amounts
payable to such Bank hereunder or under its Note, the amounts so payable to such
Bank shall be  increased  to the extent  necessary  to yield to such Bank (after
payment of all  Non-Excluded  Taxes)  interest or any such other amounts payable
with  respect  to its Loan at the  rates  or in the  amounts  specified  in this
Agreement and its Note; <U>provided</U>,  <U>however</U>,  that Borrower shall not be required
to increase any such amounts  payable to such Bank if such Bank is not organized
under the Laws of the United  States or a state  thereof  and such Bank fails to
comply with the requirements of Section 10.13.  Whenever any Non-Excluded  Taxes
are payable by Borrower,  as promptly as possible thereafter Borrower shall send
to  Administrative  Agent for the  account of such Bank a  certified  copy of an
original  official  receipt  received by Borrower  showing payment  thereof.  If
Borrower fails to pay any Non-Excluded  Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to  Administrative  Agent the  required  receipts or
other required documentary evidence,  Borrower shall indemnify such Bank for any
incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become payable by such Bank as
a result of any such failure.  The  agreements in this Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Notes and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

     SECTION 12.11. <U>Twelve Oaks Partial Releases</U>. Provided there exists no Event
of  Default,  Administrative  Agent  shall  release  the  lien  of the  Mortgage
encumbering  Twelve Oaks from  portions of the  unimproved  parcel  described as
Parcel D (the "Lake Parcel") in Schedule A to such  Mortgage,  such parcel being
the only  portion of the Twelve Oaks  premises  located  outside of the shopping
center's "ring road" (each such portion,  a "Release Parcel") in connection with
TOLLC's simultaneous conveyance thereof;  <U>provided</U>,  <U>however</U>, that no portion of
the lake located on the Lake Parcel shall be released.  All such releases  shall
be subject, in each case, to Administrative Agent's receipt of (A) evidence that
the balance of the Twelve Oaks premises constitutes one or more separate tax and
zoning lots and an endorsement to the title  insurance  policy for said Mortgage
insuring  that the lien thereof will not be impaired by virtue of the release of
the  Release  Parcel,  (B)  a  current  survey  of  the  Twelve  Oaks  premises,

                <U> LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 1992 INCENTIVE OPTION PLAN</U></B>

          <B>(As Amended and Restated Effective as of September 30, 1997)</B>

     <B>WHEREAS,</B> THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP,  a Delaware limited
partnership  (including  any  successor  thereto  "TRG"  or  the  "Partnership")
maintains The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership  1992  Incentive  Option
Plan (as Amended and Restated  Effective as of September 30, 1997) (the "Plan");
and

     <B>WHEREAS,</B>  pursuant to Section  8.1 of the Plan,  TRG has the  authority  to
amend  the  Plan  and to  make  such  other  changes  as the  Partnership  deems
advisable; and

     <B>WHEREAS,</B>  TRG desires to amend the Plan effective January 1, 2002 to permit
an  Optionee's  payment  of the  Exercise  Price  in the  form of  Units  of the
Partnership, and to make such other changes as TRG deems desirable.

     <B>NOW, THEREFORE,</B> the Plan is hereby amended as follows:

     1. Section 2.8 is amended in its entirety by substituting the following:

          <B>"2.8 `Compensation  Committee'</B> means the Compensation Committee of the
     Board of  Directors  of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. or such other  committee or
     individuals  designated by the Compensation  Committee to act on its behalf
     with respect to the Plan."

     2. The references in the Plan to the  "Partnership  Committee" are replaced
by the term  "Managing  General  Partner"  and  Section  2.32 is  amended in its
entirety by substituting the following:

          <B>"2.32 `Managing General Partner'</B> means the Managing General Partner of
     TRG as set forth in the Partnership  Agreement,  which is Taubman  Centers,
     Inc."

     3. Section 2.42 is amended in its entirety by substituting the following:

          <B>"2.42 `TTC'</B>  means The  Taubman  Company  L.L.C.,  a Delaware  limited
     liability company."

     4.  Section  4.1 is hereby  amended in its  entirety  by  substituting  the
following:

          <B>"4.1 Units of Partnership Interest Available.</B> Incentive Options may be
     granted by TRG under the Plan from time to time to  purchase  an  aggregate
     Eight Million,  Eight Hundred  Eighty-Seven  Thousand,  Eight Hundred Sixty
     (8,887,860) Units of Partnership  Interest, as said number may be increased
     by the  action of the  Managing  General  Partner.  In the  event  that the
     Exercise  Price  for  Options  is paid in the form of Units of  Partnership
     Interest pursuant to Section 7.14, only those Units of Partnership Interest
     issued to the  Optionee  in excess  of the  number of Units of  Partnership
     Interest delivered by the Optionee as payment of the Exercise Price will be
     counted  for  purposes  of  determining  the  remaining  number of Units of
     Partnership  Interest to be made the subject of Incentive Options available
     for grant under the Plan."

                                      -1-

     5. Section 7.14 of the Plan is amended in its entirety by substituting  the
following:

          <B>"7.14 Payment of the Exercise Price.</B>  The purchase price for each Unit
     of  Partnership  Interest  in  TRG  to be  purchased  upon  exercise  of an
     Incentive  Option  granted  under the Plan shall be paid in full in cash by
     the Optionee pursuant to the Option Agreement and in an amount equal to the
     Exercise  Price.  An Optionee may also elect to pay the purchase price upon
     exercise  of an  Incentive  Option  in the  form of  Units  of  Partnership
     Interest which have been  outstanding  for six (6) months by delivering the
     number of Units of Partnership  Interest which have a Fair Market Value (as
     defined in Section 2.18) equal to the Exercise  Price.  Upon receipt of the
     Exercise  Price  (whether in cash or by surrender  of Units of  Partnership
     Interest),  TRG  shall  issue  the  total  number  of Units of  Partnership
     Interest to which the Optionee has become  entitled in accordance  with the
     terms of the Option Agreement."

     6. Except as expressly  set forth herein,  the terms and  provisions of the
Plan shall continue unmodified and are hereby confirmed and ratified.

     7. This  Amendment  shall be binding  upon and inure to the  benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

     8. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Michigan.

                        AND HOLDINGS MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS</B>

     2.1. <U>General</U>. Except as expressly permitted by this Agreement,  without the
prior  written  approval of the other  Shareholder,  neither  Shareholder  shall
Transfer  all or any shares of the Common  Stock held by such  Shareholder.  Any
attempt to Transfer  shares of Common Stock in violation of this Agreement shall
be

                                       6

void <I>ab initio</I>.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holdings may Transfer all or any
portion  of  Holdings'  shares  of Common  Stock to a  Permitted  Transferee  of
Holdings,  provided that such Permitted Transferee agrees in writing to be bound
by all of the terms and restrictions set forth in this Agreement.
     Without TRG's prior written consent,  Holdings will not permit any Holdings
Member to  Transfer  all or any  portion of his  Holdings  Membership  Interest,
except that each Holdings Member may Transfer his Holdings  Membership  Interest
to a Permitted Transferee of such Holdings Member,  provided that such Permitted
Transferee  agrees in writing  to be bound by all of the terms and  restrictions
set forth in this Agreement.
     In the event that either  Shareholder  Transfers  all or any portion of the
Common Stock held by it in a transaction in full  compliance with the provisions
of this Article 2, any consent,  vote, decision, or the like required under this
Agreement  shall  require  the  written  approval of a majority of the shares of
Common Stock originally held by Holdings or TRG, as the case may be.
     2.2. <U>Right of First Refusal on TRG's Common Stock</U>. If at any time after the
expiration of the option  (defined  below) without its exercise,  TRG receives a
Third Party Offer that TRG desires to accept,  TRG shall first  submit the Third
Party  Offer to the AAT Trust and the  Company,  and the AAT Trust shall have 30
days within which to deliver an Election  Notice.  If the AAT Trust  delivers an
Election  Notice  within such 30-day period,  the AAT Trust shall  purchase  the
shares  of  Common  Stock  that are the  subject  of the  Third  Party  Offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions  contained in the Third Party Offer. If
the AAT Trust advises TRG that it does not intend to deliver an Election  Notice
or the AAT Trust fails to

                                       7

deliver an Election  Notice  within such 30-day period,  the Company  shall then
have 15 days from the  earlier of the date the AAT Trust so advises  TRG or such
30-day  period  has  elapsed,  as the case may be,  within  which to  deliver an
Election  Notice.  If the Company delivers an Election Notice within such 15-day
period,  the  Company  shall  purchase  the shares of Common  Stock that are the
subject of the Third Party  Offer in  accordance  with the terms and  conditions
contained  in the Third  Party  Offer.  If neither the AAT Trust nor the Company
delivers an Election Notice within the applicable period, TRG shall then have 30
days within which to complete the sale of the subject  shares to the Third Party
Offeror on terms and conditions,  and for a price, not less favorable to TRG, in
each and every respect, than the terms,  conditions,  and price contained in the
Third Party Offer.  Any sale by TRG pursuant to the  provisions  of this Section
2.2 shall be  conditioned  upon the  receipt by the Company and the AAT Trust of
the agreement,  in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company and
the  AAT  Trust,  of the  purchaser  to be  bound  by all of the  terms  hereof,
including, without limitation, the provisions of this Section 2.2.
     2.3.  <U>Option to Purchase TRG's Common Stock</U>.  TRG hereby grants the Company
an irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase all, but not a portion,  of the
shares of Common Stock held by TRG. The Option shall be  exercisable  upon TRG's
failure to renew the Master Services  Agreement (an "<U>Expiration  Event</U>") or upon
TRG's  termination of the Master  Services  Agreement for cause, as set forth in
the Master Services Agreement (a "<U>Termination Event</U>"). If the Company determines
to exercise the Option (a) in the case of an Expiration Event, the Company shall
give TRG written notice of exercise (the  "<U>Expiration  Election  Notice</U>") at any
time within the one year period prior to the end of the then current term of

                                       8

the Master Services  Agreement,  and (b) in the case of a Termination Event, the
Company  shall give TRG written  notice of exercise (the  "<U>Termination  Election
Notice</U>") at any time within 90 days after the date on which the Company receives
written notice from TRG of the Termination  Event. If the Company  exercises the
Option,  the closing date for the  purchase of TRG's Common Stock (the  "<U>Closing
Date</U>") shall be on a date  selected by the Company (upon at least 10 days' prior
written  notice  to TRG)  that is not  more  than 60 days  after  delivery  of a
Termination  Election Notice or an Expiration  Election Notice,  as the case may
be;  however,  if the Company  has also  elected to  purchase  TRG's  membership
interest in the Manager  pursuant to the Operating  Agreement,  the Closing Date
shall  be the  date on which  the  Company  (or its  designee)  purchases  TRG's
membership interest in the Manager.
     Upon the  Company's  exercise of the Option,  the Company  shall direct the
Company's independent public accountants to certify the Company's  determination
of Book Value as of the Valuation Date (the  "<U>Valuation  Date Book Value</U>").  The
purchase  price for TRG's shares of Common Stock shall be the product of (a) the
Valuation Date Book Value,  less any dividends (other than share dividends) that
the Company has declared and paid subsequent to the Valuation  Date,  multiplied
by (b) a  fraction,  the  numerator  of which  shall be the  number of shares of
Common Stock held by TRG, and the  denominator  of which shall be the then total
number of  outstanding  shares of  capital  stock of the  Company.  TRG shall be
entitled to its pro rata share of any dividends declared but unpaid prior to the
Valuation Date.
     On the Closing Date, the Company shall pay the purchase price, by certified
check (same day funds) or by wire transfer of immediately  available  funds.  On
the

                                       9

Closing  Date,  TRG shall  transfer to the Company  (or its  designee)  good and
marketable title to TRG's shares of Common Stock,  free and clear of any claims,
liens, encumbrances,  restrictions, or rights of others, excluding any rights or
restrictions  created  or  imposed  by this  Agreement  or by  federal  or state
securities laws or regulations. TRG shall deliver such stock certificates, stock
powers,  and other  instruments  as the  Company  (or its  designee)  reasonably
requests  to  ensure  that the  Company  (or its  designee,  as the case may be)
acquires title to the Common Stock in the condition  required under this Section
2.3. The Company  shall,  if requested by TRG,  deliver an investment  letter in
customary form confirming compliance with Article 3 hereof.
     2.4.  <U>Exercise  of  Option</U>.  TRG and  Holdings  hereby  agree that upon the
occurrence of an Expiration Event or a Termination  Event,  they shall cause the
Company to (i)  exercise the Option and (ii)  acquire  TRG's  entire  membership
interest in the Manager as provided in Article VIII of the Operating  Agreement,
unless  they  agree  otherwise  in  writing.

                                  <B> ARTICLE 3.

     It is  acknowledged  that it will be  impossible  to  measure  in money the

                  <B>THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
                    AND THE TAUBMAN COMPANY LLC ELECTION AND
                            OPTION DEFERRAL AGREEMENT
                            _________________________</B>


     This Agreement dated as of the 28th  day of December,  2001 is entered into
by and between The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership,  a Delaware limited
partnership  ("TRG"),  The Taubman  Company  LLC, a Delaware  limited  liability
company, (the "Manager") and Robert S. Taubman (the "Executive").

                                    <B>RECITALS:</B>

     WHEREAS, TRG has engaged Manager, on an exclusive basis, to provide various
services,   including   management,   leasing,   development,   acquisition  and
administrative services, to TRG.

     WHEREAS,   TRG  currently   maintains  The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited
Partnership 1992 Incentive Option Plan (as amended and restated  effective as of
September  30, 1997) (the  "Incentive  Option  Plan") to provide  incentives  to
employees  of the  Manager to remain in the employ of Manager for the benefit of
TRG, to encourage a proprietary  interest in TRG, and to attract  employees with
outstanding qualifications to serve the Manager on behalf of TRG;

     WHEREAS,  Executive  was  granted an  incentive  option (the  "Option")  to
purchase Fifteen Hundred (1,500) Units of Partnership  Interest (as such term is
defined in the  Incentive  Option Plan)  pursuant to an Option  Agreement  dated
November 20, 1992 (the "1992 Option Agreement"). In connection with the division
of Units of  Partnership  Interest  effective  September  30, 1997,  Executive's
Option to purchase 1,500 Units of Partnership Interest was converted,  effective
as of September  30,  1997,  into an Option to purchase two million nine hundred
sixty  two  thousand,  six  hundred  twenty  (2,962,620)  Units  of  Partnership
Interest;

     WHEREAS, Executive wishes to give up his right to receive the Units subject
to the Option by making an election to defer  receipt of the Units  attributable
to the gains that would be recognized  upon the exercise of the Option  pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

     WHEREAS,  TRG,  the Manager and  Executive,  wish to modify the 1992 Option
Agreement  to provide for the  deferral of gains that would be  recognized  upon
Executive's  exercise  of the  Option  and to  credit  such  gains  to  Deferred
Compensation  Account (as defined in paragraph 1)  maintained  by the Manager in
consideration of the valuable services Executive performs for the benefit of the
Manager and TRG.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  TRG, the Manager and  Executive,  intending to be legally
bound, and in consideration of the agreements set forth herein,  hereby agree as
follows:


     1. <U><B>Election to Defer and  Investment  of Option Gain.</B></U>  Upon exercise of the
Option  and in lieu of his  receiving  the full  number of Units  subject to the
Option,   Executive  hereby  elects  to  defer  receipt  of  all  of  the  Units
attributable to the gain that would,  but for this Agreement,  be recognized for
federal and state  income tax  purposes  (the  "Gain")  upon his exercise of the
Option.  Contemporaneously  with Executive's  exercise of the Option,  TRG shall
direct the Manager to establish a  bookkeeping  reserve  account (the  "Deferred
Compensation  Account") to reflect the amount of the Gain. The Gain shall be the
amount  equal to the Fair Market  Value of Units of  Partnership  subject to the
Option on the Date of  Exercise  minus  the  Exercise  Price (as such  terms are
defined  in the  Incentive  Option  Plan).  The amount of Gain  credited  to the
Deferred  Compensation  Account  shall be deemed  invested  in phantom  units of
partnership  interest in TRG ( the  "Notional  Units").  A Notional Unit will be
utilized solely as a device for the measurement and determination of the amounts
to be paid to or for the benefit of  Executive  pursuant to this  Agreement  and
will not under any circumstances constitute or be treated as a trust fund of any
kind. The actual number of Units to which  Executive would otherwise be entitled
under the Option  Agreement  upon exercise of the Option shall be reduced by the
number of Notional Units.

          (a) <U>Distribution Equivalents.</U>  On each date in which holders of actual
     Units of  Partnership  Interest  receive  distributions  in respect of such
     Units of Partnership Interest, the Manager shall distribute to Executive an
     amount  equal to (i) the  distribution  amount  paid with  respect  to each
     actual Unit of Partnership  Interest on such distribution date,  multiplied
     by (ii) the number of Notional Units credited to the Deferred  Compensation
     Account as of the business day immediately preceding such distribution date
     (the "Distribution Equivalents").  Distribution Equivalents will be paid to
     Executive in cash lump sum payments.

          (b) <U>No Rights as a Partner.</U>  A Notional  Unit shall not  represent  an
     ownership  interest in actual  Units of  Partnership  Interest of TRG,  and
     Executive  shall  have no rights as a partner  in TRG with  respect  to the
     Notional Units credited to the Deferred Compensation Account.

     2. <B><U>Vesting of Deferred  Compensation  Account.</U></B>  The  Deferred  Compensation
Account shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable at all times.

     3. <B><U>Payment of Deferred  Compensation  Account.</U></B>  All amounts credited to the
Deferred  Compensation  Account shall be distributed to Executive in the form of
actual  Units of  Partnership  Interest  upon  the  earlier  of (a)  Executive's
termination of employment for any reason,  or (b) the ten (10) year  anniversary
of  Executive's  Date  of  Exercise  of the  Option.  Payment  shall  be made in
substantially  equal annual  installments  over a ten year period with the first
payment  commencing on the first day of the month following (a) or (b) above and
each subsequent payment on the anniversary thereof.

     Any  portion  of the  Deferred  Compensation  Account  which  has not  been
distributed  to Executive  shall  continue to be invested in Notional  Units and
Executive  shall continue to receive  Distribution  Equivalents  with respect to
Notional Units in the Deferred Compensation Account.

                                       2

     4.  <B><U>Designation of  Beneficiary.</U></B>  Executive  shall designate in writing and
file with the Manager a designated beneficiary to receive benefits payable under
this  Agreement  in the event of his death  prior to his  receipt of all amounts
credited to the Deferred Compensation Account. If Executive has not designated a
beneficiary,  such death  benefit shall be paid to his estate.  Any  beneficiary
designation  may be revoked or modified at any time by  Executive  but only in a
writing filed with the Manager.

     5.  <B><U>Amendment.</U></B>  This  Agreement may be amended by the written  agreement of
TRG, the Manager and Executive at any time; provided, however, that no amendment
shall reduce any benefits in which  Executive has a vested interest prior to the
effective date of the amendment.

     6. <B><U>Termination Upon Change of Control.</U></B>  Notwithstanding any other provision
of this  Agreement,  this Agreement will terminate  immediately  and all amounts
credited to the Deferred  Compensation  Account will be distributed to Executive
in a lump sum payment in the form of actual Units of Partnership Interest upon a
Change of Control  Event (as  defined in the  Incentive  Option  Plan)  which is
followed  by  Executive's  termination  of  employment  within six months of the
Change of Control Event.

     7. <B><U>Governing Law.</U></B> This Agreement  shall be construed in accordance with the
internal  laws of the  State of  Michigan  (excluding  the  choice  of law rules
thereof).

     8. <B><U>Alienation or Assignment of Benefits.</U> </B> Benefits payable pursuant to this
Agreement shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation,  alienation, sale,
transfer, or assignment.

     9.  <B><U>Ownership of Deferred  Compensation  Account.</U></B>  Title to and  beneficial
ownership of any assets, whether Notional Units, Distribution Equivalents,  cash
or other  investments  which the  Manager  or TRG may set aside to  fulfill  its
deferred  obligation  under this  Agreement  shall at all times  remain with the
Manager  or TRG and  neither  Executive  nor his  beneficiary  shall  under  any
circumstances  acquire  any  property  interest  in any  specific  assets of the
Manager or TRG. Nothing contained in this Agreement and no action taken pursuant
to the  provisions  of this  Agreement  shall create or be construed to create a
fiduciary  relationship  between TRG or the Manager and  Executive  or any other
person.  Any funds which may be invested  under the provisions of this Agreement
shall  continue for all purposes to be part of the general assets of the Manager
or TRG and no  person  other  than the  Manager  or TRG  shall by  virtue of the
provisions of this Agreement have any interest in such funds. To the extent that
any person  acquires a right to receive  payments  from the Manager or TRG under
this  Agreement,  such right shall be no greater  than the right of an unsecured
general  creditor of the Manager or TRG. In the sole  discretion of the Manager,
all or any portion of the amounts credited to the Deferred  Compensation Account
may be contributed to a trust established by the Manager in connection with this
Agreement.  Neither Executive nor his beneficiary shall have the right to direct
or  require  that the  Manager  contribute  amounts to a trust.  Any  amounts so
contributed  shall be held,  invested and administered to provide benefits under
this  Agreement  except as otherwise  required in the  agreement  governing  the
trust.

                                       3

     10. <B><U>1992 Option Agreement.</U></B>  The 1992 Option Agreement,  as modified by this
Agreement with respect to Executive's  election to defer the Gain,  shall remain
in full force and effect.

     11. <B> <U>Miscellaneous.</U></B>  This Agreement is intended to be an unfunded,  top hat
plan available only to a management or highly  compensated  employee  within the
meaning of Sections 201(2),  301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 (as amended "ERISA").

     12. <B><U>Execution.</U></B>  To record the adoption of this Agreement,  TRG, the Manager
and  Executive  have caused the  execution  hereof as of the date first  written
above.
