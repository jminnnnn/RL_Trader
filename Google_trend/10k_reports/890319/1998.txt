                                    PART I

Item 1.  BUSINESS

The Company

  Taubman Centers, Inc. (the "Company" or "TCO") was incorporated in Michigan in
1973 and had its initial public offering ("IPO") in 1992. Upon completion of the
IPO, the Company became the managing general partner of The Taubman Realty Group
Limited Partnership ("TRG"). The Company has a 38.4% partnership interest in TRG
(which has increased from 36.7% at December 31, 1997 because of TRG's redemption
of a partner's  interest in January 1998). The Company,  through TRG, engages in
the ownership,  management, leasing, acquisition,  development, and expansion of
regional  shopping  centers  ("Taubman   Shopping  Centers"  or  "Centers")  and
interests therein.  TRG's portfolio,  as of December 31, 1997, includes 25 urban
and suburban  Taubman  Shopping  Centers  located in 12 states.  Two  additional
Centers are under  construction  and are  expected to open in November  1998 and
March 1999. Twenty-two of the Centers are "super-regional"  centers because they
have more than 800,000 square feet of gross leasable area. TRG also owns certain
regional retail shopping  center  development  projects and more than 99% of The
Taubman Company Limited  Partnership (the "Manager"),  which manages the Taubman
Shopping  Centers and provides  other  services to TRG and the Company.  See the
table on pages 12 and 13 of this report for  information  regarding  the Taubman
Shopping Centers and TRG's interests in them.

  The Company is a real estate  investment  trust,  or REIT,  under the Internal
Revenue  Code of  1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code").  In order  to  satisfy  the
provisions of the Code  applicable to REITs,  the Company must distribute to its
shareholders  at least 95% of its REIT  taxable  income and meet  certain  other
requirements.  TRG's partnership agreement provides that TRG will distribute, at
a minimum,  sufficient  amounts to its partners such that the Company's pro rata
share will enable the Company to pay shareholder  dividends  (including  capital
gains  dividends  that may be  required  upon TRG's sale of an asset)  that will
satisfy the REIT provisions of the Code.

Recent Developments

  For a  discussion  of business  developments  that  occurred in 1997,  see the
response to Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations."

The Shopping Center Business

  There are several types of retail shopping centers,  varying primarily by size
and marketing strategy.  Retail shopping centers range from neighborhood centers
of less than 100,000 square feet of GLA to regional and super-regional  shopping
centers.  Retail  shopping  centers in excess of 400,000  square feet of GLA are
generally referred to as "regional" shopping centers, while those centers having
in  excess  of  800,000  square  feet  of  GLA  are  generally  referred  to  as
"super-regional"  shopping centers. In this annual report on Form 10-K, the term
"regional shopping centers" refers to both regional and super-regional  shopping
centers. The term "GLA" refers to gross retail space, including anchors and mall
tenant areas,  and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail  space,  excluding
anchors.  The term "anchor"  refers to a department  store or other large retail
store.  The term "mall  tenants"  refers to stores (other than anchors) that are
typically specialty retailers and lease space in shopping centers.

Business of the Company

  The Company,  as managing general partner of TRG, is engaged in the ownership,
management, leasing, acquisition, development and expansion of regional shopping
centers.

  The Taubman Shopping Centers:

  o are strategically  located in major metropolitan  areas, many in communities
    that are among the most  affluent in the country,  including  New York City,
    Chicago,  Los Angeles,  San Francisco,  Denver,  Columbus,  Detroit,  Miami,
    Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.;

  o range in size between 438,000 and 2.3 million square feet of GLA and between
    133,000  and  942,000  square  feet of Mall GLA.  The  smallest  Center  has
    approximately 50 stores,  and the largest has  approximately  250 stores. Of
    the 25 Centers, 22 are super-regional shopping centers;

  o have  approximately  3,400  stores   operated  by  its  mall  tenants  under
    approximately 1,250 trade names;

  o have 88 anchors, operating under 17 trade names;

  o lease   approximately  76%  of  Mall  GLA  to  national  chains,   including
    subsidiaries  or  divisions of The Limited (The  Limited,  Limited  Express,
    Victoria's  Secret,  and others),  The Gap (The Gap,  Banana  Republic,  and
    others), and Woolworth  Corporation (Foot Locker, Kinney Shoes, and others);
    and

  o are among the most productive  (measured by mall tenants' average per square
    foot  sales) in the United  States.  In 1997,  mall  tenants in the  Taubman
    Shopping Centers  portfolio had average per square foot sales of $384, which
    is substantially  greater than the average for all regional shopping centers
    owned by public companies.

  The most  important  factor  affecting  the revenues  generated by the Taubman
Shopping  Centers is leasing to mall tenants  (primarily  specialty  retailers),
which represents over 90% of revenues.  Anchors account for  approximately 5% of
revenues  because many own their stores and, in general,  those that lease their
stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.

  TRG's ownership is concentrated in highly productive  super-regional  shopping
centers.  Of its 25 Centers,  19 had annual  rent rolls at December  31, 1997 of
over $10 million and 21 had annualized  sales per square foot in excess of $300.
The Company  believes that this level of  productivity  in the Taubman  Shopping
Centers  is  indicative  of  their  strong  competitive   position  and  is,  in
significant part,  attributable to TRG's business  strategy and philosophy.  The
Company believes that large shopping centers (including  regional and especially
super-regional shopping centers) are the least susceptible to direct competition
because (among other reasons)  anchors and large specialty  retail stores do not
find it  economically  attractive  to open  additional  stores in the  immediate
vicinity of an existing  location  for fear of  competing  with  themselves.  In
addition to the  advantage  of size,  the  Company  believes  that the  Centers'
success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics,  such
as design, layout, and amenities.


                                        2

Business Strategy And Philosophy

  The Company and TRG believe that the regional  shopping center business is not
simply a real estate development  business,  but rather an operating business in
which a retailing approach to the on-going management and leasing of the Taubman
Shopping Centers is essential. Thus TRG:

  o offers a large,  diverse  selection of retail  stores in each Center to give
    customers a broad selection of consumer goods and variety of price ranges;

  o endeavors to increase  overall mall  tenants'  sales,  and thereby  increase
    achievable rents, by leasing space to a constantly  changing mix of tenants;
    and

  o seeks to anticipate trends in the retailing  industry and emphasizes ongoing
    introductions  of new retail concepts into the Centers.  Due in part to this
    strategy,  a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first
    mall stores in the Taubman Shopping Centers. TRG believes that its execution
    of this  leasing  strategy  is unique in the  industry  and is an  important
    element in building and  maintaining  customer  loyalty and increasing  mall
    productivity.

  The Taubman  Shopping  Centers  compete for retail consumer  spending  through
diverse,  in-depth  presentations  of  predominantly  fashion  merchandise in an
environment  intended  to  facilitate  customer  shopping.  While  some  Taubman
Shopping Centers include stores that target high-end,  upscale  customers,  each
Center  is  individually  merchandised  in  light  of  the  demographics  of its
potential customers within convenient driving distance.

  TRG's leasing  strategy  involves  assembling a diverse mix of mall tenants in
each of the  Taubman  Shopping  Centers in order to attract  customers,  thereby
generating  higher  sales by mall  tenants.  High sales by mall tenants make the
Taubman Shopping Centers attractive to prospective  tenants,  thereby increasing
the rental rates that prospective  tenants are willing to pay. TRG implements an
active leasing strategy to increase the Taubman Shopping  Centers'  productivity
and to set minimum rents at higher  levels.  Elements of this  strategy  include
terminating leases of under-performing  tenants,  renegotiating existing leases,
and not leasing space to  prospective  tenants that (though viable or attractive
in certain ways) would not enhance a Taubman Shopping Center's retail mix.

  TRG's  strategy  is  carried  out by the  Manager,  which  is  more  than  99%
beneficially  owned  by TRG and  which  has been  engaged  to  provide  property
management and leasing  services for the Taubman Shopping Centers and to provide
corporate, development, administrative, and acquisition services for TRG and the
Company.  The Manager has been a leading  developer  and manager in the regional
shopping center business for more than 25 years.

Potential For Growth

  The Company's  principal  objective is to enhance  shareholder  value,  and it
conducts all of its operations  through TRG to achieve that result. TRG seeks to
maximize the financial  results of its dominant assets,  while pursuing a growth
strategy  that  includes  the  following  key  elements  1) an active new center
development program, 2) strategic acquisitions, 3) expansion of the Centers, and
4) internal growth.


                                        3

<PAGE>



Development of New Centers
- --------------------------

  The Company  believes that TRG has attractive  development  opportunities  and
intends to continue  to pursue an active  program of  regional  shopping  center
development.  The  Company  believes  that TRG has the  expertise,  through  the
Manager,  to develop  economically  attractive regional shopping centers through
intensive  analysis  of  local  retail  opportunities.  TRG  believes  that  the
development of new centers is the best use of TRG's capital and an area in which
TRG excels.  At any time,  TRG has numerous  potential  development  projects in
various stages, with the objective of opening,  on average,  one new center each
year.  During 1997,  TRG's  program of  development  produced the opening of two
centers.  In July,  TRG opened  The Mall at Tuttle  Crossing,  a  super-regional
shopping  center located in Columbus,  Ohio.  This Center was 95% leased at year
end. In November,  TRG opened  Arizona Mills,  a value  super-regional  shopping
center located in Tempe, Arizona. The Center opened 90% leased.

  Additionally,  two centers from TRG's development  program are currently under
construction.  In 1997,  TRG began  construction  on Great  Lakes  Crossing,  an
enclosed  value  super-regional  mall in  Auburn  Hills,  Michigan,  owned  by a
partnership in which TRG has an 80% controlling interest. The 1.4 million square
foot Center is  scheduled  to open in  November  1998,  at an  expected  cost of
approximately  $210 million.  Construction  continues on MacArthur Center, a new
Center in  Norfolk,  Virginia,  which is expected to open in March 1999 with 930
thousand square feet of GLA. The  three-level  Center will initially be anchored
by Nordstrom  and  Dillard's.  The project is a joint venture in which TRG has a
70% controlling interest and is projected to cost approximately $150 million.

  TRG's  policies with respect to  development  activities are designed to limit
the risks otherwise associated with development.  For instance, TRG entered into
an agreement to lease  Memorial City Mall, a center  adjacent to one of the most
affluent  residential  areas in  Houston,  Texas,  while  TRG  investigates  the
redevelopment  opportunities  of the center (see  "Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations  --  Liquidity  and
Capital   Resources  --  Capital   Spending"  for  further   discussion  of  the
transaction).  Also,  TRG generally does not intend to acquire land early in the
development  process, but will instead generally acquire options on land or form
partnerships with landholders holding potentially  attractive development sites,
typically exercising options only once it is prepared to begin construction.  In
addition, TRG does not intend to begin construction until a sufficient number of
anchor  stores have agreed to operate in the shopping  center,  such that TRG is
confident  that the  projected  sales and rents from Mall GLA are  sufficient to
earn a return on  invested  capital in excess of TRG's cost of  capital.  Having
historically followed these two principles, TRG's experience indicates that less
than 20% of the costs of the  development of a regional  shopping center will be
incurred prior to the construction  period;  however,  no assurance can be given
that TRG will continue to be able to so minimize pre-construction costs.

  While the Company  anticipates that TRG will continue to evaluate  development
projects  using  criteria,  including  financial  criteria  for rates of return,
similar  to those  employed  in the past,  no  assurances  can be given that the
adherence to these policies will produce  comparable  results in the future.  In
addition,  the  costs of  shopping  center  development  opportunities  that are
explored but  ultimately  abandoned  will, to some extent,  diminish the overall
return on development projects.

Strategic Acquisitions
- ----------------------

  TRG's  objective is to acquire  existing  centers that are compatible with the
quality  of TRG's  portfolio  (or can be  redeveloped  to that  level)  and that
satisfy TRG's strategic plans and pricing  requirements.  In 1997, TRG completed
three acquisitions totaling over $356 million.

  In September 1997, TRG acquired Regency Square shopping  center,  the dominant
fashion  center in the greater  Richmond,  Virginia  area,  for $123.9  million.
Regency  Square has  825,000  square  feet of GLA and is  anchored  by  Hecht's,
JCPenney and Sears.


                                        4

<PAGE>



  In December  1997,  TRG acquired The Falls  shopping  center in Miami for $156
million.  Representing  TRG's  entry into the  Florida  market,  The Falls is an
812,000 square foot Center, anchored by Bloomingdale's and Macy's.

  Also  in  December,  TRG  completed  the  $76.3  million  acquisition  of  the
participating leasehold interest in The Mall at Tuttle Crossing. Tuttle Crossing
opened in July as the  second  of TRG's two  properties  in the  Columbus,  Ohio
market.

  See "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results
of  Operations  --  Results of  Operations  --  Acquisitions"  and Note 3 to the
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of TRG  for  further  discussion  of  these
acquisitions.

  The Company and TRG believe  that TRG will have  additional  opportunities  to
acquire regional shopping centers,  or interests therein,  and will have certain
advantages in doing so.

  o First, the management  expertise of the Manager will enhance the leasing and
    operation of newly acquired  regional  shopping  centers.  If  opportunities
    exist to expand,  remodel, or re-merchandise the center through new leasing,
    the  Manager's  expertise  will assist TRG in making an informed  and timely
    evaluation  of  the  economic  consequences  of  such  activities  prior  to
    acquisition, as well as facilitate implementation of such activities.

  o Second,  a center  can be  acquired  for any  combination  of cash or equity
    interests in TRG or (subject to certain  limitations) the Company,  possibly
    creating the opportunity  for  tax-advantaged  transactions  for the seller,
    thereby  reducing the price that might  otherwise  have to be paid in an all
    cash transaction or making an opportunity available that would not otherwise
    exist. TRG is able to offer partnership  interests in itself in exchange for
    shopping center  interests,  allowing  sellers to diversify their interests,
    attain  liquidity not otherwise  available,  possibly defer taxes that might
    otherwise be due if the  interests  were instead sold for cash,  maintain an
    investment in the regional  shopping center  business,  and resolve concerns
    sellers  otherwise may have regarding future management of their properties.
    For  instance,  Biltmore  Fashion  Park's  selling  group  included  private
    investors who found it tax efficient to accept TRG partnership units as part
    of the consideration when TRG acquired the Center in 1994.

Expansions of the Taubman Shopping Centers
- ------------------------------------------

  A key element of growth is the strategic  expansion of existing  properties to
update and enhance  their  market  positions,  by replacing or adding new anchor
stores or increasing  mall tenant space.  Most of the Taubman  Shopping  Centers
have been  designed to  accommodate  expansions.  Expansion  projects  can be as
significant  as new  shopping  center  construction  in terms of scope and cost,
requiring   governmental  and  existing  anchor  store  approvals,   design  and
engineering  activities,  including rerouting  utilities,  providing  additional
parking areas or decking,  acquiring additional land, and relocating anchors and
mall  tenants  (all of which must take place  with a minimum  of  disruption  to
existing  tenants and  customers).  In 1997,  for example,  TRG opened a 135,000
square foot  expansion at Westfarms  in August  (followed by a new  Nordstrom in
September)  and new  mall  stores  totaling  50,000  square  feet of Mall GLA at
Biltmore throughout the year. Additionally, construction is in process at Cherry
Creek,  where a 132,000  square foot  expansion of the Mall GLA will open in the
fall of 1998.

  Consolidation of department stores has also strengthened  TRG's portfolio,  as
retailers  continue to be  attracted  to TRG's  dominant  and highly  productive
locations.  A recent  department store  conversion  includes  Bloomingdale's  at
Beverly  Center,  which  opened  in March  of  1997.

Internal Growth
- ---------------

  The Taubman Shopping Centers are among the most productive in the nation, when
measured by mall tenant's average sales per square foot. Higher sales per square
foot enable mall tenants to remain  profitable while paying occupancy costs that
are a greater  percentage of total sales.  As leases expire at the Centers,  TRG
has  consistently  been able, on a portfolio basis, to lease the available space
to an existing or new tenant at higher rates.

  Augmenting  this  growth,  TRG is  pursuing a number of new sources of revenue
from the Taubman Shopping  Centers.  For example,  TRG expects increased revenue
from its  specialty  leasing  efforts.  In recent years a new industry -- beyond
traditional  carts and  kiosks -- has  evolved,  with  more and  better  quality
specialty tenants.  TRG has put in place a company-wide program to maximize this
opportunity. 

Rental Rates

  As leases have expired in the Taubman Shopping Centers, TRG has generally been
able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant,
at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of
increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations
of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or
declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for
the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older
leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated
at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for
existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per
square foot base rent, excluding renewals, at Taubman Shopping Centers that have
been owned and open for five years.

  Average annualized rent on stores opening in 1997 excludes rent on stores with
greater than 40,000 square feet. TRG anticipates that the spread in 1998 will be
somewhat higher than in 1997. However, this statistic is difficult to predict in
part because  TRG's  leasing  policies and  practices  may result in early lease
terminations  with actual average  closing rents which may vary from the average
rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations. In addition, the opening or
closing of large  tenant  spaces,  which  generally  pay a lower rent per square
foot, can significantly affect the spread in a given year.

(1)  Excludes leases that expire in 1998 for which renewal leases or leases with
     replacement tenants have been executed as of December 31, 1997.
</TABLE>

  The Company  believes  that the  information  in the table is not  necessarily
indicative  of what will occur in the future  because  of several  factors,  but
principally  because TRG's leasing  policies and practices  create a significant
level of early lease terminations at the Taubman Shopping Centers.  For example,
the average  remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period
1992 to 1997 was  approximately  1.9 years.  The average  term of leases  signed
during 1997 and 1996 was approximately 7.3 years.

  In addition,  mall tenants at Taubman Shopping Centers may seek the protection
of the bankruptcy  laws,  which could result in the termination of such tenants'
leases and thus cause a  reduction  in the cash flow  generated  by the  Taubman
Shopping Centers. Prior to 1992, such bankruptcies had not affected more than 3%
of leases in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers in any one calendar  year.  In 1997,
approximately  1.5% of leases were so affected compared to 2.8% in 1996, 3.2% in
1995, 3.1% in 1994 and 4.0% in 1993. Since 1991, the annual provision for losses
on accounts receivable has been less than 2% of TRG's annual revenues.

Occupancy

  Mall tenant average  occupancy rates of the Taubman  Shopping  Centers for the
last five years are as follows:

                 Year                 Mall Tenant Average Occupancy
                 ----                 -----------------------------
                 1997                             87.6%
                 1996                             87.4%
                 1995                             88.0%
                 1994                             86.6%
                 1993                             86.5%

  Historically,  average  annual  occupancy for TRG as a whole has been within a
narrow band. In the last ten years,  average annual occupancy has ranged between
86.5% and 88.7%.

Major Tenants

  The combined  operations of The Limited,  Inc. accounted for approximately 12%
of leased Mall GLA as of December 31, 1997 and for approximately 10% of the 1997
base rent.  The largest of these,  in terms of square  footage and rent,  is The
Limited,  which accounted for approximately  2.3% of leased Mall GLA and 2.1% of
1997 base rent.  No other single  retail  company  accounted for more than 4% of
leased Mall GLA or 1997 base rent.

Environmental Matters

  All of the Taubman  Shopping  Centers  presently  owned by TRG (not  including
option  interests in the Development  Projects or any of the real estate managed
by the  Manager  but not  included  in TRG's  portfolio)  have been  subject  to
environmental  assessments.  The Company,  TRG, and the Manager are not aware of
any  environmental  liability  relating to the Taubman  Shopping  Centers or any
other  property  in which they have or had an  interest  (whether as an owner or
operator) that the Company  believes would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's  business,  assets,  or results of  operations.  No assurances  can be
given, however, that all environmental  liabilities have been identified or that
no prior  owner,  operator,  or current  occupant  has created an  environmental
condition not known to the Company, TRG, or the Manager. Moreover, no assurances
can be given that (i) future laws,  ordinances,  or regulations  will not impose
any  material  environmental  liability  or that (ii) the current  environmental
condition  of the Taubman  Shopping  Centers will not be affected by tenants and
occupants of the Taubman Shopping Centers, by the condition of properties in the
vicinity of the Taubman  Shopping  Centers (such as the presence of  underground
storage  tanks),  or by third  parties  unrelated to TRG,  the  Company,  or the
Manager.

  With respect to the matters described below, while there can be no assurances,
the Company  believes that such matters will not have a material  adverse effect
on the Company's business, assets, or results of operations.

  Beverly  Center is located over an oil field and several  abandoned oil wells,
and is adjacent to an active oil production  facility that operates numerous oil
and gas wells.  In the Los  Angeles  basin,  where  Beverly  Center is  located,
pockets of methane gas may be found in oil fields;  however,  elevated levels of
methane have not been detected at Beverly Center.

  Cherry  Creek is situated  on land that was used as a landfill  prior to 1950.
Because  of the past use of the site as a  landfill,  the site is  listed on the
United States  Environmental  Protection  Agency's  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Information System list.

  In the summer of 1997, geotechnical drilling activities were undertaken in the
former  gasoline  station  area  as  part  of a  parking  lot  expansion  at the
southeastern corner of the Cherry Creek site. The geotechnical soil samples were
observed  to have  petroleum  odors and  staining.  A  subsurface  environmental
investigation  subsequently revealed a limited zone of hydrocarbon  contaminated
soils, with no significant impacts to groundwater. Discussions with the Colorado
Department of Labor and Employment,  Oil Inspection  Section,  held in September
1997,  resulted  in a "passive  retardation"  remedial  approach  that relies on
natural processes to degrade the hydrocarbon contamination.  A Corrective Action
Plan was  submitted  in  February  1998 that  proposes  monitoring  the soil and
groundwater  quarterly  for a period  of two  years.  Acceptance  of the plan is
anticipated by May 1998.  Implementation of the plan poses no constraints to the
current expansion activity.

  Paseo  Nuevo is  located  in an area of  known  groundwater  contamination  by
tetrachloroethylene  ("PCE").  The  groundwater  under and  around  the site was
monitored for six years before, during, and after construction of the center. No
on-site sources of PCE were identified during  construction.  The Regional Water
Quality Control Board has given approval to discontinue  the monitoring  program
because the PCE levels remained relatively constant over the six-year period and
do not exceed the state standard for PCE in drinking water.

  There  are  asbestos  containing  materials  ("ACMs")  at most of the  Taubman
Shopping  Centers,  primarily  in the form of floor  tiles,  roof  coatings  and
mastics.  The floor  tiles,  roof  coatings  and mastics are  generally  in good
condition.  Fire-proofing material containing asbestos is present at some of the
Taubman  Shopping  Centers in limited  concentrations  or in limited areas.  The
Manager has developed and is implementing an operations and maintenance  program
that details  operating  procedures with respect to ACMs prior to any renovation
and that requires  periodic  inspection  for any change in condition of existing
ACMs.

Personnel

  The Company has engaged the Manager to provide certain management, accounting,
and other administrative services to the Company. TRG has engaged the Manager to
provide real estate  management,  acquisition,  development,  and administrative
services required by (or of) TRG or any of its properties.

  As of  December  31,  1997,  the  Manager  had 449  full-time  employees.  The
following  table  provides a breakdown of employees by  operational  areas as of
December 31, 1997:

Mortgage Debt

  The  following  table sets forth certain  information  regarding the mortgages
encumbering the Taubman  Shopping  Centers as of December 31, 1997. All mortgage
debt in the table  below is  nonrecourse  to TRG,  except  for debt  encumbering
Arizona Mills and MacArthur Center.  TRG has guaranteed the payment of principal
and interest on the mortgage debt of these Centers (the guarantee on the Arizona
Mills  mortgage is limited to the extent of TRG's 37% ownership  interest in the
joint venture owning the Center).  The loan agreements provide for the reduction
of the amounts  guaranteed as certain center  performance and valuation criteria
are met.  Biltmore,  Hilltop and  Stoneridge  are also  encumbered by assessment
bonds totaling approximately $4.8 million, which are not included in the table.

(1)  Debt may be prepaid with a yield maintenance prepayment penalty.
(2)  Prepayment can be made without penalty.
(3)  The loan is a  construction  facility with a maximum  availability  of $150
     million.
(4)  Commercial paper facility.  The maximum  availability under the facility is
     $75 million. Commercial paper is generally sold with a 30 day maturity.
(5)  The loan is a  construction  facility with a maximum  availability  of $145
     million.  The rate is capped at 9.5% until  maturity,  plus credit  spread,

(6)  The rate is capped at 6.5% through  January 1998 and from  February 1998 to
     maturity at 7%, plus credit spread, based on one month LIBOR.
(7)  The mortgage was prepayable on 12/01/97 (the earliest prepayment date) with
     a penalty of 4.5% of outstanding principal. In March 1998, the mortgage was
     extinguished with the proceeds of a $140 million,  6.60%, secured financing
     maturing  2008.  The net  proceeds  were  also  used to pay the  prepayment
     penalty of  approximately  $1.8  million.  In  addition,  proceeds  of $5.6
     million were used to close out a treasury  lock  agreement  entered into in
     1997, which resulted in an effective rate on the financing of approximately
     7%. The remaining  proceeds were distributed to the owners.  
(8)  The  lender  is  entitled  to  contingent  interest  equal to 20% of annual
     applicable receipts in excess of approximately $9.0 million.
(9)  The mortgage has a  prepayment  penalty of 6%,  declining by one-half of 1%

     penalty  of 1%,  plus an  amount  equal to ten  times  the  greater  of (i)
     contingent interest payable for the year immediately  preceding  prepayment
     or (ii) the  average  amount of  contingent  interest  for the three  years
     immediately prior to prepayment.
(10) The rate is capped at 8.55% until  maturity,  plus credit spread,  based on
     one month LIBOR.
(11) If the  loan  is  prepaid  between  7/1/98  and  1/3/02  there  is a  yield
     maintenance prepayment penalty.
(12) The loan is a  construction  facility  with a maximum  availability  of $55
     million. The rate on the construction  facility is capped until maturity at
     6.5%, plus credit spread.
(13) The interest  rate on $93.5 million was swapped to maturity at an effective
     annual rate of 5.4%.  The rate on the balance of the  financing,  which has
     been capped at a maximum annual rate,  including credit spread,  of 6.5% to
     maturity, floats at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 0.5%.

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------------------------------

  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial
Data, the Financial  Statements of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. and the Notes thereto
and the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements of The Taubman Realty Group Limited
Partnership and the Notes thereto.

General Background and Performance Measurement

  The Company,  through its interest in and as managing  general partner of TRG,
participates in TRG's Managed  Businesses.  TRG's Managed Businesses consist of:
(i) Taubman  Shopping  Centers that TRG  controls by  ownership  or  contractual
agreement,   development   projects  for  future   regional   shopping   centers
(Development   Projects)  and  The  Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the
Manager), (collectively, the Consolidated Businesses); and (ii) Taubman Shopping
Centers  partially  owned through joint ventures with third parties that are not
controlled  (Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures).  The Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
are  accounted  for under the  equity  method  in TRG's  Consolidated  Financial
Statements.

  Certain  aspects  of  the  performance  of the  Managed  Businesses  are  best
understood by measuring  their  performance as a whole,  without regard to TRG's
ownership interest. For example, mall tenant sales and shopping center occupancy
trends fit this  category  and are so analyzed  below.  In  addition,  trends in
certain  items of revenue  and  expense  are often best  understood  in the same
fashion, and the discussions following take this approach when appropriate. When
relevant,  these  items  are  also  discussed  separately  with  regard  to  the
Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.

Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues

  Over  the long  term,  the  level of mall  tenant  sales  is the  single  most
important  determinant of revenues of the Taubman  Shopping Centers because mall
tenants  provide  over 90% of these  revenues  and  because  mall  tenant  sales
determine  the  amount  of  rent,  percentage  rent,  and  recoverable  expenses
(together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However,
levels of mall tenant sales can be  considerably  more volatile in the short run
than total occupancy costs.

  The Company  believes that the ability of tenants to pay  occupancy  costs and
earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot
increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because
most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can
afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher
sales per square foot.

  The following table summarizes occupancy costs, excluding utilities,  for mall
tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.

                                           1997         1996         1995

  Mall  tenant  occupancy  costs  as a  percentage  of sales  decreased  in 1997
primarily  due to Centers  acquired in 1997 and late 1996 (Results of Operations
- --  Acquisitions).  These Centers have lower  occupancy costs than the portfolio
average and consequently provide a source of future revenue growth.

Occupancy

  Historically,  average  annual  occupancy for TRG as a whole has been within a
narrow band. In the last ten years,  average annual occupancy has ranged between
86.5% and 88.7%.  Mall tenant average  occupancy  rates for the last three years
are as follows:

                   Year                 Mall Tenant Average Occupancy
                   ----                 -----------------------------
                   1997                           87.6%
                   1996                           87.4
                   1995                           88.0

Rental Rates

  As leases have expired in the Taubman Shopping Centers, TRG has generally been
able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant,
at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of
increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations
of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or
declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for
the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older
leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated
at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for
existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per
square foot base rent,  excluding  renewals,  at the 18 Taubman Shopping Centers
that have been owned and open for five years.

                                            Store        Store     Difference

                                ----      ---------    ---------    ---------

1997                           $38.79      $37.62        $41.67       $4.05
1996                           $37.90      $33.39        $42.39       $9.00
1995                           $36.33      $32.96        $41.27       $8.31


  Average annualized rent on stores opening in 1997 excludes rent on stores with
greater than 40,000 square feet. TRG anticipates that the spread in 1998 will be
somewhat higher than in 1997. However, this statistic is difficult to predict in
part because  TRG's  leasing  policies and  practices  may result in early lease
terminations  with actual average  closing rents which may vary from the average
rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations. In addition, the opening or
closing of large  tenant  spaces,  which  generally  pay a lower rent per square
foot, can significantly affect the spread in a given year.

Seasonality

  The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant
sales  highest in the  fourth  quarter  due to the  Christmas  season,  and with
lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter
holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are
generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire
in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of
the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Accordingly,  revenues
and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.

  The following  table  summarizes  certain  quarterly  operating data for TRG's
Managed Businesses for 1997:

  Because the  seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of
minimum rents and  recoveries,  mall tenant  occupancy costs (the sum of minimum
rents,   percentage  rents  and  expense  recoveries)   relative  to  sales  are
considerably  higher in the first  three  quarters  than they are in the  fourth
quarter.  The following table summarizes  occupancy costs,  excluding utilities,
for mall tenants as a percentage of sales for each quarter of 1997:

Results of Operations

Equity Transactions

  In October 1997,  the Company used the $200 million  public  offering of eight
million shares of 8.3% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock to acquire
a Series A Preferred  Equity interest in TRG that entitles the Company to income
and distributions  (in the form of guaranteed  payments) in amounts equal to the
dividends  payable on the Company's Series A Preferred Stock. In addition to the
income  from  the  Company's  preferred  equity  interest  in TRG,  the  Company
continues to participate in the income allocable to TRG partnership  unitholders
to the extent of the Company's  ownership in TRG, including  adjustments arising
from the Company's  additional basis in TRG's net assets.  TRG bore all expenses
of the offering,  which have been  accounted for as a reduction of the proceeds.
TRG used the net proceeds to pay down debt under TRG's existing revolving credit
and  commercial  paper  facilities,  which were used to fund the  acquisition of
Regency Square in September 1997.

  In December 1996, the Company  purchased newly issued TRG units of partnership
interest with the $75 million proceeds from the Company's December 1996 offering
of 5.97 million  shares of common stock.  TRG bore all expenses of the Company's
offering which have been accounted for as a reduction of the proceeds from TRG's
issuance of units.  TRG used the net  proceeds  to pay down short term  floating
rate debt and to acquire La Cumbre  Plaza.  Also in December  1996,  the Company
exchanged common shares for TRG units of partnership interest newly issued under
TRG's  incentive  option  plan.  Additionally  in  1996,  TRG  issued  units  of
partnership  interest  in  connection  with  the  acquisition  of the  remaining
interest in Fairlane Town Center.

Acquisitions

  The following discussion of TRG's 1997 acquisitions  contains  forward-looking
statements  regarding  the  impact of these  acquisitions  on EBITDA  (EBITDA is
defined and described in Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Distributions).  The
actual  impact  may  vary  based  on a  variety  of  factors,  including  actual
occupancy,  rents achieved and operating expenses of the Centers.  See Note 3 to
TRG's   consolidated   financial   statements  for  further  discussion  of  the
acquisitions.

The Falls
- ---------

  In December 1997,  TRG acquired The Falls shopping  center for $156 million in
cash.  The  operating  results  of The  Falls  have been  consolidated  in TRG's
financial  statements from the acquisition  date. TRG borrowed under an existing
revolving credit facility to fund the  acquisition.  The acquisition is expected
to produce EBITDA of about 8% of the acquisition cost in 1998.

Regency Square
- --------------

  In September  1997, TRG acquired  Regency Square  (Regency)  shopping  center,
located in Richmond,  Virginia,  for $123.9 million in cash. The acquisition was
initially funded with borrowings under TRG's revolving credit facilities,  which
were paid down in October 1997 with the proceeds from TRG's issuance of Series A
Preferred  Equity.  The operating  results of Regency have been  consolidated in
TRG's financial statements from the acquisition date. Regency is expected to add
EBITDA of approximately 8% of the acquisition cost in 1998.

La Cumbre Plaza
- ---------------

  In December 1996,  TRG acquired a 100%  leasehold  interest in La Cumbre Plaza
(La Cumbre) located in Santa Barbara, California for $22.25 million in cash. The
acquisition  was  funded  with  proceeds  from  an  issuance  of  TRG  units  of
partnership interest.  The operating results of La Cumbre have been consolidated
in TRG's financial statements from the acquisition date.

Fairlane Town Center
- --------------------

  In July 1996, TRG completed  transactions  that resulted in the acquisition of
the 75% interest in Fairlane Town Center  (Fairlane)  previously held by a Joint
Venture Partner.  In connection with the  transaction,  TRG issued to the former
Joint  Venture  Partner  units  of  partnership   interest,   exchangeable   for
approximately  6.1 million  shares of the Company's  common  stock,  which had a
closing  price of $10.75 per share on the day prior to the  issuance  date.  TRG
also assumed mortgage debt of approximately $26 million, representing the former
Joint  Venture  Partner's  beneficial  interest  in the $34.6  million  mortgage
encumbering  the property.  TRG used unsecured debt to fund the repayment of the
9.73% mortgage and the prepayment  penalty of  approximately  $1.2 million.  The
operating  results  of  Fairlane  have  been  consolidated  in  TRG's  financial
statements  from the acquisition  date.  Prior to the  acquisition  date,  TRG's
interest  in  Fairlane  was   accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  as  an
Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture.  In January 1998,  TRG redeemed the former Joint
Venture Partner's units of partnership  interest for approximately $77.7 million
(including costs).

Paseo Nuevo
- -----------

  In June 1996, TRG acquired a 100% leasehold  interest in Paseo Nuevo,  located
in Santa  Barbara,  California,  for $37 million in cash. TRG borrowed under its
existing lines of credit to fund the acquisition. The operating results of Paseo
Nuevo have been consolidated in TRG's financial  statements from the acquisition
date.

New Centers and Expansions

  In November 1997,  TRG opened Arizona Mills, a 37% owned value  super-regional
shopping center located in Tempe, Arizona. The Center opened 90% leased.

  In July  1997,  TRG  opened  The Mall at  Tuttle  Crossing,  a  super-regional
shopping  center  located in Columbus,  Ohio.  The Center was 95% leased at year
end. TRG's  ownership  interest in The Mall at Tuttle  Crossing was subject to a
long-term  participating lease with Tuttle Crossing Holding Co., a subsidiary of
The Limited, Inc. (The Limited) for land and leasehold improvements. In December
1997,  TRG purchased  The Limited's  interests in the lease for $76.3 million in
cash and took fee simple title to the underlying  land and buildings.  The lease
had been  accounted  for as a capital  lease  with  capital  lease  assets and a
capital lease  obligation of $55.3 million at the date of the  acquisition.  The
purchase  is  anticipated  to  produce  a  return  of  approximately  8% of  the
acquisition cost in 1998.

  TRG opened a 135,000  square foot  expansion at Westfarms in August 1997.  The
expansion   was   approximately   90%  leased  as  of  year  end.  In  addition,
approximately  50,000 square feet of new mall stores opened at Biltmore in 1997.
See also Liquidity and Capital  Resources -- Capital Spending for discussions of
other planned expansion and development activities.

Memorial City Mall Lease

  In November  1996,  TRG entered into an agreement to lease  Memorial City Mall
(Memorial  City), a 1.4 million square foot shopping  center located in Houston,
Texas. The lease of this unencumbered property grants TRG the exclusive right to
manage,  lease and operate the  property.  TRG has the option to  terminate  the
lease after the third full lease year by paying $2 million to the lessor. TRG is
using this option  period to evaluate  the  redevelopment  opportunities  of the
Center.  As a  development  project,  Memorial  City has been  excluded from all
operating  statistics in this report,  and Memorial City's results of operations
have been presented as a net line item in the following  tabular  comparisons of
TRG's  results of  operations.  Memorial  City is expected to have an immaterial
effect on EBITDA and net income during the option period.

Comparison of Fiscal Year 1997 to Fiscal Year 1996

Taubman Centers, Inc.

  The  Company  is the  managing  general  partner  of TRG and  shares  in TRG's
financial  performance  to the extent of its  ownership  percentage,  as well as
earning an 8.3% return on its  preferred  equity  interest in TRG. The Company's
average ownership percentage of TRG was 36.7% for 1997 and 34.5% for 1996. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company had 50.8 million shares outstanding, up from 50.7
million at December 31, 1996.

  The  Company's  income  from TRG in 1997  consists  of $4.1  million  from its
preferred  equity interest in TRG and the Company's $33.5 million  proportionate
share of TRG's income before  extraordinary  item. In 1996, the Company's income
from TRG  consisted  of its $29.0  million  proportionate  share of TRG's income
before  extraordinary  item. The Company's  proportionate  share of TRG's income
before  extraordinary  item was reduced by $8.2 million in 1997 and $7.6 million
in 1996, representing adjustments arising from the Company's additional basis in
TRG's net assets. Income before extraordinary item for 1997 was $28.7 million or
$0.48 per common share as compared to $20.7 million or $0.47 per common share in
1996.

  The  Company  recognized  an  extraordinary  item of $(0.4)  million  in 1996,
consisting of the  Company's  share of TRG's  extraordinary  item related to the
extinguishment  of debt.  Net  income  for 1996 was $20.3  million  or $0.46 per
common  share.  After  reduction of $4.1  million in dividends on the  Company's
Series A Preferred Stock,  net income  available to common  shareowners for 1997
was $24.6 million or $0.48 per common share.

TRG

Occupancy and Mall Tenant Sales

  Average  occupancy  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers was 87.6% in 1997 versus
87.4% in 1996. Ending occupancy for the Taubman Shopping Centers at December 31,
1997 was 90.3% versus  88.0% at December 31, 1996.  Leased space at December 31,
1997 was 92.3% compared to 89.0% at the same date in 1996.

  Total sales for Taubman Shopping Center mall tenants increased in 1997 by 9.2%
to $3.09  billion  from $2.83  billion  in 1996.  Tenant  sales per square  foot
increased  by 1.6% to $371 in 1997 from $365 in 1996.  Tenant  sales per  square
foot,  excluding theaters and tenants greater than 40,000 square feet, increased
by 1.9% to $384 in 1997 from $377 in 1996.  Mall tenant  sales for Centers  that
were  owned  and  open  for all of 1997 and 1996  (which  excludes  all  Centers
acquired in those  years,  as well as Tuttle  Crossing  and Arizona  Mills) were
$2.85 billion,  a 1.6% increase over 1996.  Sales statistics for the first three
quarters  of 1997 were  negatively  affected  by new  competition  near  certain
Centers. The effect of the competition on sales moderated in the fourth quarter,
after the anniversary date of the opening of the competing centers.

TRG --Consolidated Businesses
- -----------------------------

  Total revenues for 1997 were $301.6 million, a $39.7 million or 15.2% increase
over 1996.  Minimum rents  increased  $24.1 million,  of which $21.4 million was
caused by the 1997 and 1996  acquisitions,  and the opening of Tuttle  Crossing.
The results of Fairlane have been  consolidated  in TRG's results  subsequent to
the acquisition date in July 1996 (prior to that date Fairlane was accounted for
under the equity method as an Unconsolidated Joint Venture).  Minimum rents also
increased due to the expansion at Biltmore and tenant rollovers. Percentage rent
increased primarily due to the acquisitions.  The increase in expense recoveries
was primarily  due to the acquired  Centers and Tuttle  Crossing.  Other revenue
increased  $1.9 million  primarily  due to an insurance  recovery,  a litigation
settlement, and an increase in lease cancellation revenue.

  Total  operating  costs  increased  $28.8 million,  or 12.5%.  Recoverable and
depreciation  and  amortization   expenses   increased   primarily  due  to  the
acquisitions and Tuttle Crossing.  Other operating expenses increased  primarily
due to the acquisitions and Tuttle Crossing,  offset by a decrease in the charge
to  operations   for   development   pre-construction   reserves.   General  and
administrative  expense  increased by $3.9 million primarily due to increases in
compensation  (including the continuing  phase-in of the long-term  compensation
plan),  recruiter fees and relocation  charges,  travel, and training.  Interest
expense increased due to an increase in debt used to finance Tuttle Crossing and
capital  expenditures at other Consolidated  Businesses,  partially offset by an
increase in capitalized  interest.  The acquisitions  were initially funded with
debt which was  subsequently  paid down with the proceeds from the December 1996
and the October 1997 equity issuances.

  Revenues  and expenses as  presented  in the  preceding  table differ from the
amounts  shown in TRG's  consolidated  statement  of  operations  by the amounts
representing  Memorial City's revenues and expenses,  which are presented in the
preceding table as a net amount.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
- -----------------------------

  Total revenues for 1997 were $258.8 million, a $6.5 million, or 2.5%, decrease
from  1996,  representing  a $15.0  million  decrease  caused  by the  change of
Fairlane from an Unconsolidated Joint Venture to a Consolidated Business, offset
by  increases  due to the  openings  of  Arizona  Mills  and  the  expansion  at
Westfarms,  in addition to increases at other  Centers.  The decrease in minimum
rents was  primarily  due to Fairlane,  offset by Arizona  Mills,  Westfarms and
increases  due to tenant  rollovers  at other  Centers.  The decrease in expense
recoveries was primarily due to Fairlane, offset by Arizona Mills. Other revenue
increased  by $1.3  million  primarily  due to gains on  peripheral  land sales,
offset by a decrease in lease cancellation revenue and interest income.

  Total operating  costs  decreased by $4.7 million,  or 2.7%, to $166.4 million
for  1997  including  a $10.1  million  decrease  due to  Fairlane.  Recoverable
expenses  decreased $5.4 million primarily due to Fairlane,  offset by increases
due to Arizona Mills. Other operating costs decreased  primarily due to Fairlane
and a  decrease  in bad  debt  expense.  Additionally,  included  in 1996  other
operating expense was a nonrecurring $0.5 million payment to an anchor at one of
the  Centers.  Interest  expense  increased  $1.0  million  primarily  due to an
increase  in debt used to finance  Arizona  Mills and the  Westfarms  expansion,
partially  offset by a decrease in debt related to Fairlane.  Operating costs as
presented in the preceding  table differ from the amounts shown in the combined,
summarized  financial statements of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures (Note 4 to
TRG's financial statements) by the amount of intercompany profit.

  As a result of the foregoing,  net income of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
decreased by $1.9 million, or 2.0%, to $92.4 million. TRG's equity in net income
of the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures was $52.3  million,  a 1.0% increase from
1996.

Net Income
- ----------

  As a result of the foregoing, TRG's income before extraordinary item increased
by $11.2 million, or 13.3%, to $95.3 million for 1997. In 1996, TRG recognized a
$(1.3)  million  extraordinary  charge  related to the  prepayment of Fairlane's
debt.  After payment of $4.1 million in preferred  distributions to the Company,
net income  available to  partnership  unitholders  for 1997 was $91.2  million,
compared to $82.8 million in 1996.

Taubman Centers, Inc.

  The Company's average ownership percentage of TRG was 34.5% for 1996 and 35.1%
for 1995.  Equity  in income of TRG  consists  of the  Company's  $29.0  million
proportionate  share of TRG's  income  before  extraordinary  items for 1996 and
$28.0  million for 1995.  These amounts were reduced by $7.6 million in 1996 and
$8.1  million  in 1995,  representing  adjustments  arising  from the  Company's
additional basis in TRG's net assets.  Equity in income of TRG for 1995 includes
a $1.8 million gain related to the disposition of Bellevue Center. Income before
extraordinary  items for 1996 was $20.7  million  or $0.47 per  common  share as
compared to $19.3 million or $0.44 per common share in 1995.

  The  Company  recognized  an  extraordinary  item of $(0.4)  million  in 1996,
consisting   of  its  share  of  TRG's   extraordinary   item   related  to  the
extinguishment of debt. In 1995, the Company recognized  extraordinary  items of
$5.8 million consisting of its share of TRG's extraordinary items related to the
disposition  of  Bellevue  Center and the  related  extinguishment  of  Bellevue
Center's debt, and other  extinguishment  of debt. Net income for 1996 was $20.3
million or $0.46 per common share  compared to $25.1 million or $0.57 per common
share in 1995.

  Average  occupancy  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers was 87.4% in 1996 versus
88.0% in 1995. Ending occupancy for the Taubman Shopping Centers at December 31,
1996 was 88.0% versus  89.4% at December 31, 1995.  Leased space at December 31,
1996 was 89.0% compared to 90.6% at the same date in 1995. Average occupancy for
1996 was somewhat  less than the previous  year's level but  comfortably  within
TRG's historic range of average annual occupancy.

  Total sales for Taubman Shopping Center mall tenants increased in 1996 by 3.2%
to $2.83  billion  from $2.74  billion  in 1995.  Tenant  sales per square  foot
increased  by 5.2% to $365 in 1996 from $346 in 1995.  Sales per square  foot in
1995 was $352,  excluding  Bellevue  Center.  Mall tenant sales for Centers that
were owned and open for all of 1996 and 1995 were $2.81 billion, a 3.9% increase
over 1995.

TRG --Consolidated Businesses
- -----------------------------

  Total revenues for 1996 were $261.9 million, a $33.0 million or 14.4% increase
from 1995. Minimum rents for 1996 increased $18.8 million, of which $8.7 million
was caused by the Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo acquisitions. The results of Fairlane
have been  consolidated  in TRG's  results  subsequent to the  acquisition  date
(prior to that date  Fairlane was  accounted  for under the equity  method as an
Unconsolidated Joint Venture). Minimum rent also increased due to the expansions
at Short  Hills and  Meadowood  and tenant  rollovers.  The  increase in expense
recoveries was also  primarily due to the Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo  acquisitions
and recoveries of increased  maintenance  costs and property taxes. The increase
in other revenues of $3.9 million was primarily due to increases in revenue from
management,   leasing,  and  development  services,   rental  fees  on  exterior
advertising  signs and gains on sales of peripheral land,  partially offset by a
decrease in lease cancellation revenue.

  Total operating  costs  increased $22.6 million,  or 10.9%, to $229.7 million.
The  increase in  recoverable  expenses  for 1996 was due to Fairlane  and Paseo
Nuevo and to increases in maintenance costs and property taxes,  including those
related to the expansion at Short Hills.  Other operating expenses increased due
to Fairlane and Paseo  Nuevo,  and an increase in the charge to  operations  for
development  pre-construction  reserves.  General  and  administrative  expenses
increased  $2.0 million due  primarily to increases in  compensation,  including
costs of the new long-term  performance  compensation plan and the allocation of
internal  acquisition costs,  travel, and professional fees in 1996, offset by a
decrease  resulting  from a $0.8  million  charge  in  1995  for  severance  and
termination  benefits.  Interest expense increased $4.7 million due primarily to
an increase in debt levels,  including  debt used to finance the  acquisition of
Paseo Nuevo and capital  expenditures and the assumption of debt relating to the
Fairlane acquisition,  and a decrease in capitalized interest,  partially offset
by decreased  interest rates.  The increase in depreciation and amortization was
due primarily to the acquisitions of Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo and the expansions
at Short Hills and Meadowood.

  Revenues  and expenses as  presented  in the  preceding  table differ from the
amounts  shown  in  TRG's   consolidated   income   statements  by  the  amounts
representing  Memorial City's revenues and expenses,  which are presented in the
preceding table as a net amount.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures
- -----------------------------

  Total revenues for 1996 were $265.3 million,  a $25.8 million or 8.9% decrease
from 1995, primarily  representing a $23.8 million decrease caused by the change
in Fairlane from an Unconsolidated Joint Venture to a Consolidated  Business and
by the November 1995  disposition of Bellevue  Center  (Bellevue).  Minimum rent
decreases  due to Fairlane  and  Bellevue  were offset by  increases  due to the
expansion  at  Woodfield  and tenant  rollovers.  Expense  recoveries  decreased
primarily  due to Fairlane and Bellevue,  offset by increases at other  Centers.
Other income  decreased due to a gain on the sale of peripheral land in 1995 and
decreased  interest income in 1996, offset by an increase in lease  cancellation
revenue in 1996. In 1995, an ordinary gain of $8.3 million was recognized on the
disposition of Bellevue.

  Total operating  costs decreased by $12.7 million,  or 6.9%, to $171.1 million
for 1996,  representing  a $19.9 million  decrease due to Fairlane and Bellevue,
offset by  increases  at other  Centers.  Recoverable  expenses  decreased  $6.4
million due to Fairlane and Bellevue,  offset by increases in maintenance  costs
and property taxes.  Other  operating  costs  increased $0.5 million  reflecting
increases in property  management  costs,  promotion and advertising  costs, bad
debt expense and a nonrecurring  $0.5 million payment to an anchor at one of the
Centers,  offset by decreases  due to Bellevue and  Fairlane.  Interest  expense
decreased  $5.1  million  due to a  decrease  in debt  related to  Fairlane  and
Bellevue and an increase in capitalized interest,  partially offset by increases
due to an increase in debt used to finance  capital  expenditures  and to higher
interest rates on certain debt refinanced in 1995.  Operating costs as presented
in the preceding table differ from the amounts shown in the combined, summarized
financial  statements  of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  (Note 4 to TRG's
financial statements) by the amount of intercompany profit.


                                       29

<PAGE>



  As a  result  of the  foregoing,  income  before  extraordinary  items  of the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  was $94.3  million in 1996, a decrease of 12.1%
from  1995.   TRG's  equity  in  income  before   extraordinary   items  of  the
Unconsolidated Joint Ventures decreased $6.1 million, or 10.5%, to $51.8 million
for 1996.

Net Income
- ----------

  As a  result  of  the  foregoing,  TRG's  income  before  extraordinary  items
increased by $4.4 million,  or 5.5%,  to $84.1  million for 1996.  In 1996,  TRG
recognized a $(1.3)  million  extraordinary  charge related to the prepayment of
Fairlane's  debt. In 1995,  TRG recognized an $18.9 million  extraordinary  gain
related  to the  disposition  of  Bellevue  and the  related  extinguishment  of
Bellevue's  debt, and $(2.2)  million in  extraordinary  charges  related to the
prepayment of debt at TRG and at one of its Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures.  Net
income for 1996 was $82.8 million, compared to $96.3 million in 1995.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Taubman Centers, Inc.

  As of December 31, 1997,  the Company had a cash balance of $9.0 million,  the
source  of  which  was  primarily  TRG's  distributions,  and  had  incurred  no
indebtedness.  As of December  31,  1997,  the Company had 50.8  million  shares
outstanding compared to 50.7 million at December 31, 1996.

  On October 3, 1997,  the Company  issued eight million shares of 8.3% Series A
Preferred  Stock under its $500  million  equity shelf  registration  statement.
Dividends  accrue from the date of original  issuance and are payable in arrears
on or  before  the last  day of each  calendar  quarter.  The  Company  used the
proceeds to acquire a Series A Preferred  Equity  interest in TRG that  entitles
the Company to  distributions  (in the form of  guaranteed  payments) in amounts
equal to the dividends payable on the Company's Series A Preferred Stock.

  During 1997 and 1996, the Company received  distributions from its partnership
interest in TRG of $47.0 million and $41.3 million, respectively.  Additionally,
the Company received preferred distributions from TRG of $4.1 million in 1997.

  The Company  pays  regular  quarterly  dividends  to its common and  preferred
shareowners.  The  Company's  ability to pay  dividends  is  affected by several
factors,  most importantly,  the receipt of distributions from TRG. Dividends to
its common  shareowners  are at the  discretion  of the Board of  Directors  and
depend on the cash available to the Company,  its financial  condition,  capital
and other  requirements,  and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems
relevant.  Preferred  dividends  accrue  regardless  of whether  earnings,  cash
availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit the current payment of
dividends.

  On December 11, 1997, the Company declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.235 per
common share payable  January 20, 1998 to  shareowners of record on December 31,
1997. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.50722 per
share on the Company's 8.3% Series A Preferred  Stock for the partial  quarterly
dividend  period of October 3, 1997 to December 31, 1997, paid December 31, 1997
to shareowners of record on December 19, 1997.

  Common  dividends  declared  totaled $0.925 per common share in 1997, of which
$0.324  represented  return of capital and $0.601  represented  ordinary income,
compared to dividends declared in 1996 of $0.89 per common share, of which $0.41
represented  return of capital and $0.48  represented  ordinary income.  The tax
status of total 1998 common  dividends  declared  and to be  declared,  assuming
continuation of a $0.235 per common share quarterly dividend, is estimated to be
approximately  45% return of capital,  and approximately 55% of ordinary income.
Preferred  dividends  declared were $0.50722 per preferred share in 1997, all of
which represented  ordinary income. The tax status of total 1998 dividends to be
paid on Series A Preferred Stock is estimated to be 100% ordinary income.  These
are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the
actual  results to differ  materially,  including:  1) the  amount of  dividends
declared; 2) changes in the Company's share of anticipated taxable income of TRG
due to the  actual  results of TRG;  3)  changes in the number of the  Company's
outstanding  shares;  4) property  acquisitions  or  dispositions;  5) financing
transactions,  including  refinancing  of existing  debt;  and 6) changes in the
Internal Revenue Code or its application.

TRG

  As of December  31,  1997,  TRG had a cash  balance of $3.3  million.  TRG has
available  for  general  partnership  purposes  an  unsecured  revolving  credit

  Proceeds from short term  borrowings  provided  $487.3  million of funding for
1997  (including   $358.2  million,   including   transaction   costs,  for  the
acquisitions  of Regency  Square,  The Falls and  interests in Tuttle  Crossing)
compared  to  $121.2  million  in  1996   (including   $103.6  million  for  the
acquisitions  of Paseo  Nuevo and an  interest  in  Fairlane  Town  Center).  In
November 1997, proceeds from TRG's revolving credit facilities were also used to
repay $100 million of floating rate notes.  Additionally,  proceeds in both 1997
and 1996 were used to fund capital expenditures for the Consolidated  Businesses
and contributions to Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for construction costs.

  In October  1997,  TRG used the net proceeds from the issuance of its Series A
Preferred  Equity to pay down floating rate debt under TRG's existing  revolving
credit and commercial paper facilities,  which were used to fund the acquisition
of Regency  Square.  During  1996,  proceeds  from the  issuance of TRG units of
partnership  interest  were used to pay down  short  term  borrowings  of $124.7
million and for the $22.3 million acquisition of La Cumbre.

  TRG has a medium-term note program under TRG's $500 million shelf registration
statement.  During July 1997, TRG issued $55 million of unsecured  10-year notes
at a coupon rate of 7%. The net  proceeds  were used to pay down  floating  rate
debt under TRG's  revolving  credit  facilities.  In 1996, TRG used the proceeds
from the issuance of $154 million of notes to pay down  floating rate debt under
TRG's  revolving  credit  facilities  as well as to pay  off the  $34.6  million
mortgage on Fairlane and the related  prepayment  penalty of approximately  $1.2
million.  Including  the  issuance in July 1997,  TRG has issued a total of $342
million of notes since the program's inception in 1995.

  In October 1997, TRG closed on a three year $150 million secured  construction
facility  for  MacArthur  Center,  which is owned by a  consolidated  70%  owned
venture. The loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 1.2%.  Borrowings under
the  facility  were $42.2  million at  December  31,  1997.  The  payment of the
principal and interest is guaranteed by TRG. The loan agreement provides for the
reduction of the amount  guaranteed as certain center  performance and valuation
criteria are met.

  In November  1997,  TRG entered  into an unsecured  $210 million  construction
facility  maturing in 2001 to finance the  construction of Great Lakes Crossing.
Under the loan  agreement,  the maturity date may be extended for one year.  The
loan bears interest at one month LIBOR plus 0.90%. Borrowings under the facility
at December 31, 1997 were $46.9 million.

  Scheduled  principal payments on installment notes were $838 thousand and $793
thousand in 1997 and 1996, respectively.

  At December 31, 1997,  TRG's debt and its  beneficial  interest in the debt of
its consolidated and Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures totaled $1,737.2 million. As
shown in the following table,  $79.8 million of this debt was floating rate debt
that remained unhedged at December 31, 1997. Interest rates shown do not include
amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items
are  reported  as  interest  expense  in TRG's  results  of  operations.  In the
aggregate,  these costs accounted for 0.36% of the effective rate of interest in
TRG's  beneficial  interest  in debt at  December  31,  1997.  Included in TRG's
beneficial  interest  in  debt  at  December  31,  1997  is  debt  used  to fund
development and expansion costs.  TRG's  beneficial  interest in assets on which
interest is being  capitalized  totaled  $149.0 million as of December 31, 1997.
TRG's beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $13.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997.

  TRG's loan and facility  agreements and indenture contain various  restrictive
covenants including  limitations on the amount of secured and unsecured debt and
minimum debt service coverage ratios, the latter being the most restrictive. TRG
is in compliance with all of such covenants.

  Subsequent    to   year   end,    Fairfax    Company   of   Virginia    L.L.C.
(successor-in-interest  to Fairfax Associates,  a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint
Venture)  completed a $140 million,  6.60%,  secured financing maturing in 2008.
The net proceeds were used to  extinguish  an existing  mortgage on Fair Oaks of
approximately  $39 million and pay a prepayment  penalty of  approximately  $1.8
million. In addition, proceeds of $5.6 million were used to close out a treasury
lock agreement  entered into in 1997, which resulted in an effective rate on the
financing of  approximately  7%. The remaining  proceeds were distributed to the
owners.  TRG used its 50% share of the  distribution  to pay down its  revolving
credit facilities.

Distributions

  A  principal  factor  considered  by TRG in  deciding  upon  distributions  to
partners is an amount,  which TRG defines as  Distributable  Cash Flow, equal to
EBITDA less TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense,  non-real estate depreciation and
amortization,  and  preferred  distributions.  This  measure of  performance  is
influenced  not only by  operations  but also by  capital  structure.  EBITDA is
defined as TRG's  beneficial  interest in revenues,  less operating costs before
interest,  depreciation and  amortization,  meaning TRG's pro rata share of this
result  for  each  of  the  Managed  Businesses,   after  recording  appropriate
intercompany eliminations. TRG's Beneficial Interest Expense is defined as TRG's
pro rata  share of the  interest  expense of each of TRG's  Managed  Businesses.
Funds from Operations is calculated by adding the Company's  beneficial interest
in  TRG's  Distributable  Cash  Flow to the  Company's  other  income,  less the
Company's  operating  expenses.  EBITDA,  Distributable Cash Flow and Funds from
Operations do not represent cash flows from operations,  as defined by generally
accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be  considered  to  be  an
alternative  to net income as an indicator of operating  performance  or to cash
flows  from  operations  as  a  measure  of  liquidity.  However,  the  National
Association of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts (NAREIT) suggests that Funds from
Operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs.

  The following table summarizes TRG's Distributable Cash Flow and the Company's
Funds from Operations for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996:

</TABLE>

  For 1997,  EBITDA and  Distributable  Cash Flow were $255.7 million and $146.7
million,  compared to $229.8  million and $129.7 million in 1996. In addition to
$4.1 million representing preferred distributions to the Company on TRG's Series
A Preferred  Equity,  TRG  distributed  $128.1  million to its partners in 1997,
compared to $119.1 million in 1996. The Company's Funds from Operations for 1997
was $53.1 million, compared to $44.1 million in 1996.

  The Partnership  Committee of TRG makes an annual determination of appropriate
distributions   for  each  year.  The  determination  is  based  on  anticipated
Distributable  Cash Flow available after preferred  distributions to the Company
on TRG's Series A Preferred Equity, as well as financing considerations and such
other factors as the Partnership Committee considers  appropriate.  Further, the
Partnership  Committee has decided that the growth in distributions will be less
than the growth in Distributable Cash Flow for the immediate future.


                                       34
<PAGE>



  Except under unusual  circumstances,  TRG's  practice is to  distribute  equal
monthly  installments of the determined  amount of distributions  throughout the
year.  Due  to  seasonality  and  the  fact  that  cash  available  to  TRG  for
distributions  may be  more  or less  than  net  cash  provided  from  operating
activities  plus  distributions  from Joint  Ventures  during the year,  TRG may
borrow  from  unused  credit  facilities  (described  in  Liquidity  and Capital
Resources -- TRG above) to enable it to  distribute  the amount  decided upon by
the TRG Partnership Committee.

  Distributions  by each Joint Venture may be made only in  accordance  with the
terms of its  partnership  agreement.  TRG,  in  general,  acts as the  managing
partner  and has the  right  to  determine  the  amount  of cash  available  for
distribution  from the  Joint  Venture.  In  general,  the  provisions  of these
agreements  require the  distribution  of all available cash (as defined in each
partnership agreement), but most do not allow borrowing to finance distributions
without approval of the Joint Venture Partner.

  As a result,  distribution  policies of many Joint  Ventures will not parallel
those of TRG.  While TRG may not,  therefore,  receive as much in  distributions
from each Joint Venture as it intends to  distribute  with respect to that Joint
Venture,   the  Company  does  not  believe  this  will  impede  TRG's  intended
distribution  policy  because  of TRG's  overall  access  to  liquid  resources,
including borrowing capacity.

  Any inability of TRG or its Joint Ventures to secure  financing as required to
fund  maturing  debts,  capital  expenditures  and  changes in working  capital,
including development activities and expansions,  may require the utilization of
cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly  reducing  distributions to
partners of TRG and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.

  In  addition,  if the GM Trusts  exercise  their  rights under the Cash Tender
Agreement (see Liquidity and Capital  Resources -- Cash Tender Agreement below),
TRG will be  required  to pay the GM  Trusts  $10.9  million  and may  borrow to
finance such expenditures.

Capital Spending

  Capital  spending for routine  maintenance of the Taubman  Shopping Centers is
generally recovered from tenants.  Excluding  acquisitions,  capital spending by
the Managed Businesses not recovered from tenants is summarized in the following

(2)  Includes TRG's share of construction costs for Great Lakes Crossing (an 80%
     owned  consolidated  joint  venture)  and  MacArthur  Center  (a 70%  owned
     consolidated joint venture).

  In 1997 and 1996, TRG's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased
during the year,  excluding expansion space and new developments,  was $8.34 and
$9.96,  respectively.  In addition,  TRG's share of its Consolidated Businesses'
and  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures'  capitalized  leasing costs,  excluding new
developments,  was $10.9  million,  or $10.72 per square foot leased  during the
year in 1997,  and $8.5 million or $10.47 per square foot leased during the year
in 1996.

  At Cherry Creek,  an ongoing  expansion  includes a newly  constructed  Lord &
Taylor store,  which opened in November  1997,  and the addition of 132 thousand
square feet of mall GLA,  which will open in the fall of 1998.  The expansion is
expected to cost approximately $50 million.  TRG has a 50% ownership interest in
Cherry Creek.

  Great Lakes Crossing, an enclosed value super-regional mall being developed by
TRG in Auburn Hills,  Michigan, is expected to open in November 1998. The Center
will be 1.4 million  square feet and its anchors will include Off 5th-Saks Fifth
Avenue Outlet,  Oshman's  Supersports  USA,  Rainforest  Cafe,  Jeepers!,  and a
25-screen 100,000 square foot Star Theater complex. This Center will be owned by
a joint venture in which TRG has a controlling  80% interest and is projected to
cost approximately $210 million.

  MacArthur  Center, a new Center under  construction in Norfolk,  Virginia,  is
expected to open in March 1999. The Center is expected to open with 930 thousand
square feet and will  initially be anchored by  Nordstrom  and  Dillard's.  This
Center  will be owned by a joint  venture  in  which  TRG has a 70%  controlling
interest and is projected to cost approximately $150 million.

  In 1996,  TRG entered  into an agreement  to lease  Memorial  City Mall, a 1.4
million square foot shopping center located in Houston,  Texas. Memorial City is
anchored by Sears, Foley's,  Montgomery Ward and Mervyn's. TRG has the option to
terminate  the  lease  after the third  full  year by paying $2  million  to the
lessor.   TRG  is  using  this  option  period  to  evaluate  the  redevelopment
opportunities  of the  Center.  Under the terms of the lease,  TRG has agreed to
invest a minimum of $3  million  during the three  year  option  period.  If the
redevelopment  proceeds,  TRG is required to invest an additional $22 million in
property  expenditures not recoverable from tenants during the first 10 years of
the lease term.

     consolidated joint venture).
(3)  Includes costs related to MacArthur Center and Great Lakes Crossing.
(4)  Includes costs related to the expansion project at Cherry Creek.

  TRG's share of costs for  development  projects  scheduled  to be completed in
1999 is  anticipated  to be as much as $58 million in 1999.  TRG's  estimates of
1998  and  1999  capital  spending  include  only  projects  approved  by  TRG's
Partnership  Committee  and,  consequently,  TRG's  estimates will change as new
projects  are  approved.  Currently,  TRG  expects to open on  average  one $175
million to $200 million  shopping center each year.  TRG's  estimates  regarding
capital expenditures presented above are forward-looking  statements and certain
significant  factors  could  cause the  actual  results  to  differ  materially,
including but not limited to: 1) actual  results of  negotiations  with anchors,
tenants and contractors; 2) changes in the scope and number of projects; 3) cost
overruns; 4) timing of expenditures; and 5) actual time to complete projects.

Capital Resources

  TRG believes that its net cash provided by operating activities, distributions
from the Joint Ventures,  the unutilized portion of its credit  facilities,  and
its ability to access the credit  markets assure  adequate  liquidity to conduct
its operations in accordance with its distribution and financing policies. TRG's
borrowings are not and will not be recourse to the Company without its consent.

Cash Tender Agreement

  A. Alfred  Taubman  and the GM Trusts each have the annual  right to tender to
the Company units of  partnership  interest in TRG (provided  that the aggregate
value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered
interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the
trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender
Agreement).  The Company  will have the option to pay for these  interests  from
available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the  proceeds  of an offering of the
Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the  Company  expects  to  finance  these
purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock.  The tendering  partners
will  bear all  market  risk if the  market  price at  closing  is less than the
purchase  price.  Any proceeds of the  offering in excess of the purchase  price
will be for the sole benefit of the Company.  At A. Alfred  Taubman's  election,
his family, and Robert C. Larson and his family may participate in tenders.  The
GM Trusts will be entitled  to receive  from TRG an amount (not to exceed  $10.9
million in the aggregate over the term of the Partnership)  equal to 5.5% of the
amounts that the Company pays to the GM Trusts under the Cash Tender Agreement.

  Based on a market  value at  December  31, 1997 and 1996 of $13.00 and $12.875
per common share,  the aggregate  value of interests in TRG that may be tendered
under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately $960 million and $954 million,
respectively.  Purchase  of these  interests  at  December  31,  1997 would have
resulted in the Company owning an additional 53% interest in TRG.

  The Company is not aware of any present  intention  of any partner to sell its
interest in TRG under the Cash Tender Agreement.

Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.


  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Taubman Centers, Inc. as of
December  31,  1997  and  1996,  and  the  related   statements  of  operations,
shareowners'  equity,  and cash flows for each of the three  years in the period
ended December 31, 1997. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

  We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion,  such financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects,  the financial  position of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. as of December 31,
1997 and 1996,  and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       Three Years Ended December 31, 1997




Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

  The Company,  a real estate investment trust, or REIT, is the managing general
partner  of The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited  Partnership  (TRG).  TRG is an
operating  partnership  that  engages  in the  ownership,  management,  leasing,
acquisition,  development,  and expansion of regional  retail  shopping  centers
(Taubman  Shopping  Centers)  and  interests  therein.  TRG's  portfolio,  as of
December 31, 1997, includes 25 urban and suburban Taubman Shopping Centers in 12
states. Two additional Centers are under construction in Norfolk,  Virginia, and
Auburn Hills,  Michigan.  The Company's  investment in TRG consists of a general
partnership interest and a preferred equity interest (Note 2).

  The Company  accounts  for its  investment  in TRG under the equity  method of
accounting.  The  excess  of  the  Company's  cost  of  its  investment  in  TRG
partnership  units over its proportionate  share of TRG's accumulated  partners'
deficit has been allocated to the Company's  basis in the underlying  assets and
liabilities  of TRG.  Depreciation  related to amounts  allocated to depreciable
assets is recognized by the Company on a straight-line  basis over 40 years. The
excess of the Company's cost of its investment in TRG partnership units over its
proportionate share of TRG's accumulated  partners' deficit at December 31, 1997
and 1996, was $468.4 million and $476.3 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

  Federal income taxes are not provided  because the Company  operates in such a
manner as to qualify  as a REIT under the  provisions  of the  Internal  Revenue
Code, and therefore  applicable taxable income is included in the taxable income
of its  shareowners.  As a REIT, the Company must distribute at least 95% of its
REIT taxable income to its shareowners and meet certain other requirements.

  Dividends  per common  share  declared in 1997 were  $0.925,  of which  $0.324
represented return of capital and $0.601 represented ordinary income.  Dividends
per common share declared in 1996 were $0.89, of which $0.41 represented  return
of capital and $0.48  represented  ordinary  income.  Dividends per common share
declared in 1995 were $0.88,  of which $0.52  represented  return of capital and
$0.36  represented  ordinary  income.  The tax  status of the  Company's  common
dividends  in  1997,  1996 and 1995 may not be  indicative  of  future  periods.
Dividends  per  preferred  share  declared in 1997 were  $0.50722,  all of which
represented  ordinary  income.  The difference  between net income for financial
reporting  purposes and taxable  income results  primarily  from  differences in
depreciation expense.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash  equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

Note 2 - Investment in TRG

  The  Company's  investment  in TRG at December 31, 1997 and 1996 consists of a
36.70%  and  36.68%,   respectively,   managing  general  partnership  interest.
Additionally,  at December 31, 1997, the Company's  investment in TRG includes a
preferred  equity  interest.  TRG's net income and  distributions  are allocable
first to the preferred equity interest, and the remaining amounts to the general
and limited TRG  partners in  accordance  with their  percentage  ownership.  In
January  1998,  the  Company's  ownership of TRG increased to 38.4% due to TRG's
redemption of a partner's interest (Note 8).

  In October  1997,  the Company  used the proceeds  from a $200 million  public
offering  of  eight  million  shares  of 8.3%  Series  A  Cumulative  Redeemable
Preferred  Stock  (Series A  Preferred  Stock) to  acquire a Series A  Preferred
Equity interest in TRG that entitles the Company to income and distributions (in
the form of guaranteed  payments) in amounts  equal to the dividends  payable on
the Company's  Series A Preferred  Stock. TRG bore all expenses of the offering.
TRG used the net  proceeds  to pay down  short term debt  under  TRG's  existing
revolving credit and commercial paper facilities.

  The Company's  average  ownership in TRG for 1997,  1996,  and 1995 was 36.7%,
34.5% and 35.1%, respectively, as the result of the following transactions.

  In December 1996, the Company  purchased newly issued TRG units of partnership
interest with the $75 million proceeds from the Company's December 1996 offering
of 5.97 million  shares of common stock.  TRG bore all expenses of the Company's
offering.  TRG used the net proceeds to pay down short term  floating  rate debt
and to acquire  La Cumbre  Plaza.  Additionally  in 1996,  TRG  issued  units of
partnership  interest in connection  with its acquisition of the 75% interest in
Fairlane Town Center held by a joint venture partner.

  Also in 1997 and 1996, TRG issued units of partnership  interest in connection
with the exercise of incentive  options.  The Company exchanged shares of common
stock for these newly issued units of TRG partnership  interest  pursuant to the
Company's Continuing Offer (Note 5).

  The Company's  income from its investment in TRG included $4.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 1997 from its Series A Preferred Equity interest in TRG.
Additionally,   the  Company's   proportionate  share  of  TRG's  income  before
extraordinary  items  available to partnership  unitholders  for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1996, and 1995, was $33.5 million,  $29.0 million,  and $28.0
million (including the Company's $1.8 million share of the gain related to TRG's
disposition of Bellevue Center in 1995), respectively,  reduced by $8.2 million,
$7.6 million, and $8.1 million,  respectively,  representing adjustments arising
from the Company's additional basis in TRG's net assets.

  In  1996  and  1995,  TRG  recognized  extraordinary  items  relating  to  the
extinguishment of debt. Of the 1995 amount, an $18.9 million gain was recognized
related  to TRG's  disposition  of  Bellevue  Center and the  extinguishment  of
Bellevue  Center's  debt.  Extraordinary  charges  in 1996  and  1995  consisted
primarily of prepayment  penalties.  The Company's share of TRG's  extraordinary
items  was  approximately  $(0.4)  million  and $5.8  million  in 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

Note 3 - Corporate Services Agreement

  The Taubman Company Limited Partnership (the Manager),  which is approximately
99%  beneficially  owned by TRG,  provides various  administrative,  management,
accounting, shareowner relations, and other services to the Company. The Manager
is paid an annual fee of $250 thousand under an agreement  expiring November 30,
2000. The agreement can be renewed for consecutive three-year terms.


Note 4 - Preferred Stock

  The 8.3%  Series A Preferred  Stock has no stated  maturity,  sinking  fund or
mandatory  redemption and is not  convertible  into any other  securities of the
Company.  The Series A  Preferred  Stock has a  liquidation  preference  of $200
million ($25 per share).  Dividends are  cumulative and accrue at an annual rate
of 8.3% from the date of the original issuance, October 3, 1997, and are payable
in arrears on or before the last day of each calendar quarter.  The 1997 accrued
dividends were paid in 1997. The Series A Preferred Stock can be redeemed by the
Company  beginning in October 2002 at $25 per share plus any accrued  dividends.
The redemption  price can be paid solely out of the sale of capital stock of the
Company.


Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies

  At the time of the Company's  initial public offering (IPO) and acquisition of
its  partnership  interest in TRG, the Company entered into an agreement with A.
Alfred Taubman and the General Motors Hourly-Rate Employes Pension Trust and the
General Motors  Salaried  Employes  Pension Trust (the GM Trusts),  each of whom
indirectly owns an interest in TRG,  whereby each has the annual right to tender
to the Company units of partnership interest in TRG (provided that the aggregate
value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered
interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the
trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender
Agreement).  The Company  will have the option to pay for these  interests  from
available  cash,  borrowed  funds or from the  proceeds  of an  offering  of the
Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the  Company  expects  to  finance  these
purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock.  The tendering  partners
will bear the  costs of sale.  Any  proceeds  of the  offering  in excess of the
purchase  price will be for the sole  benefit of the  Company.  At Mr. A. Alfred
Taubman's  election,  his  family  and  Robert  C.  Larson  and his  family  may
participate  in tenders.  The GM Trusts will be entitled to receive  from TRG an
amount  (not to  exceed  $10.9  million  in the  aggregate  over the term of the
Partnership) equal to 5.5% of the amounts that the Company pays to the GM Trusts
under the Cash Tender Agreement.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  Based on a market  value at December  31, 1997 and 1996 of $13.00 and $12.875,
respectively,  per common share, the aggregate value of partnership interests in
TRG which may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately $960
million  and $954  million,  respectively,  at December  31, 1997 and 1996.  The
purchase  of these  interests  at December  31, 1997 would have  resulted in the
Company owning an additional 53% interest in TRG.

  Shares of common stock that were acquired by the GM Trusts and the AT&T Master
Pension  Trust in  connection  with  the IPO may be sold  through  a  registered
offering.  Pursuant to a registration  rights  agreement  with the Company,  the
owners of each of these  shares  have the annual  right to cause the  Company to
register and  publicly  sell their  shares of common  stock  (provided  that the
shares  have an  aggregate  value of at least $50 million and subject to certain
other  restrictions).  The annual right is deemed to have been exercised if they
initiate or  participate  in a sale  pursuant to the Cash Tender  Agreement,  as
described  above.  All  expenses of such a  registration  are to be borne by the
Company,  other than the underwriting  discounts or selling  commissions,  which
will be borne by the exercising party.

  The Company has made a continuing,  irrevocable  offer to all present  holders
(other than certain  excluded  holders,  including A. Alfred  Taubman and the GM
Trusts),  assignees of all present holders,  those future holders of partnership
interests in TRG as the Company may, in its sole discretion, agree to include in
the  continuing  offer,  and all  existing  and  future  optionees  under  TRG's
incentive  option plan (described  below) to exchange shares of common stock for
partnership interests in TRG (the Continuing Offer).

  Effective  September 30, 1997, TRG amended its partnership  agreement to split
existing  units of  partnership  interest at a ratio of  1,975.08  to one.  Also
effective  September 30, 1997,  the  Continuing  Offer was amended to change the
number of shares exchangeable for a unit of partnership interest.  Formerly, the
number  was  based on  market  valuation  of the  Company  on the  trading  date
immediately  preceding the date of exchange.  Under the amended  agreement,  one
unit of TRG partnership  interest is exchangeable for one share of the Company's
common stock.

  TRG has an incentive  option plan for  employees  of the  Manager.  Currently,
options for 8.2 million units of partnership  interest, as restated for the unit
split,  may be issued  under the plan,  including  options  outstanding  for 7.0
million units. The exercise price of all options outstanding was equal to market
value on the date of the grant.  Incentive options generally become  exercisable
to the extent of one-third of the units on each of the third,  fourth, and fifth
anniversaries  of the date of grant.  Options  expire ten years from the date of
grant.

   A summary of the status of the plan as of December 31, 1997,  1996, and 1995,
and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

Note 6 - Earnings Per Share

  Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing earnings  available
to common  shareowners by the average number of common shares outstanding during
each period.  For diluted  earnings per common share,  the  Company's  ownership
interest in TRG (and therefore  earnings) are adjusted  assuming the exercise of
all options for units of partnership  interest under TRG's incentive option plan
having exercise prices less than the average market value of the units using the
treasury  stock method.  For the years ended  December 31, 1997,  1996 and 1995,
options  for 0.4  million,  1.0 million  and 7.2  million  units of  partnership
interest   with  average   exercise   prices  of  $13.58,   $12.64  and  $11.37,
respectively,  were excluded from the computation of diluted  earnings per share
because the options'  exercise prices were greater than the average market price
for the period calculated.

Company's  ownership in TRG to 38.4%. TRG funded the redemption  through the use
of an existing revolving credit facility.

Partners
The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership


  We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of The Taubman
Realty Group Limited  Partnership  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and
1996,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  accumulated
deficiency  in assets,  and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December  31, 1997.  Our audits also  included  the  financial  statement
schedules  listed  in the  Index  at Item 14.  These  financial  statements  and
financial  statement  schedules  are  the  responsibility  of the  Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on the  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

  We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, such consolidated  financial statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of The Taubman Realty Group Limited
Partnership  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1997 and 1996, and the results
of their  operations  and their  cash  flows for each of the three  years in the
period ended December 31, 1997 in conformity with generally accepted  accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion,  such  financial  statement  schedules,  when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the  information  set forth
therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       Three Years Ended December 31, 1997


Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

  The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership  (TRG) engages in the ownership,
management,  leasing, acquisition,  development and expansion of regional retail
shopping  centers  (Taubman  Shopping  Centers)  and  interests  therein.  TRG's
portfolio,  as of December  31,  1997,  includes 25 urban and  suburban  Taubman
Shopping Centers in 12 states.  Two additional Centers are under construction in
Norfolk,  Virginia, and Auburn Hills,  Michigan.  Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO) is
the managing  general  partner of TRG.  GMPTS Limited  Partnership  (GMPTS),  TG
Partners Limited Partnership (TG) and Taub-Co Management,  Inc. are also general
partners.

  At December  31,  1997,  TRG had  138,299,310  units of  partnership  interest
outstanding,   of  which  107,114,443  units  represented   general  partnership
interests.  At December 31, 1997, TRG was owned 36.70% by TCO,  36.17% by GMPTS,
20.22% by certain present and former key executives (and certain of their family
members) of the  predecessor to The Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership,  the
Manager  (collectively,  the Taubman Group), and TG, and 6.91% by certain former
joint  venture  partners and others (Note 16). The members of the Taubman  Group
(other than Taub-Co  Management,  Inc.),  the former joint venture  partners and
others  are  limited  partners  of TRG.  Additionally,  TCO  owns  the  Series A
Preferred Equity interest in TRG (Note 2).

  Income and  distributions of TRG are allocated first to the Series A Preferred
Equity interest,  and the remaining  amounts to the general and limited partners
of TRG in accordance with their percentage  ownership.  The financial statements
include only those assets,  liabilities,  and results of operations which relate
to the business of TRG. No provision  has been made for income taxes since these
taxes are the responsibility of the individual partners.

Basis of Presentation

  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of TRG and its
consolidated  subsidiaries.  Investments in entities unilaterally  controlled by
ownership or contractual  agreements are  consolidated;  investments in entities
not unilaterally  controlled  (Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures) are accounted for
under the equity method.

  The Manager,  which is approximately  99% beneficially  owned by TRG, provides
property  management  and  leasing  services  for Taubman  Shopping  Centers and
provides corporate,  development and acquisition services. Intercompany balances
and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

  Dollar  amounts  presented  in tables  within  the  notes to the  consolidated
financial statements are stated in thousands of dollars, except for unit data or
as otherwise noted.

Revenue Recognition

  Shopping  center space is generally  leased to specialty  retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis as earned,  the result of which
does not differ  materially from a straight-line  method.  Percentage  rents are
recognized on an accrual basis as earned.  Expense recoveries,  which include an
administrative fee, are recognized as revenue in the period applicable costs are
chargeable to tenants.

                  THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Depreciation and Amortization

  Buildings,  improvements  and equipment,  stated at cost,  are  depreciated on
straight-line or double-declining  balance bases over the estimated useful lives
of the assets,  which range from 5 to 50 years.  Tenant  allowances and deferred
leasing  costs are  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the lives of the
related leases.

Capitalization

  Costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement of
properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction is
substantially  complete.  Properties  are reviewed for  impairment  if events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amounts of the properties
may  not  be  recoverable.   Costs  of  potentially   unsuccessful   development
pre-construction  activities  are  provided  for by  charges to  operations  and
written off if abandoned.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash  equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Deferred Charges

  Direct  financing  and interest  rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

  Stock-based  compensation  plans  are  accounted  for under  APB  Opinion  25,
"Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees"  and related  interpretations,  as
permitted under FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation".

Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

  Premiums paid for interest  rate caps are  amortized to interest  expense over
the terms of the cap agreements.  Amounts  received under the cap agreements are
accounted  for on an accrual  basis,  and  recognized as a reduction of interest
expense. The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements is accounted
for on an accrual basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
financial instruments:

    The carrying  value of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,   accounts  and  notes
       receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short
       maturity of these instruments.


                                      F-21

<PAGE>



                  THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


    The fair value of TRG's debt is estimated  based on quoted  market prices if
       available,  or on the current rates  available to TRG for debt of similar
       terms and  maturity and the  assumption  that debt will be prepaid at the
       earliest possible date.

    The fair value of interest rate hedging  instruments  is the amount that TRG
       would receive or pay to terminate  the  agreement at the reporting  date,
       taking into account current interest rates.

Reclassifications

    Certain  prior  year  amounts  have been  reclassified  to  conform  to 1997
classifications.


Note 2 - Equity Transactions

  In October  1997,  TCO used the $200 million  proceeds of its offering of 8.3%
Series A Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock (Series A Preferred  Stock) to
acquire  a Series A  Preferred  Equity  interest  in TRG  that  entitles  TCO to
distributions  (in the form of  guaranteed  payments)  in  amounts  equal to the
dividends payable on TCO's Series A Preferred  Equity.  TRG bore all expenses of
the offering,  which were  accounted for as a reduction of the proceeds from the
Series A Preferred  Equity.  TRG used the net proceeds to pay down floating rate
debt under TRG's  existing  revolving  credit and commercial  paper  facilities,
which were used to fund the  acquisition  of Regency  Square in  September  1997
(Note 3).

  The Series A Preferred Equity has no stated maturity, sinking fund requirement
or  mandatory  redemption.  In the event of  partnership  liquidation,  the $200
million Series A Preferred  Equity and any unpaid  guaranteed  payments would be
paid prior to any distributions to holders of units of partnership interest.

  Effective  September 30, 1997, TRG amended its partnership  agreement to split
existing units of partnership  interest at a ratio of 1,975.08 to one. The split
did not alter the ownership  percentage of any of TRG's  partners.  All unit and
per unit amounts have been  adjusted to reflect the unit split on a  retroactive
basis.

  In December 1996, TRG issued units of partnership  interest to TCO for the $75
million proceeds from TCO's December 1996 equity offering. TRG bore all expenses
of TCO's offering,  which have been accounted for as a reduction of the proceeds
from TRG's  issuance  of units.  Also in  December  1996,  TRG  issued  units of
partnership  interest in connection with the exercise of incentive options (Note
11).  Concurrently  under TCO's  continuing  offer to exchange  shares of common
stock for certain  partnership  interests  in TRG,  TCO  exchanged  652 thousand
shares of common stock for these newly issued units of TRG partnership interest.
TRG used the net  proceeds  from the  issuance  of units to pay down  short term
floating  rate debt and to acquire La Cumbre  Plaza  (Note 3).  Additionally  in
1996,  TRG  issued  units  of  partnership   interest  in  connection  with  the
acquisition  of the  remaining  interest in Fairlane Town Center (Note 3), which
were subsequently redeemed in January 1998 (Note 16).

Note 3 - Acquisitions

  In 1997 and 1996, TRG acquired  interests in various shopping  centers.  These
acquisitions  were  recorded  at fair  value and the  operating  results  of the
Centers  have  been   consolidated  in  TRG's  financial   statements  from  the
acquisition dates.

  Center                        Date Acquired        Purchase Price
 --------                      ---------------      ----------------

The Mall at Tuttle Crossing    December 1997            76,268
Regency Square                 September 1997          123,880
La Cumbre Plaza                December 1996            22,250
Fairlane Town Center           July 1996                91,552
Paseo Nuevo                    June 1996                37,000

  In 1997,  TRG  acquired  interests  in The  Mall at  Tuttle  Crossing  (Tuttle
Crossing) from Tuttle  Crossing  Holding Co., a subsidiary of The Limited,  Inc.
(The  Limited).  TRG's  ownership  interest in Tuttle  Crossing was subject to a
long-term   participating   lease  with  The  Limited  for  land  and  leasehold
improvements.  TRG purchased  The  Limited's  interest in the lease and took fee
simple title to the underlying land and buildings.  The lease had been accounted
for as a capital lease with capital lease assets and a capital lease  obligation
of $55.3 million at the acquisition date. Tuttle Crossing opened in July 1997.

  La Cumbre Plaza was  purchased  subject to four ground  leases (three of which
are participating). The leases expire in 2028. Paseo Nuevo was purchased subject
to two participating ground leases expiring in 2065.

  In 1996, TRG completed  transactions  that resulted in the  acquisition of the
75%  interest in  Fairlane  Town Center  (Fairlane)  previously  held by a Joint
Venture  Partner.  In connection  with the  transactions,  which resulted in TRG
owning 100% of Fairlane, TRG issued to the former Joint Venture Partner units of
partnership  interest,  exchangeable for approximately 6.1 million shares of TCO
common stock,  which had a closing price of $10.75 per share on the day prior to
the issuance date. The units issued represented  limited  partnership units. TRG
also assumed mortgage debt of approximately $26 million, representing the former
Joint  Venture  Partner's  beneficial  interest  in the $34.6  million  mortgage
encumbering  the property.  TRG used unsecured debt to fund the repayment of the
9.73% mortgage and prepayment penalty of $1.2 million.  Prior to the acquisition
date, TRG's interest in Fairlane was accounted for under the equity method as an
Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture.  The units  issued to the former  Joint  Venture
Partner were redeemed in January 1998 (Note 16).

necessarily indicative of future results.


Note 4 - Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

  Following are TRG's  investments in various real estate  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures  which own regional  retail  shopping  centers.  TRG is  generally  the
managing general partner of these Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.  TRG's interest
in each Unconsolidated Joint Venture is as follows:

                                                                     TRG's %

  Arizona Mills, L.L.C.  developed Arizona Mills, a value super-regional mall in
Tempe,  Arizona,  which opened in November  1997.  TRG's  ownership  interest in
Arizona Mills,  L.L.C.  increased in January 1997 to 37% from 35% as a result of
Arizona  Mills,  L.L.C.'s  redemption  of a former  owner's 5% interest for $2.8
million (the former owner is an affiliate of a partner in TRG).

  In January  1997,  Arizona  Mills,  L.L.C.  closed on a secured  $145  million
construction  facility  maturing in 2002.  The loan bears  interest at one month
LIBOR plus 1.3%. The loan is hedged until maturity at a one month LIBOR cap rate
of 9.5%,  plus credit  spread.  The  payment of the  principal  and  interest is
guaranteed by each of the owners of Arizona Mills,  L.L.C., to the extent of its
ownership  percentage.  The loan  agreement  provides  for the  reduction of the
amount guaranteed as certain center  performance and valuation criteria are met.
Borrowings on the facility at December 31, 1997 were $122 million.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  In December  1995,  TRG  recognized  an ordinary  gain of $5.0  million on the
disposition of Bellevue  Center  (Bellevue),  a 60% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint
Venture,  based on the carrying value of TRG's investment in Bellevue.  TRG also
recognized an extraordinary gain of $18.9 million on the related  extinguishment
of Bellevue's debt. The carrying value of TRG's investment in Bellevue  differed
from  TRG's  60%  share  of  Bellevue's  net  deficiency  in  assets  due to the
elimination of intercompany profits on sales of services.

  TRG reduces its  investment  in  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures to  eliminate
intercompany   profits  on  sales  of  services  that  are  capitalized  by  the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  As a  result,  the  carrying  value  of  TRG's
investment  in  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  is less than TRG's share of the
deficiency in assets reported in the Balance Sheet of the  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures of the Taubman  Realty Group  Limited  Partnership  by $8.1 million and
$7.4 million in 1997 and 1996,  respectively.  These  differences  are amortized
over the useful lives of the related assets.

                                                  ==========   ==========

  Depreciation  expense  for  1997,  1996,  and 1995 was  $37.6  million,  $29.6
million,  and $26.6 million.  Peripheral land consists  primarily of undeveloped
land generally adjacent to the Taubman Shopping Centers. Construction in process
includes costs related to the  construction  of new centers,  and expansions and
other improvements at various existing centers.

  TRG  actively  pursues  opportunities  for  the  development  of new  regional
shopping  centers.  Development  pre-construction  activities,  including market
research,  site location,  environmental  work,  zoning permits and obtaining of
anchor  commitments,  may  take  years  to  accomplish  and  ultimately  may  be
abandoned.  TRG provides a reserve for the cost of such potentially unsuccessful
pre-construction activities.

  The activity in development pre-construction costs and the related reserve for
1997 and 1996 is summarized as follows:

                                             Costs     Reserve     Net

Note 7 - Other Liabilities

  In November 1992, the General Motors  Hourly-Rate  Employes  Pension Trust and
the General Motors Salaried Employes Pension Trust (GM Trusts), which indirectly
own  interests  in TRG,  entered  into an  agreement  with TCO (the Cash  Tender
Agreement)  pursuant to which the GM Trusts have certain  rights to cause TCO to
purchase  their  interests  in TRG. TRG will pay the GM Trusts an amount (not to
exceed $10.9 million in the aggregate over the term of the Partnership) equal to
5.5% of the  amounts  that  TCO pays to the GM  Trusts  under  the  Cash  Tender
Agreement.

  As of December 31, 1997, TRG has available for general partnership purposes an
unsecured  revolving  credit  facility of $300  million.  Included in the credit
facility is a competitive  bid option program which allows TRG to hold auctions,
among the banks  participating in the facility,  for short term borrowings of up
to $150 million.

  TRG has used the proceeds from the $210 million construction  facility to make
contributions  to  Taubman  Auburn  Hills  Associates  Limited  Partnership,   a
consolidated  80% owned  venture,  to finance  the  construction  of Great Lakes
Crossing. TRG is entitled to preferred distributions on these contributions at a
rate of prime plus 1.5%. The preferred distributions will be paid from available
cash  as  defined  in  the  partnership  agreement.  The  maturity  date  on the
construction facility may be extended to December 2002.

</TABLE>

  Mortgage debt is  collateralized by properties with a net book value of $208.7
million as of December 31, 1997. The assessment bonds payable are due in monthly
installments  with  maturities at various dates through 2019, and fixed interest
rates between 6.0% and 7.2%.

  In  October  1997,  TRG  closed on a three  year,  $150  million  construction
facility  for  MacArthur  Center,  which is owned by a  consolidated  70%  owned
venture.  The loan  bears  interest  at one month  LIBOR  plus  1.2%.  Under the
facility  agreement the maturity date may be extended for two years. The payment
of the principal and interest is guaranteed by TRG. The loan agreement  provides
for the reduction of the amount  guaranteed as certain  center  performance  and
valuation criteria are met.

  Stoneridge  is  encumbered  by a deed of trust  securing  a  commercial  paper
facility.  The facility is supported by an underlying  credit  facility of up to
$75 million, which is renewable quarterly for a twelve month period.
Commercial paper is generally sold with a 30 day maturity.

  The following table presents  scheduled  principal  payments on mortgage debt,
excluding commercial paper, as of December 31, 1997.

Interest Expense

   Interest  paid in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  net of amounts  capitalized  of $9.5
million,  $5.7  million and $6.9  million in 1997,  1996 and 1995,  approximated
$69.8 million, $69.8 million and $62.2 million.

Extraordinary Items

   In 1996,  TRG  recognized an  extraordinary  charge to income of $1.3 million
primarily  consisting of a prepayment  penalty related to the  extinguishment of
debt at a wholly owned Center. In 1995, TRG recognized an extraordinary  gain of
approximately  $18.9 million,  related to the extinguishment of debt at Bellevue
(Note 4) and $2.2  million of  extraordinary  charges,  consisting  primarily of
prepayment  penalties,  related  to the  extinguishment  of  debt  of TRG and an
Unconsolidated Joint Venture.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

   TRG enters into interest rate agreements to reduce its exposure to changes in
the cost of its floating rate debt. The derivative  agreements  generally  match
the  notional  amounts,  reset dates and rate bases of the hedged debt to assure
the  effectiveness  of the  derivatives  in reducing  interest  rate risk. As of
December 31, 1997, the following interest rate cap agreements were outstanding:

                               Frequency
     Notional     LIBOR         of Rate
      Amount     Cap Rate       Resets                       Term
    ---------    --------    ------------    -----------------------------------

    $100,000       6.5%      Three Months    November 1997 through December 1998
     200,000       9.5%        Monthly       December 1997 through December 1999



  The 9.5% cap rate of the $200 million notional amount cap agreement  decreases
to 7.0% beginning in December 1998.

  TRG  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  in  the  event  of  nonperformance  by the
counterparties  to its  interest  rate  cap  and  swap  agreements,  but  has no
off-balance  sheet risk of loss. TRG anticipates  that its  counterparties  will
fully perform their obligations under the agreements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Related to Debt

  The estimated fair values of TRG's financial  instruments at December 31, 1997
and 1996 are as follows:

Note 9 - Leases

Operating Leases

  Shopping  center  space is leased to tenants and certain  anchors  pursuant to
lease agreements.  Tenant leases typically provide for guaranteed  minimum rent,
percentage  rent and other  charges to cover  certain  operating  costs.  Future
minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 1997 for operating
centers,  assuming no new or renegotiated  leases or option extensions on anchor
agreements, is summarized as follows:

                1998                 $ 205,779
                1999                   196,423
                2000                   173,580

                2002                   139,594
                Thereafter             461,160

  Certain Taubman Shopping Centers,  as lessees,  have ground leases expiring at
various dates through the year 2076. In addition,  the Manager leases its office
facilities.  Rental  payments  under ground and office leases were $9.8 million,
$8.0 million and $7.3 million in 1997, 1996 and 1995.  Included in these amounts
are related party office rental payments of $3.1 million,  $3.0 million and $2.8
million in 1997, 1996 and 1995.

  The following is a schedule of future minimum rental  payments  required under
operating leases.

                1998                   $ 8,677

                Thereafter             189,935

  The table above  includes $2.9  million,  $3.0  million,  $2.9  million,  $2.6
million,  $2.6 million and $6.2 million of related party amounts in 1998,  1999,
2000, 2001, 2002 and thereafter.

  Included  in  deferred  charges is  approximately  $6.0  million  representing
lump-sum payments for base rent on two parcels of adjacent land. These costs are
being charged to operations over the 87 and 99 year terms of the leases.

Memorial City Mall Lease

  In November  1996,  TRG entered into an agreement to lease Memorial City Mall,
located in Houston,  Texas. The lease of this  unencumbered  property grants TRG
the exclusive right to manage,  lease and operate the property.  The annual rent
is  initially $7 million.  TRG has the option to  terminate  the lease after the
third full lease year by paying $2 million to the lessor. Accordingly, the lease
will be accounted  for as an operating  lease during the option  period.  TRG is
using this option  period to evaluate  the  redevelopment  opportunities  of the
center.

  If TRG does not exercise  its option to terminate  the lease at the end of the
third full lease year, the lease continues for another 52 years and provides for
increases  in rent every ten years based on 75% of the  increase in the Consumer
Price  Index  between  1996 and the then  current  year.  Under the terms of the
lease,  TRG has agreed to invest a minimum  of $3 million  during the three year
option  period.  If the  redevelopment  proceeds,  TRG is  required to invest an
additional $22 million in property  expenditures  not  recoverable  from tenants
during the first 10 years of the lease term.


Note 10 - Transactions with Affiliates

  The  revenue  from  management,  leasing and  development  services is derived
primarily from  transactions with affiliates.  Accounts  receivable from related
parties    includes    amounts   related   to   reimbursement   of   third-party
(non-affiliated) costs.

  During 1997,  TRG acquired an option from a related party to purchase  certain
real estate on which TRG may  develop a shopping  center.  The option  agreement
requires  option  payments of $150 thousand during each of the first five years,
$400  thousand in the sixth year,  and $500 thousand in the seventh year. If TRG
exercises  the option,  the purchase  price for the property  will be between $5
million and $10 million, depending upon the year of purchase. While the optionor
will have no interest in the shopping  center  itself,  the optionor may,  under
certain  circumstances,  participate  in the proceeds from TRG's future sales of
the peripheral land contiguous to the shopping center.

  Other related party transactions are described in Notes 4, 9 and 11.

Note 11 - The Manager

  The  Manager,  The Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership,  provides  property
management, leasing and development services to the Taubman Shopping Centers and
affiliates.

  The Manager has a voluntary  retirement  savings plan  established in 1983 and
amended and restated effective January 1, 1994 (the Plan). The Plan is qualified
in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code (the Code).  The
Manager  contributes  an  amount  equal  to 2% of  the  qualified  wages  of all
qualified employees and matches employee  contributions in excess of 2% up to 7%
of  qualified   wages.   In  addition,   the  Manager  may  make   discretionary
contributions  within the limits prescribed by the Plan and imposed in the Code.
Costs relating to the Plan were $1.7 million,  $1.6 million, and $1.5 million in
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

  TRG has an incentive  option plan for  employees  of the  Manager.  Currently,
options for 8.2 million units of partnership  interest, as restated for the unit
split (Note 2), may be issued under the plan,  including options outstanding for
7.0 million  units.  The exercise  price of all options  outstanding is equal to
market  value on the  date of the  grant.  Incentive  options  generally  become
exercisable  to the  extent  of  one-third  of the  units on each of the  third,
fourth, and fifth  anniversaries of the date of grant.  Options expire ten years
from the date of grant.

  A summary of the status of the plan as of December 31, 1997,  1996,  and 1995,
and changes during the years ending on those dates are presented below:

  Options  outstanding  at December  31, 1997 have a remaining  weighted-average
contractual  life of 5.4 years and range in exercise price from $9.39 to $13.89.
The weighted average fair value per unit of options granted during 1997 and 1995
was $2.33 and $1.37.  There were no grants in 1996.  TRG used a binomial  option
pricing  model to  determine  the grant  date  fair  values of the 1997 and 1995
grants  based on the  following  assumptions:  volatility  rates of 21% and 22%,
risk-free rates of return of  approximately  6.8% and 8%, and dividend yields of
approximately 7% and 9%, respectively.

  TRG applies APB Opinion 25 and related  Interpretations  in accounting for the
plan. The exercise price of all options  outstanding  granted under the plan was
equal to market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation expense
has been  recognized  for the  plan.  Had  compensation  cost for the plan  been
determined  based on the fair value of the  options at the grant  dates for 1997
and 1995 awards (there were no grants in 1996) consistent with the method of FAS
Statement  123, the pro forma effect on TRG's  earnings and earnings per unit of
partnership interest would not have been material.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  Effective  January 1, 1996, the Manager adopted The Taubman Company  Long-Term
Performance  Compensation  Plan.  Annually,  eligible  employees will be granted
contingent  notional TRG units of partnership  interest,  the ultimate number of
which will be based on the employee's performance. These awards, which will vest
on the third  anniversary  of the date of grant,  will also accrue  distribution
equivalents  in the form of  additional  notional  units  each  time TRG makes a
distribution  to its partners.  Upon vesting,  additional  notional units may be
granted based on the performance of the employee and the Manager and/or TRG. The
awards will be paid to the employee in cash upon vesting,  based on the value of
TRG's units of partnership interest, unless the employee elects to defer payment
as provided in the plan.  The cost of this plan was  approximately  $4.5 million
and $2.0 million for 1997 and 1996, respectively.


Note 12 - Earnings Per Unit of Partnership Interest

  Basic  earnings  per unit of  partnership  interest  are based on the  average
number of units of partnership interest outstanding during each period.  Diluted
earnings per unit of  partnership  interest  are based on the average  number of
units of partnership interest outstanding during each period,  assuming exercise
of all options for units of partnership  interest  having  exercise  prices less
than the average market value of the units using the treasury stock method.  For
the years ended December 31, 1997, 1996 and 1995,  options for 0.4 million,  1.0
million and 7.2 million  units of  partnership  interest  with average  exercise
prices of $13.58,  $12.64  and  $11.37,  respectively,  were  excluded  from the
computation of diluted  earnings per unit because the options'  exercise  prices
were greater than the average market price for the period calculated. In January
1998, TRG redeemed a partner's  interest in TRG (Note 16), which will affect the
number of units of partnership interest outstanding in 1998.

Note 13 -  Supplemental Disclosures of Non-Cash Activities

    In connection with the construction of Tuttle Crossing,  additions to assets
under capital lease and the capital lease  obligation  were recognized for $15.5
million, $25.4 million, and $14.4 million in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
The outstanding capital lease obligation was extinguished in connection with the
1997 acquisition of interests in Tuttle Crossing (Note 3).


Note 14 - Contingencies

    TRG is  currently  involved in certain  litigation  arising in the  ordinary
course of business.  Management  believes that this  litigation  will not have a
material adverse effect on TRG's assets or results of operations.

Note 16 - Subsequent Events

  In January 1998,  TRG redeemed a partner's  6.1 million  units of  partnership
interest for approximately  $77.7 million  (including costs). The redemption was
funded through the use of an existing revolving credit facility.

  Subsequent  to  December  31,  1997,   Fairfax   Company  of  Virginia  L.L.C.
(successor-in-interest  to Fairfax Associates,  a 50% owned Unconsolidated Joint
Venture)  completed a $140 million,  6.60%,  secured financing maturing in 2008.
The net proceeds were used to  extinguish  an existing  mortgage on Fair Oaks of
approximately  $39 million and pay a prepayment  penalty of  approximately  $1.8
million. In addition, proceeds of $5.6 million were used to close out a treasury
lock agreement  entered into in 1997, which resulted in an effective rate on the
financing of  approximately  7%. The remaining  proceeds were distributed to the
owners.  TRG used its 50% share of the  distribution  to pay down its  revolving
credit facilities.

Partners
The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership

  We have audited the  accompanying  combined  balance sheets of  Unconsolidated
Joint   Ventures  of  The  Taubman   Realty  Group  Limited   Partnership   (the
"Partnership")  as of  December  31,  1997 and 1996,  and the  related  combined
statements of operations,  accumulated  deficiency in assets, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 1997.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

  We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion,  such combined  financial  statements  present fairly,  in all
material respects,  the financial  position of Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures of
The Taubman  Realty Group Limited  Partnership as of December 31, 1997 and 1996,
and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1997 in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting  principles.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules,   when  considered  in  relation  to  the  basic  combined  financial
statements  taken  as a whole,  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
information set forth therein.

                       Three Years Ended December 31, 1997



Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

  The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership  (TRG) engages in the ownership,
management,  leasing, acquisition,  development and expansion of regional retail
shopping  centers  (Taubman  Shopping  Centers) and interests  therein.  TRG has
engaged  the  Manager  (The  Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership,   which  is
approximately 99% beneficially owned by TRG) to provide property  management and
leasing  services  for the Taubman  Shopping  Centers and to provide  corporate,
development,   and  acquisition  services.  For  financial  statement  reporting
purposes,  the accounts of Taubman Shopping Centers owned through joint ventures
with third parties that are not controlled  (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) have
been combined in these financial statements.  Generally,  net profits and losses
of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  are  allocated  to TRG and the  outside
partners   (Joint  Venture   Partners)  in  accordance   with  their   ownership
percentages.

  Dollar amounts presented in tables within the notes to the combined  financial
statements are stated in thousands.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

  TRG's  interest in each of the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures at December 31,
1997, is as follows:

                                                                     TRG's %

  Arizona Mills, L.L.C.  developed Arizona Mills, a value super-regional mall in
Tempe,  Arizona,  which opened in November  1997.  TRG's  ownership  interest in
Arizona Mills,  L.L.C.  increased in January 1997 to 37% from 35% as a result of
Arizona  Mills,  L.L.C.'s  redemption  of a former  owner's 5% interest for $2.8
million.  The former owner is an affiliate of a partner in TRG. In 1996, Arizona
Mills,  L.L.C.  purchased for $24.8 million  approximately  116 acres of land on
which the Center was constructed  from an affiliate of a partner in TRG and of a
former owner in Arizona Mills. Also in 1996, TRG and the other owners of Arizona
Mills  contributed  non-cash  pre-construction  costs  related  to  this  center
totaling $12.8 million.

            UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES OF THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP
                               LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
              NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)


  In July 1996, TRG completed transactions that resulted in it acquiring the 75%
interest in Fairlane Town Center  (Fairlane)  previously held by a Joint Venture
Partner.   TRG  also  assumed  mortgage  debt  of  approximately   $26  million,
representing the former Joint Venture Partner's beneficial interest in the $34.6
million mortgage encumbering the property. The accounts of Fairlane are included
in these  combined  financial  statements  until the  acquisition  date.  On the
acquisition  date,  the book values of Fairlane's  assets and  liabilities  were
approximately $25 million and $39 million, respectively.

  In  December  1995,  the bank  group  holding  the $99.5  million  nonrecourse
mortgage  encumbering  Bellevue  Center  acquired  title to the Center through a
nonjudicial  foreclosure  sale.  The mortgage  matured on November 1, 1995.  TRG
ceased to recognize  the results of Bellevue  Associates  (Bellevue),  TRG's 60%
owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owned the Center,  as of November 1,
1995, and, accordingly,  the accounts of Bellevue Associates are not included in
these combined financial statements from that date.

  As a result of the foreclosure and debt extinguishment, Bellevue recognized in
1995 an  extraordinary  gain of  approximately  $31.4 million,  representing the
difference  between  the  carrying  value of the debt and the fair  value of the
Center, net of related  transaction costs, and an ordinary gain of approximately
$4.4 million,  representing  the excess of the fair value of the Center over its
carrying  value.  The  extinguishment  of the debt and write off of the Center's
carrying value represent non-cash transactions.

Revenue Recognition

  Shopping  center space is generally  leased to specialty  retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis as earned,  the result of which
does not differ  materially from a straight-line  method.  Percentage  rents are
recognized on an accrual basis as earned.  Expense recoveries,  which include an
administrative fee, are recognized as revenue in the period applicable costs are
chargeable to tenants.

Depreciation and Amortization

  Buildings,  improvements  and equipment,  stated at cost,  are  depreciated on
straight-line or double-declining  balance bases over the estimated useful lives
of the assets  which range from 3 to 55 years.  Tenant  allowances  and deferred
leasing  costs are  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the lives of the
related leases.

Capitalization

  Costs related to the acquisition,  development,  construction, and improvement
of properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction
is substantially  complete.  Properties are reviewed for impairment if events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amounts of the properties
may not be recoverable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash  equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

              NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)


Deferred Charges

  Direct  financing  and interest  rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

  Premiums paid for interest  rate caps are  amortized to interest  expense over
the terms of the cap agreements.  Amounts  received under the cap agreements are
accounted  for on an accrual  basis,  and  recognized as a reduction of interest
expense. The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements is accounted
for on an accrual basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
financial instruments:

    The  carrying  value  of cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  and  notes
      receivable,  and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short
      maturity of these instruments.

    The fair value of mortgage notes and other notes payable is estimated  based
      on quoted market prices if available, or on the current rates available to
      the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures for debt of similar terms and maturity
      and the  assumption  that debt will be  prepaid at the  earliest  possible
      date.

    The fair  value of  interest  rate  hedging  instruments  is the  amount the
      Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  would  pay or  receive  to  terminate  the
      agreement at the  reporting  date,  taking into account  current  interest
      rates.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

Reclassifications

  Certain  prior  year  amounts  have  been  reclassified  to  conform  to  1997
classifications.

  The Arizona Mills loan is a construction  facility with a maximum availability
of $145 million. The rate is capped at 9.5% until maturity,  plus credit spread.
The payment of  principal  and interest is  guaranteed  by each of the owners of
Arizona  Mills to the extent of its  ownership  percentage.  The loan  agreement
provides  for  the  reduction  of  the  amount   guaranteed  as  certain  center
performance and valuation criteria are met.

  The other  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures with floating rate debt have entered
into interest rate  agreements to reduce their exposure to increases in interest
rates.  The rate on Cherry  Creek's loan is capped at 6.5% through  January 1998
and from February 1998 to maturity at 7%, plus credit spread, based on one month
LIBOR. The loan can be extended up to an additional three years. The rate on the
Twelve Oaks loan is capped at 8.55% until maturity, plus credit spread, based on
one month LIBOR.  The interest rate on $93.5  million of the Woodfield  loan was
swapped to maturity at an effective annual rate of 5.4%. The rate on the balance
of the  Woodfield  financing,  which has been capped at a maximum  annual  rate,
including  credit  spread,  of 6.5% to maturity by an interest  rate  agreement,
floats at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 0.5%. The Westfarms  balance of $51.8
million  represents  borrowings  under a  construction  facility  with a maximum
availability  of $55 million.  The rate on the  construction  facility is capped
until maturity at 6.5%, plus credit spread.

  The Stamford note also requires payment of additional  interest ($1.3 million,
$1.6  million,  and $1.4  million in 1997,  1996,  and 1995) based on  operating
results.

                                                    =====   ======

Interest Expense

  Interest paid on mortgages and other notes payable in 1997, 1996 and 1995, net
of  amounts  capitalized  of $9.4  million,  $4.8  million,  and  $3.5  million,
approximated $48.7 million, $49.9 million, and $55.6 million.

Extraordinary Items

  In 1995, Bellevue Associates recognized an extraordinary gain of approximately
$31.4 million (Note 1). The extraordinary charge to income totaling $0.6 million
in  1995   primarily   represented   a  prepayment   penalty   relating  to  the
extinguishment of mortgage debt.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

  Certain of the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures have entered into interest rate
swap and cap  agreements  to reduce  their  exposure  to  changes in the cost of
floating rate debt. The terms of the derivative agreements are equivalent to the
notional  amounts,  reset dates and rate bases of the underlying  hedged debt to
assure the  effectiveness  of the  derivatives  in reducing  interest rate risk.
These  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures are exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance  by  their   counterparties  to  the  agreements,   but  have  no
off-balance sheet risk of loss. These  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures anticipate
that their  counterparties will be able to fully perform their obligations under
the agreements.

  In  1997,  Fairfax  Associates  entered  into a  treasury  lock  agreement  to
effectively fix the rate on its anticipated  refinancing of the mortgage on Fair
Oaks. At December 31, 1997,  Fairfax  Associates would have paid $4.2 million to
close out the agreement (Note 7).

million in 1997.

  Westfarms  previously loaned $2.4 million to one of its Joint Venture Partners
to purchase a portion of a deceased Joint Venture Partner's  interest.  The note
bears interest at approximately  7.9% and requires monthly principal payments of
$25 thousand,  plus accrued  interest,  with the final payment due in 2001.  The
balance  at  December  31,  1997 and 1996 was  $1.3  million  and $1.6  million,
respectively. Interest income related to the loan was approximately $0.1 million
in 1997, 1996, and 1995.

Note 7 - Subsequent Event

  Subsequent  to  December  31,  1997,   Fairfax   Company  of  Virginia  L.L.C.
(successor-in-interest  to Fairfax Associates) completed a $140 million,  6.60%,
secured financing  maturing in 2008. The net proceeds were used to extinguish an
existing mortgage on Fair Oaks of approximately $39 million and pay a prepayment
penalty of  approximately  $1.8 million.  In addition,  proceeds of $5.6 million
were used to close out a treasury lock agreement  entered into in 1997 (Note 4),
which  resulted in an effective rate on the financing of  approximately  7%. The
remaining proceeds were distributed to the owners.

          the Unincorporated Materials, free from any lien or encumbrances, upon
          payment therefor;

               (5) the Agent  shall have  received  copies of any  documents  of
          title and warehouse receipts that evidence title to the Unincorporated
          Materials;

               (6) the Agent shall have received such documents and instruments,
          including,   without  limitation,   financing   statements,   security
          agreements,  consents  of  manufacturers,  vendors,  warehousemen  and
          bailees,  as the Agent may  reasonably  require to evidence or perfect
          the Agent's lien on the Unincorporated Materials;

               (7) upon request by Agent, the Agent shall have received evidence
          satisfactory  to  it  that  all  specially  fabricated  Unincorporated
          Materials have been fabricated in accordance with the Plans; and

               (8) if the Agent  advances  amounts to pay contract  deposits for
          Unincorporated  Materials,  and title has not passed to Borrower,  the
          Agent shall have  received a first,  perfected,  enforceable  security
          interest in Borrower's rights in the contract for the purchase of such
          materials and any sums payable or  refundable to Borrower  thereunder,
          and,  if  requested  by the  Agent,  the  contract  vendor  shall have
          consented  to such  assignment  and agreed to perform its  obligations
          under such contract for the benefit of the Agent.

          2.3 Budget Evaluation. If at any time Agent, after reallocation of any
amounts under  subsection 2.4,  reasonably  determines after  consultation  with
Borrower that the portion of the Available Commitment allocated to any line item
of the Budget is not  sufficient to pay the cost of  completing  such line item,
except,  so long as no  Event  of  Default  is  continuing,  the  line  item for
interest, (any such deficiency, a "Budget Deficit"),  Borrower shall be required
to pay costs of such line item or items as to which the  Budget  Deficit  exists
with funds from some other source  (including the contingency  line item) before
Lenders advance proceeds of the Loans to pay such costs and upon such payment by
Borrower, such Budget Deficit shall be remedied.

          2.4 Budget Reallocation and Adjustments.  If at any time the Available
Commitment  allocated  to any line item shown on the Budget  exceeds  the amount
necessary for such line item, then Borrower,  with the approval of Agent,  which
approval shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed, may allocate the amount
of such excess to any other line item shown on the Budget that Agent deems to be
insufficient,  or if no other line item is insufficient  Borrower may reallocate
the amount of such excess to

                                                                              20



any other  line item  shown on the  Budget  (including  contingency),  provided,
however,  such reallocation shall require Agent's prior approval,  such approval
not to be unreasonably  withheld and which approval shall not be required if the
aggregate amount of such reallocation is for an amount less then $5,000,000.

          2.5 Use of  Proceeds.  The  proceeds  of the  Loans  shall  be used by
Borrower only for payment of costs specified in the Budget.


          SECTION 3. BORROWING PROCEDURES
                     --------------------


          3.1 Procedure for  Borrowing.  Borrower  shall give Agent  irrevocable
notice  (which  notice must be  received by Agent prior to 10:00 A.M.,  New York
City time,  seven Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date (which date shall be
prior  to the  Termination  Date)  requesting  that  Lenders  make  loans on the
Borrowing Date and  specifying  (i) the amount to be borrowed,  (ii) whether the
Loans are to be initially  Eurodollar Loans,  Prime Rate Loans, or a combination
thereof,  and (iii) if the Loans are to be entirely or partly  Eurodollar Loans,
the respective  amounts of each such Type of Loan and the respective  lengths of
the initial Interest Periods  therefor.  Upon receipt of such notice Agent shall
promptly  notify each Lender  thereof.  Provided all conditions to an advance of
the Loan proceeds have been satisfied or otherwise waived by Agent in accordance
with the terms  hereof,  Lenders  shall  deposit  in an  account  designated  by
Borrower for transmittal upon Borrower's order, in immediately  available funds,
the amount of the advance then  requested.  Upon the  occurrence  and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, at Agent's option, Lenders may advance funds
by payment  directly  to the third  party to whom an amount is payable and Agent
shall provide  Borrower  with notice  promptly  after such advance is made.  The
execution of this Agreement by Borrower constitutes an irrevocable authorization
to Lenders to advance Loan proceeds as provided in this  subsection.  No further
authorization  shall be  necessary  to warrant  such direct  advances.  All sums
advanced  by  direct  payment  to  third  parties  shall  reduce  the  Available
Commitment, shall be evidenced by the Notes and shall be secured by the Security
Documents.  Lenders  shall  have no  obligation  to make  advances  of the  Loan
proceeds  more often than once in each  calendar  month.  Lenders  shall have no
obligation to see to the disposition of any direct payments to any contractor or
other Person.

          3.2 First Advance and Subsequent  Advances.  The first advance of Loan
proceeds shall be made upon satisfaction of all conditions  specified in Section
7 of this  Agreement.  All advances  after the first  advance shall be made upon
satisfaction of all conditions specified in Section 8 of this Agreement.




<PAGE>


                                                                              21



          3.3 Waivers of Conditions.  (a) Agent, in its sole discretion may, but
shall have no  obligation  to,  waive any  requirements  imposed on Borrower for
giving notice of borrowing.

          (b) If any or all conditions  precedent to an advance of Loan proceeds
have not been satisfied on any Borrowing Date,  Agent,  in its sole  discretion,
may, but shall have no obligation to, waive such  conditions and disburse all or
a part of the requested  advance subject  however,  to the provisions of Section
11.4 hereof. No person dealing with Borrower, directly or indirectly, shall have
standing to object to such waiver.  Such  waivers and advances  pursuant to such
waivers shall be deemed made pursuant to this Agreement and not in  modification
of this Agreement.

          3.4 Advances to Pay  Interest.  (a) Included in the Budget are amounts
allocated  to pay  interest on the Loans.  Subject to the  conditions  set forth
below,  Borrower shall request advances to be made on each Interest Payment Date
for the  purpose of paying the  interest  due or to become due at such time,  in
which event Lenders shall be authorized and are hereby  directed to disburse the
amount of such  interest by crediting  the bank account  maintained  by Borrower
with Agent.  No separate fund or account shall be created for such interest.  In
no event shall  Lenders be obligated to make any advance if the request for such
advance  does not  contain a direction  to pay  interest on the Loans due at the
time of such advance unless Borrower has paid interest to Lenders  directly from
a source  other  than the Loan  proceeds.  Any such  request  for an  advance of
interest  shall be  accompanied  by a direction by Borrower to Lenders to charge
such bank  account  for the amount of such  interest  then due and  advanced  to
Borrower by Lenders.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  Borrower  hereby requests
Lenders to make  advances  to pay such  interest  on the day when each  interest
payment is due in the amount of interest  then due, by crediting  such amount to
the bank account maintained by Borrower with Agent and charging such account for
such  interest.  Lenders  may  comply  with the  foregoing  request at any time,
notwithstanding any failure by Borrower to make a more specific request.

          (b) Agent, in its discretion, may refuse to advance for the payment of
interest at such time and so long as either a Default or an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.  If Agent  determines not to advance for the payment
of interest for such reason,  Agent shall so notify  Borrower and Borrower shall
be  obligated  to pay all  interest  becoming due on the Loans after such notice
from a source other than Loan proceeds,  in the manner and at the times provided
in the Notes,  provided  that if Agent is stayed or  otherwise  prohibited  from
providing such notice,  Borrower shall  nevertheless  be liable for all interest
becoming due.

          3.5  Optional  Prepayments.  Borrower may at any time and from time to
time prepay the Loans, in whole or in part,



<PAGE>


                                                                              22



without premium or penalty, provided that (a) Borrower shall have given at least
four  Business  Days' prior notice to Agent,  specifying  the date and amount of
prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurodollar  Loans,  Prime Rate Loans
or a combination thereof, and, if of a combination thereof, the amount allocable
to each, (b) all accrued and unpaid  interest to the date of such  prepayment on
the amount being  prepaid is then paid and (c) any amounts  payable  pursuant to
subsection  3.15 are then paid.  Upon  receipt of any such  notice  Agent  shall
promptly notify each Lender thereof. Amounts prepaid on account of the Loans may
not be reborrowed. Partial prepayments shall be in an aggregate principal amount
of $100,000 or a whole multiple thereof.

          3.6 Conversion and Continuation  Options.  (a) Borrower may elect from
time to time to convert  Eurodollar  Loans to Prime  Rate Loans by giving  Agent
irrevocable  notice no later than 11:00 A.M. at least three LIBOR  Business Days
prior  to such  requested  conversion,  provided  that any  such  conversion  of
Eurodollar  Loans may only be made on the last day of an  Interest  Period  with
respect  thereto.  Borrower  may elect from time to time to  convert  Prime Rate
Loans to Eurodollar Loans by giving Agent irrevocable notice no later than 11:00
A.M. at least three LIBOR Business Days prior to such requested conversion.  Any
such notice of conversion  to  Eurodollar  Loans shall specify the length of the
initial Interest Period or Interest Periods  therefor.  Upon receipt of any such
notice  Agent shall  promptly  notify each  Lender  thereof.  All or any part of
outstanding  Eurodollar  Loans and Prime Rate Loans may be converted as provided
herein,  provided that (i) no Loan may be converted into a Eurodollar  Loan when
any Event of Default has occurred  and is  continuing  and Agent has  determined
that such a conversion is not appropriate and (ii) no Loan may be converted into
a Eurodollar Loan after the date that is one month prior to the Maturity Date.

          (b) Any Eurodollar  Loans may be continued as such upon the expiration
of the then  current  Interest  Period with respect  thereto by Borrower  giving
notice  to Agent,  in  accordance  with the  applicable  provisions  of the term
"Interest  Period"  set  forth in  subsection  1.1,  of the  length  of the next
Interest Period to be applicable to such Loans, provided that no Eurodollar Loan
may be  continued  as such (i) when any Event of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing and Agent has determined  that such a continuation is not appropriate
or (ii)  after  the  date  that is one  month  prior  to the  Maturity  Date and
provided,  further,  that if Borrower shall fail to give any required  notice as
described  above in this  paragraph  or if such  continuation  is not  permitted
pursuant to the preceding  proviso such Loans shall be automatically  converted,
at Agent's  election,  to Prime Rate Loans or one-month  Eurodollar Loans on the
last day of such then expiring Interest Period.

          3.7 Minimum  Amounts of  Tranches;  Maximum  Number of  Tranches.  All
borrowings, conversions and continuations of Loans



<PAGE>


                                                                              23



hereunder and all  selections  of Interest  Periods  hereunder  shall be in such
amounts and be made  pursuant to such  elections so that,  after  giving  effect
thereto,  the aggregate principal amount of the Loans comprising each Eurodollar
Tranche  shall be at least  equal to  $1,000,000.  No more than five  Eurodollar
Tranches in the aggregate may be  outstanding  at any time under this  Agreement
and the Notes.

            3.8 Interest Rates and Payment Dates. (a) Each Eurodollar Loan shall
bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a
rate per annum equal to the  Eurodollar  Rate  determined  for such day plus the
Applicable Margin.

          (b) Each Prime Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal
to the Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

          (c) If all or a portion of (i) the principal  amount of any Loan, (ii)
any interest payable thereon or (iii) any fee or other amount payable  hereunder
shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated  maturity,  by acceleration or
otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is
(x) in the  case  of  overdue  principal,  the  rate  that  would  otherwise  be
applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing  provisions of this subsection plus
4% or (y) in the  case of  overdue  interest,  fee or  other  amount,  the  rate
described in  paragraph  (b) of this  subsection  plus 4%, in each case from the
date of such  non-payment  until  such  amount is paid in full (as well after as
before judgment);  provided,  however, that in the case of overdue interest, the
rate  described  in clause (y) shall not apply if such  interest  is paid within
three Business Days after written notice to Borrower.

          (d)  Interest  shall be payable in  arrears on each  Interest  Payment
Date,  provided  that  interest  accruing  pursuant  to  paragraph  (c) of  this
subsection shall be payable from time to time on demand.

          3.9  Computation  of Interest and Fees. (a) Fees and interest shall be
calculated  on the basis of a 360-day  year for the actual days  elapsed.  Agent
shall as soon as practicable  notify Borrower and Lenders of each  determination
of a Eurodollar Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from a
change in the Prime Rate, or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements, shall become
effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change  becomes
effective. Agent shall as soon as practicable notify Borrower and Lenders of the
effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.

          (b) Each  determination  of an interest rate by Agent  pursuant to any
provision of this  Agreement  shall be conclusive and binding on Borrower in the
absence of manifest error.  Agent shall, at the request of Borrower,  deliver to
Borrower a

                                                                              24



statement  showing the quotations used by Agent in determining any interest rate
pursuant to subsection 3.9(a).

          3.10  Inability to Determine  Interest Rate. If prior to the first day
of any Interest Period:

          (a)  Agent  shall  have  determined  (which   determination  shall  be
     conclusive  and binding upon  Borrower)  that,  by reason of  circumstances
     affecting the relevant  market,  adequate and reasonable means do not exist
     for ascertaining the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period, or

          (b) Agent shall have  received  notice from the Required  Lenders that
     the Eurodollar Rate determined or to be determined for such Interest Period
     will not  adequately  and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making
     or maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period,

Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic  notice  thereof to Borrower and Lenders
as soon as  practicable  thereafter.  If such notice is given (x) any Eurodollar
Loans  requested  to be made on the first day of such  Interest  Period shall be
made as Prime Rate Loans,  (y) any Loans that were to have been converted on the
first day of such Interest  Period to Eurodollar  Loans shall be converted to or
continued as Prime Rate Loans and (z) any outstanding  Eurodollar Loans shall be
converted,  on the first day of such Interest Period, to Prime Rate Loans. Until
such notice has been withdrawn by Agent,  no further  Eurodollar  Loans shall be
made or continued as such, nor shall Borrower have the right to convert Loans to
Eurodollar Loans.

          3.11 Pro Rata  Treatment and Payments.  (a) Each borrowing by Borrower
from the  Lenders  hereunder,  each  payment by  Borrower on account of any fees
hereunder  shall  be  made  pro  rata  according  to the  respective  Commitment
Percentages of the Lenders. Each payment (including each prepayment) by Borrower
on account of  principal  of and  interest  on the Loans  shall be made pro rata
according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the Loans then held
by  Lenders.  All  payments  (including  prepayments)  to be  made  by  Borrower
hereunder and under the Notes, whether on account of principal,  interest,  fees
or otherwise,  shall be made without set off or  counterclaim  and shall be made
prior to 12:00 Noon,  New York City time, on the due date thereof to Agent,  for
the account of Lenders,  at Agent's  office  specified in  subsection  11.3,  in
Dollars and in immediately available funds. Agent shall distribute such payments
to Lenders  promptly  upon  receipt in like funds as  received.  If any  payment
hereunder (other than payments on the Eurodollar  Loans) becomes due and payable
on a day other than a Business  Day,  such payment shall be extended to the next
succeeding  Business Day,  and, with respect to payments of principal,  interest
thereon shall be payable at the then applicable  rate during such extension.  If
any payment on a



<PAGE>


                                                                              25



Eurodollar  Loan  becomes due and  payable on a day other than a LIBOR  Business
Day,  the  maturity  thereof  shall be  extended  to the next  succeeding  LIBOR
Business Day unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment
into another  calendar  month,  in which event such payment shall be made on the
immediately preceding LIBOR Business Day.

          (b) Unless  Agent  shall have been  notified  in writing by any Lender
prior to a  borrowing  that such  Lender  will not make the  amount  that  would
constitute its Commitment Percentage of such borrowing available to Agent, Agent
may assume that such Lender is making such amount  available to Agent, and Agent
may (but shall be under no obligation),  in reliance upon such assumption,  make
available  to  Borrower  a  corresponding  amount.  If such  amount  is not made
available to Agent by the required time on the  Borrowing  Date  therefor,  such
Lender shall pay to Agent,  on demand,  such amount with  interest  thereon at a
rate equal to the daily  Federal  Funds Rate for the  period  until such  Lender
makes  such  amount  immediately  available  to Agent.  A  certificate  of Agent
submitted to any Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this  subsection
shall  be  conclusive  in the  absence  of  manifest  error.  If  such  Lender's
Commitment  Percentage of such  borrowing is not made available to Agent by such
Lender within three  Business Days of such Borrowing  Date,  Agent shall also be
entitled  to recover  such amount  with  interest  thereon at the rate per annum
applicable to Prime Rate Loans  hereunder,  on demand,  from Borrower,  provided
that (i) the  foregoing  shall not impair any of  Borrower's  rights or remedies
against such Lender and (ii) Agent shall promptly notify such Lender that it has
defaulted under this Agreement.

          3.12 Illegality.  Notwithstanding  any other provision  herein, if the
adoption of or any change in any Legal  Requirement or in the  interpretation or
application  thereof  shall make it unlawful  for any Lender to make or maintain
Eurodollar  Loans as contemplated by this Agreement,  (a) the commitment of such
Lender hereunder to make Eurodollar Loans, continue Eurodollar Loans as such and
convert  Prime Rate Loans to Eurodollar  Loans shall  forthwith be cancelled and
(b) such Lender's Loans then  outstanding as Eurodollar  Loans, if any, shall be
converted  automatically  to Prime Rate Loans on the respective last days of the
then current  Interest Periods with respect to such Loans or within such earlier
period as required by law. If any such conversion of a Eurodollar Loan occurs on
a day which is not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect
thereto,  Borrower  shall pay to such  Lender  such  amounts,  if any, as may be
required pursuant to subsection 3.15.

          3.13 Legal  Requirements.  (a) If the adoption of or any change in any
Legal Requirement or in the interpretation or application  thereof or compliance
by any Lender with any request or directive  (whether or not having the force of
law) from any central  bank or other  Governmental  Authority,  in any such case
made subsequent to the date hereof:



<PAGE>


                                                                              26




          (i) shall  subject any Lender to any tax of any kind  whatsoever  with
     respect to this  Agreement,  any Note or any Eurodollar Loan made by it, or
     change the basis of taxation of payments to such Lender in respect  thereof
     (except for  Non-Excluded  Taxes covered by subsection  3.15 and changes in
     the rate of tax on the overall net income of such Lender);

          (ii) shall  impose,  modify or hold  applicable  any reserve,  special
     deposit,  compulsory  loan or similar  requirement  against assets held by,
     deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances,  loans or
     other  extensions of credit by, or any other  acquisition  of funds by, any
     office of such Lender which is not otherwise  included in the determination
     of the Eurodollar Rate; or

          (iii) shall impose on such Lender any other condition;

and the result of any of the  foregoing  is to increase the cost to such Lender,
by an amount which such Lender deems to be material, of making, converting into,
continuing or maintaining  Eurodollar  Loans or to reduce any amount  receivable
hereunder in respect  thereof,  then, in any such case,  Borrower shall promptly
pay such Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate
such Lender for such increased cost or reduced amount receivable.  If any Lender
becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this subsection, it
shall promptly notify  Borrower after it becomes aware of such increased  costs,
through  Agent,  of the event by reason of which it has  become so  entitled.  A
certificate as to any additional  amounts  payable  pursuant to this  subsection
submitted by such Lender,  through Agent, to Borrower shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest  error.  No Lender  shall be  entitled  to any  compensation
pursuant to this  Section  relating to any period more than 90 days prior to the
date notice thereof is given to Borrower by such Lender.

          (b) If any Lender shall have  determined  that any change in any Legal
Requirement  regarding capital adequacy or in the  interpretation or application
thereof or compliance by such Lender or any corporation  controlling such Lender
with any request or directive  regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having
the  force of law)  from any  Governmental  Authority,  in any  such  case  made
subsequent  to the date  hereof,  does or shall have the effect of reducing  the
rate of return on such Lender's or such  corporation's  capital as a consequence
of its  obligations  hereunder  to a level  below that which such Lender or such
corporation  could have achieved but for such change or compliance  (taking into
consideration  such  Lender's or such  corporation's  policies  with  respect to
capital  adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material,  then from
time to time, after submission by such Lender to Borrower (with a copy to Agent)
of a written request therefor, Borrower shall pay to such Lender such additional
amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such reduction.




<PAGE>


                                                                              27



          (c) If,  subsequent to the date of this Agreement,  any Lender obtains
actual knowledge of any increased costs or losses of yield as described above or
any  indemnified  Non-Excluded  Taxes  described  in  subsection  3.14(a)  below
(collectively,  "Indemnified  Losses"),  Agent, on behalf of such Lender,  shall
promptly notify Borrower  thereof,  and Lenders agree to use reasonable  efforts
(without  incurring  material  costs and without  undertaking  to restructure or
reallocate any assets other than the Loans) to minimize any Indemnified  Losses.
Notwithstanding  any provision to the contrary in this  subsection or subsection
3.15,  Borrower shall not be required to reimburse or indemnify  Lenders for any
Indemnified  Losses to the extent any such  Indemnified  Losses are  incurred or
attributable to the period ending 90 days after Borrower's  receipt of notice of
such  Indemnified  Losses,  provided  such  Indemnified  Losses  shall not apply
retroactively  and Borrower  shall prepay the Loans  pursuant to subsection  3.5
hereof within such 90-day period (such  prepayment to be made at Borrower's sole
option).

          3.14 Taxes. (a) All payments made by Borrower under this Agreement and
the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without  deduction or withholding
for or on  account  of,  any  present or future  stamp or other  taxes,  levies,
imposts,  duties,  charges,  fees, deductions or withholdings,  now or hereafter
imposed, levied, collected,  withheld or assessed by any Governmental Authority,
excluding income taxes and franchise taxes (imposed in lieu of or in addition to
income taxes)  imposed on Agent or any Lender as a result of a present or former
connection between Agent or such Lender and the jurisdiction of the Governmental
Authority  imposing such tax or any political  subdivision  or taxing  authority
thereof or therein. If any such non-excluded  taxes,  levies,  imposts,  duties,
charges, fees, deductions or withholdings ("Non-Excluded Taxes") are required to
be withheld from any amounts  payable to Agent or any Lender  hereunder or under
the Notes,  the amounts so payable to Agent or such Lender shall be increased to
the extent  necessary  to yield to Agent or such  Lender  (after  payment of all
Non-Excluded  Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the
rates or in the amounts  specified in this  Agreement  and the Notes,  provided,
however,  that  Borrower  shall not be  required to  increase  any such  amounts
payable to any Lender that is not organized  under the laws of the United States
of  America  or a  state  thereof  if such  Lender  fails  to  comply  with  the
requirements  of paragraph  (b) of this  subsection.  Whenever any  Non-Excluded
Taxes are payable by Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter Borrower shall
send to Agent for its own account or for the account of such Lender, as the case
may be, a certified copy of an original  official  receipt  received by Borrower
showing payment thereof.  If Borrower fails to pay any  Non-Excluded  Taxes when
due to the appropriate  taxing authority or fails to remit to Agent the required
receipts or other required documentary evidence,  Borrower shall indemnify Agent
and Lenders for any  incremental  taxes,  interest or penalties  that may become
payable by Agent or any Lender as a result of any such

                                                                              28



failure.  Any  Lender  making  a  claim  against  Borrower  for the  payment  of
Non-Excluded  Taxes under this Section shall  provide  prompt notice to Borrower
that  such  taxes  are due.  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  herein to the
contrary,  Borrower  shall  not be  responsible  for the  payment  of any  Taxes
incurred more than 90 days prior to Borrower's receipt of such notice.

          (b) Each Lender that is not incorporated  under the laws of the United
States of America or a state thereof shall:

          (i) deliver to  Borrower  and Agent (A) two duly  completed  copies of
     United  States  Internal  Revenue  Service Form 1001 or 4224,  or successor
     applicable  form, as the case may be, and (B) an Internal  Revenue  Service
     Form W-8 or W-9, or successor applicable form, as the case may be;

          (ii) deliver to Borrower and Agent two further copies of any such form
     or  certification on or before the date that any such form or certification
     expires or becomes obsolete and after the occurrence of any event requiring
     a change in the most recent form  previously  delivered  by it to Borrower;
     and

          (iii)  obtain such  extensions  of time for filing and  complete  such
     forms or  certifications  as may  reasonably  be  requested  by Borrower or
     Agent;

unless in any such case an event (including,  without limitation,  any change in
treaty,  law or  regulation)  has  occurred  prior to the date on which any such
delivery would  otherwise be required which renders all such forms  inapplicable
or which would prevent such Lender from duly  completing and delivering any such
form with  respect to it and such  Lender so advises  Borrower  and Agent.  Such
Lender shall certify (i) in the case of a Form 1001 or 4224, that it is entitled
to receive payments under this Agreement without deduction or withholding of any
United  States  federal  income taxes and (ii) in the case of a Form W-8 or W-9,
that it is entitled to an exemption from United States backup  withholding  tax.
Each Person that shall become a Transferee pursuant to Section 10.11 shall, upon
the  effectiveness  of the related  transfer,  be required to provide all of the
forms and statements required pursuant to this subsection,  provided that in the
case of a Participant such Participant shall furnish all such required forms and
statements  to the Lender from which the related  participation  shall have been
purchased.

          3.15  Indemnity.  Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to hold
each Lender  harmless  from any loss or expense which such Lender may sustain or
incur as a  consequence  of (a) default by  Borrower  in making a borrowing  of,
conversion into or  continuation of Eurodollar  Loans after Borrower has given a
notice  requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement,
(b) failure by Borrower in making any prepayment



<PAGE>


                                                                              29



after Borrower has given a notice  thereof in accordance  with the provisions of
this  Agreement or (c) the making of a prepayment of  Eurodollar  Loans on a day
which is not the last day of an  Interest  Period  with  respect  thereto.  Such
indemnification  may include an amount  equal to the excess,  if any, of (i) the
amount of interest which would have accrued on the amount so prepaid,  or not so
borrowed,  converted  or  continued,  for  the  period  from  the  date  of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow,  convert or continue to the last day of
such  Interest  Period  (or,  in the case of a failure  to  borrow,  convert  or
continue,  the  Interest  Period that would have  commenced  on the date of such
failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided
for herein (excluding,  however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any)
over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) which
would have  accrued to such  Lender on such  amount by  placing  such  amount on
deposit for a comparable  period with leading banks in the interbank  eurodollar
market.

          3.16  Substitution of Lenders.  (a) If any Lender (an "Affected Bank")
(i) makes demand upon Borrower for (or if Borrower is otherwise required to pay)
amounts  pursuant to Section 3.13 (any such amounts  referred to as  "Additional
Costs") or (ii) is unable to make or maintain a Eurodollar Loan as a result of a
condition  described in Section 3.12, or (iii)  defaults in its  obligations  to
make  Advances in  accordance  with the terms of this  Agreement,  Borrower may,
within 90 days of receipt of such  demand or notice (or the  occurrence  of such
other event causing  Borrower to be required to pay Additional  Costs or causing
said Section 3.12 to be applicable)  or the  occurrence of such default,  as the
case may be, give notice (a "Replacement  Notice") to Agent (which will promptly
forward a copy of such notice to each Lender) of Borrower's intention either (x)
to prepay in full the Affected  Bank's Note and to terminate the Affected Bank's
entire  Commitment  or (y) to replace the Affected  Bank with another  financial
institution (the "Replacement Bank") designated in such Replacement Notice.

      In the event Borrower  gives the notice  provided for in clause (x) above,
and if the Affected  Bank shall not agree within 30 days of its receipt  thereof
to waive the  payment of the  Additional  Costs in question or the effect of the
circumstances  described in Section 3.12 or if the Affected  Bank shall not cure
such  default  within  five days of its  receipt  thereof,  then,  so long as no
Default or Event of Default  shall  exist,  Borrower  may  (notwithstanding  the
provisions of Section 3.11)  terminate  the Affected  Bank's entire  Commitment,
provided  that  in  connection  therewith  it  pays  to the  Affected  Bank  all
outstanding  principal and accrued and unpaid interest under the Affected Bank's
Note, together with all other amounts, if any, due from Borrower to the Affected
Bank,  including all amounts properly  demanded and unreimbursed  under Sections
3.5 and all Additional Costs.

      In the event Borrower  gives the notice  provided for in clause (y) above,
and if (i) Agent shall, within 30 days of its receipt of the Replacement Notice,
notify  Borrower  and  each  Lender  in  writing  that the  Replacement  Bank is
reasonably  satisfactory to Agent and (ii) the Affected Bank shall not, prior to
the end of such  30-day  period,  agree to waive the  payment of the  Additional
Costs in question or the effect of the  circumstances  described in Section 3.12
or if the Affected  Bank shall not cure such  default,  then the  Affected  Bank
shall,  so long as no Default or Event of Default  shall exist,  assign its Note
and all of its rights and  obligations  under this Agreement to the  Replacement
Bank, and the  Replacement  Bank shall assume all of the Affected  Bank's rights
and  obligations,  pursuant  to an  agreement,  substantially  in the form of an
Assignment  and  Assumption  Agreement,  executed by the  Affected  Bank and the
Replacement  Bank and  otherwise in  accordance  with the  provisions of Section
10.11(b).  In connection with such  assignment and  assumption,  the Replacement
Bank shall pay to the Affected Bank an amount equal to the outstanding principal
amount under the Affected Bank's Note plus all interest  accrued  thereon,  plus
all other amounts,  if any (other than the Additional  Costs in question),  then
due and  payable  to the  Affected  Bank;  provided,  however,  that prior to or
simultaneously with any such assignment and assumption, Borrower shall have paid
to such  Affected  Bank all amounts  properly  demanded and  unreimbursed  under
Section 3.15.  Upon the effective date of such  assignment and  assumption,  the
Replacement  Bank shall become a Lender under this  Agreement and shall have all
the  rights  and  obligations  of a Lender as set forth in such  Assignment  and
Assumption  Agreement,  and the Affected Bank shall (except to the extent of any
damages  caused by a default by such  Lender) be released  from its  obligations
hereunder, and no further consent or action by any party shall be required. Upon
the consummation of any assignment  pursuant to this Section,  a substitute Note
shall be issued to the Replacement Bank by Borrower,  in exchange for the return
of the Affected Bank's Note. The  obligations  evidenced by such substitute note
shall constitute  "Obligations" for all purposes of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents.  If the Replacement Bank is not  incorporated  under the laws of
the United States of America or a state  thereof,  it shall,  prior to the first
date on which interest or fees are payable hereunder for its account, deliver to
Borrower and Agent  certification  as to exemption from deduction or withholding
of any United States federal income taxes in accordance with Section 3.14.

      Borrower,  Agent and the Lenders shall execute such  modifications  to the
Loan  Documents  as shall  be  reasonably  required  in  connection  with and to
effectuate the foregoing.

          3.17  Extension of Maturity  Date.  Borrower  shall have the option to
extend the Initial Maturity Date for a period of one year, from the date that is
one day after the Initial  Maturity  Date to the date that is one year after the
Initial Maturity Date (the "First Extended Maturity Date") and for a

further period (the "Second Extension Period") of one year from the date that is
one day after the First Extended Maturity Date to the date (the "Second Extended
Maturity  Date")  that is one year  after  the  First  Extended  Maturity  Date,
provided that the following conditions are satisfied for each such extension:

          (a) at least 60 days prior to the Initial  Maturity  Date or the First
     Extended Maturity Date, as the case may be, Agent shall have received:

               (i) written  notice from  Borrower of its  election to extend the
          Initial Maturity Date or the First Extended Maturity Date, as the case
          may be; and

               (ii) an  extension  fee,  for the account of the  Lenders,  in an
          amount  equal to (a) 0.10% for the First  Extension  and (b) 0.25% for
          the  Second  Extension,  of the  Commitment  Amount as of the  Initial
          Maturity Date or the First Extended Maturity Date, as the case may be;

          (b) no  Default  or  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
     continuing as of the Initial  Maturity Date or the First Extended  Maturity
     Date, as the case may be.

required to the date that this  representation  is being made or reaffirmed have
been obtained and are in full force and effect.

          4.13 Financial Statements.  Any and all financial statements delivered
to Lenders by or on behalf of Borrower or Guarantor  are true and correct in all
material respects and fairly present the financial  conditions of their subjects
as of their  respective  dates,  no material  adverse change has occurred in the
financial  conditions  reflected since their  respective dates and no additional
Indebtedness  has been incurred by Borrower  since the  respective  dates of the
latest statements,  other than the borrowings  contemplated by this Agreement or
other  Indebtedness  which has been  approved  by  Lenders in  writing.  No such
financial  statement or any certificate or statement  furnished to Lenders by or
on  behalf  of  Borrower  or  Guarantor  in  connection  with  the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement,  and no  representation  or  warranty  in this
Agreement,  contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material  fact  necessary  in  order to make the  statements  contained  in such
financial  statements,  certificates  or other  statements or this Agreement not

deficiency"  (within  the  meaning of Section  412 of the Code or Section 302 of
ERISA) has occurred during the five-year  period prior to the date on which this
representation  is made or deemed made with respect to any ERISA Plan,  and each
ERISA Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable  provisions
of ERISA and the Code. No  termination  of a Single  Employer Plan has occurred,
and no Lien in  favor  of the PBGC or an ERISA  Plan  has  arisen,  during  such
five-year  period.  The present value of all accrued  benefits under each Single
Employer  Plan (based on those  assumptions  used to fund such  Single  Employer
Plans) did not, as of the last annual  valuation date prior to the date on which
this  representation  is made or deemed made,  exceed the value of the assets of
such ERISA Plan  allocable to such accrued  benefits.  Neither  Borrower nor any
Commonly  Controlled  Entity has had a complete or partial  withdrawal  from any
Multiemployer  Plan,  and neither  Borrower nor any Commonly  Controlled  Entity
would  become  subject to any  liability  under  ERISA if  Borrower  or any such
Commonly  Controlled  Entity were to withdraw  completely from all Multiemployer
Plans as of the  valuation  date most closely  preceding  the date on which this
representation  is  made  or  deemed  made.  No  such  Multiemployer  Plan is in
Reorganization  or Insolvent.  The present value (determined using actuarial and
other  assumptions  which are reasonable in respect of the benefits provided and
the  employees  participating)  of the  liability of Borrower and each  Commonly
Controlled  Entity for post retirement  benefits to be provided to their current
and former  employees  under ERISA Plans  which are  welfare  benefit  plans (as
defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) does not, in the aggregate,  exceed the assets
under all such ERISA Plans allocable to such benefits.

          4.15 Solvency.  Borrower is, and upon consummation of the transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  the  other  Loan  Documents  and  any  other
documents, instruments or agreements relating thereto, will be, Solvent.

their intended  purposes and required by  Governmental  Authorities  have either
been completed or the necessary  rights of way therefor are owned by Borrower or
have been  acquired by  appropriate  Governmental  Authorities  or  dedicated to
public use and  accepted by said  Governmental  Authorities,  and all  necessary
steps have been taken by Borrower and said  Governmental  Authorities  to assure
the complete  construction  and  installation  thereof no later than the Outside
Completion Date or any earlier date required by any Legal Requirement, any Lease
or the REA.

          4.17 REA and Leases. The REA and all existing Leases in respect of the
Project are unmodified and in full force and effect,  there exists no default by
Borrower, or to the best of Borrower's  knowledge,  by any other party under the
REA or any  existing  Leases,  and  all  conditions  to  the  effectiveness  and
continuing  effectiveness  the  REA  and  all  existing  Leases  required  to be
satisfied as of the date hereof have been satisfied.

          4.18   Accuracy  of   Information;   Full   Disclosure.   All  written
information,  reports  and  other  papers  and data  with  respect  to  Borrower
furnished to Lenders by Borrower were, to the best of Borrower's  knowledge,  at
the  time  the  same  were so  furnished  or as of the  date of such  report  or
information,  correct  in all  material  respects,  or  have  been  subsequently
supplemented  by other  information,  reports  or other  papers or data,  to the
extent  necessary to give  Lenders a true and accurate  knowledge of the subject
matter of such  information,  reports,  or other papers and data in all material
respects. All projections with respect to Borrower furnished to Lenders by or on
behalf of Borrower,  as supplemented,  were prepared and presented in good faith
by Borrower.  No fact is known to Borrower which has or is reasonably  likely to
have a Material  Adverse  Effect,  which has not been set forth in the financial
statements  referred  to in  subsection  4.13 or in such  information,  reports,
papers and data or otherwise  disclosed in writing to Lenders  prior to the date
hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any documents, financial statements, reports,
notices, schedules,  certificates,  statements or other writings furnished by or
on behalf of Borrower to Agent or any Lender in connection  with the negotiation
of this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby,
or required  herein to be  furnished  by or on behalf of  Borrower,  contains to
Borrower's  knowledge any untrue or  misleading  statement of a material fact or
omits a material  fact  necessary to make the  statements  herein or therein not
misleading.  There is no fact known to Borrower which Borrower has not disclosed
to Agent and Lenders in writing which materially  affects  adversely nor, so far
as Borrower can now

          5.2 Performance  under Other  Agreements.  Borrower shall duly perform
and observe in all material  respects all of (a) the  covenants,  agreements and
conditions  on its part to be  performed  and  observed  under  each of the Loan
Documents and the Leases,  and (b) the  covenants,  agreements and conditions on
its part to be  performed  and  observed  under each of the  Project  Documents.
Borrower  shall  diligently  enforce  its rights and  remedies  under the Agency
Documents, the REA and the Anchor Leases in a commercially reasonable manner.

          5.3 No Encroachments.  The Improvements shall be constructed  entirely
on the Leased  Premises and shall not encroach  upon or overhang any easement or
right-of-way  or the land of others in any  material  manner.  When  erected the
Improvements  shall be wholly  within any building  restriction  lines,  however
established.  Borrower shall furnish to Agent promptly after the foundations for
the  Improvements  have  been  completed,  a  foundation  survey  prepared  by a
registered surveyor or engineer.

          5.4 Application of Insurance and Condemnation  Proceeds.  Any proceeds
of insurance or condemnation  received as a result of a casualty or taking shall
be applied  as  provided  in the  Mortgage.  In the event that Agent  shall make
available to Borrower the  proceeds of any fire or other  casualty  insurance or
condemnation  actually paid to Agent in respect of such damage or destruction of
the  Improvements  (after  deducting  therefrom  any sums  retained  by Agent in
reimbursement  for  costs  of  collection)  to pay the cost of  restoration,  as
provided in the  Mortgage,  Borrower  shall,  and shall  diligently  enforce its
rights,  if any,  under the Project  Documents  to cause the Agency to,  proceed
promptly  with  the  work  of  restoration  of the  Improvements  or  any  other
improvements  located  at the  Mall in  accordance  with  the  Plans  and  shall
prosecute the work of restoration diligently to completion.  Except as otherwise
provided in the Mortgage  with  respect to insurance  proceeds in an amount less
than $3,000,000, all insurance proceeds shall be held by Agent to secure payment
of  Borrower's  obligations  under this  Agreement,  the Notes and the  Security
Documents  and disbursed in accordance  with the  procedures  and subject to the
conditions  specified in this Agreement and the Mortgage for the disbursement of
Loan proceeds.  If any Event of Default or payment  Default shall occur prior to
completion of such work of  restoration,  then Agent,  at its option,  may apply
such  insurance  or  condemnation  proceeds  in  payment  of sums due under this
Agreement  or on the Notes or any of the  Security  Documents,  in such order as
Agent may elect in its sole discretion.  Any insurance or condemnation  proceeds
remaining  after  restoration of the  Improvements is completed shall be, (a) if
completion of such  restoration  occurs prior to the Completion Date, at Agent's
election,  applied in prepayment of the  principal  amount of the Loans,  in the
inverse order of maturity if payable in  installments,  or paid over to Borrower
or (b) if such completion of restoration  occurs after the Completion Date, paid
over to Borrower.

               against deterioration and against other loss or damage and theft;

                    (iii) Borrower  shall have  furnished to Agent  satisfactory
               evidence  that  such  cessation  of  construction  will  not  (x)
               materially  adversely affect or jeopardize the rights of Borrower
               under agreements relating to the construction or operation of the
               Project  (including  any  Leases)  or (y)  increase  the  cost of
               construction  of Borrower's  Work,  unless  Borrower shall either
               demonstrate to Agent's  satisfaction  that an adequate  source of
               funds is and shall remain available to cover such increased costs
               or deposit with Agent additional funds in an amount equal to such
               increased costs; and

                    (iv) from time to time upon Agent's  request during any such
               cessation  of  construction,  Borrower  shall  furnish  to  Agent
               satisfactory  evidence that  (notwithstanding  such  cessation of
               construction)   the  completion  of  the   Improvements   can  be
               accomplished on or prior to the Outside  Completion Date, subject
               to extensions by the period of any Force Majeure Delay.

               (f)  Nonconforming  Work. The construction of all or any material
          part of the Improvements,  including,  without limitation,  materials,
          fixtures   and   articles,   is  performed  in  a  manner  other  than
          substantially  in  accordance  with the Plans and  Borrowers  does not

          construction  of  Borrower's  Work,  which,  for  security  agreements
          securing an amount less than $1,000,000,  are not discharged  within 5
          days  after  notice  from  Agent  of the  existence  of such  security
          agreement or if any such materials, fixtures or articles are purchased
          pursuant to any

                                                                              55



          conditional sales contract or other security agreement or otherwise so
          that the  ownership of such  materials,  fixtures or articles will not
          vest  unconditionally in Borrower upon delivery,  unconditionally  and
          free from  encumbrance  or (ii)  Borrower  does not  furnish  to Agent
          within 30 days after request the contracts, bills of sale, statements,
          receipted  vouchers  and  agreements,  or any  of  them,  under  which
          Borrower claims title to such materials, fixtures or articles.

               (h) Insufficient Funds.  Borrower shall fail to remedy any Budget
          Deficit  within  (i) 30 days  after  demand  by Agent  if such  Budget
          Deficit shall occur prior to the making of the first advance hereunder
          and (ii) 30 days after  demand by Agent if such Budget  Deficit  shall
          occur after the making of the first advance hereunder.

               (i)  Defaults  under  Other  Agreements.  Any default by Borrower
          shall occur under the Ground  Lease,  the REA, the Project  Agreement,
          any Anchor Lease,  the  Construction  Documents  (subject to Borrowers
          right to  dispute  amounts  due under the  Construction  Documents  in
          accordance with Section 8.1(j)),  and any notice,  if required,  shall
          have been given and any grace or cure  period,  if  applicable,  shall
          have expired.

               (j) Failure to Complete. The Improvements shall not be completed,
          as  provided  in this  Agreement,  as of the close of  business on the
          Outside Completion Date.

               (k) Other Covenants. Borrower shall default in the performance or
          observance of any of the provisions contained in Section 6.1 or 6.4 of
          this Agreement.

               (l)  Other  Defaults.  An Event of  Default  (as  defined  in the
          Mortgage)  shall have occurred and be  continuing,  or Borrower  shall
          default in the performance or observance of any other term,  covenant,
          condition or obligation contained in this Agreement or any of the Loan
          Documents  (other than the Mortgage)  and such default shall  continue
          for 30 days after  notice  shall have been given to  Borrower by Agent
          specifying  such  default and  requiring  such default to be remedied,
          which 30-day period may be extended to the extent  required  (provided
          that such  extended  period  shall not be longer  than 180 days at any
          time when the Guaranty  Percentage  is less than 100%) if such default
          is not  susceptible  of cure  within 30 days so long as  Borrower  has
          commenced  to cure such  default  within  such  30-day  period  and is
          thereafter diligently  prosecuting such cure to completion and so long
          as such  delay  is not  likely  to  have a  Material  Adverse  Effect;
          provided,  however, any default in the payment of an obligation to pay
          a liquidated amount (including,  without  limitation,  discharging any
          non-permitted Liens) shall be promptly cured after notice by Agent.

               (m)  Security  Documents.  Any of the  Security  Documents or the
          Guaranties shall cease for any reason to be in full force



<PAGE>


                                                                              56



          and effect (except in accordance with their terms), or Borrower or any
          other Person executing any Security  Document or any Guaranty shall so
          assert in writing.

               (n) Acceleration Events. Any Automatic Acceleration Default shall
          occur.

               (o)  ERISA.  (i)  Any  Person  shall  engage  in any  "prohibited
          transaction"  (as defined in Section  406 of ERISA or Section  4975 of
          the Code)  involving  any ERISA Plan,  (ii) any  "accumulated  funding
          deficiency"  (as  defined  in Section  302 of  ERISA),  whether or not
          waived,  shall  exist  with  respect  to any ERISA Plan or any Lien in
          favor of the PBGC or an  ERISA  Plan  shall  arise  on the  assets  of
          Borrower or any Commonly  Controlled Entity,  (iii) a Reportable Event
          shall occur with respect to, or  proceedings  shall commence to have a
          trustee appointed,  or a trustee shall be appointed,  to administer or
          to terminate,  any Single  Employer Plan,  which  Reportable  Event or
          commencement  of  proceedings  or  appointment of a trustee is, in the
          reasonable  opinion  of  Required  Lenders,  likely  to  result in the
          termination  of such Single  Employer Plan for purposes of Title IV of
          ERISA,  (iv) any Single  Employer Plan shall terminate for purposes of
          Title IV of ERISA,  (v)  Borrower or any  Commonly  Controlled  Entity
          shall, or in the reasonable  opinion of Required Lenders is likely to,
          incur any  liability  in  connection  with a withdrawal  from,  or the
          Insolvency  or  Reorganization  of, a  Multiemployer  Plan or (vi) any
          other event or condition shall occur or exist with respect to an ERISA
          Plan;  and in each case in clauses (i) through (vi) above,  such event
          or condition,  together with all other such events or  conditions,  if
          any,  could subject  Borrower to any tax,  penalty or other  liability
          which,  in the  aggregate,  is material  in relation to the  business,
          operations, property or financial or other condition of Borrower.

               (p)  Guarantor   Covenants.   Guarantor   shall  default  in  the
          performance or observance of any of the covenants  contained in any of
          the  Guaranties,  after any  required  notice  has been  provided  and
          applicable cure period has expired.

          9.2 Lenders' Right to Apply Loan Proceeds.  During the  continuance of
an Event of Default,  Lenders shall have the right,  but not the obligation,  to
disburse  and  directly  apply  proceeds  of the  Loans  to  satisfy  Borrower's
obligations if and to the extent the same are due and payable.  Borrower  hereby
authorizes  Lenders during the continuance of any Event of Default to hold, use,
disburse and apply advances of the Loans for costs incurred in constructing  and
equipping  Borrower's  Work,  payment or  performance of obligations of Borrower
under the Loan  Documents  (including  payment  of  interest  on the  Loans) and
preservation  and  protection of the  Collateral.  Such  disbursements  shall be
deemed  advances  of the Loans for all  purposes  and  shall be  secured  by the
Security Documents.

                                                                              57



          9.3  Lenders'  Right to Stop  Advancing  Funds and to  Accelerate  the
Loans. In addition to any other rights and remedies Lenders may have pursuant to
the Loan Documents or otherwise, and without limitation, if any Event of Default
shall occur, (a) if such Event of Default is an Automatic  Acceleration Default,
automatically  the  Commitments  shall  terminate and the Loans  (together  with
accrued  interest) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement,  the Notes,
the Security Documents and the other Loan Documents immediately shall become due
and payable, and (b) if such event is any other Event of Default, either or both
of the  following  actions  may be taken:  (i) Agent may by notice to  Borrower,
declare the Commitments to be terminated,  in which case the  Commitments  shall
immediately  terminate;  and (ii) Agent may, by notice to Borrower,  declare the
Loans  (together with accrued  interest  thereon) and all other amounts  payable
under this  Agreement,  the Notes,  the  Security  Documents  and the other Loan
Documents to be due and payable,  in which case such amounts  immediately  shall
become due and payable.  Except as expressly  provided above in this subsection,
Borrower hereby  expressly  waives  presentment,  demand,  protest and all other
notices of any kind.

          9.4 Lenders'  Right to Complete.  Upon the  occurrence  and during the
continuance  of any Event of Default,  in addition to any other  remedies  which
Lenders may have  pursuant to the Loan  Documents,  or as provided by statute or
rule of law, Agent may enter upon the Leased  Premises and construct,  equip and
complete Borrower's Work in accordance with the Borrower Construction Plans with
such changes in the Borrower Construction Plans as Lenders may from time to time
and in their sole discretion deem appropriate, all at the risk, cost and expense
of Borrower.  Lenders  shall have the right at any and all times to  discontinue
any work  commenced by it in respect of Borrower's  Work or to change any course
of action undertaken by it and shall not be bound to Borrower by any limitations
or  requirements  of time  whether  set forth in this  Agreement  or  otherwise.
Lenders shall have the right and power,  but shall not be  obligated,  to assume
Borrower's  interest  under any contract made by or on behalf of Borrower in any
way relating to Borrower's  Work or the  construction  of Borrower's Work and to
take over and use all or any part or parts of the labor, materials, supplies and
equipment contracted for by or on behalf of Borrower,  whether or not previously
incorporated  into Borrower's  Work, all in the sole and absolute  discretion of
Lenders.  In connection  with any  construction of Borrower's Work undertaken by
Lenders  pursuant to the provisions of this  subsection,  Lenders may (i) engage
builders,  contractors,  architects,  engineers  and others  for the  purpose of
furnishing labor, materials and equipment in connection with any construction of
Borrower's  Work,  (ii) pay,  settle or compromise all bills or claims which may
become Liens against the Leased Premises, or any part of the Leased Premises, or
which  have  been or may be  incurred  in any  manner  in  connection  with  the
construction,  completion and equipping of Borrower's  Work or for the discharge
of Liens or  defects  in the title of the  Leased  Premises,  or any part of the
Leased Premises,  and (iii) take such other action  (including the employment of
watchmen  to protect the Leased  Premises)  or refrain  from  acting  under this
Agreement, as Lenders may in their



<PAGE>


                                                                              58



sole and absolute  discretion from time to time determine without any limitation
whatsoever.  Borrower shall be liable to reimburse  Lenders for all sums paid or
incurred for the  construction,  completion  and equipping of  Borrower's  Work,
whether such sums shall be paid or incurred  pursuant to the  provisions of this
subsection or otherwise.  At Lenders' option,  all such sums shall be treated as
advances  hereunder  for all  purposes  or as demand  obligations  of  Borrower,
bearing  interest at the  non-default  interest rate provided in this  Agreement
plus 4% from  the  date of  payment  by  Lenders  to the  date of  repayment  by
Borrower. All of the foregoing amounts,  including interest,  shall be deemed to
constitute  advances under this Agreement,  be evidenced by the Note and secured
by the Security Documents. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, the rights,  powers and privileges provided in this subsection
and all other  remedies  available to Lenders under this Agreement or by statute
or by rule of law may be  exercised by Lenders at any time and from time to time
whether or not the Loan shall be due and  payable,  and  whether or not  Lenders
shall have instituted any foreclosure or other action for the enforcement of the
Security Documents or the Note.

          9.5 Power of Attorney.  For the purpose of carrying out the provisions
and  exercising  the  rights,  powers and  privileges  granted in this  Section,
Borrower hereby irrevocably  constitutes and appoints Agent,  effective upon the
occurrence  and  during the  continuance  of an Event of  Default,  its true and
lawful attorney-in-fact to execute,  acknowledge and deliver any instruments and
do and perform any acts such as are  referred to in this Section in the name and
on behalf  of  Borrower.  This  power of  attorney  is a power  coupled  with an
interest and cannot be revoked.


          SECTION 10. THE AGENT
                      ---------

          10.1  Appointment.  Each  Lender  hereby  irrevocably  designates  and
appoints Bayerische  Hypotheken-Und  Wechsel-Bank  Aktiengesellschaft,  New York
Branch  as  Agent  of such  Lender  under  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents,  and each such Lender  irrevocably  authorizes Hypo as Agent for such
Lender, to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and to exercise such powers and perform such duties
as are expressly delegated to Agent by the terms of this Agreement and the other
Loan  Documents,  together with such other powers as are  reasonably  incidental
thereto.  Notwithstanding  any  provision  to the  contrary  elsewhere  in  this
Agreement,  Agent shall not have any duties or  responsibilities,  except  those
expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary  relationship with any Lender,  and
no  implied  covenants,  functions,  responsibilities,  duties,  obligations  or
liabilities  shall be read into this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document  or
otherwise exist against Agent.

          10.2  Delegation of Duties.  Agent may execute any of its duties under
this   Agreement  and  the  other  Loan   Documents  by  or  through  agents  or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice



<PAGE>


                                                                              59



of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties.  Agent shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys  in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.

          10.3  Exculpatory  Provisions.  Neither Agent nor any of its officers,
directors,  employees,  agents,  attorneys-in-fact  or  Affiliates  shall be (i)
liable to any Lenders for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it
or such Person  under or in  connection  with this  Agreement  or any other Loan
Document  (except  for its or such  Person's  own gross  negligence  or  willful
misconduct)  or (ii)  responsible in any manner to any Lenders for any recitals,
statements,  representations  or  warranties  made by  Borrower  or any  Partner
therein  contained  in this  Agreement  or any  other  Loan  Document  or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received by Agent under or in connection  with,  this  Agreement or any other
Loan  Document  or  for  the  value,   validity,   effectiveness,   genuineness,
enforceability  or  sufficiency of this Agreement or the Notes or any other Loan
Document or for any failure of Borrower to perform its obligations  hereunder or
thereunder.  Agent shall not be under any  obligation to any Lender to ascertain
or to inquire  as to the  observance  or  performance  of any of the  agreements
contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to
inspect the properties, books or records of Borrower.

          10.4 Reliance by Agent.  Agent shall be entitled to rely, and shall be
fully protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate,  affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement,
order or other document or conversation believed by it to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed,  sent or made by the proper  Person or Persons and upon
advice and statements of legal counsel (including,  without limitation,  counsel
to Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by Agent. Agent
may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner  thereof for all  purposes
unless a written  notice of assignment,  negotiation  or transfer  thereof shall
have been  filed  with  Agent.  Agent  shall be fully  justified  in  failing or
refusing  to take any action  under this  Agreement  or any other Loan  Document
unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders
as it deems  appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by
Lenders against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. Agent shall in all cases
be fully protected by all Lenders in acting, or in refraining from acting, under
this Agreement and the Notes and the other Loan  Documents in accordance  with a
request of the  Required  Lenders,  and such  request  and any  action  taken or
failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon all Lenders and all future
holders of the Notes.

          10.5 Notice of Default. Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the  occurrence  of any Default or Event of Default  hereunder  unless
Agent has received notice from a Lender or Borrower referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default or



<PAGE>


                                                                              60



Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of  default".  In the
event that Agent  receives  such a notice,  Agent shall give  notice  thereof to
Lenders.  Agent shall take such action with  respect to such Default or Event of
Default as shall be reasonably  directed by the Required Lenders;  provided that
unless and until Agent shall have received such directions, Agent may (but shall
not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such action,  with
respect to such  Default or Event of Default as it shall deem  advisable  in the
best interests of Lenders.  In no event shall Agent be required to take any such
action which it determines to be contrary to law.

          10.6  Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders.  Each Lender  expressly
acknowledges that neither Agent nor any of its officers,  directors,  employees,
agents,   attorneys-in-fact  or  Affiliates  has  made  any  representations  or
warranties  to it and  that no act by Agent  hereinafter  taken,  including  any
review  of  the  affairs  of  Borrower,   shall  be  deemed  to  constitute  any
representation  or warranty by Agent to any Lender.  Each Lender  represents  to
Agent that it has,  independently  and without  reliance upon Agent or any other
Lender,   and  based  on  such  documents  and  information  as  it  has  deemed
appropriate,  made its own  appraisal of and  investigation  into the  business,
operations,  property,  financial and other  condition and  creditworthiness  of
Borrower  and made its own decision to make its Loans  hereunder  and enter into
this  Agreement.  Each Lender also represents  that it will,  independently  and
without reliance upon Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem  appropriate at the time,  continue to make its own
credit  analysis,  appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,  and to make such  investigation as
it deems  necessary to inform itself as to the business,  operations,  property,
financial  and other  condition  and  creditworthiness  of Borrower.  Except for
notices,  reports and other  documents  expressly  required to be  furnished  to
Lenders by Agent hereunder,  Agent shall not have any duty or  responsibility to
provide any Lender with any credit or other information concerning the business,
operations,   property,   condition  (financial  or  otherwise),   prospects  or
creditworthiness  of Borrower which may come into the possession of Agent or any
of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates.

          10.7 Indemnification. Lenders agree to indemnify Agent in its capacity
as such (to the extent not  reimbursed  by  Borrower  and without  limiting  the
obligation  of  Borrower  to do  so),  ratably  according  to  their  respective
Commitment  Percentages in effect on the date on which indemnification is sought
under this  subsection  (or, if  indemnification  is sought  after the date upon
which the  Commitments  shall have terminated and the Loans shall have been paid
in full,  ratably in accordance with their  Commitment  Percentages  immediately
prior to such  date),  from and against  any and all  liabilities,  obligations,
losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or
disbursements of any kind whatsoever  which may at any time (including,  without
limitation,  at any time  following  the  payment of the  Notes) be imposed  on,
incurred by or asserted against



<PAGE>


                                                                              61



Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement,  any of the other
Loan Documents or any documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein
or the  transactions  contemplated  hereby or  thereby  or any  action  taken or
omitted by Agent under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that
no  Lender  shall  be  liable  for  (a)  the  payment  of any  portion  of  such
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements  resulting solely from Agent's gross negligence
or willful misconduct,  (b) any loss of principal of or interest with respect to
Agent's Loans or (c) any loss  suffered by Agent in connection  with an interest
rate cap,  swap or other  interest  rate hedging  arrangement  entered into with
Borrower.  The  agreements in this  subsection  shall survive the payment of the
Notes and all other amounts payable hereunder.

          10.8 Agent in Its  Individual  Capacity.  Agent and its Affiliates may
make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business
with Borrower as though Agent were not Agent  hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents.  With  respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and any Note issued
to it, Agent shall have the same rights and powers under this  Agreement and the
other Loan  Documents  as any Lender and may exercise the same as though it were
not Agent,  and the terms  "Lender" and  "Lenders"  shall  include  Agent in its
individual capacity.

          10.9  Successor  Agent.  Agent agrees not to resign  without the prior
consent of Borrower, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided,
however,  Agent shall have the right to resign without  Borrower's consent if an
Event of Default has  occurred and is  continuing  or in the event it becomes an
Affected  Bank and is removed or replaced as a Lender  pursuant to Section 3.16.
If  Agent  shall  resign  as Agent  under  this  Agreement  and the  other  Loan
Documents,  then the  Required  Lenders  shall  appoint  from  among  Lenders  a
successor  agent for Lenders,  provided  that the  appointment  of any successor
agent other than Hypo shall be subject to the consent of Borrower, which consent
shall  not be  unreasonably  withheld  or  delayed.  Upon the  appointment  of a
successor  agent for Lenders,  such successor agent shall succeed to the rights,
powers and duties of Agent, and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent
effective upon such  appointment  and approval,  and the former Agent's  rights,
powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated, without any other or further act
or deed on the part of such former Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement
or any holders of the Notes.  After any retiring  Agent's  resignation as Agent,
the provisions of this  subsection  shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this  Agreement  and
the other Loan Documents.

          10.10 Rights of Agent and the Lenders. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein or in any other Loan Documents:

          (a) with the written consent of the Required  Lenders,  the Agent may,
     from time to time,  (i) enter into with the  Borrower  written  amendments,
     supplements or modifications hereto and to



<PAGE>


                                                                              62



     the Notes and the other Loan Documents,  or change in any manner the rights
     of the Lenders or of Borrower hereunder or thereunder  (including,  without
     limitation,  modifying any  financial  covenant  contained  herein) or (ii)
     waive,  on such terms and conditions as the Required  Lenders or the Agent,
     as the case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements
     of this Agreement,  the Notes or the other Loan Documents or any Default or
     Event of Default  and its  consequences;  provided,  however,  that no such
     waiver and no such amendment,  supplement or modification shall (A) without
     the written consent of each Lender  affected  thereby (i) reduce or forgive
     the  amount of any Note or of any  installment  thereof,  (ii)  extend  the
     scheduled date of maturity of the Loans or any mandatory  principal payment
     thereon,  (iii)  reduce  the stated  rate of any  interest  or fee  payable
     hereunder  or extend  the  scheduled  date of any  payment  thereof or (iv)
     forgive any portion of interest  or  principal,  fees or other  amounts due
     hereunder,  (B) without the written consent of all the Lenders,  (i) amend,
     modify or waive any  provision of this  subsection,  (ii) reduce the number
     specified  in the  definition  of Required  Lenders,  (iii)  consent to the
     assignment  or transfer  by  Borrower of any of its rights and  obligations
     under this  Agreement  and the other Loan  Documents  or (iv)  release  any
     collateral or subordinate  the Lien of the Mortgage to any other  mortgage,
     and (C) without the written  consent of the Agent,  amend,  modify or waive
     any provision of Section 10 of this Agreement. Any such waiver and any such
     amendment,  supplement or  modification  shall apply equally to each of the
     Lenders and shall be binding upon each of the  Borrower,  the Lenders,  the
     Agent  and all  future  holders  of any of the  Notes.  In the  case of any
     waiver, the Borrower,  the Lenders and the Agent shall be restored to their
     former position and rights  hereunder and under the  outstanding  Notes and
     any other Loan Documents,  and any Default or Event of Default waived shall
     be deemed to be cured and not  continuing;  but no such waiver shall extend
     to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right
     consequent thereon.

          (b) In  addition to the Agent,  the  Required  Lenders  shall have the
     right to determine that  conversion to a Eurodollar  Loan is  inappropriate
     pursuant to subsection 3.6(a) or 3.6(b) above;

          (c) If clause (b) of subsection 3.10 is invoked,  the Required Lenders
     shall certify that the Eurodollar  Rate  determined or to be determined for
     such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to the
     Lenders of making or maintaining  the affected  Eurodollar  Loan during the
     applicable Interest Period; and

          (d) Under clause (b) of Section 9.3, (i) the Agent may only accelerate
     the Obligations with the consent of the Required Lenders and (ii) the Agent
     shall  accelerate  the  Obligations  upon  the  direction  of the  Required
     Lenders.

          10.11 Participation;  Assignments. (a) Except as provided in paragraph
10.11(g),  any Lender  may, in the  ordinary  course of its  commercial  banking
business and in accordance  with applicable law, at any time sell to one or more
banks or other  entities  ("Participants")  participating  interests in any Loan
owing to such  Lender,  any Note held by such  Lender,  any  Commitment  of such
Lender or any other interest of such Lender in connection with the Loans. In the
event of any such sale by a Lender of a participating interest to a Participant,
such  Lender's  obligations  under this  Agreement to the other  parties to this
Agreement shall remain  unchanged,  such Lender shall remain solely  responsible
for the  performance  thereof,  such Lender  shall remain the holder of any such
Note for all purposes  under this  Agreement and the other Loan  Documents,  and
Borrower and Agent shall  continue to deal solely and directly  with such Lender
in connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and
the  other  Loan  Documents.  Borrower  agrees  that each  Participant  shall be
entitled to the benefits of subsections  3.13, 3.14 and 3.15 with respect to its
participation in the Commitments  outstanding from time to time; provided,  that
no Participant  shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such
provisions  than the  transferor  Lender would have been  entitled to receive in
respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender
to such Participant had no such transfer been made.

          (b) Except as  provided in  paragraph  10.11(g),  any  Lender,  in the
ordinary  course of its  commercial  banking  business  and in  accordance  with
applicable  law, at any time and from time to time may sell to any Lender or any
Affiliate thereof without  Borrower's consent or to one or more additional banks
or financial  institutions with the prior written consent of Agent and Borrower,
which consent of Borrower shall not be  unreasonably  withheld and which consent
shall  not be  required  during  the  continuance  of an Event of  Default  ("an
Assignee") all or any part of its rights and  obligations  under this Agreement,
the Notes and the other Loan Documents pursuant to an Assignment and Acceptance,
substantially  in the form of  Exhibit C,  executed  by such  Assignee  and such
assigning  Lender (and  Borrower,  if required)  and  delivered to Agent for its
acceptance  and  recording  in the  Register.  Upon  such  execution,  delivery,
acceptance and recording,  from and after the effective date determined pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance,  (x) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and shall have the rights and  obligations  of a Lender  hereunder with a
Commitment as set forth therein,  and (y) the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
to the extent provided in such  Assignment and Acceptance,  be released from its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  (and,  in the  case  of an  Assignment  and
Acceptance covering all or the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement,  such assigning Lender shall cease to be a
party hereto).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that an Event of Default
has not occurred,  (a) Hypo shall retain  Commitments in an amount not less than
$25,000,000  and (b) no Lender may assign any portion of its  Commitment  (other
than to an existing Lender) in an amount less than $15,000,000 unless it assigns
its entire Commitment.

                                                                              64



          (c) Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in subsection 11.3
a copy of each  Assignment  and  Acceptance  delivered to it and a register (the
"Register")  for the  recordation  of the names and addresses of Lenders and the
Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Lender from time
to time.  The entries in the  Register  shall be  conclusive,  in the absence of
manifest error, and Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person whose name
is recorded in the  Register as the owner of the Loan  recorded  therein for all
purposes of this  Agreement.  The Register  shall be available for inspection by
Borrower  or any  Lender  at any  reasonable  time  and from  time to time  upon
reasonable prior notice.

          (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment  and  Acceptance  executed by an
assigning  Lender and an Assignee (and  Borrower,  if  required),  together with
payment to Agent of a registration and processing fee of $3,000 (payable by such
assigning  Lender),   Agent  shall  (i)  promptly  accept  such  Assignment  and
Acceptance and (ii) on the effective date determined pursuant thereto record the
information contained therein in the Register and give notice of such acceptance
and  recordation to Lenders and Borrower.  On or prior to such  effective  date,
Borrower  shall  execute and deliver to Agent (in  exchange  for the Note of the
assigning  Lender) a new Note, as the case may be, to the order of such Assignee
in an amount equal to the  Commitment or Loan, as the case may be, assumed by it
pursuant to such  Assignment  and  Acceptance  and, if the assigning  Lender has
retained a Commitment or Loan hereunder,  a new Note, as the case may be, to the
order of the assigning  Lender in an amount equal to the  Commitment or Loan, as
the case may be, retained by it hereunder. Such new Note shall be dated the date
of this  Agreement,  and  shall  otherwise  be in the form of the Note  replaced
thereby.

          (e) Borrower  authorizes each Lender to disclose to any Participant or
Assignee  (each,  a  "Transferee")   and  any  prospective   Transferee,   on  a
confidential  basis,  any  and  all  financial   information  in  such  Lender's
possession  concerning  Borrower and its Affiliates  which has been delivered to
such Lender by or on behalf of Borrower  pursuant to this Agreement or which has
been  delivered  to such Lender by or on behalf of Borrower in  connection  with
such Lender's credit evaluation of Borrower and its Affiliates prior to becoming
a party to this Agreement.

          (f)  Nothing  herein  shall  prohibit  any  Lender  from  pledging  or
assigning  any Note to any Federal  Reserve Bank in accordance  with  applicable
law,  provided  that  no such  assignment  shall  release  such  Lender  from it
obligations hereunder.

          (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing  provisions of this Section, so long
as an Event of Default is not continuing, no Lender shall assign, grant, convey,
or transfer all or any portion of or interest  (participation  or  otherwise) in
the Loan to any Person if such Person is a partner in  Borrower.  Any Person who
becomes a Lender or Participant  in accordance  with the terms of this Agreement
agrees  to be bound by the  provisions  of this  Paragraph  and,  other  than in
connection with a bankruptcy proceeding of a partner in



<PAGE>


                                                                              65



Borrower or during the  continuance  of an Event of Default,  agrees not to take
any action that would make it a partner in Borrower. Any Lender may conclusively
rely upon the certificate of any proposed  Transferee stating that such proposed
Transferee  is not a partner in  Borrower  and the  assigning  or  participating
Lender  shall have no  liability  to Borrower  or any  partner in  Borrower  for
assigning  or  participating  any  interest  in the  Loan  in  reliance  on such
certification.

          10.12  Liability  of Agent.  Agent shall not have any  liabilities  or
responsibilities  to Borrower on account of the failure of any Lender to perform
its obligations  hereunder (without affecting any rights of Borrower  hereunder)
or to  any  Lender  on  account  of the  failure  of  Borrower  to  perform  its
obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document.


          SECTION 11. GENERAL CONDITIONS
                      ------------------

          The following  conditions  shall be applicable  throughout the term of
this Agreement:

          11.1 No Waivers.  No advance of proceeds of the Loans shall constitute
a  waiver  of any of the  conditions  of  Lenders'  obligation  to make  further
advances.  No  waiver of any such  condition  shall  constitute  a waiver of any
Default or Event of Default related to or predicated  upon such  condition.  Any
advance  made by Lenders and any sums  expended by Lenders  pursuant to the Loan
Documents  shall  be  deemed  to have  been  made  pursuant  to this  Agreement,
notwithstanding  the  existence  of an uncured  Default or Event of Default.  No
advance of the Loans at a time when an Event of Default  exists,  whether or not
Lenders had actual  knowledge of such default,  shall constitute a waiver of any
right or  remedy  of  Lenders  existing  by  reason  of such  Event of  Default,
including,  without limitation, the right to accelerate the maturity of the Loan
or to foreclose the Lien of the Security  Documents or to refuse to make further
advances of the Loan.

          11.2  Lenders  and  Agent  Sole  Beneficiary.  All  conditions  of the
obligation of Lenders and Agent to make advances of the Loan are imposed  solely
and  exclusively  for the benefit of Lenders and Agent and their  assigns and no
other Person shall have standing to require  satisfaction  of such conditions in
accordance with their terms or be entitled to assume that Lenders will refuse to
make advances in the absence of strict compliance with any or all such terms and
no Person shall, under any circumstances,  be deemed to be a beneficiary of such
conditions,  any or all of which  may be  freely  waived  in whole or in part by
Agent  and/or  Lenders  at any time if in their sole  discretion  they deem such
waiver  to be  advisable.  Lenders'  obligation  to make  advances  of the Loan,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, is solely for the benefit
of Borrower  and no other  Person  shall be deemed to be a  beneficiary  of such
obligation nor entitled to require any advance of Loan proceeds. Inspections and
approvals of the Plans and the Improvements and the

workmanship  and materials used in the  construction of the  Improvements  shall
impose no  responsibility  or liability of any nature whatsoever on Agent and/or
Lenders, and no Person shall, under any circumstances,  be entitled to rely upon
such  inspections and approvals by Agent and/or Lenders for any reason.  Lenders
are only  obligated  under this  Agreement  to make the  advances  if and to the
extent required by this Agreement.

          11.3 Notices. All notices,  demands,  consents and approvals hereunder
shall be in  writing  and shall be deemed  to have  been  sufficiently  given or
served when presented personally, when delivered to an overnight courier service
with  guaranteed  next business day delivery or, 5 days after being deposited in
the mail,  postage prepaid,  certified or registered,  return receipt requested,

provided  that any  notice,  request  or demand to or upon the Agent or  Lenders
pursuant to subsection  3.1, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 or 3.11 shall not be effective  until
received. Any party may change its address by notice to the other parties.

          11.4 Modifications. Neither this Agreement, any Note or any other Loan
Document,  nor any terms  hereof or  thereof  may be  amended,  supplemented  or
modified  except in a writing duly  executed by Borrower and Agent in accordance
with  the  terms of this  Agreement.  Any such  waiver  and any such  amendment,
supplement or  modification  shall apply equally to each of Lenders and shall be
binding upon Borrower,  Lenders,  Agent and all future holders of the Notes.  In
the case of any waiver, Borrower, Lenders and Agent shall be restored to

their former position and rights  hereunder and under the outstanding  Notes and
any other Loan  Documents,  and any Default or Event of Default  waived shall be
deemed to be cured and not  continuing;  but no such waiver  shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default,  or impair any right consequent
thereon.

          11.5 Rights Cumulative. All rights, powers and remedies given to Agent
and Lenders under this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative,  and are in
addition to all rights, powers and remedies otherwise afforded Agent and Lenders
under  all  statutes  and  rules  of  law  (all  rights,   powers  and  remedies
collectively,  "Lenders' Rights");  any forbearance or delay by Agent or Lenders
in exercising any of Lenders' Rights shall not be deemed to be a waiver, and the
exercise or partial  exercise of any of Lenders'  Rights  shall not preclude the
further  exercise of any of Lenders'  Rights which shall  continue in full force
and effect until  specifically  waived by an instrument  in writing  executed by
Agent or Lenders. All representations, warranties and covenants contained in any
of the Loan Documents shall survive the making of the Loans.

          11.6 Sign.  Prior to the Outside  Completion Date, at Lenders' option,
Borrower  will,  to the  extent  it has the  right  to do so  under  the  Agency
Documents and in  compliance  with Legal  Requirements  and at its sole cost and
expense,  erect and  maintain  a sign on the Land  indicating  the source of the
construction  financing,  which sign shall be subject to Agent's and  Borrower's
reasonable approval.

          11.7 Schedules. The Schedules attached to this Agreement are essential
to and are made a part of this Agreement.

          11.8 Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of  Borrower,  Lenders,  Agent,  all future  holders of the
Notes and their respective successors and assigns,  except that Borrower may not
assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of each Lender.

          11.9  Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE AND DELIVERED IN NEW YORK,
NEW YORK AND SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND  INTERPRETED  IN ACCORDANCE
WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICT
OF LAWS.

          11.10  Submission  to  Jurisdiction.  All judicial  actions,  suits or
proceedings  brought  against  Borrower  and its  property  with  respect to its
obligations,  liabilities  or any other  matter  under or  arising  out of or in
connection  with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for recognition or
enforcement of any judgment  rendered in any such  proceedings may be brought in
any trial or appellate  state or federal court of competent  jurisdiction in the
City of New York. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, Borrower accepts,
generally and unconditionally, the non-exclusive jurisdiction of such courts and
irrevocably  waives, and agrees not to plead or claim, any objection that it may
ever have to the venue of any such action or



<PAGE>


                                                                              68



proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an
inconvenient  court.  Borrower  irrevocably  agrees  that  all  process  in  any
proceeding or any court arising out of or in connection  with this  Agreement or
any of the other Loan  Documents,  may be effected by mailing to Borrower a copy
by  registered  or  certified  mail or any  substantially  similar form of mail,
postage  prepaid,  to Borrower at its address set forth in subsection 11.3 or at
such other address of which Lenders shall have been notified in accordance  with
the terms of such  subsection.  Such service  shall be effective  ten days after
such  mailing.  Such  service  will be  effective  and binding  service in every
respect.  Borrower  shall  not  assert  that  such  service  did not  constitute
effective  and binding  service  within the meaning of any  applicable  state or
federal law,  rule,  regulation  or the like.  Borrower  irrevocably  waives any
objections, including without limitation any objection to the laying of venue or
based on the grounds of forum non conveniens,  which it may now or in the future
have to the bringing of any such action or proceeding in any such  jurisdiction.
Nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right to effect service of process in
any other  manner  permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue in any other
jurisdiction.

          11.11  WAIVERS  OF JURY  TRIAL.  BORROWER,  Agent AND  LENDERS  HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY  AND  UNCONDITIONALLY  WAIVE  TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY  LEGAL  ACTION OR
PROCEEDING  RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT OR THE NOTES OR ANY OTHER LOAN  DOCUMENT
AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

          11.12 Captions.  The captions in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only, and in no way limit or amplify the provisions of this Agreement.

          11.13 Adjustments;  Set-off. (a) If any Lender (a "benefitted Lender")
shall at any time  receive any payment of all or part of its Loans,  or interest
thereon,  or receive any collateral in respect thereof  (whether  voluntarily or
involuntarily,  by  set-off,  pursuant  to events or  proceedings  of the nature
referred to in Section  19(a)(v) of the Mortgage,  or  otherwise),  in a greater
proportion than any such payment to or collateral  received by any other Lender,
if any,  in respect of such other  Lender's  Loans,  or interest  therein,  such
benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating
interest in such portion of each such other Lender's Loan, or shall provide such
other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, or the proceeds thereof,
as shall be  necessary  to cause  such  benefitted  Lender to share  the  excess
payment or benefits of such  collateral  or  proceeds  ratably  with each of the
Lenders;  provided,  however,  if all or any portion of such  excess  payment or
benefits is thereafter  recovered  from such  benefitted  Lender,  such purchase
shall be rescinded,  and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent
of such recovery, but without interest.

          (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of Lenders provided by law,
each Lender shall have the right,  without  prior  notice to Borrower,  any such
notice being expressly waived by



<PAGE>


                                                                              69



Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due
and  payable by  Borrower  hereunder  or under the Notes  (whether at the stated
maturity,  by  acceleration  or otherwise) to set-off and  appropriate and apply
against  such amount any and all deposits  (general or special,  time or demand,
provisional or final), in any currency,  and any other credits,  indebtedness or
claims,  in any currency,  in each case whether direct or indirect,  absolute or
contingent,  matured or  unmatured,  at any time held or owing by such Lender or
any branch or agency  thereof to or for the credit or the  account of  Borrower.
Each Lender agrees  promptly to notify Borrower and Agent after any such set-off
and  application  made by such  Lender,  provided  that the failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application.

          11.14  Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts  (including
by telecopy),  and all of said  counterparts  taken  together shall be deemed to
constitute  one and the same  instrument.  A set of the copies of this Agreement
signed by all the parties shall be lodged with Borrower and Agent.

          11.15   Severability.   Any  provision  of  this  Agreement  which  is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction  shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such  prohibition  or  unenforceability  without
invalidating  the  remaining  provisions  hereof,  and any such  prohibition  or
unenforceability   in  any   jurisdiction   shall  not   invalidate   or  render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

          11.16  Integration.  This  Agreement  and  the  other  Loan  Documents
represent the  agreement of Borrower,  Agent and the Lenders with respect to the
subject matter hereof, and there are no promises, undertakings,  representations
or  warranties  by Agent or any Lender or Borrower  relative  to subject  matter
hereof  not  expressly  set forth or  referred  to  herein or in the other  Loan
Documents.

          11.17 Cure Rights of Agency.  Lenders agree that the Agency shall have
the right to cure any  Default  hereunder  and under  the other  Loan  Documents
during  the  applicable  cure  period  provided  herein  and in the  other  Loan
Documents and Lenders shall accept such cure by the Agency.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to provide
a notice of default to the Agency.

          11.18 Exculpation.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained

incurred in connection with the acquisition and which is still outstanding as of
such date,  multiplied  by (2) the ratio of (A) three  hundred  sixty five (365)
minus the number of days between the closing of the acquisition and such date to
(B) three hundred sixty five (365).

relating to the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby.

minimum amount of Two Million Dollars  ($2,000,000) and in integral multiples of
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) above such amount and shall be made upon
satisfaction  of the conditions set forth in Section 4.01.  Subsequent  advances
shall be made no more frequently than monthly  thereafter,  upon satisfaction of
the conditions set forth in Section 4.02. The amount of each advance  subsequent
to the Initial  Advance shall be (x) in the case of advances of Base Rate Loans,

multiples of One Hundred Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000) above such amount and (y)

            Section  2.04  Procedures  for  Advances.  Borrower  shall submit to
Administrative  Agent a request for each advance  hereunder,  stating the amount
requested, and certifying that (x) no Default or Event of Default then exists or
would exist as a result of such advance,  (y) the advance will be, and all prior
advances have been,  used solely for the purposes  described in Section 2.02 and
(z) none of the costs  covered by said  request for advance  were the subject of
any previous request for advance, no later than 10:00 a.m.  (Pittsburgh time) on
the date,  in the case of advances of Base Rate Loans,  which is two (2) Banking
Days,  and, in the case of advances of LIBOR  Loans,  which is three (3) Banking
Days, prior to the date the advance is to be made.  Administrative  Agent,  upon
its receipt and  approval of the request for  advance,  will so notify the Banks
either by telephone or by facsimile. Not later than 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh time)
on the date of each advance,  each Bank shall,  through its  Applicable  Lending
Office and subject to the  conditions of this  Agreement,  make the amount to be
advanced by it on such day available to Administrative  Agent, at Administrative
Agent's Office and in immediately  available funds, for the account of Borrower.
The amount so received by Administrative  Agent shall, subject to the conditions
of this  Agreement,  be made  available to Borrower,  in  immediately  available
funds, by Administrative  Agent's crediting an account of Borrower designated by
Borrower.

extension  between  sixty (60) and ninety (90) days prior to the Maturity  Date,

outstanding  principal  amount of the Loans as of the Maturity Date and (z) such
note extension agreement(s) as Administrative Agent may reasonably require, (ii)

Agencies,   one  (1)  of  which  must  be  either  S&P  or  Moody's   and  (iii)
Administrative  Agent's determination (which shall be conclusive so long as made
on a reasonable  basis) that, as of the Maturity  Date,  Borrower will remain in
compliance with the financial covenants set forth in Article VIII.

            Section  2.06  Interest  Periods;  Renewals In the case of the LIBOR
Loans,  Borrower  shall select an Interest  Period of any duration in accordance
with the definition of Interest Period in Section 1.01, subject to the following
limitations:  (1) no Interest Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date; (2) if
an Interest  Period would end on a day which is not a Banking Day, such Interest
Period shall be extended to the next Banking Day,  unless such Banking Day would
fall in the next calendar  month,  in which event such Interest Period shall end
on the  immediately  preceding  Banking  Day;  and (3) only  five  (5)  discrete
segments  of a Bank's Loan  bearing  interest at a LIBOR  Interest  Rate,  for a
designated  Interest Period,  pursuant to a particular  Election,  Conversion or
Continuation,  may be  outstanding  at any one time (each  such  segment of each
Bank's Loan corresponding to a proportionate segment of each of the other Banks'
Loans).

Borrower may  Continue any LIBOR Loan on the last day of the Interest  Period of
the same or  different  duration in  accordance  with the  limitations  provided
above. If Borrower shall fail to give notice to  Administrative  Agent of such a
Continuation, such LIBOR Loan shall automatically become a Base Rate Loan on the
last day of the current Interest Period.

            Section 2.07 Interest. Borrower shall pay interest to Administrative
Agent for the  account  of the  applicable  Bank on the  outstanding  and unpaid
principal amount of the Loans, at a rate per annum as follows: (1) for Base Rate
Loans at a rate equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable  Margin;  and (2) for
LIBOR  Loans at a rate  equal to the  applicable  LIBOR  Interest  Rate plus the
Applicable  Margin.  Any principal amount not paid when due (when scheduled,  at
acceleration or otherwise) shall bear interest thereafter, payable on demand, at
the Default Rate.

            The interest rate on Base Rate Loans shall change when the Base Rate
changes.  Interest  on Base Rate  Loans and LIBOR  Loans  shall not  exceed  the
maximum amount permitted under applicable law.  Interest shall be calculated for
the actual number of days elapsed on the basis of, in the case of both Base Rate
Loans and LIBOR Loans, three hundred sixty (360) days.

            Accrued interest shall be due and payable in arrears, in the case of
both Base Rate Loans and LIBOR Loans,  on the first Banking Day of each calendar
month;  provided,  however,  that interest accruing at the Default Rate shall be
due and payable on demand.

            Section 2.08 Fees. (a) Borrower shall, during the term of the Loans,
pay to Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank a facility fee computed
on the daily Loan Commitment of such Bank (irrespective of usage), at a rate per
annum equal to the daily Facility Fee Rate, calculated on the basis of a year of
three  hundred  sixty  (360) days for the  actual  number of days  elapsed.  The
accrued facility fee shall be due and payable in arrears on the tenth (10th) day
of December,  March, June and September of each year (for the respective periods
September 1 through  November 30,  December 1 through  February  28/29,  March 1
through May 31 and June 1 through August 31),  commencing on the first such date
after the Closing Date, and upon the Maturity Date or earlier termination of the
Loan Commitments.

          (b) Borrower  shall pay, for the  accounts  of the  parties  specified
therein, the fees provided for, on the dates specified,  in the Supplemental Fee
Letter.

            Section 2.09 Notes.  The Loan made by each Bank under this Agreement
shall be evidenced by, and repaid with interest in accordance with, a promissory
note of  Borrower  in the form of  EXHIBIT  C duly  completed  and  executed  by
Borrower, in the principal amount equal to such Bank's Loan Commitment,  payable
to such Bank for the account of its  Applicable  Lending Office (each such note,
as the same may hereafter be amended,  modified,  extended,  severed,  assigned,
substituted,  renewed or restated from time to time,  including  any  substitute
note pursuant to Section 3.07 or 12.05, a "Note"; all such notes, as so amended,
modified,  extended,  severed, assigned,  substituted,  renewed or restated from
time to time,  collectively,  the  "Notes").  Each Note  shall  mature,  and all
outstanding  principal and accrued  interest and other sums thereunder  shall be
paid in full, on the Maturity Date, as the same may be accelerated or extended.

            Each Bank is hereby  authorized by Borrower to endorse on a schedule
attached to the Note held by it, the amount of each advance, and each payment of
principal  received  by such  Bank for the  account  of its  Applicable  Lending
Office(s) on account of its Loan,  which  endorsements,  if made,  shall, in the
absence of manifest error,  be conclusive as to the  outstanding  balance of the
Loan  made by such  Bank;  provided,  however,  that the  failure  to make  such
notations  with respect to the Loans or each advance or payment  shall not limit
or otherwise affect the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement or the Note
held by such Bank.

            Section  2.10  Prepayments.  Borrower  may,  upon at  least  one (1)
Banking Day's notice to Administrative Agent in the case of the Base Rate Loans,
and at least two (2) Banking Days' notice to Administrative Agent in the case of
LIBOR Loans (in each case to be received by  Administrative  Agent no later than
1:00 P.M.,  Pittsburgh  time),  prepay the Loans,  provided that (1) any partial
prepayment  under this  Section  shall be in integral  multiples  of One Million
Dollars  ($1,000,000);  (2) a LIBOR Loan may be prepaid  only on the last day of
the  Applicable  Interest  Period for such LIBOR Loan;  and (3) each  prepayment
under this Section shall include all interest accrued on the amount of principal
prepaid through the date of prepayment.  Any prepayment shall effect a permanent
reduction in the Total Loan Commitment by the amount prepaid.



            Section 2.11 Changes of Commitments. (a) At any time, Borrower shall
have the right,  without  premium  or  penalty,  to  terminate  the unused  Loan
Commitments, in whole or in part, from time to time, provided that: (1) Borrower
shall give notice of each such termination to Administrative  Agent,  specifying
the amount of the termination, no later then 10:00 a.m. (Pittsburgh time) on the
date which is fifteen (15) days prior to the  effectiveness of such termination;
(2) the Loan  Commitments  of each of the Banks must be  terminated  ratably and
simultaneously  with those of the other Banks; and (3) each partial  termination
of the Loan  Commitments  as a whole (and  corresponding  reduction of the Total
Loan  Commitment)  shall  be in an  integral  multiple  of One  Million  Dollars
($1,000,000).

           (b)  The  Loan  Commitments,  to the  extent  terminated,  may not be
reinstated.

            Section  2.12 Method of Payment.  Borrower  shall make each  payment
under this  Agreement and under the Notes not later than 11:00 A.M.  (Pittsburgh
time) on the date when due in Dollars to Administrative  Agent at Administrative
Agent's  Office  in  immediately  available  funds.  Administrative  Agent  will
thereafter,  on the day of its receipt of each such payment (assuming receipt by
11:00 A.M.),  cause to be distributed  to each Bank (1) such Bank's  appropriate
share (based upon the respective  outstanding  principal  amounts and rate(s) of
interest under the Notes of the Banks) of the payments of principal and interest
in like funds for the account of such Bank's Applicable  Lending Office; and (2)
fees  payable  to such  Bank in  accordance  with the  terms of this  Agreement.
Borrower  hereby  authorizes  Administrative  Agent and the Banks, if and to the
extent  payment by Borrower is not made when due under this  Agreement  or under
the Notes,  to charge from time to time against any account  Borrower  maintains
with Administrative  Agent or any Bank any amount so due to Administrative Agent
and/or the Banks.

            Except  to the  extent  provided  in this  Agreement,  whenever  any
payment  to be made under  this  Agreement  or under the Notes is due on any day
other than a Banking  Day,  such  payment  shall be made on the next  succeeding
Banking Day, and such extension of time shall in



                                       18

such case be included in the  computation  of the payment of interest  and other
fees, as the case may be.

            Section  2.13  Elections,  Conversions  or  Continuation  of  Loans.
Subject to the  provisions of Article III and Sections  2.06 and 2.14,  Borrower
shall  have the right to Elect to have all or a portion  of any  advance  of the
Loans be LIBOR Loans,  to Convert  Base Rate Loans into LIBOR Loans,  to Convert
LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans,  or to Continue LIBOR Loans as LIBOR Loans, at
any  time  or from  time  to  time,  provided  that:  (1)  Borrower  shall  give
Administrative Agent notice of each such Election, Conversion or Continuation as
provided in Section  2.15;  and (2) a LIBOR Loan may be  Converted  or Continued
only on the last day of the  applicable  Interest  Period for such  LIBOR  Loan.
Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Election,  Continuation and
Conversion  shall be applicable  to each Bank's Loan in accordance  with its Pro
Rata Share.

            Section 2.14 Minimum Amounts.  With respect to the Loans as a whole,
each  Election and each  Conversion  shall be in an amount at least equal to One
Million Dollars  ($1,000,000) and in integral  multiples of One Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($100,000).

            Section 2.15 Certain Notices  Regarding  Elections,  Conversions and
Continuations  of  Loans.   Notices  by  Borrower  to  Administrative  Agent  of
Elections, Conversions and Continuations of LIBOR Loans shall be irrevocable and
shall be effective only if received by Administrative Agent not later than 10:00
a.m.  (Pittsburgh  time) on the number of Banking  Days prior to the date of the
relevant Election, Conversion or Continuation specified below:


                                                          Number of 
                    Notice                            Banking Days Prior
                    ------                            ------------------
Conversions into Base Rate Loans                           three (3)
Election of, Conversions into or Continuations as,
LIBOR Loan                                                 three (3)


Promptly following its receipt of any such notice, Administrative Agent shall so
advise  the Banks  either by  telephone  or by  facsimile.  Each such  notice of
Election  shall  specify the portion of the amount of the advance  that is to be
LIBOR Loans  (subject to Section  2.14) and the duration of the Interest  Period
applicable  thereto  (subject to Section  2.06);  each such notice of Conversion
shall specify the LIBOR Loans or Base Rate Loans to be Converted;  and each such
notice of  Conversion  or  Continuation  shall specify the date of Conversion or
Continuation  (which shall be a Banking  Day),  the amount  thereof  (subject to
Section  2.14)  and the  duration  of the  Interest  Period  applicable  thereto
(subject to Section 2.06). In the event that Borrower fails to Elect to have any
portion  of an advance of the Loans be LIBOR  Loans,  the entire  amount of such
advance shall  constitute  Base Rate Loans.  In the event that Borrower fails to
Continue  LIBOR Loans within the time period and as  otherwise  provided in this
Section,  such LIBOR Loans will be automatically  Converted into Base Rate Loans
on the last day of the then current  applicable  Interest  Period for such LIBOR
Loans.

            Section 2.16 Late Payment Premium. Borrower shall, at Administrative
Agent's option, pay to Administrative  Agent for the account of the Banks a late
payment premium in the



                                       19

<PAGE>



amount of four  percent  (4%) of any  payments of interest  under the Loans made
more than fifteen (15) days after the due date thereof,  which shall be due with
any such late payment.


                 ARTICLE III. YIELD PROTECTION; ILLEGALITY; ETC.

            Section 3.01 Additional  Costs.  Borrower shall pay directly to each
Bank from time to time on demand such  amounts as such Bank may  determine to be
necessary to compensate it for any  increased  costs which such Bank  determines
are attributable to its making or maintaining a LIBOR Loan, or its obligation to
make or maintain a LIBOR Loan, or its  obligation to Convert a Base Rate Loan to
a LIBOR Loan hereunder,  or any reduction in any amount  receivable by such Bank
hereunder in respect of its LIBOR Loan or such  obligations  (such  increases in
costs and  reductions  in amounts  receivable  being herein  called  "Additional
Costs"), in each case resulting from any Regulatory Change which:

           (1) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts payable to such Bank
      under this Agreement or the Notes in respect of any such LIBOR Loan (other
      than changes in the rate of general corporate,  franchise,  branch profit,
      net  income or other  income tax  imposed  on such Bank or its  Applicable
      Lending  Office by the  jurisdiction  in which such Bank has its principal
      office or such Applicable Lending Office); or

           (2) (other than to the extent the LIBOR Reserve  Requirement is taken
      into  account in  determining  the LIBOR Rate at the  commencement  of the
      applicable  Interest  Period)  imposes or modifies  any  reserve,  special
      deposit,  deposit insurance or assessment,  minimum capital, capital ratio
      or similar  requirements  relating  to any  extensions  of credit or other
      assets  of,  or any  deposits  with or other  liabilities  of,  such  Bank
      (including any LIBOR Loan or any deposits referred to in the definition of
      "LIBOR  Interest  Rate" in Section  1.01),  or any commitment of such Bank
      (including such Bank's Loan Commitment hereunder); or

           (3) imposes any other condition affecting this Agreement or the Notes
      (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities).

Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  in the event that any Bank  determines  that it
shall  incur  Additional  Costs in  maintaining  a LIBOR  Loan,  such Bank shall
provide  written  notice  thereof  to  Borrower  (with a copy to  Administrative
Agent),  which notice shall include the dollar amount of the  Additional  Costs,
and Borrower shall have the option,  which option must be exercised  within five
(5) Banking Days of Borrower's receipt of such notice, to prepay such LIBOR Loan
or to Convert such LIBOR Loan into a Base Rate Loan,  subject,  however,  to the
provisions of Section 3.05.

            Without limiting the effect of the provisions of the first paragraph
of this Section, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory Change, any Bank
either (1) incurs  Additional  Costs based on or measured by the excess  above a
specified level of the amount of a category of deposits of other  liabilities of
such Bank which includes  deposits by reference to which the LIBOR Interest Rate
is  determined  as provided in this  Agreement  or a category of  extensions  of
credit or other  assets of such Bank  which  includes  loans  based on the LIBOR
Interest  Rate or (2) becomes  subject to  restrictions  on the amount of such a
category  of  liabilities  or assets  which it may hold,  then,  if such Bank so
elects by notice to Borrower (with a copy to Administrative



                                       20

<PAGE>



Agent),  the obligation of such Bank to permit Elections of, to Continue,  or to
Convert Base Rate Loans into,  LIBOR Loans shall be suspended (in which case the
provisions of Section 3.04 shall be  applicable)  until such  Regulatory  Change
ceases to be in effect.

            Determinations  and  allocations  by a Bank  for  purposes  of  this
Section of the effect of any Regulatory  Change  pursuant to the first or second
paragraph  of this  Section,  on its  costs  or  rate of  return  of  making  or
maintaining  its Loan or  portions  thereof  or on amounts  receivable  by it in
respect of its Loan or portions thereof,  and the amounts required to compensate
such Bank under this Section, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            To the extent that changing the jurisdiction of a Bank's  Applicable
Lending Office would have the effect of minimizing  Additional  Costs, each such
Bank  shall use  reasonable  efforts to make such a change,  provided  that same
would not otherwise be disadvantageous to each such Bank.

            No Bank  shall be  entitled  to any  compensation  pursuant  to this
Section  relating  to any period  more than  ninety  (90) days prior to the date
notice thereof is given to Borrower by such Bank.

            Section 3.02 Limitation  on Types of Loans.  Anything  herein to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  if,  on or prior to the  determination  of the LIBOR
Interest Rate for any Interest Period:

           (1)  Administrative  Agent determines (which  determination  shall be
      conclusive)  that  quotations of interest rates for the relevant  deposits
      referred to in the definition of "LIBOR Interest Rate" in Section 1.01 are
      not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the relevant  maturities
      for  purposes  of  determining  rates of  interest  for the LIBOR Loans as
      provided in this Agreement; or

           (2) a Bank determines (which  determination  shall be conclusive) and
      promptly notifies Administrative Agent that the relevant rates of interest
      referred to in the  definition  of "LIBOR  Interest  Rate" in Section 1.01
      upon the basis of which  the rate of  interest  for  LIBOR  Loans for such
      Interest  Period is to be determined do not  adequately  cover the cost to
      such Bank of making  or  maintaining  such  LIBOR  Loan for such  Interest
      Period;

then Administrative Agent shall give Borrower prompt notice thereof, and so long
as  such  condition  remains  in  effect,  the  Banks  (or,  in the  case of the
circumstances  described in clause (2) above,  the affected Bank) shall be under
no  obligation  to permit  Elections of LIBOR Loans,  to Convert Base Rate Loans
into LIBOR Loans or to  Continue  LIBOR Loans and  Borrower  shall,  on the last
day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for the affected outstanding LIBOR
Loans,  either (x) prepay the  affected  LIBOR Loans or (y) Convert the affected
LIBOR Loans into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 2.13.

            Section 3.03 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement,  in the event that it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable
Lending  Office  to  honor  its  obligation  to make or  maintain  a LIBOR  Loan
hereunder,  to allow  Elections  of a LIBOR  Loan or to Convert a Base Rate Loan
into a LIBOR Loan, then such Bank shall promptly notify Administrative Agent and
Borrower thereof and such Bank's obligation to make or maintain a



                                       21

<PAGE>



LIBOR Loan, or to permit Elections of, to Continue,  or to Convert its Base Rate
Loan into,  a LIBOR Loan shall be  suspended  (in which case the  provisions  of
Section  3.04 shall be  applicable)  until such time as such Bank may again make
and maintain a LIBOR Loan.

            Section 3.04 Treatment  of Affected Loans. If the obligations of any
Bank to make or maintain a LIBOR Loan, or to permit an Election of a LIBOR Loan,
to Continue its LIBOR Loan,  or to Convert its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan,
are  suspended  pursuant to  Sections  3.01 or 3.03 (each LIBOR Loan so affected
being herein  called an "Affected  Loan"),  such Bank's  Affected  Loan shall be
automatically  Converted  into a Base  Rate  Loan on the  last  day of the  then
current  Interest  Period for the Affected Loan (or, in the case of a Conversion
required by Sections 3.01 or 3.03, on such earlier date as such Bank may specify
to Borrower).

            To the extent that such Bank's  Affected Loan has been so Converted,
all payments and  prepayments of principal  which would  otherwise be applied to
such  Bank's  Affected  Loan shall be applied  instead to its Base Rate Loan and
such Bank shall have no  obligation  to Convert  its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR
Loan.

            In the event that the  conditions  giving rise to the  suspension of
any Bank's  obligations  to permit an Election of a LIBOR Loan,  to Continue its
LIBOR  Loan,  or to Convert  its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan shall cease to
exist, such Bank shall provide Borrower with prompt written notice of same (with
a copy to  Administrative  Agent),  and such Bank shall  again be  obligated  to
permit an Election of a LIBOR Loan,  to Continue  its LIBOR Loan,  or to Convert
its Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan in accordance with this Agreement.

            Section   3.05   Certain   Compensation.   Borrower   shall  pay  to
Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Bank, upon the request of
such Bank  through  Administrative  Agent,  such  amount or  amounts as shall be
sufficient  (in the  reasonable  opinion of such Bank) to  compensate it for any
loss, cost or expense which such Bank determines is attributable to:

           (1) any payment,  prepayment,  Conversion or  Continuation of a LIBOR
      Loan made by such Bank on a date other than the last day of an  applicable
      Interest Period for such LIBOR Loan,  whether by reason of acceleration or
      otherwise; or

           (2) any failure by  Borrower  for any reason to Convert or Continue a
      LIBOR Loan to be Converted or Continued by such Bank on the date specified
      therefor in the relevant notice under Section 2.15; or

           (3) any  failure by Borrower to borrow (or to qualify for a borrowing
      of) a LIBOR Loan  which  would  otherwise  be made  hereunder  on the date
      specified in the  relevant  Election  notice  under  Section 2.15 given or
      submitted by Borrower.

            Without limiting the foregoing,  such compensation  shall include an
amount equal to the present  value (using as the discount  rate an interest rate
equal to the rate determined under (2) below) of the excess,  if any, of (1) the
amount of interest which otherwise would have accrued on the principal amount so
paid, prepaid, Converted or Continued (or not Converted,  Continued or borrowed)
for the  period  from  the  date  of such  payment,  prepayment,  Conversion  or
Continuation (or failure to Convert,  Continue or borrow) to the last day of the
then  current  applicable  Interest  Period  (or,  in the case of a  failure  to
Convert, Continue or borrow, to the last



                                       22

<PAGE>



day of the  applicable  Interest  Period which would have  commenced on the date
specified  therefor in the relevant  notice) at the applicable  rate of interest
for the LIBOR Loan  provided  for herein,  over (2) the amount of  interest  (as
reasonably determined by such Bank) based upon the interest rate which such Bank
would have bid in the London interbank  market for Dollar deposits,  for amounts
comparable to such principal amount and maturities  comparable to such period. A
determination  of any Bank as to the amounts  payable  pursuant to this  Section
shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            Section 3.06  Capital  Adequacy.  If any Bank shall have  determined
that,  after the date  hereof,  the  adoption  of any  applicable  law,  rule or
regulation  regarding capital adequacy,  or any change therein, or any change in
the  interpretation  or  administration  thereof by any Governmental  Authority,
central  bank  or  comparable   agency  charged  with  the   interpretation   or
administration  thereof,  or any request or directive regarding capital adequacy
(whether  or not  having the force of law) of any such  Governmental  Authority,
central bank or comparable  agency, has or would have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on capital of such Bank (or its Parent) as a consequence  of such
Bank's  obligations  hereunder  to a level  below  that  which such Bank (or its
Parent) could have achieved but for such adoption,  change, request or directive
(taking into  consideration its policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an
amount  deemed by such  Bank to be  material,  then  from  time to time,  within
fifteen  (15) days  after  demand by such  Bank  (with a copy to  Administrative
Agent),  Borrower  shall pay to such Bank such  additional  amount or amounts as
will compensate  such Bank (or its Parent) for such reduction.  A certificate of
any Bank claiming  compensation under this Section,  setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis therefor, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

            Section 3.07 Substitution of Banks. If any Bank (an "Affected Bank")
(i) makes demand upon Borrower for (or if Borrower is otherwise required to pay)
Additional  Costs pursuant to Section 3.01 or (ii) is unable to make or maintain
a LIBOR Loan as a result of a condition  described in Section 3.03 or clause (2)
of Section 3.02, Borrower may, within ninety (90) days of receipt of such demand
or notice (or the occurrence of such other event causing Borrower to be required
to pay  Additional  Costs or causing  said Section 3.03 or clause (2) of Section
3.02 to be applicable), as the case may be, give notice (a "Replacement Notice")
to  Administrative  Agent (which will promptly  forward a copy of such notice to
each Bank) of  Borrower's  intention  either (x) to prepay in full the  Affected
Bank's Note and to terminate the Affected  Bank's entire Loan  Commitment or (y)
to  replace  the  Affected  Bank  with  another   financial   institution   (the
"Replacement Bank") designated in such Replacement Notice.

            In the event Borrower opts to give the notice provided for in clause
(x) above,  and if the Affected  Bank shall not agree within thirty (30) days of
its receipt thereof to waive the payment of the Additional  Costs in question or
the  effect of the  circumstances  described  in  Section  3.03 or clause (2) of
Section  3.02,  then,  so long as no Default or Event of  Default  shall  exist,
Borrower may  (notwithstanding  the provisions of clause (2) of Section 2.11(a))
terminate  the  Affected  Bank's  entire  Loan  Commitment,   provided  that  in
connection therewith it pays to the Affected Bank all outstanding  principal and
accrued and unpaid  interest under the Affected  Bank's Note,  together with all
other  amounts,  if any, due from Borrower to the Affected  Bank,  including all
amounts properly demanded and unreimbursed under Sections 3.01 and 3.05.

            In the event Borrower opts to give the notice provided for in clause
(y) above, and if (i) Administrative Agent shall, within thirty (30) days of its
receipt of the Replacement Notice,



                                       23

<PAGE>



notify Borrower and each Bank in writing that the Replacement Bank is reasonably
satisfactory to Administrative Agent and (ii) the Affected Bank shall not, prior
to the end of such thirty  (30)- day  period,  agree to waive the payment of the
Additional  Costs in question or the effect of the  circumstances  described  in
Section 3.03 or clause (2) of Section  3.02,  then the Affected  Bank shall,  so
long as no Default or Event of Default  shall exist,  assign its Note and all of
its rights and obligations under this Agreement to the Replacement Bank, and the
Replacement Bank shall assume all of the Affected Bank's rights and obligations,
pursuant  to an  agreement,  substantially  in the  form  of an  Assignment  and
Assumption Agreement, executed by the Affected Bank and the Replacement Bank. In
connection with such assignment and assumption,  the Replacement  Bank shall pay
to the Affected Bank an amount equal to the outstanding  principal  amount under
the  Affected  Bank's Note plus all  interest  accrued  thereon,  plus all other
amounts,  if any (other than the  Additional  Costs in  question),  then due and
payable to the Affected Bank; provided, however, that prior to or simultaneously
with any such  assignment  and  assumption,  Borrower  shall  have  paid to such

partnership  agreement,  (c)  violate any  provision  of, or require any filing,

consents  which have been obtained,  (e) result in, or require,  the creation or
imposition of any Lien,  upon or with respect to any of its properties now owned
or  hereafter  acquired,  or (f) cause it to be in  default  under any such Law,

indenture,  agreement,  lease  or  instrument;  to the  best  of its  knowledge,

in compliance would cause a Material Adverse Change to occur.

            Section 5.03 Legally Enforceable Agreements. Each Loan Document is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Borrower, enforceable against Borrower in
accordance  with its terms,  except to the extent that such  enforcement  may be
limited by applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency  and other similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally.

            Section 5.04 Litigation.  There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending  or,  to  its  knowledge,  threatened  against  Borrower  or  any of its
Affiliates  before any court or arbitrator or any Governmental  Authority except
actions,  suits or proceedings which have been disclosed to Administrative Agent
and the Banks in writing and which are fully  covered by insurance or would,  if
adversely  determined,  not substantially  impair the ability of Borrower to pay
when due any amounts  which may become  payable  under the Notes or to otherwise
pay and perform its obligations in connection with the Loan.

            Section  5.05 Good  Title to  Properties.  Borrower  and each of its
Affiliates  have good,  marketable  and legal title to all of the properties and
assets  each of them  purports  to own  (including,  without  limitation,  those
reflected in the June 30, 1997 financial statements referred to in Section 5.13)
and, in the case of all of  Borrower's  shopping  center  properties,  only with
exceptions  which do not  materially  detract from the value of such property or
assets or the use  thereof in  Borrower's  and such  Affiliate's  business,  and
except to the extent that any such properties and assets have been encumbered or
disposed of since the date of such financial statements without violating any of
the covenants contained in Article VII or elsewhere in this Agreement.  Borrower

state and local)  required to be filed and has paid all taxes,  assessments  and
governmental  charges and levies due and payable  without  the  imposition  of a
penalty,  including  interest and  penalties,  except to the extent they are the
subject of a Good Faith Contest.

within the past five (5) years; no circumstance exists which constitutes

grounds under Section 4042 of ERISA entitling the PBGC to institute  proceedings
to  terminate,  or appoint a trustee  to  administer,  a Plan,  nor has the PBGC
instituted any such proceedings;  Borrower and the ERISA Affiliates thereof have
not completely or partially  withdrawn under Sections 4201 or 4204 of ERISA from

minimum  funding  requirements  of each under ERISA with respect to the plans of
each and there are no  unfunded  vested  liabilities  with  respect  to any plan
established or maintained by each; and Borrower and the ERISA Affiliates thereof
have not incurred any liability to the PBGC under ERISA.

            Section 5.08 No Default on Outstanding Judgments or Orders. Borrower
has satisfied all judgments  which are not being  appealed and is not in default

Governmental  Authority,  commission,  board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign.

the  Bank  Parties  in  writing,   including  anything  disclosed  on  financial
statements,  Borrower,  to the  best of its  knowledge,  is not a  party  to any
indenture,  loan  or  credit  agreement  or any  lease  or  other  agreement  or
instrument or subject to any partnership,  trust or other  restriction  which is
likely to result in a Material  Adverse  Change.  To the best of its  knowledge,
Borrower  is not in default in any  respect in the  performance,  observance  or
fulfillment of any of the obligations,  covenants or conditions contained in any
agreement or instrument which is likely to result in a Material Adverse Change.

            Section  5.10  Government  Regulation.  Borrower  is not  subject to
regulation  under the Investment  Company Act of 1940,  the Interstate  Commerce
Act,  the Federal  Powers Act or any  statute or  regulation  limiting  any such
Person's  ability  to incur  indebtedness  for money  borrowed  as  contemplated
hereby.

            Section 5.11  Environmental  Protection.  To the best of  Borrower's
knowledge,  none  of  Borrower's  or its  Affiliates'  properties  contains  any
Hazardous  Materials that, under any Environmental Law currently in effect,  (1)
would  impose  liability  on  Borrower  that is likely  to result in a  Material
Adverse  Change,  or (2) is likely to result in the  imposition of a Lien on any
assets of Borrower or its  Affiliates,  in each case if not properly  handled in
accordance with applicable Law. To the best of Borrower's knowledge,  neither it
nor any of its  Affiliates  is in  violation  of, or  subject  to any  existing,
pending or threatened  investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Authority
under, any Environmental Law.

the only material  Affiliates of Borrower which own or lease operating  shopping
centers or shopping  centers  under  construction  are listed on EXHIBIT D. Each
such Affiliate is a partnership, limited liability company or joint venture duly
organized and existing in good standing  under the laws of the  jurisdiction  of
its formation. As to each such Affiliate,  its correct name, the jurisdiction of
its formation and Borrower's  percentage of beneficial  interest therein are set
forth on said EXHIBIT D. Borrower and each of such  Affiliates have the power to
own their respective  properties and to carry on their respective businesses now
being  conducted.  Each of Borrower and such  Affiliates is duly  qualified as a
foreign  partnership,  company or venture to do business and is in good standing
in every jurisdiction in which the nature of the respective businesses conducted
by it or its  respective  properties,  owned  or held  under  lease,  make  such
qualification necessary.

            Section 5.15  Insurance.  Borrower and each of its Affiliates has in
force paid insurance with financially sound and reputable insurance companies or
associations  in such amounts and covering such risks as are usually  carried by

Agreement nor any documents, financial statements,  reports, notices, schedules,

to  Administrative  Agent or any Bank in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement  or the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  or
required herein to be furnished by or on behalf of Borrower, contains any untrue
or misleading statement of a material fact or omits a material fact necessary to
make the  statements  herein or therein not  misleading.  There is no fact which
Borrower  has not  disclosed  to  Administrative  Agent and the Banks in writing
which materially affects adversely nor, so far as Borrower can now foresee, will
materially  affect  adversely  the  business,  prospects,  profits or  financial
condition of Borrower or the ability of Borrower to perform this  Agreement  and
the other Loan Documents.

            In connection with each acquisition of assets that is required to be
reported  pursuant to paragraph  (8) of this Section,  the  following  pro-forma
adjustments shall be made to the covenant compliance calculations required as of
the end of the most recently ended calendar quarter for which financial  results
are required hereunder to have been reported by Borrower:

              (i) Gross Asset  Value  shall be  adjusted  by adding  thereto the
      lesser of (A) the Purchase  Price  Borrower paid for the acquired asset or
      (B) the acquired asset's trailing twelve  (12)-month net operating income,
      less any management fee adjustment,  if applicable,  capitalized at a rate
      of eight percent (8%) per annum;  provided,  however,  that, at Borrower's
      request and expense,  Administrative Agent shall promptly cause the Banks'
      Valuation  Consultant  to  appraise  the  acquired  asset  and,  upon  the
      completion  of such  appraisal,  provided  such  appraisal  is  reasonably
      satisfactory to Administrative  Agent, the appraised value of the acquired
      asset as determined in such appraisal  shall be substituted for the amount
      calculated pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) above.

              (ii) Total  Outstanding  Indebtedness,  Secured  Indebtedness  and
      Unsecured Indebtedness shall be adjusted by adding thereto,  respectively,
      all indebtedness,  secured indebtedness and unsecured indebtedness that is
      assumed and/or  incurred by Borrower in connection  with the  acquisition.
      For purposes of such adjustments,  indebtedness,  secured indebtedness and
      unsecured indebtedness in connection with the acquisition shall be treated
      in  a  manner   consistent   with  the  treatment  of  Total   Outstanding
      Indebtedness,  Secured Indebtedness and Unsecured  Indebtedness in the TRG
      Consolidated Financial Statements.

              (iii) Combined EBITDA, for any period, shall be adjusted by adding
      (or  subtracting,  in the case of a loss)  thereto  actual  revenues  less
      operating   costs  before   interest,   depreciation,   amortization   and
      extraordinary  items,  for the same period  (based on the same  accounting
      principles and assumptions as are set forth in the definition of "Combined
      EBITDA"  in Section  1.01,  to the extent  possible  based on  information
      reasonably  available  with  respect  to the  acquired  asset),  from  the
      acquired asset.

              (iv) If, upon its acquisition,  the acquired asset becomes part of
      Unencumbered  Wholly-Owned Assets,  Unencumbered  Combined EBITDA, for any
      period,  shall be  adjusted  by adding (or  subtracting,  in the case of a
      loss)  thereto  actual  income  before  interest  expense,  income  taxes,
      depreciation,  amortization and extraordinary  items, for the same period,
      from the acquired asset.

              (v)  Interest  Expense and  Unsecured  Interest  Expense,  for any
      period,  shall be  adjusted  by  adding  thereto  interest  expense  to be
      incurred on,  respectively,  all indebtedness  and unsecured  indebtedness
      that is  assumed  and/or  incurred  by  Borrower  in  connection  with the
      acquisition,  assuming,  for  purposes  of  this  calculation,  that  such
      indebtedness  were to bear interest at a rate 1.75% per annum in excess of
      the rate of  interest  that  would be payable  on a ten  (10)-year  United
      States Treasury Note issued as of the date of the acquisition.

            Section 10.02 Reliance by Administrative Agent. Administrative Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon any certification,  notice or other communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by it to
be genuine and correct and to have been



                                       38

<PAGE>



signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person or Persons,  and upon advice
and  statements  of legal  counsel,  independent  accountants  and other experts
selected by Administrative  Agent.  Administrative Agent may deem and treat each
Bank as the holder of the Loan made by it for all purposes  hereof and shall not
be required to deal with any Person who has acquired a participation in any Loan
or  participation  from a Bank. As to any matters not expressly  provided for by
this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document,  Administrative  Agent shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting,  or in refraining from acting,  hereunder in
accordance with instructions signed by the Required Banks, and such instructions
of the Required  Banks and any action  taken or failure to act pursuant  thereto
shall be binding on all of the Banks and any other  holder of all or any portion
of any Loan or participation.

            Section 10.03 Defaults.  Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to
have  knowledge  of the  occurrence  of a  Default  or Event of  Default  unless
Administrative Agent has received notice from a Bank or Borrower specifying such
Default  or Event of  Default  and  stating  that such  notice  is a "Notice  of
Default." In the event that  Administrative  Agent receives such a notice of the
occurrence  of a Default or Event of  Default,  Administrative  Agent shall give
prompt notice thereof to the Banks. Administrative Agent, following consultation
with the Banks,  shall  (subject to Section 10.07) take such action with respect
to such Default or Event of Default  which is continuing as shall be directed by
the Required Banks;  provided that, unless and until  Administrative Agent shall
have received such  directions,  Administrative  Agent may take such action,  or
refrain  from  taking  such  action,  with  respect to such  Default or Event of
Default as it shall  deem  advisable  in the best  interest  of the  Banks;  and
provided further that Administrative Agent shall not send a notice of Default or
acceleration to Borrower without the approval of the Required Banks. In no event
shall  Administrative  Agent  be  required  to take  any  such  action  which it
determines to be contrary to law.

            Section 10.04 Rights of Administrative Agent as a Bank. With respect
to its Loan Commitment and the Loan provided by it,  Administrative Agent in its
capacity as a Bank hereunder shall have the same rights and powers  hereunder as
any  other  Bank and may  exercise  the same as  though  it were not  acting  as
Administrative  Agent, and the term "Bank" or "Banks" shall,  unless the context
otherwise  indicates,  include  Administrative  Agent in its capacity as a Bank.
Administrative  Agent and its Affiliates may (without having to account therefor
to any Bank)  accept  deposits  from,  lend money to (on a secured or  unsecured
basis),  and generally  engage in any kind of banking,  trust or other  business
with  Borrower  (and any  Affiliates  of  Borrower)  as if it were not acting as
Administrative Agent.

            Section 10.05  Indemnification  of  Administrative  Agent. Each Bank
agrees to indemnify  Administrative  Agent (to the extent not  reimbursed  under
Section 12.04 or under the applicable provisions of any other Loan Document, but
without  limiting  the  obligations  of  Borrower  under  Section  12.04 or such
provisions),  for its Pro Rata  Share of any and all  liabilities,  obligations,
losses,  damages,  penalties,  actions,  judgments,  suits,  costs,  expenses or
disbursements  of any  kind and  nature  whatsoever  which  may be  imposed  on,
incurred by or asserted against  Administrative  Agent in any way relating to or
arising out of this  Agreement,  any other Loan Document or any other  documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which Borrower is
obligated to pay under Section 12.04) or under the applicable  provisions of any
other Loan Document or the  enforcement of any of the terms hereof or thereof or
of any such  other  documents  or  instruments;  provided  that no Bank shall be
liable for (1) any



                                       39

<PAGE>



of the  foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross  negligence or willful
misconduct of the party to be indemnified, (2) any loss of principal or interest
with  respect  to  Administrative  Agent's  Loan or (3)  any  loss  suffered  by
Administrative  Agent in connection  with a swap or other  interest rate hedging
arrangement entered into by Administrative Agent with Borrower.

            Section 10.06 Non-Reliance on Administrative  Agent and Other Banks.
Each  Bank  agrees  that  it  has,   independently   and  without   reliance  on
Administrative  Agent  or any  other  Bank,  and  based  on such  documents  and
information  as it has  deemed  appropriate,  made its own  credit  analysis  of
Borrower  and the  decision  to  enter  into  this  Agreement  and that it will,
independently and without reliance upon Administrative  Agent or any other Bank,
and based on such documents and information as it shall deem  appropriate at the
time,  continue to make its own analysis  and  decisions in taking or not taking
action under this  Agreement or any other Loan  Document.  Administrative  Agent
shall  not  be  required  to  keep  itself  informed  as to the  performance  or
observance by Borrower of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any other
document  referred  to or  provided  for herein or  therein  or to  inspect  the
properties or books of Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other documents
and   information   expressly   required  to  be   furnished  to  the  Banks  by
Administrative Agent hereunder,  Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility  to  provide  any Bank  with  any  credit  or  other  information
concerning  the  affairs,  financial  condition  or business of Borrower (or any
Affiliate  of Borrower)  which may come into the  possession  of  Administrative
Agent or any of its  Affiliates.  Administrative  Agent shall not be required to
file this  Agreement,  any other Loan  Document or any  document  or  instrument
referred to herein or therein, for record or give notice of this Agreement,  any
other Loan Document or any document or instrument referred to herein or therein,
to anyone.

            Section 10.07  Failure of  Administrative  Agent to Act.  Except for
action expressly  required of  Administrative  Agent  hereunder,  Administrative
Agent  shall in all cases be fully  justified  in  failing  or  refusing  to act
hereunder  unless it shall have received further  assurances  (which may include
cash collateral) of the  indemnification  obligations of the Banks under Section
10.05 in respect of any and all  liability  and expense which may be incurred by
it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action.

            Section  10.08  Resignation  or  Removal  of  Administrative  Agent.
Provided  there exists no Event of Default,  Administrative  Agent hereby agrees
not to  unilaterally  resign except in the event it becomes an Affected Bank and
is removed or replaced as a Bank  pursuant  to Section  3.07,  in which event it
shall have the right to resign.  Administrative Agent may be removed at any time
with or without  cause by the Required  Banks,  provided  that  Borrower and the
other Banks shall be promptly  notified  thereof.  Upon any such  resignation or
removal, the successor  Administrative Agent shall, at Fleet's option, be Fleet.
If Fleet elects not to become the successor  Administrative  Agent, the Required
Banks shall have the right to appoint a successor  Administrative  Agent.  If no
successor  Administrative  Agent shall have been so  appointed  by the  Required
Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the
Required Banks' removal of the retiring  Administrative Agent, then the retiring
Administrative   Agent  may,  on  behalf  of  the  Banks,  appoint  a  successor
Administrative Agent, which shall be one of the Banks. The Required Banks or the
retiring Administrative Agent, as the case may be, shall upon the appointment of
a  successor  Administrative  Agent  promptly so notify  Borrower  and the other
Banks. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative  Agent hereunder
by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor



                                       40

<PAGE>



Administrative  Agent shall thereupon  succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers,  privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and
the  retiring  Administrative  Agent  shall be  discharged  from its  duties and
obligations  hereunder.   After  any  retiring  Administrative  Agent's  removal
hereunder  as  Administrative  Agent,  the  provisions  of this  Article X shall
continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to
be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.

            Section 10.09 Amendments Concerning Agency Function. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Administrative Agent shall
not be  bound by any  waiver,  amendment,  supplement  or  modification  of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document  which affects its duties,  rights,  and/or
function  hereunder or  thereunder  unless it shall have given its prior written
consent thereto.

            Section  10.10  Liability of  Administrative  Agent.  Administrative
Agent shall not have any liabilities or  responsibilities to Borrower on account
of the failure of any Bank to perform its  obligations  hereunder or to any Bank
on account of the failure of Borrower to perform its  obligations  hereunder  or
under any other Loan Document.

            Section 10.11  Transfer of Agency  Function.  Without the consent of
Borrower or any Bank,  Administrative Agent may at any time or from time to time
transfer its functions as  Administrative  Agent hereunder to any of its offices
wherever located in the United States,  provided that Administrative Agent shall
promptly notify Borrower and the Banks thereof.

            Section 10.12 Non-Receipt of Funds by Administrative  Agent.  Unless
Administrative  Agent shall have received notice from a Bank or Borrower (either
one as appropriate being the "Payor") prior to the date on which such Bank is to
make  payment  hereunder  to  Administrative  Agent of the proceeds of a Loan or
Borrower is to make payment to Administrative  Agent, as the case may be (either
such payment being a "Required  Payment"),  which notice shall be effective upon
receipt,  that  the  Payor  will  not  make  the  Required  Payment  in  full to
Administrative Agent,  Administrative Agent may assume that the Required Payment
has been made in full to Administrative  Agent on such date, and  Administrative
Agent in its sole  discretion  may, but shall not be  obligated  to, in reliance
upon  such  assumption,  make  the  amount  thereof  available  to the  intended
recipient on such date. If and to the extent the Payor shall not have in fact so
made the Required Payment in full to Administrative Agent, the recipient of such
payment shall repay to Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount made
available to it together with interest thereon,  for each day from the date such
amount  was  so  made   available  by   Administrative   Agent  until  the  date
Administrative  Agent  recovers  such  amount,  at  the  customary  rate  set by
Administrative  Agent for the  correction  of errors  among  Banks for three (3)
Banking Days and thereafter at the Base Rate.

            Section 10.13  Withholding  Taxes.  Each Bank  represents that it is
entitled  to  receive  any  payments  to be made  to it  hereunder  without  the
withholding  of any tax and will  furnish to  Administrative  Agent such  forms,
certifications,  statements  and  other  documents  as  Administrative  Agent or
Borrower may request from time to time to evidence  such Bank's  exemption  from
the   withholding  of  any  tax  imposed  by  any   jurisdiction  or  to  enable
Administrative  Agent to comply with any applicable Laws or regulations relating
thereto.  Without  limiting  the  effect  of the  foregoing,  if any Bank is not
created or organized under the laws of the United States of America or any state
thereof, such Bank will furnish to



                                       41

<PAGE>



Administrative  Agent Form 4224 or Form 1001 of the Internal Revenue Service, or
such other forms,  certifications,  statements or  documents,  duly executed and
completed by such Bank as evidence of such Bank's exemption from the withholding
of U.S. tax with respect thereto. Administrative Agent shall not be obligated to
make any payments hereunder to such Bank in respect of any Loan or participation
or such Bank's Loan  Commitment or obligation to purchase  participations  until
such Bank shall have  furnished  to  Administrative  Agent the  requested  form,
certification, statement or document.

            Section 10.14 Minimum Commitment by Fleet and PNC. Subsequent to the
Closing  Date,  each of Fleet and PNC agree to maintain a Loan  Commitment in an
amount no less than Twenty Five Million  Dollars  ($25,000,000),  provided there
exists no Event of Default,  and each of them further  agrees to hold and not to
participate  or assign any of such amount other than an  assignment to a Federal
Reserve  Bank  or  to  their  respective  Parent  or  respective  majority-owned
subsidiary.

            Section  10.15 Pro Rata  Treatment.  Except to the extent  otherwise
provided,  (1) each advance of proceeds of the Loans shall be made by the Banks,
(2) each reduction of the amount of the Total Loan Commitment under Section 2.10
or Section 2.11 shall be applied to the Loan  Commitments of the Banks,  and (3)
each payment of the facility fee accruing  under  Section  2.08(a) shall be made
for the  account  of the  Banks,  ratably  according  to the  amounts  of  their
respective Loan Commitments.

            Section  10.16  Sharing of  Payments  Among  Banks.  If a Bank shall
obtain  payment of any  principal  of or interest on any Loan made by it through
the  exercise of any right of setoff,  banker's  lien,  counterclaim,  or by any
other means (including  direct  payment),  and such payment results in such Bank
receiving a greater payment than it would have been entitled to had such payment
been paid directly to  Administrative  Agent for disbursement to the Banks, then
such Bank shall promptly  purchase for cash from the other Banks  participations
in the  Loans  made by the other  Banks in such  amounts,  and make  such  other
adjustments  from  time to time as  shall be  equitable  to the end that all the
Banks shall share  ratably  the benefit of such  payment.  To such end the Banks
shall  make  appropriate   adjustments   among  themselves  (by  the  resale  of
participations sold or otherwise) if such payment is rescinded or must otherwise
be restored.  Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation in the
Loans made by other  Banks may  exercise  all rights of setoff,  banker's  lien,
counterclaim  or similar  rights  with  respect to such  participation.  Nothing
contained  herein  shall  require any Bank to  exercise  any such right or shall
affect the right of any Bank to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising,
any such right with respect to any other indebtedness of Borrower.

            Section  10.17  Possession  of  Documents.   Each  Bank  shall  keep
possession of its own Note.  Administrative  Agent shall hold all the other Loan
Documents and related  documents in its possession and maintain separate records
and  accounts  with  respect  thereto,  and  shall  permit  the  Banks and their
representatives  access at all reasonable  times to inspect such Loan Documents,
related documents, records and accounts.

                        ARTICLE XI. NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS

            Section  11.01  Absolute  and  Unconditional  Obligations.  Borrower
acknowledges  and  agrees  that  its  obligations  and  liabilities  under  this
Agreement and under the other Loan Documents shall be absolute and unconditional
irrespective  of:  (1) any  lack of  validity  or  enforceability  of any of the
Obligations,  any  Loan  Documents,  or any  agreement  or  instrument  relating
thereto;  (2) any change in the time,  manner or place of payment  of, or in any
other term in respect of, all or any of the Obligations,  or any other amendment
or waiver of or consent to any  departure  from any Loan  Documents or any other
documents  or  instruments  executed  in  connection  with  or  related  to  the
Obligations;  (3) any  exchange  or release of any  collateral,  or of any other
Person from all or any of the Obligations;  or (4) any other circumstances which
might otherwise  constitute a defense  available to, or a discharge of, Borrower
or any other Person in respect of the Obligations.

            The obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Agreement and
other Loan Documents  shall not be conditioned or contingent upon the pursuit by
any Bank or any other Person at any time of any right or remedy against Borrower
or any other Person which may be or become  liable in respect of all or any part
of the  Obligations or against any collateral or security or guarantee  therefor
or right of setoff with respect thereto.

            Section 11.02 Non-Recourse to TRG Partners. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in any of the other Loan Documents,
or in any other instruments,  certificates,  documents or agreements executed in
connection  with the Loans (all of the foregoing,  for purposes of this Section,
hereinafter  referred  to,  individually  and  collectively,  as  the  "Relevant
Documents"), no recourse under or upon any Obligation, representation, warranty,
promise or other matter  whatsoever  shall be had against any of the constituent
partners of Borrower or their successors or assigns (said  constituent  partners
and their  successors  and assigns,  for purposes of this  Section,  hereinafter
referred to, individually and collectively, as the "TRG Partners") and each Bank
expressly  waives  and  releases,  on behalf of itself  and its  successors  and
assigns,  all right to assert any liability  whatsoever under or with respect to
the Relevant  Documents  against,  or to satisfy any claim or obligation arising
thereunder  against,  any of the TRG  Partners  or out of any  assets of the TRG
Partners,  provided,  however,  that nothing in this Section shall be deemed to:
(1) release Borrower from any personal liability pursuant to, or from any of its
respective obligations under, the Relevant Documents, or from personal liability
for its fraudulent actions or fraudulent omissions;  (2) release any TRG Partner
from  personal  liability  for its or his own  fraudulent  actions or fraudulent
omissions; (3) constitute a waiver of any obligation evidenced or secured by, or
contained  in,  the  Relevant  Documents  or affect in any way the  validity  or
enforceability   of  the  Relevant   Documents;   or  (4)  limit  the  right  of
Administrative  Agent  and/or the Banks to proceed  against or realize  upon any
collateral  hereafter  given  for the  Loans  or any and  all of the  assets  of
Borrower  (notwithstanding  the fact  that the TRG  Partners  have an  ownership
interest in Borrower and, thereby,  an interest in the assets of Borrower) or to
name Borrower (or, to the extent that the same are required by applicable law or
are determined by a court to be necessary  parties in connection  with an action
or suit against Borrower or any collateral hereafter given for the Loans, any of
the TRG Partners) as a party defendant in, and to enforce against any collateral
hereafter given for the Loans and/or assets of Borrower any judgment obtained by
Administrative  Agent and/or the Banks with respect to, any action or suit under
the  Relevant  Documents  so long as no judgment  shall be taken  (except to the
extent taking a judgment is required by applicable  law or determined by a court
to be necessary



                                       43

<PAGE>



to preserve  Administrative  Agent's and/or Banks' rights against any collateral
hereafter  given  for the  Loans or  Borrower,  but not  otherwise)  or shall be
enforced  against the TRG  Partners,  their  successors  and  assigns,  or their
assets.


                            ARTICLE XII. MISCELLANEOUS

            Section 12.01 Binding Effect of Request for Advance. Borrower agrees
that,  by its  acceptance  of any  advance of  proceeds  of the Loans under this
Agreement,  it shall  be  bound  in all  respects  by the  request  for  advance
submitted on its behalf in connection  therewith  with the same force and effect
as if Borrower  had itself  executed and  submitted  the request for advance and
whether or not the  request  for  advance is  executed  and/or  submitted  by an
authorized person.

            Section  12.02  Amendments  and  Waivers.  No  amendment or material
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document nor consent
to any material departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Required Banks and, solely
for purposes of its acknowledgment thereof,  Administrative Agent, and then such
waiver or consent shall be effective  only in the specific  instance and for the
specific purpose for which given, provided,  however, that no amendment,  waiver
or consent  shall,  unless in writing  and signed by all the Banks do any of the
following:  (1) reduce the  principal  of, or interest on, the Notes or any fees
due hereunder or any other amount due hereunder or under any Loan Document;  (2)
postpone  any date fixed for any payment of  principal  of, or interest  on, the
Notes or any fees due hereunder or under any Loan Document, or waive any default
in the payment of principal, interest or any other amount due hereunder or under
any Loan Documents;  (3) change the definition of Required Banks; (4) amend this
Section or any other provision  requiring the consent of all the Banks or of the
Required  Banks;  (5) waive any default under paragraph (5) of Section 9.01; (6)
increase the Loan  Commitment of any Bank; or (7) amend Section 10.15 or Section
10.16.  Any  advance of  proceeds  of the Loans  made  prior to or  without  the
fulfillment by Borrower of all of the conditions  precedent thereto,  whether or
not known to Administrative  Agent and the Banks,  shall not constitute a waiver
of the requirement that all conditions,  including the non-performed conditions,
shall be required with respect to all future advances. No failure on the part of
Administrative  Agent or any Bank to exercise,  and no delay in exercising,  any
right  hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver  thereof or  preclude  any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein
provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

            Section   12.03   Usury.    Anything    herein   to   the   contrary
notwithstanding,  the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes
shall be  subject to the  limitation  that  payments  of  interest  shall not be
required to the extent that receipt  thereof  would be contrary to provisions of
law  applicable  to a Bank  limiting  rates of interest  which may be charged or
collected by such Bank.

            Section  12.04   Expenses;   Indemnification.   Borrower  agrees  to
reimburse  Administrative Agent on demand for all costs,  expenses,  and charges
(including,  without  limitation,  all reasonable fees and charges of engineers,
appraisers  and external  legal  counsel)  incurred by  Administrative  Agent in
connection  with the Loans  and to  reimburse  each of the Banks for  reasonable
legal costs, expenses and charges incurred by each of the Banks in



                                       44

<PAGE>



connection with the performance or enforcement of this Agreement,  the Notes, or
any other Loan Documents;  provided,  however,  that Borrower is not responsible
for costs,  expenses and charges incurred by the Bank Parties in connection with
the  administration  or  syndication  of the Loans  (other than the  syndication
expenses  and  administration  fee  required by the  Supplemental  Fee  Letter).
Borrower  agrees  to  indemnify  Administrative  Agent  and each  Bank and their
respective directors, officers, employees and agents from, and hold each of them
harmless against, any and all losses,  liabilities,  claims, damages or expenses
incurred by any of them arising out of or by reason of (x) any claims by brokers
due to acts or omissions by Borrower,  or (y) any investigation or litigation or
other proceedings (including any threatened investigation or litigation or other
proceedings)  relating to any actual or proposed use by Borrower of the proceeds
of  the  Loans,   including   without   limitation,   the  reasonable  fees  and
disbursements of counsel  incurred in connection with any such  investigation or
litigation or other  proceedings  (but  excluding any such losses,  liabilities,
claims,  damages  or  expenses  incurred  by reason of the gross  negligence  or
willful misconduct of the Person to be indemnified).

            The  obligations  of Borrower  under this Section  shall survive the
repayment  of all  amounts  due  under  or in  connection  with  any of the Loan
Documents and the termination of the Loans.

            Section 12.05  Assignment;  Participation.  This Agreement  shall be
binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, Borrower, Administrative Agent,
the Banks and their respective  successors and permitted  assigns.  Borrower may
not assign or transfer its rights or obligations hereunder.

            Subject to the provisions of Section 10.14, any Bank may at any time
grant  to one or  more  banks  or  other  institutions  (each  a  "Participant")
participating  interests  in its Loan  (each a  "Participation")  subject to the
consent of Fleet and PNC, which consents shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or
delayed, and provided that any such Participation shall be in the minimum amount
of Ten Million Dollars  ($10,000,000).  In the event of any such grant by a Bank
of a Participation to a Participant,  whether or not Borrower or  Administrative
Agent was given notice,  such Bank shall remain  responsible for the performance
of its  obligations  hereunder,  and  Borrower  and  Administrative  Agent shall
continue  to deal solely and  directly  with such Bank in  connection  with such
Bank's rights and  obligations  hereunder.  Any agreement  pursuant to which any
Bank may grant a  Participation  shall  provide  that such Bank shall retain the
sole right and  responsibility to enforce the obligations of Borrower  hereunder
and under any other Loan Document including,  without  limitation,  the right to
approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement
or any other Loan  Document;  provided  that such  participation  agreement  may
provide that such Bank will not agree to any  modification,  amendment or waiver
of this  Agreement  described  in  Section  12.02  without  the  consent  of the
Participant.

            Subject to the provisions of Section  10.14,  any Bank having a Loan
Commitment  in  an  amount  equal  to  or  exceeding   Fifteen  Million  Dollars
($15,000,000) may at any time assign to any bank or other institution,  with the
acknowledgment  of  Administrative  Agent and the  consent  of  Fleet,  PNC and,
provided there exists no Event of Default, of Borrower, which consents shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed (such assignee, a "Consented Assignee"),  or
to one or more banks or other institutions which are majority owned subsidiaries
of a Bank or to the Parent of a Bank (each Consented Assignee or subsidiary bank
or institution, an



                                       45

<PAGE>



"Assignee")  all, or a proportionate  part of all, of its rights and obligations
under this  Agreement and its Note,  and such  Assignee  shall assume rights and
obligations, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement executed by such
Assignee and the  assigning  Bank,  provided  that,  in each case,  after giving
effect to such assignment, the Assignee's Loan Commitment, and, in the case of a
partial assignment, the assigning Bank's Loan Commitment,  each will be equal to
or greater  than Five  Million  Dollars  ($5,000,000).  Upon (i)  execution  and
delivery of such  instrument,  (ii)  payment by such  Assignee to the Bank of an
amount equal to the purchase price agreed between the Bank and such Assignee and
(iii)  payment  by  such  Assignee  to  Administrative   Agent  of  a  fee,  for
Administrative  Agent's  own  account,  in the amount of  $2,500,  on account of
Administrative  Agent's fees and expenses in  connection  with such  assignment,
such  Assignee  shall be a Bank Party to this  Agreement  and shall have all the
rights and  obligations of a Bank as set forth in such Assignment and Assumption
Agreement,  and the  assigning  Bank  shall be  released  from  its  obligations
hereunder to a  corresponding  extent,  and no further  consent or action by any
party shall be required.  Upon the  consummation  of any assignment  pursuant to
this  paragraph,  substitute  Notes  shall be issued to the  assigning  Bank and
Assignee by  Borrower,  in exchange  for the return of the  original  Note.  The
obligations  evidenced by such substitute notes shall  constitute  "Obligations"
for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. If the Assignee
is not  incorporated  under the laws of the United  States of America or a state
thereof, it shall, prior to the first date on which interest or fees are payable
hereunder  for  its  account,  deliver  to  Borrower  and  Administrative  Agent
certification as to exemption from deduction or withholding of any United States
federal income taxes in accordance with Section 10.13.

            Any Bank may at any time  assign  all or any  portion  of its rights
under this Agreement and its Note to a Federal  Reserve Bank. No such assignment
shall release the transferor Bank from its obligations hereunder.

            Borrower  recognizes  that in  connection  with a Bank's  selling of
Participations  or making of assignments,  any or all  documentation,  financial
statements,  appraisals and other data, or copies thereof,  relevant to Borrower
or the  Loans  may be  exhibited  to and  retained  by any such  Participant  or
assignee or prospective Participant or assignee. In addition, such documentation
etc. may be exhibited to and retained by  Affiliates  of a Bank.  In  connection
with a Bank's  delivery of any financial  statements  and appraisals to any such
Participant or assignee or prospective  Participant or assignee, such Bank shall
also deliver its standard confidentiality statement indicating that the same are
delivered on a  confidential  basis.  Borrower  agrees to provide all assistance
reasonably  requested  by a Bank to enable such Bank to sell  Participations  or
make  assignments of its Loan as permitted by this Section.  Each Bank agrees to
provide Borrower with notice of all Participations sold by such Bank.

            Notwithstanding  the foregoing  provisions of this Section,  no Bank
shall  assign,  grant,  convey,  or  transfer  all or any portion of or interest
(participation  or  otherwise) in the Loan to any Person if such Person is (i) a
greater than 10% partner  (determined  in accordance  with Treasury  Regulations
Section  1.752-2(d)(1)  of the Code) of Borrower (a "Greater than 10% Partner"),
(ii) an 80% or greater  partner,  member or  shareholder of any Greater than 10%
Partner or (iii) a person who is under 80% or greater common  ownership with (x)

as modified by Treasury Regulations Section 1.752-4. Any Person

in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding of a constituent partner of Borrower,
any interest as (a) a partner in Borrower or (b) an 80% or greater interest as a

intended to be  severable.  If for any reason any  provision  of this  Agreement
shall be held invalid or unenforceable in whole or in part in any  jurisdiction,
such provision shall, as to such  jurisdiction,  be ineffective to the extent of
such invalidity or unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity
or enforceability  thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions
hereof in any jurisdiction.

                           --------------------------

          (As Amended and Restated Effective as of September 30, 1997)


                                    Article 1
                Background, Amendment and Restatement, and Term.

     1.1 Background.  THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP,  a Delaware
limited partnership (including any successor thereto,  "TRG") was formed for the
purposes of,  among other  things,  owning,  operating,  acquiring,  developing,
redeveloping, expanding, leasing, managing, financing and refinancing, disposing
of,  and  generally   dealing  with,   regional  retail  shopping   centers  and
opportunities  to  develop  regional  retail  shopping  centers  (and  interests
therein). TRG has engaged the Manager, on an exclusive basis, to provide various
services,   including  management,   leasing,   development,   acquisition,  and
administrative services, to TRG.

     1.2 Original Plan. TRG adopted The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership
1992 Incentive  Option Plan (the "Original  Plan")  effective as of November 20,
1992, to provide  incentives to employees of the Manager to remain in the employ
of the Manager for the benefit of TRG, to encourage proprietary interest in TRG,
and to  attract  new  employees  with  outstanding  qualifications  to serve the
Manager on behalf of TRG.

     1.3 Amended and  Restated  Plan.  The Original  Plan is hereby  amended and
restated  effective as of September 30, 1997 and is referred to  hereinafter  as
the "Plan".

     1.4 Term.  The Plan will remain in effect until  terminated or abandoned by
action  of  the  Partnership   Committee  in  accordance  with  the  Partnership
Agreement.

                                   Definitions

     In the Plan,  whenever  the context so  indicates,  the  singular or plural

time (or any corresponding provisions of succeeding law).

of Partnership  Interest and Incentive  Options to exchange,  subject to certain
restrictions, Units of Partnership Interest (or the right, without condition, to
receive Units of Partnership Interest pursuant to the Plan) for shares of Common
Stock.

     2.10 "Date of  Exercise",  means with respect to an Incentive  Option,  the
Business Day  immediately  preceding the date on which such Incentive  Option is
exercised pursuant to the Plan.

     2.11  "Date of Grant",  means with  respect  to an  Incentive  Option,  the
Business Day immediately preceding the date on which the Compensation  Committee
grants such Incentive Option pursuant to the Plan.

     2.12 "Day" means each calendar day, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal
holidays;  provided,  however,  that if the Day on  which a  period  of time for
consent or approval  or other  action  ends is not a Business  Day,  such period
shall end on the next Business Day.

     2.13  "Disability"  or  "Disabled"  means,  with respect to an Employee,  a
physical or mental condition resulting from any medically  determinable physical

substantial  gainful  employment  and that can be expected to result in death or
that has lasted or can be expected to last for a  continuous  period of not less
than three hundred  sixty-five  (365) Days.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  an
Employee shall not be deemed to be Disabled as a result of any condition that:

               (a) was contracted, suffered, or incurred while such Employee was
     engaged in, or resulted from such Employee  having  engaged in, a felonious
     activity;


                                      - 2 -

<PAGE>



               (b) resulted from an  intentionally  self-inflicted  injury or an
     addiction to drugs, alcohol, or substances which are not administered under
     the direction of a licensed  physician as part of a medical treatment plan;
     or

               (c)  resulted  from  service  in the Armed  Forces of the  United
     States for which such  Employee  received a  disability  benefit or pension
     from the United  States,  or from  service in the armed forces of any other
     country irrespective of any disability benefit or pension.

     The Disability of an Employee and the date upon which an Employee ceases to
be employed by reason of  Disability  shall be  determined  by the  Compensation
Committee,  upon the recommendation from the Manager, in accordance with uniform
principles  consistently  applied,  upon  the  basis  of  such  evidence  as the
Compensation  Committee and the Manager deem  necessary and  desirable,  and its
good faith  determination  shall be conclusive for all purposes of this Plan and
the relevant Option Agreement.  The Compensation  Committee or the Manager shall
have the right to require an Employee to submit to an examination by a physician
or physicians and to submit to such reexaminations as the Compensation Committee
or the Manager shall  require in order to make a  determination  concerning  the
Employee's physical or mental condition; provided, however, that (i) an Employee
may not be required to undergo a medical  examination  more often than once each
one  hundred  eighty  (180) Days nor at any time  after the  normal  date of the
Employee's  Retirement,  and  (ii) the fees  and  expenses  of any such  medical
examination(s)  shall be considered  expenses of administering  the Plan. If any
Employee engages in any occupation or employment  (except for  rehabilitation as
determined  by the  Compensation  Committee,  upon the  recommendation  from the
Manager) for remuneration or profit,  which activity would be inconsistent  with
the  finding  of  Disability,   or  if  the  Compensation  Committee,  upon  the
recommendation  from  the  Manager,   determines  on  the  basis  of  a  medical
examination  that an  Employee  no longer has a  Disability,  or if an  Employee
refuses  to  submit  to  any  medical  examination  properly  requested  by  the
Compensation  Committee  or the  Manager,  then in any such event,  the Employee
shall be deemed to have recovered from such Disability.

     2.14  "Effective  Date" means September 30, 1997. The effective date of the
Original Plan was November 20, 1992.

     2.15  "Employee"  means an  individual  who is and continues to be employed
(within the meaning of Section 3401 of the Code and the regulations  promulgated
thereunder) by the Manager or a Manager Entity. An Employee shall cease to be an
Employee upon the voluntary or involuntary  termination  of his employment  with
the Manager or a Manager  Entity (as such terms are defined in Sections 2.26 and
2.27 hereof) for any reason, including death, Disability, Retirement, or with or
without cause. Transfers of employment between the Manager and a Manager Entity,
or  between  Manager  Entities,  shall not affect an  individual's  status as an
Employee  for  purposes of the Plan and shall not be treated as a  cessation  of
employment  provided  that the  cessation  of  employment  with the Manager or a
Manager Entity is immediately followed by employment with the Manager or another
Manager  Entity.  Whether an authorized  leave of absence,  or an absence due to
military or government service,  Disability, or any other reason,  constitutes a
cessation of employment shall be determined by the Compensation Committee,  upon
the recommendation from the Manager.

                    Initial Public  Offering:  The Exercise Price shall be equal
                    to $11.139 for each Unit of Partnership  Interest subject to
                    an Incentive  Option  granted prior to or at the time of the
                    Initial Public Offering.

                    to September 30, 1997:  The Exercise Price shall be equal to
                    the Fair Market Value of each Unit of  Partnership  Interest
                    (as defined in the Original Plan)  determined as of the Date
                    of Grant,  divided by 1975.08  (rounding  the quotient up to
                    the  nearest  1/10th  cent)  for  each  Unit of  Partnership
                    Interest  subject to an Incentive Option granted on any date
                    after November 20, 1992 but prior to September 30, 1997.

                    2.18)  determined as of the Date of Grant,  for each Unit of
                    Partnership  Interest subject to an Incentive Option granted
                    on any date on or after September 30, 1997.

     2.17 "Fair Market  Value of the Common  Stock" means the per share value of
the Common Stock on the Valuation Date, and is determined as follows:

               (a) If the Common  Stock is listed or admitted for trading on any
     national securities exchange,  the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is
     the closing price per share on such exchange on such Valuation Date (or, if
     listed on more than one exchange, the principal said exchange).

               (b) If the Common Stock is not traded on any national  securities
     exchange,  but is quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers,
     Inc.  Automated  Quotation  System (NASDAQ System) or any similar system of
     automated  dissemination  of  quotations  of prices in common use, the Fair
     Market  Value of the Common  Stock is the price per share equal to the mean
     between the closing high bid and the closing low bid on such system on such
     Valuation Date.

               (c) If neither paragraph (a) nor paragraph (b) of this definition
     is applicable, the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock is the fair market
     value per share,  on such  Valuation  Date,  as  determined by the Board of
     Directors (or by the  Partnership  Committee if the Board of Directors does
     not,  for any reason,  provide  such  determination),  in good faith and in
     accordance with uniform principles consistently applied.

     2.43 "Units of Partnership Interest" means the units into which Partnership
Interests are divided.

     2.44 "Valuation Date" means, with respect to an Incentive Option,  the Date
of Grant  of such  Incentive  Option  or the Date of  Exercise,  as  applicable.
Whenever  reference is made to a Valuation  Date, it shall mean, with respect to

with respect to any other item, midnight in Detroit, Michigan at the end of such
Valuation Date.

                                    Article 3
                                 Administration.

     3.1  Administration.  The Plan shall be  administered  by the  Compensation
Committee in accordance with this Article 3. Except as otherwise provided in the
Partnership Agreement or this Plan and except as otherwise expressly reserved to
the  Partnership  Committee  in the Plan or in the  Partnership  Agreement,  the
Compensation Committee shall have the sole discretionary authority (i) to select
the Employees who are to be granted  Incentive  Options under the Plan,  (ii) to
determine the number of Units of  Partnership  Interest in TRG to be optioned to
an Employee,  (iii) to authorize  the  granting of  Incentive  Options,  (iv) to
interpret  the Plan,  (v) to establish and modify  administrative  rules for the
Plan, (vi) to impose such conditions and restrictions on Incentive Options as it
determines  appropriate,  (vii) to execute Option  Agreements,  (viii) to cancel
Incentive Options and to substitute new Incentive Options with the consent of an
Optionee, and (ix) to take any other actions in connection with the Plan and the
Incentive Options and to make all  determinations  under the Plan as it may deem
necessary or advisable.

     It  is  anticipated  that  the  Compensation  Committee  will  act  upon  a
recommendation  from the Manager in  exercising  the  discretion  granted to the
Compensation  Committee  under  the  Plan.  Action  taken  or not  taken  by the
Compensation  Committee on one or more occasions shall be without  obligation to
take or not take such action on any other occasion(s).

     The   Compensation   Committee  may,  subject  to  the  provisions  of  the
Partnership Agreement,  delegate to one or more Persons any of its powers, other
than its power to authorize  the granting of  Incentive  Options,  hereinbefore,
hereinafter,  or pursuant to the Partnership Agreement provided or conferred, or
designate  one or more  Persons  to do or  perform  those  matters to be done or
performed by the Compensation Committee,  including  administration of the Plan.
Any Person or Persons  delegated or  designated  by the  Compensation  Committee
shall be  subject  to the  same  obligations  and  requirements  imposed  on the
Compensation  Committee  and its  members  under  the Plan  and the  Partnership
Agreement.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1, any selection
of an officer or director of the Company to be granted an Incentive Option under
the Plan, and any


                                      - 7 -

decisions concerning the timing, pricing, and amount of a grant to an officer or
director of the Company, in the event such officer or director is subject to the
provisions of Section 16 of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 at the time of
grant, shall be made solely by those members of the Compensation Committee,  but
in no event fewer than two, who are  "disinterested  persons" within the meaning
of Rule 16b-3 under the  Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934.  In view of the fact
that,  subject  to  certain  restrictions,  the  Units of  Partnership  Interest
acquired upon exercise of an Incentive Option may be exchanged,  pursuant to the
Continuing Offer, for shares of Common Stock, all grants of Incentive Options to
such  officers  and  directors  of the Company  must  further be  confirmed by a
committee  of  two  or  more  disinterested  directors  of  the  Company  (which
confirmation shall be deemed made if such  disinterested  directors who serve on
such  committee  of the  Board  of  Directors  also  serve  on the  Compensation
Committee).

     3.2  Expenses of  Administration.  TRG shall pay all costs and  expenses of
administering the Plan.

     3.3   Indemnification.   The   Compensation   Committee,   members  of  the
Compensation  Committee,  and each Person or Persons  designated or delegated by
the  Compensation  Committee,  and the Manager and each  Manager  Entity and the
shareholders,  directors  and  officers of the Manager and each  Manager  Entity
shall be entitled to  indemnification  and reimbursement from TRG for any action
or any failure to act in connection  with services  performed by or on behalf of
the Compensation Committee for the benefit of TRG to the fullest extent provided
or permitted by the Partnership  Agreement and by any insurance  policy or other
agreement  intended  for the benefit of the  Compensation  Committee,  or by any
applicable law.

                                    Article 4
             Units of Partnership Interest Available Under the Plan

     4.1 Units of  Partnership  Interest  Available.  Incentive  Options  may be
granted by TRG under the Plan from time to time to purchase an  aggregate  Eight
Million,  Eight Hundred Eighty- Seven Thousand,  Eight Hundred Sixty (8,887,860)
Units of Partnership  Interest, as said number may be increased by the action of
the Partnership Committee.

     4.2  Units  of  Partnership  Interest  Subject  to  Terminated  or  Expired
Incentive  Options.  In the  event  that  an  outstanding  Incentive  Option  is
surrendered,  expires or is terminated  for any reason before it shall have been
fully exercised,  then all Units of Partnership Interest in TRG formerly subject
to such  Incentive  Option shall again be  available  for any  Incentive  Option
subsequently granted under the Plan.

     4.3  Adjustments.  In the event of any  change in the Units of  Partnership
Interest by reason of merger, or by reason of a division or combination of Units
of  Partnership  Interest,  or  otherwise,  the  number  and  kind of  Units  of
Partnership  Interest  which may thereafter be optioned and sold under the Plan,
the  number  and kind of Units of  Partnership  Interest  subject  to option and
outstanding  Option  Agreements,  and the Exercise Price per Unit of Partnership
Interest,  shall be  appropriately  adjusted  in a manner  consistent  with such
change, as the Compensation Committee may deem equitable.

                                    Article 5
                                  Participation

     All  Employees  shall be eligible to receive  grants of  Incentive  Options
under the Plan.  The Optionees  shall be such  individuals  as the  Compensation
Committee may select, upon the recommendation  from the Manager,  from among the
Employees  (who may include  executive  officers of the  Manager),  and shall be
based upon the expected future  contribution of such Employee to the Manager for
the benefit of TRG.

                                    Article 6
                                Incentive Options

     6.1 Power to Grant Incentive Options. The Compensation  Committee may grant
to such Employees as the Compensation  Committee may select,  in accordance with
Article 5 hereof,  Incentive Options entitling the Optionee to purchase Units of
Partnership Interest from TRG in such quantity, exercisable at an Exercise Price
equal to the Fair Market Value of the Units of Partnership  Interest  determined
as of the Date of Grant,  and on such terms and subject to such  conditions  not
inconsistent  with  the  terms  of  the  Plan,  as  may  be  established  by the
Compensation  Committee. No Incentive Option covering a Fractional Unit shall be
granted under the Plan.

     6.2 Modification,  Extension,  and Renewal of Incentive Options. Subject to
the  approval of the  Partnership  Committee,  the  Compensation  Committee  may
modify,   extend,  or  renew  outstanding   Incentive  Options,  or  accept  the
cancellation  or surrender of outstanding  Incentive  Options (to the extent not
previously  exercised) for the granting of new Incentive Options in substitution
therefor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no modification of an Incentive Option
shall,  without  the  consent  of the  Optionee,  alter or impair  any rights or
obligations under any Incentive Option previously granted.

     6.3  Optionee  to Have No Rights as a Partner.  An  Optionee  shall have no
rights as a partner  in TRG with  respect to the Units of  Partnership  Interest
made subject to an Incentive  Option  unless and until such  Optionee  exercises
such  Incentive  Option,  is  admitted  as a  partner  in TRG,  and is  issued a
Partnership Interest Certificate  evidencing his Units of Partnership  Interest.
No adjustments  shall be made for  distributions,  allocations,  or other rights
with respect to any Units of Partnership  Interest prior to the last to occur of
the foregoing events specified in this Section 6.3.

                                    Article 7
                    Terms and Conditions of Incentive Options

     7.1 Option  Agreements.  The terms of any Incentive  Option shall be as set
forth in a written  incentive option  agreement (an "Option  Agreement") in such
form as the  Compensation  Committee  shall  from time to time  determine.  Each
Option Agreement shall comply with and be subject to the terms and conditions of
the Plan, the Partnership Agreement,  and such other terms and conditions as the
Compensation  Committee  may deem  appropriate.  No Person shall have any rights
under any Incentive  Option  granted under the Plan unless and until TRG and the
Optionee have executed an Option Agreement setting forth the grant and the terms
and conditions of the Incentive Option.

     7.2 Plan Provisions  Control  Incentive Option Terms. The terms of the Plan
shall govern all Incentive Options granted under the Plan, and in no event shall
the  Compensation  Committee have the power to grant any Incentive  Option under
the Plan which is contrary to any of the  provisions  of the Plan.  In the event
that any provision of an Incentive  Option granted under the Plan shall conflict
with any term in the Plan as  constituted on the Date of Grant of such Incentive
Option,  the term in the Plan constituted on the Date of Grant of such Incentive
Option shall control.

     7.3  Conditions  for  Exercise  (Vesting).  Except with  respect to Special
Incentive Options or in the case of the death,  Disability,  or Retirement of an
Optionee, and subject to the provisions of Sections 7.6, 8.3, and 8.4 hereof, no
part of an Incentive  Option  granted under the Plan may be exercised  until the
Optionee has completed  three (3) years of employment with the Manager after the
Date of Grant of such Incentive Option. Except with respect to Special Incentive
Options or in the case of the death,  Disability,  or Retirement of an Optionee,
and provided that an Optionee has completed  three (3) years of employment  with
the Manager after the Date of Grant of such  Incentive  Option,  such  Incentive
Option shall become exercisable (i.e., it shall "vest") as follows:

               (a) Subject to  paragraph  (d) below of this  Section  7.3,  each
     Incentive Option (other than a Special Incentive Option) granted under this
     Plan shall become  exercisable (i) on the third (3rd)  anniversary  date of
     the Date of Grant of such  Incentive  Option,  to the  extent of  one-third
     (1/3) of the Units of  Partnership  Interest made subject to such Incentive
     Option;  (ii) on the fourth (4th)  anniversary date of the Date of Grant of
     such Incentive  Option,  to the extent of an additional  one-third (1/3) of
     the Units of Partnership  Interest made subject to such  Incentive  Option;
     and (iii) on the fifth (5th)  anniversary date of the Date of Grant, to the
     extent of all of the Units of  Partnership  Interest  made  subject to such
     Incentive Option.

               (b) The vesting and exercise of Special  Incentive  Options shall
     be determined under the terms of the Original Plan.

               (c) For purposes of this Section 7.3, in  determining  the "Units
     of  Partnership  Interest made subject to such Incentive  Option,"  account
     shall be taken of any adjustments made to the Units of Partnership Interest
     as described in Section 4.3 hereof after the Date of Grant of the Incentive
     Option, such that the number of Units of Partnership  Interest with respect
     to which an Optionee's  Incentive Option is vested shall be redetermined at
     the time of an adjustment,  and the number of Units of Partnership Interest
     with respect to which an Optionee's  Incentive Option becomes vested on any
     anniversary date shall be determined by reference to the number of Units of
     Partnership  Interest  then subject to such  Incentive  Option,  taking any
     adjustments previously made into account.

               (d) An Optionee  may  exercise all or any portion of an Incentive
     Option,  to the  extent  vested;  however,  Incentive  Options  may  not be
     exercised  over less than one (1) Unit of  Partnership  Interest.  If, as a
     result  of  the  vesting   provisions  of  Section  7.3(a),  the  Units  of
     Partnership   Interest  with  respect  to  which  an  Optionee's  Incentive
     Option(s)   become   exercisable   include  a  Fractional  Unit,  then  the
     exercisable Options shall be rounded down to cover whole Units only.

     7.4 Conversion of Incentive Options Granted Prior to September 30, 1997. In
connection  with  the  division  of  Units  of  Partnership  Interest  effective
September 30, 1997, the number of Units of Partnership  Interest  subject to all
unexercised  and  outstanding  Incentive  Options granted prior to September 30,
1997 shall be  increased  (effective  as of  September  30, 1997) by a factor of
1,975.08,  rounding  up to the next whole Unit if the  product  would  otherwise
include a Fractional Unit.

     7.5 Expiration  Date.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Plan, no
Incentive Option shall be exercisable after the tenth (10th)  anniversary of the
Date of Grant.

     7.6 Acceleration of Exercise Time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in the Plan,  including  Sections  7.3,  7.7 and 7.8  hereof,  the  Compensation
Committee,  in its discretion,  upon the  recommendation  from the Manager,  may
allow the  exercise,  in whole or in part,  at any time more than six (6) months
after the Date of Grant,  as determined by the  Compensation  Committee,  of any
Incentive Option held by an Optionee,  which Incentive Option has not previously
become exercisable.

     7.7 Termination of Employment (Except by Death, Disability,  or Retirement)
Within  Three  Years  After  Date of  Grant.  Except  in the case of the  death,
Disability,  or  Retirement  of an  Optionee,  if an  Optionee  ceases  to be an
Employee  for any reason  within three (3) years after the Date of Grant to such
Optionee  of an  Incentive  Option  under the  Plan,  such  Optionee's  right to
exercise  such  Incentive   Option  or  any  part  thereof  shall  be  forfeited
immediately and permanently.

     7.8 Termination of Employment (Except by Death, Disability,  or Retirement)
More Than  Three  Years  After  Date of Grant.  Except in the case of the death,
Disability,  or  Retirement  of an  Optionee,  if an  Optionee  ceases  to be an
Employee  for any reason  more than  three (3) years  after the Date of Grant to
such Optionee of an Incentive  Option under the Plan,  such Optionee  shall have
the right, subject to the restrictions of Sections 7.5, 7.17 and 7.18 hereof, to
exercise such  Incentive  Option,  in full or in part, at any time within ninety
(90) Days after his cessation of employment, but only to the extent that, on the
date of such cessation of  employment,  such  Optionee's  right to exercise such
Incentive  Option had vested pursuant to the terms of Section 7.3 hereof and the
applicable Option Agreement and had not previously been exercised.

     7.9 Termination for Cause.  Notwithstanding  the preceding Sections of this
Article  7,  including  without  limitation  Sections  7.3  and 7.8  hereof,  an
Incentive   Option  shall  cease  to  be  exercisable  and  shall  be  forfeited
immediately and permanently on the date of an Optionee's cessation of employment
if such  cessation  is a  Termination  For Cause (as  defined  in  Section  2.40
hereof).

     7.10 Death of Optionee.  If an Optionee  dies while an Employee and without
having fully exercised his Incentive Option(s),  then any outstanding  Incentive
Option(s) of such Optionee shall vest  immediately and fully,  and the executor,
administrator, or other personal representative of the Optionee's estate, or the
trustee of any Family Trust  receiving such  Incentive  Option(s) as a result of
such Optionee's  death, or any heir,  successor,  assign, or other transferee of
the  Optionee  receiving  such  Incentive  Option(s)  by will or by the  laws of
descent and distribution,  shall have the right,  subject to the restrictions of
Sections 7.5,  7.17 and 7.18 hereof,  to exercise  such  Incentive  Option(s) to
acquire the Units of Partnership


                                     - 11 -

<PAGE>



Interest in TRG made subject to such Incentive Option(s), in full or in part, at
any time within seven hundred thirty (730) Days after the Optionee's death.

     7.11 Disability of Optionee. If an Optionee who ceases to be an Employee at
any  time  by  reason  of  Disability  has not  fully  exercised  his  Incentive
Option(s),  then any outstanding Incentive Option(s) of such Optionee shall vest
immediately  and  fully,  and such  Optionee  or his  guardian  or  other  legal
representative,  shall have the right,  subject to the  restrictions of Sections
7.5, 7.17 and 7.18 hereof,  to exercise such Incentive  Option(s) to acquire the
Units  of  Partnership  Interest  in TRG  made  the  subject  of such  Incentive
Option(s), in full or in part, at any time prior to the tenth (10th) anniversary
date of the Date of Grant.

     7.12 Retirement of Optionee. If an Optionee who ceases to be an Employee at
any  time  by  reason  of  Retirement  has not  fully  exercised  his  Incentive
Option(s),  then any Incentive Option(s) of such Optionee shall vest immediately
and fully,  and such Optionee shall have the right,  subject to the restrictions
of Sections 7.5, 7.17 and 7.18 hereof,  to exercise such Incentive  Option(s) to
acquire  the  Units of  Partnership  Interest  in TRG made the  subject  of such
Incentive  Option(s),  in full or in part, at any time prior to the tenth (10th)
anniversary date of the Date of Grant.

     7.13 Exercise  Procedures.  Each  Incentive  Option  granted under the Plan
shall be exercised by written notice to the Compensation Committee, which notice
must be received by the  Compensation  Committee on or before the earlier of (i)
the date such Incentive Option expires pursuant to Section 7.5 hereof,  and (ii)
the last date on which such  Incentive  Option may be  exercised  as provided in
Sections 7.7 through 7.12 and in Section 8.3 hereof.

     7.14 Payment of the  Exercise  Price.  The purchase  price for each Unit of
Partnership Interest in TRG to be purchased upon exercise of an Incentive Option
granted under the Plan shall be paid in full in cash by the Optionee pursuant to
the Option Agreement and in an amount equal to the Exercise Price.

     7.15 Taxes.  TRG or the Manager,  or a Manager Entity,  as the case may be,
shall  be  entitled,  if  the  Compensation  Committee  deems  it  necessary  or
desirable,  to withhold (or secure  payment from an Optionee or  Beneficiary  in
lieu of withholding)  the amount of any withholding or other tax required by law
to be withheld or paid by TRG or the Manager with respect to any amount  payable
and/or Units of Partnership  Interest  issuable under such Optionee's  Incentive
Option,  and TRG may defer  payment  or  issuance  of the  Units of  Partnership
Interest upon such Optionee's exercise of an Incentive Option unless indemnified
to its  satisfaction  against any liability for such tax. The amount of any such
withholding shall be determined by the Compensation Committee.

     7.16 Surrender of Incentive Options. Any Incentive Option granted under the
Plan  may  be  surrendered  to  TRG  for  cancellation  on  such  terms  as  the
Compensation  Committee and the Optionee agree,  including,  but not limited to,
terms which provide that upon such  surrender TRG shall pay to the Optionee cash
or,  subject to the  provisions  of Section  7.17 hereof,  Units of  Partnership
Interest, or a combination of cash and Units of Partnership Interest.

     7.17 Prohibition Against Exercise of Incentive Option. In the event that an
Optionee properly exercising an Incentive Option as provided in the Plan, or any
other Person properly


                                     - 12 -

<PAGE>



exercising an Incentive  Option as provided in the Plan, is not a Person to whom
a Partner  (as that  term is  defined  in the  Partnership  Agreement)  would be
permitted  to  Transfer  all or any  portion  of its  Partnership  Interest,  as
provided in Section 8.1(b) of the Partnership  Agreement (such Optionee or other
Person being hereinafter  referred to as an "Impermissible  Holder"),  then such
Impermissible  Holder shall nevertheless be permitted to exercise such Incentive
Option as  provided in Sections  7.3  through  7.12 and in Sections  8.2 and 8.4
hereof,  by complying  with the  procedures  provided in Sections  7.13 and 7.15
hereof and by paying or causing to be paid to TRG the Exercise Price pursuant to
Section  7.14,  but such  Impermissible  Holder  shall not be issued  Unit(s) of
Partnership Interest but shall, instead, and at the same time, receive shares of
Common  Stock  pursuant  to and  subject  to the  terms  and  conditions  of the
Continuing Offer.

     7.18  Prohibition  Against Exercise of Option within Six (6) Months of Date
of Grant.  Notwithstanding  any other provision of the Plan (including  Sections
8.3 and 8.4 hereof),  no Incentive  Option  which,  but for this Section 7.18 is
exercisable, shall be exercised within six (6) months from the Date of Grant.

                                    Article 8
            Amendment and Termination of the Plan; Dissolution of TRG

     8.1 Amendment of the Plan. The Compensation Committee, with the approval or
at the direction of the Partnership Committee,  may from time to time suspend or
discontinue the Plan or revise or amend the Plan in any respect  whatsoever.  In
addition, the Compensation  Committee,  with the approval or at the direction of
the  Partnership  Committee  and the Company,  may cause the Company to adopt an
incentive  option plan in  replacement  of the Plan whereby  options to purchase
shares of Common Stock of the Company are granted to  Employees.  In such event,
all  outstanding  Incentive  Options shall be adjusted to be consistent with the
terms and provisions of the Plan and the Continuing Offer, and in such manner as
the Compensation  Committee may deem equitable or as may be required pursuant to
applicable law;  provided,  however,  that except with the written consent of an
Optionee  or  as  otherwise  specifically  provided  herein  with  respect  to a
replacement  plan,  no amendment or suspension of the Plan shall alter or impair
any Incentive Option previously granted to such Optionee under the Plan.

     8.2 Termination of the Plan. The Compensation Committee,  with the approval
or at the direction of the Partnership Committee, shall have the right and power
to  terminate  the Plan at any time,  and no  Incentive  Option shall be granted
under the Plan after the termination of the Plan.  Except as otherwise  provided
in Section  8.3  hereof,  the  termination  of the Plan shall not have any other
effect,  and any Incentive Option  outstanding at the time of the termination of
the Plan may be exercised  after  termination  of the Plan, at any time prior to
the expiration date of such Incentive  Option and to the same extent and subject
to the same terms and  conditions,  as provided in Article 7 hereof,  that would
have applied to such Incentive Option if the Plan had not been terminated.

     8.3  Dissolution  of TRG. The  dissolution of TRG (provided that TRG is not
reconstituted as provided in the Partnership  Agreement) shall automatically and
without  further  action  cause  the  Plan to  terminate  and  each  outstanding
Incentive  Option which is not yet vested to vest  immediately  and fully.  Each
Optionee holding an outstanding  Incentive Option which is then, or by reason of
the dissolution of TRG has become, vested and exercisable, as


                                     - 13 -

<PAGE>



set forth in Article 7 hereof,  shall receive  written notice of the dissolution
of TRG and shall have fifteen (15) Days from the receipt of such written  notice
of dissolution  to exercise such  Optionee's  Incentive  Option(s) by delivering
written notice of such exercise as provided in Section 7.13 hereof and by paying
or causing to be paid to TRG the Exercise Price. Except as otherwise provided in
this Section 8.3, any  Incentive  Option  exercised  upon  dissolution  shall be
exercisable  only as provided under the Plan and shall continue to be subject to
all of the terms and conditions of the Plan.  The grant of any Incentive  Option
pursuant  to the Plan  shall not  affect in any way the right or power of TRG to
make changes to its business structure,  or to merge, dissolve, or terminate, or
to sell or transfer any or all of its assets.

     8.4 Termination of Management  Contract/Change  of Control Event.  Upon the
termination  of the Master  Services  Agreement  (as defined in the  Partnership
Agreement)  between TRG and the Manager,  for any reason, or upon the occurrence
of either of the following events (a "change of control"  event),  all Incentive
Options  previously granted under the Plan shall vest immediately and fully, but
shall  otherwise  be  exercisable  only as  provided  under  the Plan and  shall
continue  to be  subject  to all of the terms and  conditions  of the Plan.  For
purposes of this Section 8.4, a "change of control" event means:

               (a)  The   acquisition  of  beneficial   ownership  of  Units  of
     Partnership  Interest in TRG entitling the Person acquiring such beneficial
     ownership  to  appoint  a  majority  of  the  members  of  the  Partnership
     Committee,  if such  Person  was  not,  at the time of the  Initial  Public
     Offering,  a  Partner  of  TRG  (as  identified  in  the  Preamble  to  the
     Partnership Agreement); or

               (b) If, at such time as the Company  obtains the right to appoint
     a majority  of the  members of the  Partnership  Committee,  or at any time
     thereafter,  at least a  majority  of that  number of the  individuals  who
     constitute  the Board of Directors  are not, or cease for any reason to be,
     the same  individuals who  constituted  the Board of Directors  immediately
     after the  consummation  of the Initial  Public  Offering  (the  "Incumbent
     Board");  provided,  that any  individual  becoming  a  director  after the
     Initial  Public  Offering  whose election or nomination for election by the
     Company's shareholders was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the
     directors then  comprising the Incumbent  Board shall,  for the purposes of
     this clause (b), be considered as though such  individual  were a member of
     the Incumbent Board.

                                    Article 9
                   Compliance With Other Laws and Regulations

     9.1  Exemption  or  Qualification.  The Plan,  the grant  and  exercise  of
Incentive  Options under the Plan, and the obligation of TRG to sell and deliver
Units of Partnership  Interest under such Incentive  Options shall be subject to
all  applicable  federal  and state laws,  rules,  and  regulations  and to such
approvals by any government or regulatory  agency as may be required.  TRG shall
not be required to issue or deliver any Partnership  Interest  Certificates  for
Units of  Partnership  Interest  prior to such  time as there is an  appropriate
exemption available from the registration or qualification requirements for such
Units of  Partnership  Interest under any federal or state law, or any ruling or
regulation of any government body which TRG shall, in its discretion,  determine
to be  necessary  or  advisable.  Any  determination  by TRG and its  counsel in
connection  with any of the  matters  set  forth in this  Section  9.1  shall be
conclusive and binding on all Persons.

     9.2 Representation.  The Compensation Committee may require that any Person
who is granted an Incentive Option under the Plan represent and agree in writing
that if the Units of Partnership  Interest made subject to the Incentive  Option
are issuable under an exemption  from  registration  requirements,  the Units of
Partnership Interest will be "restricted" securities which may be resold only in
compliance  with the  applicable  securities  laws,  and  that  such  Person  is
acquiring the Units of Partnership Interest issued upon exercise of an Incentive
Option for investment and not with a view toward distribution.

                                   Article 10
                  Disposition of Units of Partnership Interest

     10.1 Limitations on Transfer.  An Optionee's rights and interests under the
Plan  may not be  assigned  or  transferred  other  than by will or the  laws of
descent  and  distribution,  and during the  lifetime of an  Optionee,  only the
Optionee personally (or the Optionee's personal representative) may exercise the
Optionee's  rights under the Plan.  An Optionee's  Beneficiary  may exercise the
Optionee's  rights to the extent they are  exercisable  under the Plan following
the death of the Optionee.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of the Plan to
the contrary,  an Optionee's  rights and interests  under the Plan shall vest in
the Company upon the Optionee's exercise of the Incentive Option,  acceptance of
the Continuing  Offer, and payment of the Exercise Price as described in Section
7.17 hereof.

     10.2 Partnership Interest Certificates. Units of Partnership Interest shall
be represented by a certificate of TRG (a "Partnership  Interest  Certificate").
Each Partnership Interest Certificate shall bear the following legend:

               The  Unit(s)  of   Partnership   Interest   represented  by  this
               certificate  is  (are)  subject  to  and  transferable   only  in
               compliance  with the Amended and  Restated  Agreement  of Limited
               Partnership of The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership,  as
               the same may be  amended  and/or  supplemented  from time to time
               (the "Partnership Agreement"),  a copy of which is on file at the
               office of The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited  Partnership.  Any
               assignment,  sale,  transfer,  conveyance,   mortgage,  or  other
               encumbrance,  pledge,  granting  of an Option or proxy,  or other
               disposition   or  act  of   alienation,   whether   voluntary  or
               involuntary,  or by  operation  of law,  in  respect of a Unit of
               Partnership   Interest  made  other  than  as  permitted  in  the
               Partnership Agreement shall be null and void and have no force or
               effect whatsoever.

     In  addition,   Partnership  Interest  Certificates   evidencing  Units  of
Partnership  Interest  acquired  under  the  Plan  pursuant  to an  unregistered
transaction  shall  bear  the  following   restrictive  legend  and  such  other
restrictive  legends as are required or deemed advisable under the provisions of
any applicable law:


               The sale of the Unit(s) of  Partnership  Interest  represented by
               this certificate has not been registered under the


                                     - 15 -

<PAGE>



               Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act").  Any transfer of such Unit(s)
               of  Partnership  Interest will be invalid  unless a  registration
               statement under the Act is in effect as to such transfer,  or, in
               the opinion of counsel for the Partnership,  such registration is
               unnecessary in order for such transfer to comply with the Act.

Any  determination  by TRG and its counsel in connection with any of the matters
set forth in this Section 10.2 shall be conclusive and binding on all persons.

                                   Article 11
                               General Provisions

     11.1 No Right to  Continued  Employment.  No Employee  or any other  Person
shall have any claim or right to be granted an Incentive  Option under the Plan.
Neither the adoption and  maintenance  of the Plan nor the granting of Incentive
Options  pursuant  to the Plan  shall be  deemed to  constitute  a  contract  of
employment between the Manager or TRG or the Company and any Employee or to be a
condition of the  employment of any Person.  The Plan and any  Incentive  Option
granted under the Plan shall not confer upon any Optionee any right with respect
to  continued  employment  by the  Manager or a Manager  Entity,  nor shall they
interfere  in any way with the  right of the  Manager  or a  Manager  Entity  to
terminate the employment of any Optionee at any time,  and for any reason,  with
or without cause, it being acknowledged,  unless expressly provided otherwise in
writing, that the employment of any Optionee is "at will."

     11.2 Dealings with  Beneficiaries or  Representatives  of an Optionee.  The
Compensation  Committee may require such proper proof of death and such evidence
of the right of any Person  other than an  Optionee to  exercise  any  Incentive
Option granted under the Plan, as the Compensation  Committee deems necessary or
advisable. The Compensation Committee's determination of death or Disability and
of the right of any Person  other than an  Optionee  to  exercise  an  Incentive
Option shall be conclusive.  The Compensation Committee, in its discretion,  may
require from any Person, other than an Optionee, exercising any Incentive Option
under the Plan, such security and indemnity as the  Compensation  Committee,  in
its discretion,  deems necessary or advisable. The issuance of and acceptance of
any Units of Partnership  Interest  and/or of cash (pursuant to Section 7.14) or
the issuance  and  acceptance  of Common Stock  pursuant to Section 7.17 hereof,
shall constitute a complete  acquittance and discharge of full liability of TRG,
the  Manager,  each  Manager  Entity,  and the Company  under the Plan,  and the
Compensation  Committee shall be entitled to demand a receipt and/or acquittance
in full  satisfaction  of all claims  against  TRG,  the  Manager,  each Manager
Entity, and the Company.

     11.3 Application of Funds.  The proceeds  received by TRG from the exercise
of any Incentive  Option to acquire a Unit of Partnership  Interest in TRG shall
be used for general partnership purposes of TRG.

     11.4  Inspection of Records.  Copies of the Plan,  records  reflecting each
Optionee's  Incentive  Option(s),  and any other  documents  and records that an
Optionee  is  entitled  by law to  inspect  shall be open to  inspection  by the
Optionee and his duly authorized  representative(s)  at the office of TRG at any
reasonable business hour.

     11.5 Word Meanings.  The words such as "herein,"  "hereinafter,"  "hereof,"
and "hereunder" refer to this Plan as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in
which such words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

     11.6 Section Titles.  Section titles are for descriptive  purposes only and
shall not control or alter the meaning of the Plan as set forth in the text.

     11.7 Severability.  Whenever possible, each provision in the Plan and every
Incentive Option at any time granted under the Plan shall be interpreted in such
a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision
of the Plan or any Incentive  Option at any time granted under the Plan shall be
held to be prohibited or invalid under  applicable law, then, (i) such provision
shall be deemed  amended  to  accomplish  the  objectives  of the  provision  as
originally  written to the fullest  extent  permitted by law, and (ii) all other
provisions  of the Plan and every  other  Incentive  Option at any time  granted
under the Plan shall remain in full force and effect.

     11.8  Compliance  with  Securities  Exchange  Act.  With respect to persons
subject to Section 16 of the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"),
transactions  under  this  Plan are  intended  to  comply  with  all  applicable
conditions of Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the 1934 Act. To the extent any
provision of the Plan or action by the plan  administrators  fails to so comply,
it shall be deemed  null and void,  to the  extent  permitted  by law and deemed
advisable by the plan administrators.

     11.9 Strict  Construction.  No rule of strict construction shall be implied
against TRG, the Partnership Committee, the Compensation Committee, or any other
Person in the  interpretation  of any of the terms of the  Plan,  any  Incentive
Option  granted  under  the Plan or any  rule or  procedure  established  by the
Compensation Committee.

     11.10 Choice of Law. All determinations  made and actions taken pursuant to
the Plan shall be governed  by the  internal  laws of the State of Michigan  and
construed in accordance therewith.

     11.11  Execution.  To record  the  adoption  of the Plan,  as  amended  and
restated,  TRG has caused the execution  hereof  effective as of the 30th day of
September, 1997.

               (d) Purchaser  shall have the right to conduct,  at its sole cost
and expense, any inspections,  studies or tests that Purchaser deems appropriate

               (e) Purchaser agrees and covenants with Seller not to disclose to
any  third  party  (other  than  lenders,   accountants,   attorneys  and  other
professionals  and consultants in connection  with the transaction  contemplated
herein)  prior  to  Closing  without  Seller's  prior  written  consent,  unless
Purchaser is obligated by New York Stock  Exchanges  rules or  regulations or by
law to make such  disclosure,  any of the reports or any other  documentation or
information obtained by Purchaser which relates to the Property or Seller in any
way, all of which shall be used by Purchaser and its agents solely in connection
with the transaction  contemplated  hereby.  In the event that this Agreement is
terminated, this subsection 3.2(e) shall survive termination.

               (f) Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller and its
partners, trustees, beneficiaries, shareholders, members, managers, advisors and
other  agents  and  their   respective   employees,   officers,   directors  and
shareholders (the "Indemnified  Parties")  harmless from and against any and all
claims,  losses,  damages,  costs and expense  (including,  without  limitation,
reasonable  attorneys'  fees and court costs) suffered or incurred by any of the
Indemnified  Parties  as a result  of any  activities  of  Purchaser  (including
activities of any of Purchaser's  employees,  consultants,  contractors or other
agents)  relating to the Property,  including,  without  limitation,  mechanics'
liens, damage to the Property, injury to persons or property resulting from such
activities,  and in the event that the  Property is  disturbed or altered in any
way as a  result  of such  activities,  Purchaser  shall  promptly  restore  the
Property to its condition  existing prior to the commencement of such activities
which disturb or alter the Property.  The foregoing  indemnity  does not include
any claims, losses, damages, costs and expenses (including,  without limitation,

information on or a condition at the Property. Furthermore,  Purchaser agrees to
maintain and have in effect  workers'  compensation  insurance,  with  statutory
limits of coverage, and commercial general liability insurance with (i) all risk
coverage,  (ii)  waiver of  subrogation,  and (iii)  limits of not less than One

insurance   effectuating   the  insurance   required   hereunder  prior  to  the
commencement  of such  activities  which  certificate  shall  provide  that such
insurance shall not be terminated or modified without at least thirty (30) days'
prior written notice to Seller.

               (g) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it shall have no right
to  review  or  inspect  any  of  the   following:   (i)   internal   memoranda,

               (h) Sections 3.2(e) and 3.2(f) and such other  provisions in this
Agreement which expressly survive Closing or termination of this Agreement shall
survive  Closing  or  any  termination  of  this  Agreement  (collectively,  the
"Surviving Obligations").

      3.3 Title and Survey.  Seller  shall,  at Seller's  sole cost and expense,
obtain and  deliver to  Purchaser  for  Purchaser's  review a  commitment  for a
standard  owner's policy of title insurance along with a copy of each instrument
listed as an exception  thereon other than Seller's debt instruments (the "Title
Commitment")  on the Real  Property  issued by the  Title  Company.  Seller  has
delivered  to  Purchaser a copy of the Existing  Survey  which  Purchaser  shall
reimburse  Seller for as provided in Section 4 hereof.  During the Due Diligence
Period,  Seller  shall obtain from the Title  Company at Seller's  sole cost and
expense a survey  endorsement and, if and to the extent  available,  contiguity,
fairway and PUD  endorsements.  Purchaser  may elect to receive an update to the
Existing Survey (the "Updated  Survey") by notifying  Seller of such election in
writing  prior to November 6, 1997.  If Purchaser so elects,  Seller  shall,  at
Purchaser's  sole  cost  and  expense,  obtain  and  deliver  to  Purchaser  for
Purchaser's  review the Updated Survey.  Purchaser shall have until the later of
November 6, 1997 and the date which is fifteen  days after  receipt of the Title
Commitment and Existing Survey (such date being referred to as the "Title Review
Date") for examination of Title Commitment and Existing Survey and the making of
any objections  thereto,  said objections to be made in writing and delivered to
Seller on or before the end of the Title Review Date. If Purchaser shall fail to
make any  objections  on or before the Title  Review  Date,  Purchaser  shall be
deemed to have accepted all exceptions to the Title Commitment shown on Schedule
B, Section II,


                                       -8-

<PAGE>



except for  exceptions 1, 2, 3 and 4, and the form and substance of the Existing
Survey and all matters shown thereon;  all such  exceptions and matters shall be
included  in the  term  "Permitted  Exceptions"  as used  herein.  In the  event
Purchaser elects to receive the Updated Survey,  then Purchaser shall have until
the Title Review Date for  examination  of the Updated  Survey and the making of
objections to matters shown thereon,  such  objections to be made in writing and
delivered to Seller on or before the  expiration  of the Title  Review Date.  If
Purchaser  shall fail to make any such  objections  to the Updated  Survey on or
before  such  date,  Purchaser  shall be  deemed to have  accepted  the form and
substance  of the  Updated  Survey  and all  matters  shown  thereon;  all  such
exceptions  and  matters  shall be  included  as  Permitted  Exceptions.  If any
objections to (i) the Title Commitment or Existing Survey or exceptions to title
are made within the Title  Review  Period,  or (ii) the Updated  Survey are made
before the date specified  above,  then Seller shall have the right, but not the
obligation  except as hereafter  provided,  to cure (by removal,  endorsement or
otherwise) such objections on or before the Closing Date in a manner  reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser. If the objections are not cured by Seller no later than
five (5) days before the scheduled  Closing Date, then Purchaser may as its only
option, elect to either: (i) waive such objection and consummate the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) terminate this Agreement, in which event
the Earnest  Money shall be returned to Purchaser  and neither  party shall have
any further obligations to the other party except for the Surviving Obligations.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained in this  Agreement,  Seller
shall be obligated to remove (or cause the Title Company to affirmatively insure
over in a manner  reasonably  acceptable to  Purchaser)  (i) any deeds of trust,
mortgages, and related loan documents securing any financing obtained by Seller,
including,  without  limitation,  the existing loan with Continental  Bank, N.A.
(the "Existing  Loan"),  (ii) any mechanic's or materialmen's  liens relating to
work done by or on behalf of Seller and (iii) any tax or judgment  liens against
Seller. Seller agrees to use best efforts to satisfy all of the requirements set
forth in  Schedule B - Section 1 of the  Commitment  at or prior to the  Closing
Date.

      3.4 Estoppels.  Seller shall deliver to Purchaser,  no later than five (5)
days  prior  to  the  Closing  Date,  (i)  estoppel  certificates  in  substance
reasonably  satisfactory to Purchaser,  in the form of Exhibit C attached hereto
or in the form of estoppel required under such tenant's lease, from in-line mall

lease,  and (iv) estoppel  certificate in substance  reasonably  satisfactory to
Purchaser  from United  Artists  TGI Fridays and Los Ranchos in a form  required
under their leases;  provided that, with respect to Seller's delivery of the TGI
Fridays and Los Ranchos  estoppels,  notwithstanding  anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary,  it shall not be a condition  precedent to Purchasers
obligations  under this  Agreement  unless  Purchaser  has granted all approvals
required in connection with the TGI Fridays and Los Ranchos leases.

      3.5  Purchaser's   Partnership  Committee  Approval.  The  obligations  of
Purchaser under this Agreement are contingent upon obtaining the approval of its
partnership committee ("Committee  Approval").  Not later than November 6, 1997,
Purchaser shall deliver to Seller written notice of Purchaser's  receipt of such
approval or lack thereof.  If no such notice is received by Seller by such date,
then  Purchaser  shall be deemed to have not  obtained  such  approval  and this
Agreement  shall  automatically  terminate,  and thereupon all Earnest Money, if
any,  shall be refunded to  Purchaser  and neither  party shall have any further
rights or obligations hereunder, except for the Surviving Obligations.

<PAGE>



be made by Seller and the cost of all construction or tenant improvement work to
be done by Seller under all of the Leases and those  proposed  leases  listed on
Schedule 6 (whether or not such leases have been  entered into as of the Closing
Date),  except to the extent set forth (x) specifically listed on Schedule 4; or
(y) in the  Proposals  approved by Purchaser or deemed  approved by Purchaser as
provided in subsection 15(b) hereof.

      5.2 All rents and Tenant  Contributions and other income from the Property
for the month of Closing  shall be prorated  between  Purchaser and Seller based
upon their  respective  days of  ownership  for such month in which the  Closing

payments of rental obligations due but not paid as of the Proration Date. At the
time  of  the  final   calculation   and  collection   from  tenants  of  Tenant
Contributions  for 1997,  whether in the nature of a  reconciliation  payment or
full payment,  in arrears,  there shall be a reproration  between  Purchaser and
Seller as to the Tenant Contributions. Such reproration shall not be made on the
basis of a per diem  method of  allocation,  but shall  instead  be  apportioned
between  Seller  and  Purchaser  on the  basis of the  relative  share of actual
expenses in question  incurred and paid by Seller and Purchaser during the lease
year in question.  Seller  covenants to provide  Purchaser with any  information
necessary to finalize such calculation.  Purchaser covenants to bill tenants for
amounts due from tenants attributable to periods prior to closing and diligently
pursue  collections from tenants and, as collected,  to timely deliver to Seller
reproration amounts due Seller.

      5.3  Percentage  rent shall be prorated  between  Purchaser  and Seller by
utilizing the percentage  rent payable for such lease year based upon the actual
days of ownership of the Property  during such tenant's lease year.  There shall
be no adjustment  for  percentage  rent  payments for a particular  tenant until
after the receipt of any percentage rent payments made by such tenant.

      5.4 Any amounts  received from tenants after Closing shall be applied on a
tenant by tenant  basis in the  following  order:  (i) first on  account  of any
amount currently due Purchaser from such tenant(s); (ii) next, on account of any
amount due Seller from such  tenant(s)  for the period up to and  including  the
Proration  Date and (iii)  finally,  any balance then  remaining  to  Purchaser.
Seller  retains  the  right to sue  tenants  after  Closing  for any  delinquent
payments or other  amounts  owed to Seller,  except for  actions or  proceedings
affecting a tenant's  rights of possession or landlord  liens.  However,  Seller
will not exercise any such rights or remedies unless such delinquent  rents have
not been  collected by Purchaser  and paid to Seller within six (6) months after
the Closing Date.

      5.5 Operating expenses, including, without limitation,  permits, licenses,
membership  dues,  and any other  prepaid  expenses,  shall be prorated  between

respective ownership of the Property utilizing the actual expenses or reasonable
estimates, subject to reproration when the actual amounts are known.

      5.6 Real estate taxes shall be prorated between Seller and Purchaser based
upon the actual days of ownership  of the parties for the year in which  Closing
occurs utilizing the most recent ascertainable tax bill(s). Seller and Purchaser
agree to reprorate said real estate taxes upon Purchaser's receipt of the actual
tax bill for the tax year in question, if any. Seller reserves the right to meet
with  governmental  officials  and to  contest  any  reassessment  governing  or
affecting  Seller's  obligations  under this  Section,  with  Purchaser's  prior
written approval,  which will not be unreasonably withheld.  Seller shall retain
all rights with respect to any refund of taxes applicable to any period prior to
the Closing Date, subject to the rights of tenants.

      5.7 Except for utilities  billed  directly to Tenants,  utilities shall be
prorated  as of the  Proration  Date based upon  either  meter  readings  on the
Proration  Date or the prior month's actual  invoices.  Seller shall be credited
with any  unapplied  utility  deposit  in effect as of the  Closing  Date to the
extent such deposit is assignable and actually paid to Purchaser.

      5.8 Purchaser shall be responsible for and pay for all costs in connection
with (i)  Proposals  listed on  Schedule 4 attached  hereto,  to the extent such
amounts are  identified  on Schedule 4, and (ii) any  Proposal  which  Purchaser
approved,  or is deemed to have  approved as provided in Section 15(b) herein to
the extent such  amounts are  identified  in such  Proposals;  provided  that no
commissions shall be paid to HCMC or any of its affiliates.

      5.9 All insurance  policies and property  management  agreements  shall be
terminated  as of the Closing Date and there shall be no proration  with respect
to these items.

      5.10 Purchaser shall be credited with the contractor's  security  deposits
listed on Schedule 1 to the General Assignment attached as Exhibit I.

In the event any prorations or computations made under this Section are based on
estimates  or prove to be  incorrect,  then either party shall be entitled to an
adjustment to correct the same,  provided  that it makes  written  demand on the
party from whom it is entitled to such adjustment  within one hundred and twenty
days after the end of the current  calendar  year or, in the case of  percentage
rent adjustments, from the


                                      -16-

end of the  applicable  lease year.  Purchaser  shall  indemnify and hold Seller

of this Agreement.

14.   Fire or Other Casualty; Condemnation.

      14.1 If the  Property  or any part  thereof  is  damaged  by fire or other
casualty  prior to the  Closing  Date which  would cost in excess of One Hundred
Thousand and  no/100's  Dollars  ($100,000.00)  to repair (as  determined  by an
insurance  adjuster  selected by the  insurance  carriers),  or which may have a
material affect on the income generated by the Property and which is not covered
by rental loss  insurance.  Purchaser  may terminate  this  Agreement by written
notice  to  Seller  given on or  before  the  earlier  of (i)  twenty  (20) days
following  such  casualty  or  (ii)  the  Closing  Date.  In the  event  of such
termination,  this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect and, except
for the Surviving  Obligations,  neither party shall thereafter have any further
obligation  under this  Agreement,  and Seller shall direct the Title Company to
promptly  return all Earnest Money to Purchaser.  If Purchaser does not elect to
terminate this Agreement or the cost of repair is determined by said adjuster to
be less than One  Hundred  Thousand  and  no/100's  Dollars  ($100,000.00),  the
Closing shall take place as herein  provided  without  abatement of the Purchase
Price,  and Seller shall  assign and transfer to Purchaser on the Closing  Date,
without warranty or recourse,  all of Seller's right,  title and interest to the
balance of insurance  proceeds paid or payable to Seller on account of such fire
or casualty remaining after  reimbursement to Seller for the total amount of all
costs and expenses incurred by Seller in connection  therewith including but not
limited to making  emergency  repairs,  securing the Property and complying with
applicable governmental  requirements.  Seller shall pay to Purchaser the amount
of the deductible of any of Seller's applicable insurance policies.

      14.2 If any material  portion of the  Property is taken in eminent  domain
proceedings  (or is the  subject  of a pending or  threatened  taking or eminent
domain  proceeding) prior to Closing,  Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by
notice to Seller  given on or before the  earlier of (i) twenty  (20) days after
such taking or pending or threatened  taking or (ii) the Closing  Date,  and, in
the event of such


                                      -25-

<PAGE>



termination,  this Agreement shall be of no further force and effect and, except
for the Surviving  Obligations,  neither party shall thereafter have any further
obligation  under this  Agreement,  and Seller shall direct the Title Company to
promptly  return all Earnest Money to Purchaser.  If Purchaser does not so elect
to terminate or if the taking is not material, then the Closing shall take place
as herein provided  without  abatement of the Purchase  Price,  and Seller shall
deliver  or assign  to  Purchaser  on the  Closing  Date,  without  warranty  or
recourse,  all of Seller's right,  title and interest in and to all condemnation
awards paid or payable to Seller.  For purposes hereof, a "material  portion" of

at the Property such that the Property would be rendered in  noncompliance  with
law or the provisions of any of the Leases  covering  required number of parking
spaces,  (iii) any gross  leasable area of the Property,  (iv) if any tenant has
the right to terminate its Lease as a result of such action,  or (v) any portion
of the common area or the portion of the Property which may adversely affect the
operations of the Property or the expansion or development thereof.

Purchaser that:

      (a) after the date hereof  through  the  Closing,  Seller will  (except as
specifically provided to the contrary herein):

            (ii) Refrain from entering into or amending any contracts,  or other

      usual  course of  business  and which are  cancelable  by the owner of the
      Property  without  penalty  within  thirty (30) days after  giving  notice
      thereof);

            (iii)  Continue to operate,  maintain,  and repair the Property in a
      manner  consistent with Seller's current  practices and not enter into any

      unreasonably delayed, withheld or denied;

            (iv)  Fully  comply  with the  terms  of the  Leases  and  Permitted

            (vii)  Not  remove  any of  the  Personal  Property  from  the  Real
      Property,  except  for items  that are  replaced  with an item of  equally
      suitable value, free and clear of any lien or claim;

            (viii) Seller shall immediately notify Purchaser of any pending,  or
      any written threat of, litigation,  arbitration or administrative  hearing
      affecting  the Property and not covered by  insurance  promptly  following
      receipt of notice thereof by Seller; and

            (ix) Seller shall continue to maintain or cause to be maintained its
      books and records in accordance with its past practices.

      (b) after the date  hereof,  Seller will  refrain  from (i)  amending  any
Leases of any portion of the Property,  (ii)  canceling  any of such Leases,  or
(iii)  executing any new leases  without the prior written  consent of Purchaser
(which consent prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence  Period shall not be
unreasonably  withheld and thereafter  may be withheld in  Purchaser's  sole and
absolute discretion). As used herein, "Proposal" shall mean a description of the
economic and business  terms of any proposed  lease or amendment  along with any

business  days of  receipt.  Seller  shall have the right to  execute  the lease
documents constituting a Proposal approved or deemed approved by Purchaser.

      The provisions of this Section 15 shall survive Closing or any termination
of this Agreement.

16. Assignment. Purchaser shall not assign this Agreement without Seller's prior
written consent. Such consent may be withheld for any reason or no reason


                                      -27-

<PAGE>



except in the case of an assignment to an affiliate of Purchaser. Subject to the
previous sentence, this Agreement shall apply to, inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon and  enforceable  against the parties  hereto and their  respective
successors  and assigns.  Purchaser  shall have the right to assign and transfer
its rights under this Agreement to any entity in which Purchaser owns at least a
50% equity or ownership interest provided that Purchaser delivers to Seller: (i)
a duly  executed  express  assumption  of all of the duties and  obligations  of
Purchaser by the proposed assignee,  and (ii) an ERISA certificate,  in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit D.

17.   Remedies.

      (a) IN THE EVENT THAT SELLER SHALL FAIL TO CONSUMMATE  THIS  AGREEMENT AND
SUCH FAILURE IS NOT A RESULT OF  PURCHASER'S  DEFAULT OR A  TERMINATION  OF THIS
AGREEMENT  BY  PURCHASER  OR  SELLER  PURSUANT  TO A RIGHT  TO DO SO  UNDER  THE
PROVISIONS  HEREOF,  PURCHASER,  IN THE CASE WHERE SUCH  FAILURE IS BASED UPON A
VOLUNTARY  ACTION BY SELLER,  SHALL ONLY BE  ENTITLED  TO SEEK AT ITS  ELECTION,
EITHER: (i) THE REMEDY OF SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, OR (ii) DAMAGES IN AN AMOUNT NOT
TO EXCEED THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNEST MONEY FOR ANY AND ALL OF  PURCHASER'S  CLAIM
FOR DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT (IN ADDITION TO A REFUND OF THE EARNEST MONEY).
IN NO EVENT SHALL SELLER BE LIABLE TO PURCHASER FOR ANY PUNITIVE, SPECULATIVE OR
CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES.  IN THE CASE WHERE SUCH  FAILURE IS BASED UPON AN ACTION
OTHER THAN A VOLUNTARY  ACTION BY SELLER,  PURCHASER,  AS ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY,  MAY TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND RECEIVE A REFUND OF THE EARNEST MONEY.
IN NO EVENT  SHALL  PURCHASER  BE  ENTITLED TO RECORD A LIS PENDENS OR NOTICE OF
PENDENCY  OF ACTION  AGAINST  THE  PROPERTY  FOR ANY REASON  WHATSOEVER,  UNLESS
PURCHASER IS SEEKING SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. A VOLUNTARY ACTION HEREUNDER SHALL BE
DEEMED TO BE (i) AN AFFIRMATIVE  ACTION OF SELLER, OR (ii) AN OMISSION BY SELLER
WHERE SELLER HAD A DUTY TO TAKE SUCH ACTION.

      (b) IN THE EVENT THAT PURCHASER  SHOULD FAIL TO CONSUMMATE  THIS AGREEMENT
FOR ANY REASON,  EXCEPT SELLER'S DEFAULT OR THE TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT BY
PURCHASER  PURSUANT TO A RIGHT TO DO SO UNDER THE TERMS AND  PROVISIONS  HEREOF,
THEN SELLER,  AS ITS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE  REMEDY MAY TERMINATE  THIS AGREEMENT BY
NOTIFYING  PURCHASER  THEREOF  AND  RECEIVE  OR  RETAIN  THE  EARNEST  MONEY  AS
LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, PROVIDED THAT THIS PROVISION SHALL NOT LIMIT SELLER'S RIGHTS

                                      -28-

<PAGE>



RECEIVE  REIMBURSEMENT  FOR  ATTORNEYS  FEES  RESULTING  FROM SUCH BREACH AND TO
PURSUE AND RECOVER ON A CLAIM WITH  RESPECT TO ANY  SURVIVING  OBLIGATIONS.  THE
PARTIES  AGREE THAT  SELLER  WILL  SUFFER  DAMAGES  IN THE EVENT OF  PURCHASER'S
DEFAULT ON ITS OBLIGATIONS.  ALTHOUGH THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DAMAGES IS DIFFICULT OR
IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE,  THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE EARNEST MONEY
IS A REASONABLE  ESTIMATE OF SELLER'S LOSS IN THE EVENT OF PURCHASER'S  DEFAULT.
THUS, SELLER SHALL ACCEPT AND RETAIN THE EARNEST MONEY AS LIQUIDATED DAMAGES BUT
NOT AS A PENALTY.  EXCEPT AS  OTHERWISE  SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION  17(b),  SUCH
LIQUIDATED  DAMAGES SHALL CONSTITUTE  SELLER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. IN THE
EVENT SELLER IS ENTITLED TO THE EARNEST MONEY AS  LIQUIDATED  DAMAGES AND TO THE
EXTENT  SELLER HAS NOT ALREADY  RECEIVED THE EARNEST  MONEY,  THE EARNEST  MONEY
SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY  PAID TO SELLER BY THE TITLE COMPANY,  AND PURCHASER AGREES
TO TAKE ALL SUCH ACTIONS AND EXECUTE AND DELIVER ALL SUCH DOCUMENTS NECESSARY OR
APPROPRIATE TO EFFECT SUCH PAYMENT.

      SELLER AND PURCHASER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY HAVE READ
AND UNDERSTAND THE PROVISIONS OF THE FOREGOING LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES PROVISION AND BY THEIR SIGNATURES IMMEDIATELY BELOW
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS.

documents  made in  connection  with the  transfer of the  Property and shall be
deemed waived unless  Purchaser  has given Seller  written  notice of such claim
prior to the date which is one (1) year after the Closing  Date.  For the period
of this indemnity  Seller agrees to place in escrow the Two Million Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars and no/100s ($2,500,000.00). The agreement governing the rights
of the parties  under such escrow shall be in a form  reasonably  acceptable  to
Purchaser and Seller.  The provisions of this Section 18.1 shall survive Closing
or any termination of this Agreement.

      18.2  Purchaser's  Indemnification  of Seller.  Purchaser hereby agrees to
indemnify,  defend,  and hold  Seller  harmless  from  and  against  all  costs,
expenses,  liabilities,  demands, claims, and damages (and any loss of expenses,
including,  without limitation,  interest,  penalties and reasonable  attorneys'
fees and  disbursements,  asserted  against,  resulting  to,  imposed  upon,  or
incurred  by Seller as a result  thereof)  by  reason of or  resulting  from all
third-party  claims  relating to the Property that arise,  take place,  occur or
accrue after the Closing Date, including,  without limitation, under the Leases.
The  indemnity  set forth in this  Section 18.2 shall be limited to an aggregate
amount not to exceed Two Million  Five Hundred  Thousand  and  no/100's  Dollars
($2,500,000.00)  and shall be deemed waived  unless  Seller has given  Purchaser
written  notice of such claim  prior to the date which is one (1) year after the
Closing Date. The  provisions of this Section 18.2 shall survive  Closing or any
termination of this Agreement.

19.  Miscellaneous.  The provisions of this Section 19 shall survive  Closing or
any termination of this Agreement.

      19.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the exhibits attached
hereto,  constitute  the entire  agreement of the parties  hereto  regarding the

the event of a conflict

of this Agreement shall prevail.  This Agreement may only be amended or modified
by an instrument in writing, signed by the party intended to be bound thereby.

      19.2 Time.  All parties  hereto  agree that time is of the essence in this
transaction.  If the time for performance of any obligation hereunder shall fall
on a  Saturday,  Sunday or holiday  (national,  in the State of  Illinois or the
state in which the Property is located) such that the  transaction  contemplated
hereby can not be performed,  the time for performance  shall be extended to the
next such succeeding day where performance is possible.

counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original.

      19.5  Publicity.  Seller and Purchaser  hereby covenant and agree that, at
all times after the date of execution  hereof and continuing  until the Closing,
unless  consented  to in writing by the other party,  no press  release or other
public  disclosure  concerning  this  transaction  shall be made, and each party
agrees to use  reasonable  efforts to prevent  disclosure  of this  transaction.
Seller shall have the right to approve of Purchaser's  first press release after
Closing  describing this  transaction,  which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed except with respect to information regarding the identity of
the constituent  partners of Seller which Seller may deny release of in its sole
and absolute discretion.  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing,  Purchaser shall
have the right to issue a press  release  with  respect to this  transaction  if
required  by (i) rules and  regulations  of the New York  Stock  Exchange,  (ii)
applicable  law  (including,  without  limitation,  the  Securities and Exchange
Commission),  and (iii) if Purchaser  believes  such release is  reasonable  and
necessary based upon shareholder relations,  analyst requests or other bona fide
business reasons except for purposes of clause (iii) with respect to information
regarding  the identity of the  constituent  partners of Seller which  Purchaser
agrees not to disclose.

      19.6 Recordation.  Except as is permitted by Section 17 hereof,  Purchaser
shall not record this  Agreement or a memorandum or other notice  thereof in any
public  office  without  the  express  written  consent of  Seller.  A breach by
Purchaser of this  covenant  shall  constitute  a material  default by Purchaser

      19.7 Benefit.  This  Agreement is for the benefit of Purchaser and Seller,
and except as provided in the indemnity granted by Purchaser under Paragraph 3.2
with  respect to the  Indemnified  Parties  listed  therein,  no other person or
entity will be entitled to rely on this  Agreement,  receive any benefit from it
or enforce any provisions of it against Purchaser or Seller.

      19.8 Section  Headings.  The Section headings  contained in this Agreement
are for  convenience  only and  shall in no way  enlarge  or limit  the scope or
meaning of the various and several Sections hereof.

documents  and  instruments  reasonably  required  in  order to  consummate  the
purchase and sale herein contemplated.

      19.10  Severability.  If any  portion  of  this  Agreement  is  held to be
unenforceable  by a court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  the  remainder  of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

      19.11 Waiver of Trial by Jury.  Seller and  Purchaser,  to the extent they
may  legally  do so,  hereby  expressly  waive any right to trial by jury of any

incidental to, the dealings of the parties hereto with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions related hereto or thereto, in each case whether now existing
or hereafter arising, and irrespective of whether sounding in contract, tort, or
otherwise.  To the extent they may legally do so,  Seller and  Purchaser  hereby
agree that any such claim, demand,  action, cause of action, or proceeding shall
be decided by a court trial without a jury and that any party hereto may file an
original  counterpart  or a copy of this  Section  with  any  court  as  written
evidence of the consent of the other party or parties hereto to waiver of its or
their right to trial by jury.

      19.12 Independent Counsel. Purchaser and Seller each acknowledge that: (a)
they have been  represented  by  independent  counsel  in  connection  with this
Agreement;  (b) they  have  executed  this  Agreement  with the  advice  of such
counsel;  and (c) this  Agreement  is the  result of  negotiations  between  the
parties hereto and the advice and assistance of their  respective  counsel.  The
fact that  this  Agreement  was  prepared  by  Seller's  counsel  as a matter of
convenience  shall have no import or significance.  Any uncertainty or ambiguity
in this Agreement shall not be construed against Seller because Seller's counsel
prepared this Agreement in its final form.

      19.13 Governmental Approvals.  Nothing contained  in this Agreement  shall
be construed as authorizing Purchaser to apply for a zoning change, variance,


                                      -32-

<PAGE>



subdivision maps, lot line adjustment, or other discretionary  governmental act,
approval  or permit  with  respect to the  Property  prior to the  Closing,  and
Purchaser  agrees not to do so.  Purchaser  agrees  not to submit  any  reports,
studies  or  other  documents,   including,   without   limitation,   plans  and
specifications,  impact  statements  for water,  sewage,  drainage  or  traffic,
environmental   review  forms,   or  energy   conservation   checklists  to  any
governmental agency, or any amendment or modification to any such instruments or
documents  prior to the Closing,  except as may be required by law.  Purchaser's
obligation to purchase the Property shall not be subject to or conditioned  upon
Purchaser's  obtaining any variances,  zoning amendments,  subdivision maps, lot
line adjustment or other discretionary governmental act, approval or permit.

      19.14 No Waiver.  No covenant,  term or condition of this Agreement  other

Purchaser, as the case may be.

      19.15 Discharge and Survival.  The delivery of the Deed by Seller, and the
acceptance  thereof by Purchaser shall be deemed to be the full  performance and
discharge of every covenant and obligation on the part of Seller to be performed
hereunder except the Surviving  Obligations.  No action shall be commenced after
the Closing on any covenant or obligation except the Surviving Obligations.

20. Exculpation of Seller and Related Parties.  Notwithstanding  anything to the
contrary  contained in this Agreement or in any exhibits  attached  hereto or in
any documents  executed in connection  herewith  (collectively,  including  this
Agreement, said exhibits and any such document, the "Purchase Documents"), it is
expressly  understood and agreed by and between the parties hereto that: (i) the
recourse of Purchaser or its  successors or assigns  against Seller with respect
to the  alleged  breach  by or on the  part  of  Seller  of any  representation,
warranty, covenant, undertaking,  indemnity or agreement contained in any of the

and THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited partnership
("Purchaser"),  having an address of c/o The Taubman Company, 200 East Long Lake
Road, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan 48304, is based upon the following:
      A. Seller and Purchaser  entered into a certain  Agreement of Purchase and
Sale,  dated  November  5,  1997,  as amended by a certain  First  Amendment  to
Agreement  of  Purchase  and Sale,  dated  November 6, 1997  (collectively,  the

agreements and subject to the terms and conditions contained herein, the parties
hereto hereby agree as follows:
      1.  Purchaser  hereby  agrees that it has  completed its Due Diligence and

      3. Section  2.2(a) of the Purchase  Agreement is hereby amended to provide
that the  Earnest  Money will be  deposited  with the Title  Company,  as escrow
agent, within one (1) business day after Purchaser's receipt of a fully-executed
counterpart of this Amendment.
      4. Purchaser and Seller shall  determine on November 14, 1997,  whether it

November  18,  1997,  then such party shall have the right to extend the Closing
Date until a date not later than December 4, 1997.
      5.  Seller and  Purchaser  acknowledge  that  certain,  relatively  minor,
