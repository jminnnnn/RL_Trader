Item 1. BUSINESS

The Company

     Taubman Centers, Inc. (the "Company" or "TCO") was incorporated in Michigan
in 1973 and had its initial public offering  ("IPO") in 1992. Upon completion of
the IPO, the Company became the managing  general  partner of The Taubman Realty
Group Limited  Partnership (the "Operating  Partnership" or "TRG").  The Company
has a 63% partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership,  through which the
Company conducts all its operations.  The Company owns, develops,  acquires, and
operates  regional  shopping  centers  ("Centers")  and interests  therein.  The
Company's  portfolio,  as of December 31,  1999,  includes 17 urban and suburban
Centers located in seven states.  Four additional Centers are under construction
and are expected to open in 2001.  Fourteen of the Centers are  "super-regional"
centers  because they have more than 800,000 square feet of gross leasable area.
The Operating  Partnership  also owns certain  regional  retail  shopping center
development   projects  and  more  than  99%  of  The  Taubman  Company  Limited
Partnership (the "Manager"),  which manages the shopping  centers,  and provides
other services to the Operating  Partnership  and the Company.  See the table on
pages 12 and 13 of this report for information regarding the Centers.

     The Company is a real estate  investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal
Revenue  Code of  1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code").  In order  to  satisfy  the
provisions of the Code  applicable to REITs,  the Company must distribute to its
shareholders  at least 95% of its REIT  taxable  income and meet  certain  other
requirements.   TRG's   partnership   agreement   provides  that  the  Operating
Partnership will distribute,  at a minimum,  sufficient  amounts to its partners
such  that  the  Company's  pro  rata  share  will  enable  the  Company  to pay
shareholder  dividends  (including  capital gains dividends that may be required
upon the  Operating  Partnership's  sale of an asset) that will satisfy the REIT
provisions of the Code.

Recent Developments

     For a discussion of business  developments  that occurred in 1999,  see the
response to Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" (MD&A).

The Shopping Center Business

     There are several types of retail shopping  centers,  varying  primarily by
size and marketing  strategy.  Retail shopping  centers range from  neighborhood
centers of less than 100,000  square feet of GLA to regional and  super-regional
shopping  centers.  Retail shopping  centers in excess of 400,000 square feet of
GLA are  generally  referred  to as  "regional"  shopping  centers,  while those
centers having in excess of 800,000 square feet of GLA are generally referred to
as  "super-regional"  shopping centers.  In this annual report on Form 10-K, the
term  "regional  shopping  centers"  refers to both regional and  super-regional
shopping centers. The term "GLA" refers to gross retail space, including anchors
and mall tenant  areas,  and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross  retail  space,
excluding anchors. The term "anchor" refers to a department store or other large
retail store. The term "mall tenants" refers to stores (other than anchors) that
are typically specialty retailers and lease space in shopping centers.


                                       1
<PAGE>

Business of the Company

     The Company, as managing general partner of the Operating  Partnership,  is
engaged in the ownership,  management,  leasing,  acquisition,  development  and
expansion of regional shopping centers.

   The Centers:

   o  are strategically located in major metropolitan areas, many in communities
      that are among the most affluent in the country,  including New York City,
      Los Angeles, Denver, Detroit, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.;

   o  range in size  between  438,000  and 1.5  million  square  feet of GLA and
      between  133,000 and 594,000 square feet of Mall GLA. The smallest  Center
      has approximately 50 stores, and the largest has approximately 200 stores.
      Of the 17 Centers, 14 are super-regional shopping centers;

   o  have  approximately  2,340 stores  operated  by  its  mall  tenants  under
      approximately  990 trade names;

   o  have 52 anchors,  operating under 17 trade names;

   o  lease  approximately  76%  of  Mall  GLA  to  national  chains,  including
      subsidiaries  or divisions of The Limited (The Limited,  Limited  Express,
      Victoria's  Secret,  and others),  The Gap (The Gap, Banana Republic,  and
      others), and Venator Group, Inc. (Foot Locker,  Kinney Shoes, and others);
      and

   o  are among the most  productive  (measured  by mall  tenants'  average  per
      square foot sales) in the United States. In 1999, mall tenants had average
      per square foot sales of $453,  which is  substantially  greater  than the
      average for all regional shopping centers owned by public companies.

     The most important factor  affecting the revenues  generated by the Centers
is leasing to mall tenants  (primarily  specialty  retailers),  which represents
approximately  90% of  revenues.  Anchors  account for less than 10% of revenues
because many own their stores and, in general,  those that lease their stores do
so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.

     The Company's portfolio is concentrated in highly productive super-regional
shopping  centers.  Of the 17 Centers,  14 had annual rent rolls at December 31,
1999 of over $10 million.  The Company  believes that this level of productivity
is indicative of the Centers' strong competitive position and is, in significant
part,  attributable  to the  Company's  business  strategy and  philosophy.  The
Company believes that large shopping centers (including  regional and especially
super-regional shopping centers) are the least susceptible to direct competition
because (among other reasons)  anchors and large specialty  retail stores do not
find it  economically  attractive  to open  additional  stores in the  immediate
vicinity of an existing  location  for fear of  competing  with  themselves.  In
addition to the  advantage  of size,  the  Company  believes  that the  Centers'
success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics,  such
as design, layout, and amenities.


                                       2

Business Strategy And Philosophy

     The Company  believes  that the regional  shopping  center  business is not
simply a real estate development  business,  but rather an operating business in
which a retailing approach to the on-going management and leasing of the Centers
is essential. Thus the Company:

o    Offers a large,  diverse  selection of retail stores in each Center to give
     customers a broad selection of consumer goods and variety of price ranges.

o    Endeavors to increase  overall  mall  tenants' sales, and thereby  increase
     achievable  rents, by  leasing  space  to  a  constantly  changing  mix  of
     tenants.

o    Seeks to anticipate trends in the retailing industry and emphasizes ongoing
     introductions of new retail concepts into the Centers.  Due in part to this
     strategy, a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first
     mall stores in the Centers. The Company believes that its execution of this
     leasing  strategy is unique in the industry and is an important  element in
     building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity.

o    Provides innovative  initiatives that  utilize  technology and the Internet
     to heighten the shopping  experience for customers,  build customer loyalty
     and increase tenant sales. One such initiative is the Company's ShopTaubman
     on-to-one marketing program,  which connects shoppers and retailers through
     interactive in-center computer kiosks and on-line web-sites.

     The Centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse,  in-depth
presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to
facilitate  customer  shopping.  While some Centers  include  stores that target
high-end,  upscale customers,  each Center is individually merchandised in light
of the  demographics  of  its  potential  customers  within  convenient  driving
distance.

     The Company's  leasing strategy  involves  assembling a diverse mix of mall
tenants in each of the Centers in order to attract customers, thereby generating
higher  sales by mall  tenants.  High  sales by mall  tenants  make the  Centers
attractive to  prospective  tenants,  thereby  increasing  the rental rates that
prospective tenants are willing to pay. The Company implements an active leasing
strategy to  increase  the  Centers'  productivity  and to set minimum  rents at
higher  levels.   Elements  of  this  strategy  include  terminating  leases  of
under-performing  tenants,  renegotiating existing leases, and not leasing space
to prospective  tenants that (though viable or attractive in certain ways) would
not enhance a Center's retail mix.

Potential For Growth

     The Company's  principal  objective is to enhance  shareholder  value.  The
Company seeks to maximize the financial results of its assets,  while pursuing a
growth strategy that concentrates  primarily on an active new center development
program.

Development of New Centers

     The  Company is  pursuing an active  program of  regional  shopping  center
development.  The  Company  believes  that  it  has  the  expertise  to  develop
economically  attractive regional shopping centers through intensive analysis of
local retail  opportunities.  The Company  believes that the  development of new
centers is the best use of its capital and an area in which the Company  excels.
At any time, the Company has numerous potential  development projects in various
stages.

     During  March  1999,  the  Company  opened  MacArthur  Center,  an enclosed
super-regional  mall in Norfolk,  Virginia.  Additionally,  four new centers are
currently  under  construction:  International  Plaza,  an enclosed  1.3 million
square foot  regional  mall in Tampa,  Florida;  The Shops at Willow Bend, a 1.4
million square foot regional  shopping center in the  metropolitan  Dallas area;
The Mall at Wellington Green, a 1.3 million square foot regional shopping center
located in west Palm Beach  County,  Florida;  and Dolphin  Mall,  a 1.4 million
square foot value regional center in Miami,  Florida.  All four of these Centers
are expected to open in 2001.

                                       3
<PAGE>

     The Company's policies with respect to development  activities are designed
to reduce the risks  associated  with  development.  For  instance,  the Company
previously  entered  into an  agreement  to lease a center,  while  the  Company
investigated the  redevelopment  opportunities of the center.  Also, the Company
generally  does not intend to acquire  land  early in the  development  process.
Instead,  the Company generally  acquires options on land or forms  partnerships
with landholders holding potentially  attractive  development sites. The Company
typically  exercises the options only once it is prepared to begin construction.
In  addition,  the  Company  does  not  intend  to  begin  construction  until a
sufficient  number of anchor  stores  have  agreed to  operate  in the  shopping
center,  such that the Company is confident  that the projected  sales and rents
from Mall GLA are  sufficient to earn a return on invested  capital in excess of
the Company's cost of capital.  Having  historically  followed these principles,
the  Company's  experience  indicates  that  less  than 10% of the  costs of the
development  of a  regional  shopping  center  will  be  incurred  prior  to the
construction  period;  however,  no assurance can be given that the Company will
continue to be able to so limit pre-construction costs.

     While the Company  will  continue to evaluate  development  projects  using
criteria,  including  financial  criteria for rates of return,  similar to those
employed in the past,  no  assurances  can be given that the  adherence to these
policies will produce comparable  results in the future. In addition,  the costs
of shopping center  development  opportunities  that are explored but ultimately
abandoned  will,  to some  extent,  diminish the overall  return on  development
projects (see "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations -- Liquidity  and Capital  Resources -- Capital  Spending"
for further discussion of the Company's development activities).

Strategic Acquisitions

     The Company's  objective is to acquire existing centers only when they  are
compatible with the quality of the Company's portfolio (or can be redeveloped to
that  level)  and  that  satisfy  the  Company's  strategic  plans  and  pricing
requirements.

     The  Company  believes  it will have  additional  opportunities  to acquire
regional  shopping  centers,  or  interests  therein,   and  will  have  certain
advantages in doing so.

   o  First,  the  management  expertise of the Manager will enhance the leasing
      and  operation  of  newly   acquired   regional   shopping   centers.   If
      opportunities  exist to  expand,  remodel,  or  re-merchandise  the center
      through new  leasing,  the  Company's  expertise  will assist in making an
      informed  and  timely  evaluation  of the  economic  consequences  of such
      activities prior to acquisition,  as well as facilitate  implementation of
      such activities.

   o  Second, a center can be  acquired  for  any  combination of cash or equity
      interests in the Operating Partnership or (subject to certain limitations)
      the  Company,   possibly  creating  the  opportunity  for   tax-advantaged
      transactions  for  the  seller, thereby  reducing  the  price  that  might
      otherwise  have  to be  paid  in an all  cash  transaction  or  making  an
      opportunity  available  that  would  not otherwise  exist.  The  Operating
      Partnership  is able to offer  partnership interests in itself in exchange
      for  shopping  center  interests,   allowing sellers  to  diversify  their
      interests,  attain liquidity not otherwise available, possibly defer taxes
      that might  otherwise be due if the  interests were instead sold for cash,
      maintain an  investment  in the  regional  shopping center  business,  and
      resolve concerns sellers otherwise may have regarding future management of
      their properties.

     In addition, the Company may make other investments to enhance the value of
its  business,  for  example,  in  April  1999,  the  Company  made a  strategic
investment in fashionmall.com,  an online landlord.  Visitors to the fashionmall
website find many of the same retailers in Taubman centers,  including  Sephora,
Gap, Esprit and Banana Republic.  Understanding  this developing  shopping venue
will  help the  Company  identify  ways to  maximize  the  opportunities  of the
internet.  Also, in November 1999, the Company  acquired the retail leasing firm
Lord Associates,  which will provide additional resources for the leasing of the
four new  centers  scheduled  to open in 2001.  Lord  Associates  has  extensive
experience with value and  entertainment  specialty  centers and had worked with
the Company on the leasing of Great Lakes Crossing.

                                       4
<PAGE>

Expansions of the Centers

     Another potential element of growth is the strategic  expansion of existing
properties to update and enhance their market positions,  by replacing or adding
new anchor stores or increasing mall tenant space. Most of the Centers have been
designed to accommodate expansions.  Expansion projects can be as significant as
new  shopping  center  construction  in  terms  of  scope  and  cost,  requiring
governmental  and  existing  anchor  store  approvals,  design  and  engineering
activities, including rerouting utilities, providing additional parking areas or
decking, acquiring additional land, and relocating anchors and mall tenants (all
of which must take place with a minimum of  disruption  to existing  tenants and
customers).  For example, a 21-screen theater will be added at Fairlane,  in the
Detroit  metropolitan  area and is anticipated to open in the spring of 2000. At
Fair Oaks in the  Washington,  D.C.  area,  Hecht's  expansion  will open in the
spring of 2000, and a JCPenney  expansion and a newly  constructed  Macy's store
will open in the fall of 2000.

acquisition, and expansion activities.

Internal Growth

     The Centers are among the most  productive in the nation,  when measured by
mall tenant's average sales per square foot. Higher sales per square foot enable
mall  tenants  to remain  profitable  while  paying  occupancy  costs that are a
greater percentage of total sales. As leases expire at the Centers,  the Company
has  consistently  been able, on a portfolio basis, to lease the available space
to an existing or new tenant at higher rates.

     Augmenting this growth,  the Company is pursuing a number of new sources of
revenue  from the Centers.  For example,  the Company has entered into a 15 year
lease  agreement  with  JCDecaux,  the world's  largest   street   furniture and
outdoor  advertising  company.  The agreement will create an in-mall advertising
program  in  the  Company's   portfolio  of  owned   properties,   creating  new
point-of-sale   opportunities   for  retailers  and  manufacturers  as  well  as
heightening  in-mall experience for shoppers.  In addition,  the Company expects
increased  revenue from its  specialty  leasing  efforts.  In recent years a new
industry -- beyond  traditional  carts and kiosks -- has evolved,  with more and
better quality  specialty  tenants.  The Company has put in place a company-wide
program to maximize this opportunity.

Rental Rates

     As leases have expired in the Centers,  the Company has generally been able
to rent the available space,  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant,  at
rental  rates that are higher than those of the expired  leases.  In a period of
increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations
of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or
declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for
the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older
leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated
at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for
existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per
square foot base rent at Centers that have been owned and open for five years.

(1)  Excludes leases that expire in 2000 for which renewal leases or leases with
     replacement tenants have been executed as of December 31, 1999.

     The Company  believes that the  information in the table is not necessarily
indicative  of what will occur in the future  because  of several  factors,  but
principally  because its leasing  policies and  practices  create a  significant
level of early lease  terminations  at the  Centers.  For  example,  the average
remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period 1994 to 1999
was  approximately  1.9 years. The average term of leases signed during 1999 and
1998 was approximately 7.9 years.

     In  addition,  mall tenants at the Centers may seek the  protection  of the
bankruptcy  laws,  which could result in the termination of such tenants' leases
and thus cause a reduction in cash flow. In 1999,  approximately  3.1% of leases
were so affected  compared to 1.2% in 1998, 1.5% in 1997, 2.8% in 1996, and 3.2%
in 1995. Since 1991, the annual provision for losses on accounts  receivable has
been less than 2% of annual revenues.

Occupancy

     Mall tenant average occupancy,  ending occupancy, and leased space rates of
the Centers are as follows:

Major Tenants

     No single retail company represents 10% or more of the Company's  revenues.
The combined operations of The Limited, Inc. accounted for approximately 8.3% of
leased Mall GLA as of December 31, 1999 and for  approximately  7.1% of the 1999
base rent.  The largest of these,  in terms of square  footage and rent,  is The
Limited,  which accounted for approximately  1.2% of leased Mall GLA and 1.2% of
1999 base rent.  No other single  retail  company  accounted for more than 4% of
leased Mall GLA or 1999 base rent.

General Risks of the Company

Economic Performance and Value of Shopping Centers Dependent on Many Factors

     The economic  performance and value of the Company's  shopping  centers are
dependent on various  factors.  Additionally,  these same factors will influence
the Company's  decision  whether to go forward on the development of new centers
and may affect the ultimate  economic  performance  and value of projects  under
construction  (see other risks  associated  with the  development of new centers
under  "Business  of the  Company--Development  of New  Centers").  Such factors
include:

o    changes in the national, regional, and/or local economic climates,

o    competition from other shopping  centers,  discount  stores,  outlet malls,
     discount  shopping  clubs,  direct  mail  and the  Internet  in  attracting
     customers and tenants,

o    increases in operating costs,

o    the public perception of the safety of customers at the shopping centers,

o    environmental or legal liabilities,

o    availability and cost of financing, and

o    uninsured  losses,  resulting from wars,  riots,  or civil  disturbances or
     losses from  earthquakes or floods in excess of policy  specifications  and
     insured limits.

In addition, the value of shopping centers may be adversely affected by:

o    changes in government regulations, and

o    changes in real estate zoning and tax laws.

Adverse changes in the economic  performance and value of shopping centers would
adversely affect the Company's income and cash available to pay dividends.

Third Party Interests in the Centers

     Some of the  shopping  centers  which the Company  develops  and leases are
partially  owned  by  other   non-affiliated   partners  through  joint  venture
arrangements.  As a result, the Company may not be able to control all decisions
regarding those shopping centers and may be required to take actions that are in
the interest of the joint venture partners but not the Company's best interests.

Bankruptcy of Mall Tenants or Joint Venture Partners

     The Company could be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of third parties.
The  bankruptcy  of a mall tenant could result in the  termination  of its lease
which would lower the amount of cash  generated by that mall. In addition,  if a
department  store operating an anchor at one of our shopping  centers were to go
into bankruptcy and cease  operating,  its closing may lead to reduced  customer
traffic and lower mall tenant sales which would,  in turn,  affect the amount of
rent our tenants pay us. The  profitability  of shopping centers held in a joint
venture could also be adversely  affected by the  bankruptcy of one of the joint
venture  partners if, because of certain  provisions of the bankruptcy laws, the
Company was unable to make  important  decisions  in a timely  fashion or became
subject to additional liabilities.

                                       8
<PAGE>
Third Party Contracts

     The Company provides property  management,  leasing,  development and other
administrative  services to centers transferred to GMPT, other third parties and
to certain  Taubman  affiliates.  The contracts  under which these  services are
provided  may be canceled or not  renewed or may be  renegotiated  on terms less
favorable  to the  Company.  Certain  costs of  providing  services  under these
contracts  would not  necessarily  be  eliminated  if the  contracts  were to be
canceled or not renewed.

Inability to Maintain Status as a REIT

o    The Company may not  be  able to   maintain  its  status  as a real  estate
     investment  trust, or REIT, for Federal income tax purposes with the result
     that the income  distributed  to  shareholders  will not be  deductible  in
     computing  taxable  income and  instead  would be subject to tax at regular
     corporate rates. Although the Company believes it is organized and operates
     in  a  manner  to  maintain  its  REIT  qualification,  many  of  the  REIT
     requirements of the Internal Revenue Code are very complex and have limited
     judicial  or  administrative  interpretations.   Changes  in  tax  laws  or
     regulations or new administrative  interpretations  and court decisions may
     also affect the Company's ability to maintain REIT status in the future. If
     the Company  fails to qualify as a REIT,  its income may also be subject to
     the  alternative  minimum  tax. If the Company  does not  maintain its REIT
     status in any year,  it may be unable to elect to be  treated as a REIT for
     the next four taxable years. In addition,  if the Company fails to meet the
     Internal  Revenue Code's  requirement that it distribute to shareholders at
     least  95% of our  otherwise  taxable  income,  it  will  be  subject  to a
     nondeductible 4% excise tax on a portion of its income.

o    Although the Company currently  intends to  maintain  its status as a REIT,
     future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause it to
     determine  that it would be in the  Company's  and its  shareholders'  best
     interests  to revoke its REIT  election.  As noted  above,  if the  Company
     revokes its REIT election, it will not be able to elect REIT status for the
     next four taxable years.

Environmental Matters

     All of the Centers  presently  owned by the Company (not  including  option
interests in the Development  Projects or any of the real estate managed but not
included  in  the  Company's  portfolio)  have  been  subject  to  environmental
assessments. The Company is not aware of any environmental liability relating to
the  Centers  or any  other  property,  in which  they  have or had an  interest
(whether  as an owner or  operator)  that the  Company  believes,  would  have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  assets,  or  results  of
operations.  No  assurances  can  be  given,  however,  that  all  environmental
liabilities  have been identified or that no prior owner,  operator,  or current
occupant  has  created  an  environmental  condition  not known to the  Company.
Moreover,  no  assurances  can be given that (i)  future  laws,  ordinances,  or
regulations  will not impose any material  environmental  liability or that (ii)
the  current  environmental  condition  of the  Centers  will not be affected by
tenants and  occupants of the Centers,  by the  condition of  properties  in the
vicinity of the Centers (such as the presence of underground  storage tanks), or
by third parties unrelated to the Company.

     With  respect  to  the  matters  described  below,  while  there  can be no
assurances,  the Company  believes  that such  matters  will not have a material
adverse effect on the Company's business, assets, or results of operations.

     Beverly  Center is  located  over an oil field and  several  abandoned  oil
wells,  and is  adjacent  to an active oil  production  facility  that  operates
numerous oil and gas wells.  In the Los Angeles  basin,  where Beverly Center is
located,  pockets of methane gas may be found in oil fields;  however,  elevated
levels of methane have not been detected at Beverly Center.

     Cherry Creek is situated on land that was used as a landfill prior to 1950.
Because  of the past use of the site as a  landfill,  the site is  listed on the
United States  Environmental  Protection  Agency's  Comprehensive  Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Information System list.

     In the summer of 1997,  geotechnical drilling activities were undertaken in
the former  gasoline  station  area as part of a parking  lot  expansion  at the
southeastern corner of the Cherry Creek site. The geotechnical soil samples were
observed  to have  petroleum  odors and  staining.  A  subsurface  environmental
investigation  subsequently revealed a limited zone of hydrocarbon  contaminated
soils, with no significant impacts to groundwater. Discussions with the Colorado
Department of Labor and Employment,  Oil Inspection  Section,  held in September
1997,  resulted  in a "passive  retardation"  remedial  approach  that relies on
natural processes to degrade the hydrocarbon contamination.  A Corrective Action
Plan was submitted and accepted in 1998 that  provided for  monitoring  the soil
and groundwater.  The monitoring  procedures  required under this plan have been
completed.

     Paseo  Nuevo is located in an area of known  groundwater  contamination  by
tetrachloroethylene  ("PCE").  The  groundwater  under and  around  the site was
monitored for six years before, during, and after construction of the center. No
on-site sources of PCE were identified during  construction.  The Regional Water
Quality Control Board has given approval to discontinue  the monitoring  program
because the PCE levels remained relatively constant over the six-year period and
do not exceed the state standard for PCE in drinking water.

     There are asbestos  containing  materials  ("ACMs") at most of the Centers,
primarily in the form of floor  tiles,  roof  coatings  and  mastics.  The floor
tiles,  roof coatings and mastics are generally in good  condition.  The Manager
has developed and is  implementing  an operations and  maintenance  program that
details  operating  procedures  with respect to ACMs prior to any renovation and
that requires periodic inspection for any change in condition of existing ACMs.

     During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company  offered and sold a total of
31,399,913 shares of Series B Non-Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (the
"Series B Stock") to the partners  (other than the Company) in TRG, which is the
Company's  subsidiary  Operating   Partnership,   in  an  offering  exempt  from
registration  under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"). Under the
Company's  articles of  incorporation,  as amended on September  30,  1998,  the
Company was required to offer each partner in the Operating  Partnership  (other
than the Company) the right to subscribe  for Series B Stock on the basis of one
share of Series B Stock for each Unit of  Partnership  Interest in the Operating
Partnership owned by the subscribing  partner.  The aggregate offering price was
$38,400,  which  was  equal  to the  Series  B  Stock's  per  share  liquidation
preference of $0.001  multiplied by the number of shares sold.  The Company sold
all of the offered shares.  The Company offered and sold all shares directly and
did not pay any commissions or discounts.

     In connection with its November 1999  acquisition of Lord  Associates,  the
Company  issued  435,153  shares of Series B Stock as part of the  consideration
paid to the owner.  These  shares  will be released  over a five-year  period (5
shares had been released as of December 31 ,1999).  The former owner,  presently
an officer of the Company,  has granted an irrevocable  proxy to a subsidiary of
the Operating Partnership for the unreleased shares, and therefore has no voting
or dispositive power for these shares until release.

     Each share of Series B Stock is  entitled  to one vote.  The Series B Stock
and the Company's  Common Stock vote as a single class on all matters  submitted
to a vote of the Company's  shareholders.  The Series B Stock is not entitled to
dividends or other distributions, except upon liquidation as indicated above.

     The Series B Stock is convertible under certain  circumstances  into Common
Stock at the ratio of one share of Common Stock for each 14,000 shares of Series
B Stock (with any resulting fractional shares of Common Stock being redeemed for
cash). Generally, a partner desiring to sell (by exchange or otherwise) Units in
the Operating Partnership to the Company must surrender for conversion shares of
Series B Stock  equal in number to the  Units  being  sold.  In  addition,  if a
transfer  of Series B Stock  results in the  transferee  holding  more shares of
Series B Stock than is permitted under the Company's  articles of incorporation,
then the  shares  of  Series B Stock in  excess  of the  permitted  number  will
automatically  convert  into  Common  Stock (or will be  redeemed  for cash,  as
indicated above).

     The  offerings  of  Series  B  Stock   described  above  were  exempt  from
registration under the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act. Under the Company's articles of incorporation, the Company may issue shares
of Series B Stock only to partners  in the  Operating  Partnership.  Offers were
limited to partners  in the  Operating  Partnership,  who  constitute  a limited
number of  sophisticated  investors (all of whom are "accredited  investors," as
defined in Rule 501 under the  Securities  Act) fully familiar with the business
and operations of the Company,  and did not involve any general  solicitation or
advertising.  Under the  Company's  articles  of  incorporation,  resales of the
Series B Stock are permitted  only if registered  (or exempt from  registration)
under the Securities Act, and each certificate evidencing Series B Stock carries
a restrictive legend.

     In September and November 1999, the Operating  Partnership offered and sold
a total of $100 million of 9% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership Equity
to institutional  investors, in an offering exempt from registration pursuant to
Section 4(2) of the Securities  Act. In connection  with this private placement,
the  Operating  Partnership  paid  $2.5  million  in  total  commissions  to the
placement agent who facilitated both transactions. After 10 years (an in certain
circumstances,  earlier),  the holders of such preferred partnership equity have
the  right to  exchange  their  interests  for  shares  of the  Company's  newly
authorized  Series C and Series D Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred Stock.  Each
such series of the Company's preferred stock has substantially  similar terms as
the preferred  partnership  equity being exchanged therefor and does not entitle
its  holders to vote.  No shares of Series C or Series D  Cumulative  Redeemable
Preferred Stock are currently outstanding.

(1)  On  September  30, 1998 the  Company  obtained a majority  and  controlling
     interest  in The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited  Partnership  (TRG or the
     Operating  Partnership) as a result of the GMPT Exchange (see  Management's
     Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations
     (MD&A) - GMPT  Exchange  and  Related  Transactions).  As a result  of this
     transaction, the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership increased
     to  a  majority  and  the  Company   began   consolidating   the  Operating
     Partnership.  For  years  prior  to 1998,  amounts  reflect  the  Company's
     interest in the Operating Partnership under the equity method.

     extinguishment of debt, primarily consisting of prepayment premiums.  Also,

     gain  related  to the  disposition  of  Bellevue  Center  and  the  related
     extinguishment of debt.

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The  following  discussion  should  be read in  conjunction  with  Selected
Financial  Data and the Financial  Statements of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. and the
Notes thereto.

General Background and Performance Measurement

     The  Company  owns a managing  general  partner's  interest  in The Taubman
Realty Group Limited  Partnership  (the Operating  Partnership or TRG),  through
which the Company  conducts all of its  operations.  The  Operating  Partnership
owns, develops, acquires, and operates regional shopping centers nationally. The
Consolidated  Businesses  consist of shopping  centers  that are  controlled  by
ownership or contractual  agreement,  development  projects for future  regional
shopping  centers and The Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the Manager).
Shopping  centers  that are not  controlled  and that are  owned  through  joint
ventures with third parties  (Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures) are accounted for
under the equity method.

     The  operations  of the shopping  centers are best  understood by measuring
their  performance  as a  whole,  without  regard  to  the  Company's  ownership
interest.  Consequently,  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the
Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are
presented and discussed as a whole.

     On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10
shopping  centers (nine  Consolidated  Businesses and one  Unconsolidated  Joint
Venture)  and a  share  of  the  Operating  Partnership's  debt  for  all of the
partnership  units owned by two General  Motors  pension trusts (GMPT) (the GMPT
Exchange).  See Results of Operations  -GMPT  Exchange and Related  Transactions
below.   Performance   statistics  presented  below  exclude  these  10  centers
(transferred centers).

Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues

     Over the long  term,  the level of mall  tenant  sales is the  single  most
important  determinant of revenues of the shopping  centers because mall tenants
provide  approximately  90% of these  revenues  and because  mall  tenant  sales
determine  the  amount  of  rent,  percentage  rent,  and  recoverable  expenses
(together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However,
levels of mall tenant sales can be  considerably  more volatile in the short run
than total occupancy costs.

     The Company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and
earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot
increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because
most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can
afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher
sales per square foot.

     The following table summarizes occupancy costs,  excluding  utilities,  for
mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.

Occupancy

     Historically,  average  annual  occupancy has been within a narrow band. In
the last ten years, average annual occupancy has ranged between 86.5% and 89.4%.
Mall tenant average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy and leased space rates are as
follows:

                                                1999         1998        1997

   Ending Occupancy                             90.4         90.2         90.7

Rental Rates

     As leases have expired in the shopping  centers,  the Company has generally
been able to rent the available  space,  either to the existing  tenant or a new
tenant,  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases.  In a
period of  increasing  sales,  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants'
expectations  of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In periods of slower
growth or  declining  sales,  rents on new leases  will grow more slowly or will
decline for the opposite reason.  However, Center revenues nevertheless increase
as older leases roll over or are  terminated  early and replaced with new leases
negotiated  at current  rental  rates that are  usually  higher than the average
rates for existing  leases.  The following  table contains  certain  information
regarding per square foot base rent at the shopping centers that have been owned
and open for five years.

                                                1999         1998         1997
                                                ----         ----         ----

   Average Base Rent per square foot:

      All mall tenants                         $43.58       $41.93      $41.37
      Stores closing during the year           $41.14       $44.27      $39.07
      Stores opening during the year           $52.64       $47.92      $41.08

     In 1999,  average base rent per square foot for stores  opening  during the
year was  somewhat  weighted by the leasing of smaller  than  average  spaces at
several of the Company's most productive  centers.  The Company expects the rent
spread  between  opening  and  closing  stores  in 2000  to be in the  Company's
historic  range of $5.00 to $10.00 per square foot.  However,  this statistic is
difficult  to  predict  in part  because  the  Company's  leasing  policies  and
practices may result in early lease  terminations  with actual  average  closing
rents per square  foot which may vary from the  average  rent per square foot of
scheduled lease expirations.

Seasonality

     The  regional  shopping  center  industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall
tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with
lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter
holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are
generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire
in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of
the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Accordingly,  revenues
and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.

     Because the  seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature
of minimum rents and recoveries, mall tenant occupancy costs (the sum of minimum
rents,   percentage  rents  and  expense  recoveries)   relative  to  sales  are
considerably  higher in the first  three  quarters  than they are in the  fourth
quarter.

Results of Operations

     The  following  represent  significant  debt and equity  transactions,  new
center openings, expansions, and acquisitions which affect the operating results
described under Comparison of 1999 to 1998.

GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions

     On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10
shopping  centers  (nine wholly  owned and one  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture),
together  with  $990  million  of  debt,  for all of  GMPT's  partnership  units
(approximately 50 million units with a fair value of $675 million,  based on the
average  stock price of the  Company's  common shares of $13.50 for the two week
period  prior  to the  closing),  providing  the  Company  with a  majority  and
controlling  interest in the Operating  Partnership.  The Operating  Partnership
continues to manage the centers exchanged under management agreements with GMPT.
The management  agreements are cancelable with 90 days notice.  Certain costs of
providing services under these agreements,  including administrative and certain
other fixed costs,  would not necessarily be eliminated if the contracts were to
be canceled or not renewed.  The actual  reduction of costs would be affected by
whether all or a portion of the contracts  were canceled or not renewed,  timing
of the  cancellation  or non-renewal,  and actual or anticipated  changes in the
Operating Partnership's owned or managed portfolio.

     In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating  Partnership  used the
$1.2 billion  proceeds from two bridge loans to extinguish  $1.1 billion of debt
in September 1998. The remaining  proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment
premiums and  transaction  costs.  GMPT's share of debt received in the exchange
included  the $902  million  balance  on the  first  bridge  loan,  $86  million
representing  50% of the debt on the Joint Venture owned  shopping  center,  and
$1.6 million of assessment  bond  obligations.  The $340 million  balance on the
second bridge loan was refinanced during the first half of 1999.

                                       22
<PAGE>

     Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange the Operating Partnership, expecting to
reduce  its  annual  general  and   administrative   expense,   committed  to  a
restructuring of its operations and recognized a $10.7 million charge related to
this   restructuring.   During  the  fourth   quarter  of  1998,   general   and
administrative  expense  decreased  $2.2 million from the  comparable  period in
1997.  During 1999,  general and  administrative  expense decreased $6.5 million
from 1998.  Substantially  all of the decrease in 1999  expense  occurred in the
first three quarters of 1999.

     Because the Company's  portfolio  changed  significantly as a result of the
GMPT Exchange,  the results of operations of the  transferred  centers have been
separately  classified  within the  Consolidated  Businesses and  Unconsolidated
Joint  Ventures for  purposes of  analyzing  and  understanding  the  historical
results of the current portfolio.

     Since the Company's interest in the Operating Partnership has been its sole
material  asset  throughout all periods  presented,  references in the following
discussion to "the  Company"  include the  Operating  Partnership,  except where
intercompany  transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted,  even though the
Operating  Partnership did not become a consolidated  subsidiary until September
30, 1998.

Other Debt and Equity Transactions

     In September and November 1999, the Operating Partnership completed private
placements  totaling  $100  million  of  9%  Cumulative   Redeemable   Preferred
Partnership  Equity  (Series C Preferred  Equity and Series D Preferred  Equity,
respectively), which were purchased by institutional investors. The net proceeds
were used to pay down lines of credit.

     In August  1999,  a  seven-year  secured  financing of $177 million with an
all-in rate of 7.8% was completed by the 50% owned  Unconsolidated Joint Venture
that owns  Cherry  Creek.  The  proceeds  were used to repay the  existing  $130
million   mortgage  and  transaction   costs.  The  remaining  net  proceeds  of
approximately $45.2 million were distributed to the Operating Partnership, which
had  contributed  all the funding for the 1998  expansion of Cherry  Creek.  The
Operating Partnership used the distribution to pay down lines of credit.

     In June 1999,  the  Operating  Partnership's  $200  million  line of credit
facility was securitized, with interests in Fairlane, LaCumbre, Paseo Nuevo, and
Regency  Square  serving as  collateral.  The rate on the line was  decreased to
LIBOR plus 0.90%.

     In April 1999, a ten-year  financing of $270 million with an all-in rate of
approximately  6.9% secured by The Mall at Short Hills was  completed.  Also, in
June  1999,  a  ten-year  financing  of $80  million  with  an  all-in  rate  of
approximately  7.8%  secured by Biltmore  Fashion  Park was  completed.  The net
proceeds  of these  financings  were  used to pay off the  entire  $340  million
balance on the bridge loan.

     In April  1999,  a  three-year  $170  million  loan  secured by Great Lakes
Crossing was finalized,  with proceeds used to repay the balance of the existing
construction facility. The loan bears interest at one-month LIBOR plus 1.50%. In
addition,   the  Company   finalized  an  amendment  to  the  MacArthur   Center
construction  facility,  with  total  availability  under the  facility  of $120
million at an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus 1.35%.

     In January 1998, the Operating Partnership redeemed a partner's 6.1 million
units of partnership interest for approximately $77.7 million (including costs).
The  redemption  was funded  through  the use of an  existing  revolving  credit
facility.

Openings, Expansions, Acquisitions, and Other

     In March 1999, MacArthur Center, a 70% owned enclosed  super-regional mall,
opened in Norfolk,  Virginia. In November 1998, Great Lakes Crossing, an 85% (an
increase from 80%-see below) owned enclosed value super-regional mall, opened in
Auburn Hills, Michigan. Both Great Lakes Crossing and MacArthur Center are owned
by joint ventures in which the Operating Partnership has a controlling interest,
and  consequently the results of these centers are consolidated in the Company's
financial  statements.  The  Operating  Partnership  is  entitled to a preferred
return on its equity contributions to these centers. The contributed capital was
used to fund construction  costs. The income effect of the cumulative  preferred
return net of the interest on the Operating Partnership's  associated borrowings
was approximately $2.0 million for 1999. The net effect in 2000 of any recurring
preference  is expected to be minimal.  At Cherry Creek,  a 132,000  square foot
expansion opened in stages throughout the fall of 1998.

     In November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  acquired Lord  Associates,  a
retail leasing firm based in  Alexandria,  Virginia for $2.5 million in cash and
$5 million in partnership units, which are subject to certain contingencies.  In
addition, $1.0 million of the purchase price is contingent upon profits achieved
on acquired leasing  contracts.  Of the cash purchase price,  approximately $1.0
million was paid at closing and $1.5 million will be paid over five years.

     In 1996,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into an  agreement to lease
Memorial  City Mall,  a 1.4  million  square  foot  shopping  center  located in
Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that enabled the
Operating  Partnership to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities and
terminate the lease  obligations in the event such  redevelopment  opportunities
were not deemed to be sufficient.  In November  1999, the Operating  Partnership
exercised its option to terminate the lease.  Under the terms of the lease,  the
Operating Partnership will continue to manage the center until May 2000.

     In December  1999,  the  Operating  Partnership  acquired an  additional 5%
interest  in Great  Lakes  Crossing  for $1.2  million in cash,  increasing  the
Operating Partnership's interest in the center to 85%.

Subsequent Events

     In January 2000, the Company agreed to exchange property interests with its
current joint venture partner in two  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures.  Under the
terms of the  agreement,  expected to be completed in first  quarter  2000,  the
Operating  Partnership will assume 100 percent ownership of Twelve Oaks Mall and
the current  joint  venture  partner will become 100 percent  owner of Lakeside.
Both properties  will remain subject to the existing  mortgages ($50 million and
$88  million  at  Twelve  Oaks  and  Lakeside,   respectively.)   The  Operating
Partnership  will also pay the joint  venture  partner $30 million in cash.  The
Operating  Partnership  will  continue to manage  Twelve  Oaks,  while the joint
venture partner will assume  management  responsibility  of Lakeside at closing.
Upon completion of the  transaction,  the Company expects to recognize a gain on
the exchange,  representing the excess of the fair value over the net book basis
of the Company's  interest in Lakeside  Mall,  adjusted for the $30 million paid
and  transaction  costs.  Aside from this book gain, the Company does not expect
the  transaction  to  have  a  material  effect  on  the  Company's  results  of
operations.

     In January  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns
Stamford  Town  Center  completed  a $76  million  secured  financing.  The  new
financing  bears interest at a rate of one-month  LIBOR plus 0.8% and matures in
2002 with a two-year  extension  option.  The rate is capped at 8.2% plus credit
spread for the term of the loan. The proceeds were used to repay the $54 million
participating  mortgage,  the $18.3  million  prepayment  premium,  and  accrued
interest and transaction costs.

Presentation of Operating Results

     In order to  facilitate  the  analysis of the ongoing  business for periods
prior to the GMPT Exchange,  the following tables contain the combined operating
results of the Company and the Operating Partnership and also present separately
the revenues and expenses,  other than interest,  depreciation and amortization,
of the transferred centers.  Income allocated to the noncontrolling partners and
preferred  interests  is  deducted  to arrive at the  results  allocable  to the
Company's  common   shareowners.   Because  the  net  equity  of  the  Operating
Partnership's  unitholders is less than zero, for periods subsequent to the GMPT
Exchange, the income allocated to the noncontrolling  partners is equal to their
share of  distributions.  The net equity of these minority partners is less than
zero due to  accumulated  distributions  in  excess of net  income  and not as a
result of operating  losses.  Distributions to partners are usually greater than
net income because net income includes  non-cash  charges for  depreciation  and
amortization.  The  Company's  average  ownership  percentage  of the  Operating
Partnership was 63% for 1999 and 43% for 1998 (including averages of 39% for the
period through the GMPT Exchange and 63% thereafter.)

Consolidated Businesses

     Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $257.6 million,  a
$65.0 million, or 33.7%,  increase over the comparable period in 1998, excluding
revenues of the  transferred  centers.  Minimum rents increased $34.1 million of
which  $30.6  million was caused by the  opening of  MacArthur  Center and Great
Lakes Crossing.  Minimum rents also increased due to tenant  rollovers.  Expense
recoveries increased primarily due to the new centers. Revenues from management,
leasing,  and  development  services  increased  primarily due to the management
agreements  with GMPT.  Other revenue  decreased  primarily due to a decrease in
gains on sales of peripheral  land,  partially offset by increases in garage and
trash removal services and lease cancellation fees.

     Total operating costs were $237.0 million, a $5.5 million, or 2.3% decrease
from the comparable period in 1998,  excluding expenses other than depreciation,
amortization  and  interest of the  transferred  centers.  Recoverable  expenses
increased  primarily  due to Great Lakes  Crossing and MacArthur  Center.  Other
operating  expense  increased due to an increase in the charge to operations for
costs of unsuccessful and potentially unsuccessful  pre-development  activities,
the new  centers,  and bad  debt  expense.  Costs  of  management,  leasing  and
development  services increased primarily due to the management  agreements with
GMPT. General and administrative expense decreased $6.5 million primarily due to
decreases in payroll  costs,  travel and  professional  fees.  Interest  expense
decreased  primarily  due to the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT
Exchange  and debt paid  down with the  proceeds  of the  Series C and  Series D
Preferred  Equity  offerings,  partially  offset by an  increase in debt used to
finance Great Lakes Crossing and MacArthur  Center and a decrease in capitalized
interest  related  to these  centers.  Depreciation  and  amortization  expenses
decreased due to the transferred centers, partially offset by an increase due to
the new centers.

     During 1998,  a $10.7  million loss on the  restructuring  was  recognized,
which  primarily  represented  the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations of
personnel.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

     Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $252.0 million,  a
$12.9 million, or 5.4%,  increase from the comparable period of 1998,  excluding
revenues of the transferred center. Minimum rents increased due to the expansion
at Cherry Creek and tenant rollovers.  Expense recoveries also increased because
of the Cherry Creek expansion and an increase in property taxes recoverable from
tenants at certain centers.

     Total  operating  costs  decreased by $20.2 million (of which $17.7 million
represented the expenses other than interest,  depreciation, and amortization of
the transferred  center) to $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Recoverable  expenses increased  primarily due to the Cherry Creek expansion and
an  increase in  property  taxes at certain  centers.  Other  operating  expense
increased  primarily  due to increases  in bad debt  expense.  Interest  expense
decreased  primarily  due to the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT
Exchange. Depreciation and amortization decreased due to the transferred center,
offset by an increase due to the Cherry Creek expansion.

     Income before  extraordinary  items of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures
decreased by $14.1 million, or 15.7%, to $75.6 million.  The Company's equity in
income before extraordinary items of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $39.3
million, a 15.3% decrease from the comparable period in 1998.

Net Income

     As a result of the  foregoing,  the Company's  income before  extraordinary
items,  minority and preferred  interests  decreased $12.0 million, or 17.0%, to
$58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The Company  recognized $0.5
million in  extraordinary  losses related to the  extinguishment  of debt during
1999, while an extraordinary  charge of $50.8 million for the  extinguishment of
debt, primarily related to the GMPT Exchange, was recognized in 1998. The income
of the Operating Partnership allocable to minority partners increased to a total
of $30.0  million,  from $6.0  million in 1998,  primarily  due to the  minority
partners'   $30.7   million  share  of  the   extraordinary   charges  in  1998.
Distributions of $2.4 million to the Operating Partnership's Series C and Series
D Preferred  Equity owners were made in 1999.  After payment of $16.6 million in
Series A preferred dividends,  net income (loss) available to common shareowners
for 1999 was $8.9 million compared to $(3.0) million in 1998.

Comparison of 1998 to 1997

     Discussion of significant debt and equity transactions,  acquisitions,  and
openings  occurring  in 1998 is  included  in the  Comparison  of 1999 to  1998.
Significant 1997 items are described below.

     In October 1997, the Company used the $200 million public offering of eight
million shares of 8.3% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock to acquire
a  preferred  equity  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership.  The  Operating
Partnership  used the net  proceeds  to pay down debt under  existing  revolving
credit and commercial paper facilities,  which were used to fund the acquisition
of  Regency  Square  in  September   1997.  In  September  1997,  the  Operating
Partnership acquired Regency Square (Regency) shopping center for $123.9 million
in cash.  Additionally,  in November  1997,  the  Operating  Partnership  opened
Arizona Mills, a 37% owned value  super-regional  shopping  center.  In December
1997,  the Operating  Partnership  acquired The Falls  shopping  center for $156
million in cash and the leasehold interest in The Mall at Tuttle Crossing, which
opened in July 1997. These two centers were transferred to GMPT.

     A 135,000  square foot  expansion  opened at Westfarms  in August 1997.  In
addition, approximately 50,000 square feet of new mall stores opened at Biltmore
in 1997.

     The Company's average ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership was
43% for 1998 (including averages of 39% for the period through the GMPT Exchange
and 63% thereafter) and 37% for 1997.

Consolidated Businesses

     Total  revenues for 1998 were $322.3  million,  a $20.7  million,  or 6.9%,
increase over 1997. Minimum rents increased $13.4 million, of which $8.9 million
was due to the opening of Great Lakes  Crossing and the  acquisition of Regency.
Minimum  rents also  increased  because of the  expansion at Biltmore and tenant
rollovers.  Expense recoveries  increased  primarily due to Great Lakes Crossing
and  Regency.  Revenues  from  management,   leasing  and  development  services
increased  primarily  due to the new  management  agreements  with  GMPT.  Other
revenue  increased  primarily due to an increase in gains on sales of peripheral
land and lease cancellation revenue.

     Total operating costs increased $22.8 million,  or 8.6%, to $286.8 million.
Recoverable and other operating  expenses  increased due to Great Lakes Crossing
and Regency.  Other operating  expense also increased due to professional  fees,
management  expense  and an increase  in the charge to  operations  for costs of
unsuccessful and potentially unsuccessful  pre-development  activities.  General
and  administrative  expense  decreased  $2.1  million  between  periods  due to
decreases  in payroll and  reduced  employee  relocation  and  recruiter  costs,
partially  offset by  increases  attributable  to the  phase-in of the long term
compensation plan.

     Interest  expense  increased  due to an  increase  in debt used to  finance
Tuttle Crossing,  the acquisition of The Falls and the redemption of a partner's
interest in the Operating  Partnership,  partially  offset by a decrease in debt
paid down with the proceeds of the October 1997 and April 1998 equity  offerings
and the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT  Exchange.  Depreciation
and amortization expense increased due to Great Lakes Crossing, Tuttle Crossing,
Regency and The Falls,  partially  offset by the  decrease in expense due to the
transferred  centers  only being  included in 1998  through the date of the GMPT
Exchange.

     Revenues  and  expenses  other  than  interest  and  depreciation  for  the
transferred  centers for 1998 represent  operations through the date of the GMPT
Exchange.  The resulting  decreases from 1997 were partially offset by increases
in revenues and expenses due to the  acquisition of The Falls and the opening of
Tuttle Crossing.

     During 1998,  a $10.7  million loss on the  restructuring  was  recognized,
which  primarily  represented  the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations of
personnel.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

     Total revenues for 1998 were $286.3  million,  a $27.5  million,  or 10.6%,
increase  from 1997.  The increase in minimum rents and expense  recoveries  was
primarily due to Arizona Mills and the expansions at Westfarms and Cherry Creek.
Minimum rents also increased due to tenant rollovers. Other revenue decreased by
$1.2 million primarily due to a decrease in gains on peripheral land sales.

     Total  operating  costs  increased by $30.3  million,  or 18.2%,  to $196.7
million  for  1998.  Recoverable  and  depreciation  and  amortization  expenses
increased  primarily due to Arizona Mills and the  expansions.  Other  operating
expense  increased  primarily due to Arizona Mills.  Interest expense  increased
primarily  due to an  increase  in debt used to  finance  Arizona  Mills and the
Westfarms expansion, and a decrease in capitalized interest related to these two
projects.

     Revenues  and  expenses  other  than  interest  and  depreciation  for  the
transferred  centers for 1998 represent the operations of Woodfield  through the
date of the GMPT Exchange, resulting in decreases from the prior year.

     As a result  of the  foregoing,  income  before  extraordinary  item of the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  decreased by $2.7  million,  or 2.9%,  to $89.7
million.  The  Company's  equity  in  income  before  extraordinary  item of the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  was $46.4  million,  a 4.9%  decrease  from the
comparable period in 1997.

   Net Income

     As a result of the  foregoing,  the Company's  income before  extraordinary
items,  minority and preferred interest decreased to $70.4 million for 1998. The
income  allocable to minority  partners  decreased to $6.0  million,  from $57.8
million,   reflecting  the  Company's   increased  ownership  in  the  Operating
Partnership due to the GMPT Exchange and other equity  transactions,  as well as
the minority partners' $30.7 million share of the 1998 extraordinary items.

     Also,  the Company  recognized  its $20.1 million share of $50.8 million in
extraordinary  charges  related to the  extinguishment  of debt,  including debt
extinguished  in  anticipation  of the GMPT  Exchange,  primarily  consisting of
prepayment  premiums.  After  payment  of $16.6  million  in Series A  preferred
dividends, net income (loss) available to common shareowners for 1998 was $(3.0)
million compared to $24.6 million for 1997.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     In the following  discussion,  references to beneficial  interest represent
the  Operating  Partnership's  share  of the  results  of its  consolidated  and
unconsolidated  businesses.  The  Company  does not have,  and has not had,  any
parent company  indebtedness;  all debt discussed represents  obligations of the
Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries and joint ventures.

     The Company  believes that its net cash  provided by operating  activities,
distributions  from its joint  ventures,  the  unutilized  portion of its credit
facilities,  and its ability to access the  capital  markets,  assures  adequate
liquidity  to  conduct  its  operations  in  accordance  with its  dividend  and
financing policies.

     As of December 31,  1999,  the Company had a  consolidated  cash balance of
$20.6  million.  Additionally,  the Company has a secured  $200  million line of
credit.  The line had $63.0  million of  borrowings  as of December 31, 1999 and
expires in September  2001. The Company also has available a second bank line of
credit of up to $40  million.  The line had $17.6  million of  borrowings  as of
December 31, 1999.

Debt and Equity Transactions

     Discussion of  significant  debt and equity  transactions  occurring in the
three years ended  December 31, 1999 is contained in Results of  Operations.  In
addition to the transactions  described therein, the following transactions have
occurred  which will affect the  Company's  liquidity  and capital  resources in
future periods.

     In  October  1999,  the 50%  owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is
developing  Dolphin  Mall  closed  on a $200  million,  three-year  construction
facility.  The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 2%,  decreasing  to LIBOR plus
1.75% when a certain coverage ratio is met. The rate on the loan is capped at 7%
plus credit spread until maturity.  Under the interest rate agreement,  the rate
is swapped  to a fixed  rate of 5.15%  when LIBOR is less than 6%. The  maturity
date may be  extended  one year.  The  balance at  December  31,  1999 was $22.3
million.

     In  November  1999,  the 26% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is
developing   International   Plaza  closed  on  a  $193.5  million,   three-year
construction  financing,  with a  one-year  extension  option.  The  rate on the
facility is LIBOR plus 1.90%. There were no borrowings as of December 31, 1999.

     In January 2000, the Company  finalized an agreement that  securitized  the
$40 million bank line of credit and extended its maturity to August 2000.

     In March 2000, the Company's Board of Directors  authorized the purchase of
up to $50 million of the  Company's  common stock in the open market.  The stock
may be purchased from time to time as market conditions warrant.

Summary of Investing Activities

     Net cash used in investing  activities  was $197.4 million in 1999 compared
to $269.9 million in 1998. Cash used in investing activities was impacted by the
timing  of  capital  expenditures,  with  outflows  in  1999  and  1998  for the
construction of MacArthur Center, Great Lakes Crossing, International Plaza, The
Mall at Wellington Green, The Shops at Willow Bend, as well as other development
activities and other capital items (see Capital  Spending  below).  During 1999,
$18.5  million was used in  purchasing  investments  in  Fashionmall.com,  Inc.,
Swerdlow  Real  Estate  Group,  and  Lord  Associates.  Proceeds  from  sales of
peripheral   land   decreased  in  1999  by  $4.9  million,   to  $1.8  million.
Contributions  to  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures are impacted  primarily by the
timing of construction and expansion activities, which in 1999 and 1998 included
projects at Dolphin  Mall,  International  Plaza,  Cherry  Creek,  Woodland  and
Lakeside.  Distributions  from  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures in 1999 and 1998
included  distributions  from centers  comprised of excess mortgage  refinancing
proceeds  ($45.2  million from Cherry Creek in 1999 and $45.9  million from Fair
Oaks in 1998),  while the loss of  distributions  from Woodfield  after the GMPT
Exchange was offset by increases at other centers.

                                       32
<PAGE>

     Net cash used in investing  activities in 1998 was $269.9 million  compared
to  $178.3  million  in  1997.  As  the  Company's  interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership changed  significantly as a result of the GMPT Exchange (see Results
of Operations - GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions), investing activities of
periods  prior to this  transaction  are not  comparable.  In 1997,  the Company
acquired  its  $200  million   preferred   equity   interest  in  the  Operating
Partnership,  and  received  $21.7  million  of  distributions  from its  equity
investment in the Operating  Partnership in excess of its share of the Operating
Partnership's income.

Summary of Financing Activities

     Financing activities contributed cash of $91.3 million, a decrease of $40.0
million from the $131.3 million in 1998.  Borrowings net of debt  repayments and
issuance costs decreased by $244.5 million to $100.9 million, while net proceeds
from equity  offerings  increased by $71.3  million to $100.4  million.  The net
decrease  in the debt and  equity  sources  of  $173.2  million  was  offset  by
decreases in cash used in 1999 compared to 1998 in connection with (i) the $77.7
million  partner  redemption in January 1998, (ii) the greater amount of partner
distributions  made in 1998 due the Company's  larger  pre-GMPT  Exchange equity
base, and (iii) transaction costs incurred in connection with the GMPT Exchange.

     Net cash  provided  by  financing  activities  in 1998 was  $131.3  million
compared to $149.3 million in 1997.  Financing  activities for 1998 and 1997 are
not  comparable  due to the GMPT  Exchange.  In 1997,  the  Company  issued $200
million of 8.3%  preferred  stock,  for which 1998  reflects a complete  year of
dividends.

Beneficial Interest in Debt

   At December 31, 1999,  the Operating  Partnership's  debt and its  beneficial
interest  in the debt of its  Consolidated  and  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures
totaled $1,300.2 million. As shown in the following table, there was no unhedged
floating  rate debt at December  31, 1999.  Interest  rates shown do not include
amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items
are reported as interest expense in the results of operations. In the aggregate,
these costs added 0.42% to the effective rate of interest on beneficial interest
in debt at December 31, 1999.  Included in  beneficial  interest in debt is debt
used to fund development and expansion costs.  Beneficial  interest in assets on
which  interest is being  capitalized  totaled $257.1 million as of December 31,
1999. Beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $15.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999.

Sensitivity Analysis

     The Company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt  obligations and
interest  rate  instruments.  Based on the  Operating  Partnership's  beneficial
interest  in debt and  interest  rates in effect at  December  31,  1999,  a one
percent  increase in interest  rates on floating  rate debt would  decrease cash
flows by  approximately  $2.9  million  and,  due to the  effect of  capitalized
interest,  annual earnings by approximately $2.2 million. A one percent decrease
in interest  rates on floating  rate debt would  increase  cash flows and annual
earnings by approximately $4.3 million and $3.3 million, respectively.  Based on
the  Company's  consolidated  debt and interest  rates in effect at December 31,
1999, a one percent  increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of
debt by  approximately  $13  million,  while a one percent  decrease in interest
rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $32 million.

Covenants and Commitments

     Certain loan agreements  contain various  restrictive  covenants  including
limitations  on net worth,  minimum  debt  service  and fixed  charges  coverage
ratios, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, and a minimum debt yield ratio,
the  latter  being  the  most  restrictive.  The  Operating  Partnership  is  in
compliance with all of such covenants.

     Payment of principal  and interest on the Great Lakes  Crossing,  MacArthur
Center,   and   International   Plaza  loans  is  guaranteed  by  the  Operating
Partnership.  The total amount  outstanding on these loans was $285.2 million at
December  31,  1999.  The new investor in the  International  Plaza  venture has
indemnified the Operating  Partnership to the extent of approximately 25% of the
amounts guaranteed on the International Plaza loan. In addition,  the payment of
principal  and interest on the Arizona  Mills' debt is guaranteed by each of the
owners  of  Arizona  Mills  to  the  extent  of  its  ownership.  The  Operating
Partnership's  guaranty of principal on the Arizona Mills loan was $13.1 million
at December 31, 1999. The Operating  Partnership has also guaranteed the payment
of 50% of principal  and  interest on the Dolphin Mall loan.  The balance on the
Dolphin  Mall loan was $22.3  million  at  December  31,  1999.  All of the loan
agreements  provide for a reduction of the amount  guaranteed as certain  center
performance and valuation criteria are met.

Funds from Operations

     A principal factor that the Company  considers in determining  dividends to
shareowners is Funds from  Operations  (FFO),  which is defined as income before
extraordinary and unusual items, real estate depreciation and amortization,  and
the  allocation  to the minority  interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  less
preferred dividends and distributions.

     Funds from  Operations  does not represent cash flows from  operations,  as
defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be
considered  to be an  alternative  to net income as an  indicator  of  operating
performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However,
the National  Association of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts suggests that Funds
from Operations is a useful  supplemental  measure of operating  performance for
REITs.

     In October 1999,  NAREIT approved certain  clarifications of the definition
of  FFO,   including   that   non-recurring   items  that  are  not  defined  as
"extraordinary"   under  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  should  be
reflected in the  calculation  of FFO.  The  clarified  definition  is effective
January 1, 2000 and restatement of all periods  presented is recommended.  Under
the clarified  definition,  the Company would have included in FFO, for the year
ended  December 31, 1998,  the $10.7 million  restructuring  charge  (Results of
Operations  -  GMPT  Exchange  and  Related   Transactions),   resulting  in  an
approximate  $0.09  decrease to the  Company's  FFO per share  reported for that
period. There would have been no change to the amounts reported for 1999.

Dividends

     The Company  pays  regular  quarterly  dividends to its common and Series A
preferred shareowners. Dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion
of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash  available to the Company,  its
financial condition,  capital and other requirements,  and such other factors as
the Board of Directors deems relevant.  Preferred dividends accrue regardless of
whether earnings, cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit
the current payment of dividends.

     On December 9, 1999,  the Company  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.245
per common share payable  January 20, 2000 to  shareowners of record on December
31, 1999. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.51875
per share on the Company's 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock, paid December 31, 1999
to shareowners of record on December 21, 1999.

     Common dividends declared totaled $0.965 per common share in 1999, of which
$0.4534 represented return of capital and $0.5116  represented  ordinary income,
compared  to  dividends  declared in 1998 of $0.945 per common  share,  of which
$0.854 represented return of capital and $0.091 represented ordinary income. The
tax status of total 2000 common dividends declared and to be declared,  assuming
continuation of a $0.245 per common share quarterly dividend, is estimated to be
approximately  40% return of capital,  and  approximately  60% ordinary  income.
Series A preferred  dividends  declared were $2.075 per preferred  share in 1999
and 1998, all of which represented ordinary income. The tax status of total 2000
dividends  to be paid on  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  is  estimated  to be 100%
ordinary income.  These are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant
factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,  including:  1) the
amount of dividends  declared;  2) changes in the Company's share of anticipated
taxable  income of the Operating  Partnership  due to the actual  results of the
Operating  Partnership;  3) changes in the number of the  Company's  outstanding
shares;  4) property  acquisitions or dispositions;  5) financing  transactions,
including  refinancing of existing debt; and 6) changes in the Internal  Revenue
Code or its application.

     The annual  determination  of the  Company's  common  dividends is based on
anticipated Funds from Operations available after preferred  dividends,  as well
as financing considerations and other appropriate factors.  Further, the Company
has decided that the growth in common  dividends will be less than the growth in
Funds from Operations for the immediate future.

     Any inability of the Operating  Partnership or its Joint Ventures to secure
financing as required to fund maturing debts,  capital  expenditures and changes
in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require
the utilization of cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly reducing
distributions  to partners of the Operating  Partnership  and funds available to
the Company for the payment of dividends.

Capital Spending

     Capital  spending  for  routine  maintenance  of the  shopping  centers  is
generally recovered from tenants. Capital spending not recovered from tenants is
summarized in the following tables:

     The Shops at Willow  Bend,  a new 1.4  million  square  foot  center  under
construction  in Plano,  Texas,  will be anchored by Neiman  Marcus,  Saks Fifth
Avenue, Lord & Taylor, Foley's and Dillard's. The center is scheduled to open in
August 2001; Saks Fifth Avenue will open in 2004. The Mall at Wellington  Green,
a 1.3 million square foot center under  construction  in west Palm Beach County,
Florida, will be anchored by Nordstrom, Lord & Taylor, Burdine's,  Dillard's and
JCPenney.  The center,  scheduled  to open in October  2001,  will be owned by a
joint venture in which the Operating Partnership has a 90% controlling interest.
In September 1999, the Company  finalized a partnership  agreement with Swerdlow
Real Estate Group to jointly  develop  Dolphin  Mall, a 1.4 million  square foot
value regional center located in Miami, Florida. The center is scheduled to open
in March 2001.

     Additionally,  the Company is  developing  International  Plaza,  a new 1.3
million square foot center under construction in Tampa, Florida. The center will
be anchored by Nordstrom,  Lord & Taylor,  Dillard's and Neiman  Marcus,  and is
scheduled to open in September  2001.  The Company  originally had a controlling
50.1% interest in the partnership  (Tampa Westshore) that owns the project.  The
Company was responsible for providing the funding for project costs in excess of
construction  financing in exchange for a preferential return. In November 1999,
the Company entered into agreements with a new investor,  which provided funding
for the  project  and  thereby  reduced  the  Company's  ownership  interest  to
approximately  26%.  It  is  anticipated  that  given  the  preferential  return
arrangements,  the original  49.9% owner in Tampa  Westshore  will not initially
receive  cash  distributions.  The  Company  expects to be  initially  allocated
approximately 33% of the net operating income of the project, with an additional
7% representing return of capital.

     The total cost of these four projects is anticipated to be approximately $1
billion.   The  Company's   beneficial   investment  in  the  projects  will  be
approximately $700 million, as three of these projects are joint ventures. While
the Company intends to finance  approximately 75 percent of each new center with
construction  debt,  the  Company has a greater  responsibility  for the project
equity  (approximately $230 million).  Approximately $215 million of this amount
has been funded through the Operating  Partnership's preferred equity offerings,
contributions  from the new joint  venture  partner in the  International  Plaza
project,  and borrowing under the Company's lines of credit. With respect to the
construction  loan  financing,  the Company has closed on financing  for Dolphin
Mall and International  Plaza. The financings on the two remaining  projects are
expected to be completed in 2000.

     Additionally, a 21-screen theater will be added at Fairlane, in the Detroit
metropolitan area and is anticipated to open in the spring of 2000. At Fair Oaks
in the Washington, D.C. area, Hecht's expansion will open in the spring of 2000,
and a JCPenney  expansion and a newly constructed  Macy's store will open in the
fall of 2000. The Operating Partnership's share of the cost of these projects is
expected to be approximately $9.8 million.

     The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance
to develop value  super-regional  projects in major  metropolitan  markets.  The
ten-year  agreement  calls for the two  companies to jointly  develop and own at
least seven of these centers,  each representing  approximately  $200 million of
capital  investment.  A number of  locations  across the nation are targeted for
future initiatives.

development  projects  scheduled to be completed in 2001 will be as much as $220
million.  Estimates of future capital spending include only projects approved by
the Company's Board of Directors and, consequently, estimates will change as new
projects are approved.  Estimates regarding capital expenditures presented above
are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors could cause the
actual  results to differ  materially,  including  but not limited to: 1) actual
results of negotiations with anchors, tenants and contractors; 2) changes in the
scope and number of projects;  3) cost overruns;  4) timing of expenditures;  5)
financing considerations; and 6) actual time to complete projects.

Year 2000 Matters

     All  of  the  Company's  financial,  information  and  operational  systems
performed and continue to perform satisfactorily with the onset of calendar year
2000.  The Company had  developed a detailed  plan to address the risks posed by
the year 2000 issue, as such issue was likely to impact both its own systems and
those of third parties with which the Company  conducts  business.  The costs of
addressing year 2000 issues were not material to 1998 or 1999 operations.

Cash Tender Agreement

     A. Alfred  Taubman has the annual  right to tender to the Company  units of
partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership  (provided that the aggregate
value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered
interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the
trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender
Agreement).  At A. Alfred Taubman's  election,  his family, and Robert C. Larson
and his family may  participate in tenders.  The Company will have the option to
pay for  these  interests  from  available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the
proceeds of an offering of the Company's  common stock.  Generally,  the Company
expects to finance these purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock.
The  tendering  partner will bear all market risk if the market price at closing
is less than the purchase price and will bear the costs of sale. Any proceeds of
the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the
Company.

     Based on a market  value at December  31, 1999 of $10.75 per common  share,
the  aggregate  value of  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  that may be
tendered under the Cash Tender  Agreement was  approximately  $259 million.  The
purchase  of these  interests  at December  31, 1999 would have  resulted in the
Company owning an additional 28% interest in the Operating Partnership.

New Accounting Pronouncements

     In December  1999,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial  Statements" (SAB
101). SAB 101 requires that a lessor defer  recognition  of percentage  rents in
quarterly periods until the specified target (typically gross sales in excess of
a certain  amount) that  triggers  this type of rental  income is achieved.  The
Company had  previously  accrued  interim  contingent  rental income as lessees'
specified  sales  targets  were met or  achievement  of the  sales  targets  was
probable.  The Company adopted the accounting method set forth in SAB 101 during
the fourth  quarter of 1999.  Although  the adoption had no impact on annual net
income,  the Company  restated the results of the first three  quarters of 1999.
The effect of the  restatement  was to reduce net income by $0.3 million  ($0.01
per diluted  common share),  $1.2 million ($0.02 per diluted common share),  and
$1.2 million ($0.02 per diluted common share) for the first,  second,  and third
quarters of 1999,  respectively,  and to increase  fourth quarter income and per
share amounts by $2.7 million and $0.05 per share, respectively.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  133
requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and
liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of
the  derivatives and whether it qualifies for hedge  accounting.  The Company is
still  evaluating  the  impact  of  SFAS  133  on  its  consolidated   financial
statements.  SFAS 133 is  effective  for fiscal years  beginning  after June 15,
2000.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT



Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.

     We have audited the accompanying  balance sheets of Taubman  Centers,  Inc.
(the "Company") as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related  statements of
operations,  shareowners'  equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period  ended  December  31, 1999.  Our audits also  included the  financial
statement  schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial  statements
and  financial  statement  schedules  are the  responsibility  of the  Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  such financial  statements present fairly, in all material
respects,  the financial  position of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. as of December 31,
1999 and 1998,  and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1999 in  conformity  with
generally accepted accounting  principles.  Also, in our opinion, such financial
statement  schedules,  when  considered  in  relation  to  the  basic  financial
statements  taken as a whole,  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the
information set forth therein.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       Three Years Ended December 31, 1999

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Basis of Presentation

     Taubman Centers, Inc. (the Company or TCO), a real estate investment trust,
or REIT,  is the managing  general  partner of The Taubman  Realty Group Limited
Partnership (the Operating  Partnership or TRG). The Operating Partnership is an
operating  subsidiary  that  engages  in  the  ownership,  management,  leasing,
acquisition,  development, and expansion of regional retail shopping centers and
interests therein. The Operating Partnership's portfolio as of December 31, 1999
includes 17 urban and suburban shopping centers in seven states. Four additional
centers are under construction in Florida and Texas.

     On September  30,  1998,  the Company  obtained a majority and  controlling
interest in the Operating  Partnership as a result of a transaction in which the
Operating Partnership exchanged interests in 10 shopping centers,  together with
$990 million of its debt, for all of the partnership  units owned by two General
Motors pension trusts (GMPT),  representing  approximately  37% of the Operating
Partnership's equity (the GMPT Exchange) (Note 2).

     The consolidated  balance sheet of the Company includes all accounts of the
Company,  the  Operating  Partnership  and its  consolidated  subsidiaries;  all
intercompany  balances have been  eliminated.  Investments in joint ventures not
unilaterally  controlled by ownership or contractual obligation  (Unconsolidated
Joint  Ventures) are accounted for under the equity  method.  The  statements of
operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 include
the Operating Partnership as a consolidated  subsidiary for the entire year. The
statements  of  operations  and cash flows for the year ended  December 31, 1997
reflect the  financial  position  and  results of  operations  of the  Operating
Partnership under the equity method.

     Since the Company's interest in the Operating Partnership has been its sole
material  asset  throughout all periods  presented,  references in the following
notes  to  "the  Company"  include  the  Operating  Partnership,   except  where
intercompany  transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted,  even though the
Operating  Partnership did not become a consolidated  subsidiary until September
30, 1998.

     Dollar  amounts  presented  in tables  within  the  notes to the  financial
statements are stated in thousands of dollars, except share data or as otherwise
noted.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Income Taxes

     Federal income taxes are not provided  because the Company operates in such
a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the  provisions  of the Internal  Revenue
Code; therefore,  applicable taxable income is included in the taxable income of
its  shareowners,  to the extent  distributed  by the  Company.  As a REIT,  the
Company  must  distribute  at  least  95%  of its  REIT  taxable  income  to its
shareowners and meet certain other requirements.  Additionally, no provision for
income taxes for consolidated  partnerships has been made, as such taxes are the
responsibility of the individual partners.

     Dividends  per common share  declared in 1999 were $0.965,  of which $0.453
represented return of capital and $0.512 represented ordinary income.  Dividends
per common  share  declared in 1998 were  $0.945,  of which  $0.854  represented
return of capital and $0.091 represented  ordinary income.  Dividends per common
share  declared  in 1997 were  $0.925,  of which  $0.324  represented  return of
capital and $0.601 represented  ordinary income. The tax status of the Company's
common dividends in 1999, 1998 and 1997 may not be indicative of future periods.
Dividends  per  Series A  preferred  share  declared  in both 1999 and 1998 were
$2.075,  all of which represented  ordinary income.  The difference  between net
income for financial  reporting  purposes and taxable income  results  primarily
from differences in depreciation expense.

     Shopping center space is generally leased to specialty retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on the  straight-line  method.  Percentage  rent is
accrued when lessees'  specified sales targets have been met (Note 14).  Expense
recoveries,  which include an  administrative  fee, are recognized as revenue in
the period applicable costs are chargeable to tenants.  Management,  leasing and
development revenue is recognized as services are rendered.

Depreciation and Amortization

     Buildings,  improvements  and equipment are depreciated on straight-line or
double-declining  balance bases over the  estimated  useful lives of the assets,
which range from 3 to 50 years. Tenant allowances and deferred leasing costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases.

Capitalization

     Costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement
of properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction
is  substantially  complete.  Assets are  reviewed for  impairment  if events or
changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amounts  may  not  be
recoverable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Deferred Charges

     Direct financing and interest rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

     Stock-based  compensation  plans are  accounted  for under APB  Opinion 25,
"Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees"  and related  interpretations,  as
permitted under FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."

Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

     Premiums paid for interest rate caps are amortized to interest expense over
the terms of the cap agreements.  Amounts  received under the cap agreements are
accounted  for on an accrual  basis,  and  recognized as a reduction of interest
expense.

Partners' Equity of TRG Allocable to Minority Partners

     Because the net equity of the  partnership  unitholders  is less than zero,
the interest of the noncontrolling unitholders is presented as a zero balance in
the balance  sheet as of December  31, 1999 and December  31,  1998.  Also,  for
periods   subsequent  to  the  GMPT  Exchange,   the  income  allocated  to  the
noncontrolling  unitholders  is equal to their share of  distributions.  The net
equity of the  Operating  Partnership  unitholders  is less than zero because of
accumulated  distributions  in  excess  of net  income  and not as a  result  of
operating losses.  Distributions to partners are usually greater than net income
because net income includes non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization.

Use of Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets,  liabilities  and
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements,  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of financial instruments:

     The  carrying  value of cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  and  notes
     receivable,  and accounts payable  approximates fair value due to the short
     maturity of these instruments.

     The fair  value of debt is  estimated  based on  quoted  market  prices  if
     available,  or on the current  rates  available  to the Company for debt of
     similar terms and maturity and the assumption  that debt will be prepaid at
     the earliest possible date.

     The fair value of interest rate hedging  instruments is the amount that the
     Company  would  receive or pay to terminate  the agreement at the reporting
     date, taking into account current interest rates.

Operating Segment

     The Company has one reportable  operating  segment;  it owns,  develops and
manages  regional  shopping  centers.  The shopping centers are located in major
metropolitan  areas,  have similar tenants (most of which are national  chains),
and share common economic  characteristics.  No single retail company represents
10% or more of the Company's revenues.

Reclassifications

     Certain  prior  year  amounts  have been  reclassified  to  conform to 1999
classifications.

Note 2 - The GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions

     On September 30, 1998, the Company  obtained a controlling  interest in the
Operating   Partnership  due  to  the  following   transaction.   The  Operating
Partnership  transferred  interests  in 10 shopping  centers  (nine wholly owned
(Briarwood,  Columbus  City  Center,  The  Falls,  Hilltop,  Lakeforest,  Marley
Station,  Meadowood Mall,  Stoneridge,  and The Mall at Tuttle Crossing) and one
Unconsolidated Joint Venture  (Woodfield)),  together with $990 million of debt,
for all of the partnership units of GMPT  (approximately 50 million units with a
fair value of $675  million,  based on the average  stock price of the Company's
common  shares of $13.50 for the two week period prior to the closing) (the GMPT
Exchange). The Operating Partnership continues to manage the transferred centers
under agreements with GMPT (Note 10).

     As of the date of the GMPT  Exchange,  the excess of the Company's  cost of
its  investment in the  Operating  Partnership  over the Company's  share of the
Operating Partnership's  accumulated deficit was $390.4 million, of which $176.6
million  and  $213.8  million  were  allocated  to the  Company's  bases  in the
Operating  Partnership's  properties  and  investment  in  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures, respectively.

     In September  1998, in  anticipation  of the GMPT  Exchange,  the Operating
Partnership  used the $1.2 billion  proceeds from two bridge loans to extinguish
approximately  $1.1 billion of debt. The remaining  proceeds were used primarily
to pay prepayment  premiums and transaction  costs. An  extraordinary  charge of
approximately $49.8 million,  consisting primarily of prepayment  premiums,  was
incurred in connection with the extinguishment of the debt.

     The balance on the first bridge loan of $902 million was assumed by GMPT in
connection with the GMPT Exchange. The second loan had a balance of $340 million
as of December 31, 1998 and was  refinanced  during the first half of 1999 (Note
7).

     Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange, the Operating Partnership committed to
a restructuring of its operations. A restructuring charge of approximately $10.7
million was incurred,  primarily  representing  the cost of certain  involuntary
terminations of personnel.  Pursuant to the restructuring plan, approximately 40
employees were terminated across various administrative functions.  During 1998,
termination  benefits of $6.1 million  were paid.  Substantially  all  remaining
benefits were paid by the end of the first quarter of 1999.

     Net income and  distributions  of the Operating  Partnership  are allocable
first to the preferred equity interests (Note 11), and the remaining  amounts to
the general and limited Operating  Partnership partners in accordance with their
percentage  ownership.  Prior to 1998,  when the Company  obtained a controlling
interest in the Operating  Partnership  (Note 2), the Company  accounted for its
investment in the Operating Partnership under the equity method.

     The  Company's  income from its  investment  in the  Operating  Partnership
included  $4.1  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997 from its Series A
Preferred Equity interest in the Operating Partnership (Note 11).  Additionally,
the Company's share of the Operating  Partnership's  income before extraordinary
items available to partnership  unitholders for 1997 was $33.5 million,  reduced
by $8.2 million,  representing adjustments arising from the Company's additional
basis in the Operating Partnership's net assets.

     The Company is developing  International  Plaza,  a 1.3 million square foot
regional center under construction in Tampa, Florida,  which is expected to open
September 2001. The Company  originally had a controlling  50.1% interest in the
partnership (Tampa Westshore) that owns the project. The Company was responsible
for providing funding for project costs in excess of the construction  financing
in  exchange  for  a  preferential  return.  In  November  1999,  the  Operating
Partnership entered into agreements with a new investor,  which provided funding
for the project and thereby  reduced the  Company's  ownership to  approximately
26%.  Also,  in  November  1999,  Tampa  Westshore  closed on a $193.5  million,
three-year construction financing, with a one-year extension option. The rate on
the facility is LIBOR plus 1.90%.  The Operating  Partnership has guaranteed the
payment of 100% of the  principal  and  interest.  The new investor in the Tampa
venture has  indemnified  the Operating  Partnership to the extent of 25% of the
amounts  guaranteed.  The loan agreement provides for reductions of the rate and
the amount guaranteed as certain center performance  criteria are met. There was
no balance outstanding at December 31, 1999.

     In September  1999, the Company  entered into a partnership  agreement with
Swerdlow Real Estate Group to jointly develop Dolphin Mall, a 1.4 million square
foot value regional  center under  construction in Miami,  Florida,  expected to
open March 2001. In October 1999,  the joint venture that is developing  Dolphin
Mall closed on a $200 million, three-year construction facility. The rate on the
facility  is LIBOR  plus 2%,  decreasing  to LIBOR  plus  1.75%  when a  certain
coverage ratio is met. The Operating  Partnership  has guaranteed the payment of
50% of any  outstanding  principal  balance  and 100% of all  accrued and unpaid
interest.  The guaranty will be reduced as certain  performance  conditions  are
met.  The  maturity  date on the loan may be  extended  one  year.  The  balance
outstanding was $22.3 million at December 31, 1999.

     During 1999, noncash investing activities included a total of $58.7 million
contributed to the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures developing  International Plaza
and Dolphin Mall. This amount primarily consists of project costs expended prior
to the creation of the joint ventures.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

     Arizona  Mills,   L.L.C.  has  a  construction   facility  with  a  maximum
availability  of $142 million,  all of which was  outstanding as of December 31,
1999.  The payment of principal and interest is guaranteed by each of the owners
of Arizona  Mills to the extent of their  ownership,  with  reduction in amounts
guaranteed being provided as certain center  performance and valuation  criteria
are met. The Operating  Partnership's guaranty of principal was $13.1 million at
December 31, 1999.

     During  1999  and  1998,  the   Unconsolidated   Joint  Ventures   incurred
extraordinary   charges  related  to  the  extinguishment  of  debt,   primarily
consisting of prepayment premiums.

     The Company's  carrying  value of its  Investment in  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures  differs  from its share of the  deficiency  in assets  reported in the
combined  balance  sheet of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  due to (i) the
Company's  cost of its investment in excess of the historical net book values of
the  Unconsolidated   Joint  Ventures  and  (ii)  the  Operating   Partnership's
adjustments  to the  book  basis,  including  intercompany  profits  on sales of
services  that  are  capitalized  by  the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  The
Company's  additional  basis allocated to depreciable  assets is recognized on a
straight-line  basis over 40 years. The Operating  Partnership's  differences in
bases are amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.

     Combined balance sheet and results of operations  information are presented
below (in  thousands) for all  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures,  followed by the
Operating  Partnership's   beneficial  interest  in  the  combined  information.
Beneficial interest is calculated based on the Operating Partnership's ownership
interest in each of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. The accounts of Woodfield
Associates,  formerly a 50%  Unconsolidated  Joint Venture  transferred  to GMPT
(Note 2), are included in these results through  September 30, 1998, the date of
the GMPT Exchange.

Extraordinary Items

     During the year ended December 31, 1999, extraordinary charges to income of
$0.5 million were  recognized in  connection  with the  extinguishment  of debt.
During 1998,  extraordinary  charges of $50.8 million were recognized related to
the extinguishment of debt, primarily in connection with the GMPT Exchange.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

     The Company enters into interest rate  agreements to reduce its exposure to
changes  in the  cost of its  floating  rate  debt.  The  derivative  agreements
generally match the notional  amounts,  reset dates and rate bases of the hedged
debt to assure the  effectiveness  of the derivatives in reducing  interest rate
risk. As of December 31, 1999, the following  interest rate cap agreements  were
outstanding:

                              Frequency
       Notional     LIBOR      of Rate
        Amount     Cap Rate    Resets                     Term

       170,000       6.0%      Monthly       September 1999 through August 2000
        84,000       6.5%      Monthly       September 1999 through October 2000

     The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the
counterparties to its interest rate cap agreements, but has no off-balance sheet
risk of loss. The Company anticipates that its counterparties will fully perform
their obligations under the agreements.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments Related to Debt

     The estimated fair values of financial instruments at December 31, 1999 and

Note 8 - Leases

Operating Leases

     Shopping center space is leased to tenants and certain anchors  pursuant to
lease agreements.  Tenant leases typically provide for guaranteed  minimum rent,
percentage  rent,  and other charges to cover certain  operating  costs.  Future
minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 1999 for operating
centers,  assuming no new or renegotiated  leases or option extensions on anchor
agreements, is summarized as follows:

                    2000                        $   137,065
                    2001                            132,046
                    2002                            125,614
                    2003                            114,567
                    2004                             98,968
                    Thereafter                      349,017

     Certain  shopping  centers,  as  lessees,  have ground  leases  expiring at
various dates through the year 2065. In addition,  the Company leases its office
facilities.  Rental payments under ground and office leases were $7.0 million in
1999 and $8.9 million in 1998.  Included in this amount are related party office
rental payments of $2.7 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

     The table above  includes $2.6 million,  $2.7 million,  $2.8 million,  $2.8
million,  $2.8 million and $0.9 million of related party amounts in 2000,  2001,
2002, 2003, 2004, and thereafter.

Memorial City Mall Lease

     In 1996,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into an  agreement to lease
Memorial  City Mall,  a 1.4  million  square  foot  shopping  center  located in
Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that enabled the
Operating  Partnership to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities and
terminate the lease  obligations in the event such  redevelopment  opportunities
were not deemed to be sufficient.  In November  1999, the Operating  Partnership
exercised its option to terminate the lease.  Under the terms of the lease,  the
Operating Partnership will continue to manage the center until May 2000.

Note 9 - Transactions with Affiliates

     The revenue from management, leasing and development services includes $2.5
million and $3.2 million from  transactions  with affiliates for the years ended
December  31, 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  Accounts  receivable  from  related
parties    includes    amounts   related   to   reimbursement   of   third-party
(non-affiliated) costs.

     During 1997,  the Operating  Partnership  acquired an option from a related
party to purchase  certain real estate on which the  Operating  Partnership  may
develop a shopping  center.  The option  agreement  requires  option payments of
$150,000  during each of the first five years,  $400,000 in the sixth year,  and
$500,000 in the seventh year. If the Operating Partnership exercises the option,
the purchase  price for the property will be between $5 million and $10 million,
depending upon the year of purchase. While the optionor will have no interest in
the shopping  center  itself,  the optionor may,  under  certain  circumstances,
participate in the proceeds from the Operating  Partnership's  future sales,  if
any, of the peripheral land contiguous to the shopping center.

   Other related party transactions are described in Notes 8 and 10.

Note 10 - The Manager

     The  Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the  Manager),  which  is 99%
beneficially owned by the Operating  Partnership,  provides property management,
leasing,  development  and other  administrative  services to the  Company,  the
shopping  centers,  and Taubman  affiliates.  In addition,  the Manager provides
services  to  centers  transferred  to GMPT  under  management  agreements.  The
management agreements are cancelable with 90 days notice.

     The Manager has a voluntary  retirement saving plan established in 1983 and
amended and restated effective January 1, 1994 (the Plan). The Plan is qualified
in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code (the Code).  The
Manager  contributes  an  amount  equal  to 2% of  the  qualified  wages  of all
qualified employees and matches employee  contributions in excess of 2% up to 7%
of  qualified   wages.   In  addition,   the  Manager  may  make   discretionary
contributions  within the limits prescribed by the Plan and imposed in the Code.
Costs relating to the Plan were $1.6 million in 1999 and $1.7 million in 1998.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


     The Operating Partnership has an incentive option plan for employees of the
Manager.  Currently,  options for 7.7 million Operating Partnership units may be
issued under the plan,  including  options  outstanding  for 7.4 million  units.
Incentive options generally become exercisable to the extent of one-third of the
units on each of the  third,  fourth,  and  fifth  anniversaries  of the date of
grant.  Options  expire  ten  years  from  the  date  of  grant.  The  Operating
Partnership's  units issued in  connection  with the  incentive  option plan are
exchangeable for shares of the Company's common stock under the Continuing Offer
(Note 12).

     A summary of the status of the plan as of  December  31,  1999 and 1998 and
changes during the years ending on those dates are presented below:

                         =========                    =========


     Options outstanding at December 31, 1999 have a remaining  weighted-average
contractual  life of 4.2 years and range in exercise price from $9.39 to $13.89.
The  weighted  average  fair value per unit of options  granted  during 1999 was
$1.24.  The Company used a binomial  option pricing model to determine the grant
date fair value based on the following  assumptions:  volatility rate of 20.43%,
risk-free  rate  of  return  of  approximately  5.26%,  and  dividend  yield  of
approximately 7.8%.

     The  Company  applies  APB  Opinion  25  and  related   interpretations  in
accounting for the plan. The exercise price of all options  outstanding  granted
under the plan was equal to market value on the date of grant.  Accordingly,  no
compensation expense has been recognized for the plan. Had compensation cost for
the plan been  determined  based on the fair  value of the  options at the grant
dates,  consistent with the method of FAS Statement 123, the pro forma effect on
the Company's earnings and earnings per share would have been approximately $0.7
million,  or $0.01 per share in 1999, and approximately $0.1 million,  or $0.002
per share, in 1998.

     Effective  January 1, 1996 and amended January 1, 1999, the Manager adopted
The Taubman Company Long-Term Performance Compensation Plan. Annually,  eligible
employees will be granted notional shares,  the ultimate number of which will be
based on the employee's performance.  These awards, which will vest on the third
anniversary of the date of grant,  will also accrue dividend  equivalents in the
form of additional  notional shares.  The awards will be paid to the employee in
cash upon vesting, based on the value of the Company's common shares, unless the
employee  elects to defer payment as provided in the plan. The cost of this plan
was approximately $3.8 million for 1999 and $6.6 million for 1998.

Note 11 - Preferred Stock and Preferred Equity of TRG

     In October 1997,  the Company used the proceeds from a $200 million  public
offering  of  eight  million  shares  of 8.3%  Series  A  Cumulative  Redeemable
Preferred  Stock  (Series A  Preferred  Stock) to  acquire a Series A  Preferred
Equity interest in the Operating Partnership that entitles the Company to income
and distributions  (in the form of guaranteed  payments) in amounts equal to the
dividends payable on the Company's Series A Preferred Stock.

     The  Series A  Preferred  Stock has no  stated  maturity,  sinking  fund or
mandatory  redemption and is not  convertible  into any other  securities of the
Company.  The Series A  Preferred  Stock has a  liquidation  preference  of $200
million ($25 per share).  Dividends are  cumulative and accrue at an annual rate
of 8.3% from the date of the original issuance, October 3, 1997, and are payable
in arrears  on or before  the last day of each  calendar  quarter.  All  accrued
dividends  have been paid.  The Series A Preferred  Stock can be redeemed by the
Company  beginning in October 2002 at $25 per share plus any accrued  dividends.
The redemption  price can be paid solely out of the sale of capital stock of the
Company.

     In connection with the GMPT Exchange, the Company became obligated to issue
to  the  minority   interest,   upon   subscription,   one  share  of  Series  B
Non-Participating  Convertible  Preferred  Stock (Series B Preferred  Stock) for
each of the  Operating  Partnership  units held by the minority  interest.  Each
share of Series B Preferred Stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters
submitted  to the  Company's  shareholders.  The  holders of Series B  Preferred
Stock,  voting as a class,  have the right to designate up to four  nominees for
election as  directors  of the  Company.  On all other  matters,  including  the
election of  directors,  the holders of Series B Preferred  Stock will vote with
the holders of common  stock.  The  holders of Series B Preferred  Stock are not
entitled to dividends or earnings.  Under  certain  circumstances,  the Series B
Preferred Stock is convertible  into common stock at a ratio of 14,000 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock for one share of common stock.

     In September 1999 and November 1999,  the Operating  Partnership  completed
private placements of $75 million 9% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership
Equity  (Series C Preferred  Equity) and $25  million 9%  Cumulative  Redeemable
Preferred Partnership Equity (Series D Preferred Equity), respectively. Both the
Series  C  and  Series  D  Preferred  Equity  were  purchased  by  institutional
investors, and have a fixed 9% coupon rate, no stated maturity,  sinking fund or
mandatory redemption requirements.

     The holders of Series C Preferred Equity have the right, beginning in 2009,
to exchange  $75 in  liquidation  value of such equity for one share of Series C
Preferred  Stock.  The holders of the Series D Preferred  Equity have the right,
beginning in 2009, to exchange $100 in liquidation  value of such equity for one
share of Series D Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock and
Series D  Preferred  Stock are  substantially  similar  to those of the Series C
Preferred  Equity and Series D  Preferred  Equity.  Like the Series A  Preferred
Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock are non-voting.
In connection with each private  placement,  the Company covenanted to amend its
Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  to increase the total number of authorized
shares of Preferred Stock and to increase the total number of shares  designated
as Series C  Preferred  Stock and  Series D  Preferred  Stock,  to a minimum  of
2,000,000  shares and  250,000  shares,  respectively.  The  Company has further
covenanted,  once  additional  shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock and Series D
Preferred Stock are available for issuance, to in each case lower the applicable
exchange  ratio  and to  issue  more  shares  with  each  share  having  a lower
liquidation  value.  The aggregate  amount in  liquidation  value of each of the
Series C Preferred  Stock and Series D  Preferred  Stock will remain $75 million
and $25 million, respectively.

Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies

     At the time of the Company's  initial public offering (IPO) and acquisition
of its partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership,  the Company entered
into an agreement with A. Alfred Taubman,  who owns an interest in the Operating
Partnership,  whereby he has the annual right to tender to the Company Operating
Partnership  units  (provided that the aggregate  value is at least $50 million)
and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered  interests  at a purchase  price
based on a market  valuation  of the  Company on the  trading  date  immediately
preceding the date of the tender (the Cash Tender  Agreement).  The Company will
have the option to pay for these interests from available  cash,  borrowed funds
or from the proceeds of an offering of the Company's  common  stock.  Generally,
the Company expects to finance these purchases through the sale of new shares of
its stock.  The tendering  partner will bear all market risk if the market price
at closing is less than the purchase  price and will bear the costs of sale. Any
proceeds of the  offering in excess of the  purchase  price will be for the sole
benefit of the Company. At A. Alfred Taubman's  election,  his family and Robert
C. Larson and his family may participate in tenders.

     Based on a market  value at December  31, 1999 of $10.75 per common  share,
the  aggregate  value of  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  that may be
tendered under the Cash Tender  Agreement was  approximately  $259 million.  The
purchase  of these  interests  at December  31, 1999 would have  resulted in the
Company owning an additional 28% interest in the Operating Partnership.

     The Company has made a continuing, irrevocable offer to all present holders
(other than certain excluded holders, including A. Alfred Taubman), assignees of
all present  holders,  those  future  holders of  partnership  interests  in the
Operating  Partnership  as the  Company  may, in its sole  discretion,  agree to
include in the continuing offer, and all existing and future optionees under the
Operating  Partnership's  incentive  option plan (Note 10) to exchange shares of
common  stock  for  partnership  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  (the
Continuing  Offer).  Under  the  Continuing  Offer  agreement,  one  unit of the
Operating  Partnership  interest is exchangeable  for one share of the Company's
common stock.

     Shares  of common  stock  that were  acquired  by GMPT and the AT&T  Master
Pension  Trust in  connection  with  the IPO may be sold  through  a  registered
offering.  Pursuant to a registration  rights  agreement  with the Company,  the
owners of each of these  shares  have the annual  right to cause the  Company to
register and  publicly  sell their  shares of common  stock  (provided  that the
shares  have an  aggregate  value of at least $50 million and subject to certain
other restrictions).  All expenses of such a registration are to be borne by the
Company,  other than the underwriting  discounts or selling  commissions,  which
will be borne by the exercising party.

     The  Company is  currently  involved in certain  litigation  arising in the
ordinary course of business. Management believes that this litigation  will  not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.

Note 13 - Earnings Per Share

     Basic  earnings  per  common  share are  calculated  by  dividing  earnings
available  to  common  shareowners  by  the  average  number  of  common  shares
outstanding  during each  period.  For diluted  earnings per common  share,  the
Company's  ownership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership  (and  therefore
earnings)  are  adjusted  assuming  the  exercise  of all  options  for units of
partnership  interest under the Operating  Partnership's  incentive  option plan
having exercise prices less than the average market value of the units using the
treasury  stock method.  For the years ended  December 31, 1999,  1998 and 1997,
options  for 0.7  million,  0.3 million  and 0.4  million  units of  partnership
interest   with  average   exercise   prices  of  $13.38,   $13.81  and  $13.58,
respectively,  were excluded from the computation of diluted  earnings per share
because the options'  exercise prices were greater than the average market price
for the period calculated.

Note 14 - New Accounting Pronouncements

     In December  1999,  the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  issued Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial  Statements" (SAB
101). SAB 101 requires that a lessor defer  recognition  of percentage  rents in
quarterly periods until the specified target (typically gross sales in excess of
a certain  amount) that  triggers  this type of rental  income is achieved.  The
Company had  previously  accrued  interim  contingent  rental income as lessees'
specified  sales  targets  were met or  achievement  of the  sales  targets  was
probable.  The Company adopted the accounting method set forth in SAB 101 during
the fourth  quarter of 1999.  Although  the adoption had no impact on annual net
income, the Company has restated the results of the first three quarters of 1999
(Note  15).  The  effect of the  restatement  was to reduce  net  income by $0.3
million ($0.01 per diluted common share), $1.2 million ($0.02 per diluted common
share), and $1.2 million ($0.02 per diluted common share) for the first, second,
and third quarters of 1999, respectively,  and to increase fourth quarter income
and per share amounts by $2.7 million and $0.05 per share, respectively. Had SAB
101 been in effect during 1998, 11%, 7%, 10%, and 72% of annual  percentage rent
would have been recognized in the first,  second,  third, and fourth quarters of
1998, on a pro forma basis.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  133
requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and
liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those  derivatives would be accounted for depending on the uses of
the  derivatives and whether they qualify for hedge  accounting.  The Company is
currently  evaluating  the  impact  of SFAS  133 on the  Company's  consolidated
financial  statements.  SFAS 133 is effective for fiscal years  beginning  after
June 15, 2000.

   The following is a summary of quarterly  results of  operations  for 1999 and

Note 16 - Subsequent Events

     In January 2000, the Company agreed to exchange property interests with its
current joint venture partner in two  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures.  Under the
terms of the agreement,  expected to be completed in the first quarter 2000, the
Operating  Partnership will assume 100 percent ownership of Twelve Oaks Mall and
the current  joint  venture  partner will become 100 percent  owner of Lakeside.
Both properties  will remain subject to the existing  mortgage debt ($50 million
and $88  million  at Twelve  Oaks and  Lakeside,  respectively.)  The  Operating
Partnership  will also pay the joint  venture  partner $30 million in cash.  The
transaction will be accounted for as a purchase.  The Operating Partnership will
continue to manage  Twelve  Oaks,  while the joint  venture  partner will assume
management responsibility for Lakeside at closing.

     In January  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns
Stamford  Town  Center  completed  a $76  million  secured  financing.  The  new
financing  bears interest at a rate of one-month  LIBOR plus 0.8% and matures in
2002 with a two-year  extension  option.  The rate is capped at 8.2% plus credit
spread for the term of the loan. The proceeds were used to repay the $54 million
participating  mortgage,  the $18.3  million  prepayment  premium,  and  accrued
interest and transaction costs.

     In January 2000, the Company  finalized an agreement that  securitized  the
$40 million bank line of credit and extended its maturity to August 2000.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.

     We have audited the accompanying  combined balance sheets of Unconsolidated
Joint   Ventures  of  The  Taubman   Realty  Group  Limited   Partnership   (the
"Partnership")  (a  consolidated  subsidiary  of  Taubman  Centers,  Inc.) as of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the related  combined  statements of operations,
accumulated  deficiency in assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period  ended  December  31, 1999.  Our audits also  included the  financial
statement  schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial  statements
and financial  statement  schedules are the  responsibility of the Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on the  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  such combined financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the combined  financial  position of  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures of The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership as of December 31, 1999
and 1998, and the combined  results of their  operations and their combined cash
flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1999 in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion,
such financial  statement  schedules,  when  considered in relation to the basic
combined financial  statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

                     NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

     The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited   Partnership  (TRG),  a  consolidated
subsidiary  of Taubman  Centers,  Inc.,  engages in the  ownership,  management,
leasing,  acquisition,  development  and expansion of regional  retail  shopping
centers and interests therein.  TRG has engaged the Manager (The Taubman Company
Limited  Partnership,  which is approximately 99% beneficially  owned by TRG) to
provide property management and leasing services for the shopping centers and to
provide  corporate,   development,   and  acquisition  services.  For  financial
statement  reporting  purposes,  the  accounts of shopping  centers that are not
controlled  and that  are  owned  through  joint  ventures  with  third  parties
(Unconsolidated   Joint   Ventures)  have  been  combined  in  these   financial
statements.  Generally,  net  profits  and  losses of the  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures are allocated to TRG and the outside partners (Joint Venture  Partners)
in accordance with their ownership percentages.

     Dollar  amounts  presented  in  tables  within  the  notes to the  combined
financial statements are stated in thousands.

Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

     TRG's interest in each of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures at December 31,
1999, is as follows:

     TRG is developing  International  Plaza, a 1.3 million square foot regional
center under  construction in Tampa,  Florida,  expected to open September 2001.
TRG  originally  had a  controlling  50.1%  interest in the  partnership  (Tampa
Westshore) that owns the project.  TRG was responsible for providing funding for
project  costs  in  excess  of the  construction  financing  in  exchange  for a
preferential  return.  In November 1999, TRG entered into  agreements with a new
investor,  who  contributed  funding for the project and thereby  reduced  TRG's
ownership interest in Tampa Westshore to approximately 26%.

     In September  1999, TRG entered into a partnership  agreement with Swerdlow
Real Estate Group to jointly  develop  Dolphin  Mall, a 1.4 million  square foot
value regional  center under  construction in Miami,  Florida,  expected to open
March 2001.

            UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES OF THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP
                               LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


     During 1999, noncash investing activities included a total of $83.4 million
contributed to the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures developing  International Plaza
and  Dolphin  Mall.  This  amount  primarily  consists  of the net book value of
project costs expended prior to the creation of the joint ventures.

     On September  30,  1998,  TRG  completed a  transaction  that  included the
transfer  of  interests   in  nine   consolidated   shopping   centers  and  one
Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  (the GMPT  Exchange).  The accounts of Woodfield
Associates  (Woodfield),  a 50%  owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that was
transferred,  are  included  in  these  combined  financial  statements  through
September  30,  1998.  On the date of the GMPT  Exchange,  the  book  values  of
Woodfield's assets and liabilities were approximately  $107.4 million and $196.9
million, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

     Shopping center space is generally leased to specialty retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on the  straight-line  method.  Percentage  rent is
accrued when lessees' specified sales targets have been met. Expense recoveries,
which  include an  administrative  fee, are  recognized as revenue in the period
applicable costs are chargeable to tenants.

Depreciation and Amortization

     Buildings,  improvements and equipment,  stated at cost, are depreciated on
straight-line or double-declining  balance bases over the estimated useful lives
of the assets  that range from 3 to 55 years.  Tenant  allowances  and  deferred
leasing  costs are  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the lives of the
related leases.

Capitalization

     Costs  related  to  the   acquisition,   development,   construction,   and
improvement of properties are capitalized.  Interest costs are capitalized until
construction is substantially  complete.  Properties are reviewed for impairment
if events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amounts of the
properties may not be recoverable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Deferred Charges

     Direct financing and interest rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)


Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

     Premiums paid for interest rate cap  instruments  are amortized to interest
expense  over the  terms  of the  agreements.  Amounts  received  under  the cap
agreements are accounted for on an accrual basis,  and recognized as a reduction
of interest expense.  The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements
is accounted for on an accrual basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest
expense.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of financial instruments:

      The carrying  value of cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  and  notes
         receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair  value  due  to  the
         short maturity of these instruments.

      The fair value of  mortgage notes and other  notes  payable  is  estimated
         based on quoted  market  prices if  available,  or on the current rates
         available  to the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  for debt of similar
         terms and maturity and the assumption  that debt will be prepaid at the
         earliest possible date.

      The fair  value of  interest rate  hedging  instruments  is the amount the
         Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  would pay or receive to  terminate  the
         agreement at the reporting date,  taking into account current  interest
         rates.

Use of Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in  conformity  with  generally
accepted  accounting  principles  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and
assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,
disclosure of  contingent  assets and  liabilities  at the date of the financial
statements,  and the  reported  amounts  of  revenues  and  expenses  during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

New Accounting Pronouncement

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  133
requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and
liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those  derivatives would be accounted for depending on the uses of
the  derivatives  and whether they qualify for hedge  accounting.  The impact of
SFAS 133 on the financial  statements of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures is
currently  being  evaluated.  SFAS 133 is effective  for fiscal years  beginning
after June 15, 2000.

Reclassifications

     Certain  prior  year  amounts  have been  reclassified  to  conform to 1999
classifications.

     In October  1999,  the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is  developing
Dolphin  Mall  (Note  1)  closed  on a  $200  million,  three-year  construction
facility.  The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 2%,  decreasing  to LIBOR plus
1.75% when a certain coverage ratio is met. The rate on the loan is capped at 7%
until maturity, plus credit spread. Under the interest rate agreement,  the rate
is  swapped  to a fixed  rate of  5.15%  when  LIBOR is less  than  6%.  TRG has
guaranteed the payment of 50% of any outstanding  principal  balance and 100% of
all  accrued  and  unpaid  interest.  The  guaranty  will be  reduced as certain
performance conditions are met. The maturity date may be extended one year.

     In November 1999, the joint venture that is developing  International Plaza
in Tampa, Florida closed on a $193.5 million, three-year construction financing,
with a one-year  extension option. The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 1.90%.
TRG has guaranteed  the payment of 100% of the principal and interest;  however,
the new investor in the venture  (Note 1) has  indemnified  TRG to the extent of
25% of the amounts guaranteed. The loan agreement provides for reductions of the
rate and the amount guaranteed as certain center performance criteria are met.

     The rate on the Arizona Mills loan is capped at 9.5% until  maturity,  plus
credit  spread.  The payment of principal  and interest is guaranteed by each of
the owners of Arizona  Mills to the extent of their  ownership  percentage.  The
loan  agreement  provides for the reduction of the amount  guaranteed as certain
center  performance  and  valuation  criteria  are met.  TRG's  guaranty  of the
principal was $13.1 million at December 31, 1999.

     The  other  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  with  floating  rate debt have
entered into interest rate  agreements to reduce their  exposure to increases in
interest  rates.  The rate on the  Twelve  Oaks loan is  capped  at 8.55%  until
maturity,  plus credit  spread.  The rate on the $55 million  Westfarms  loan is
capped until maturity at 6.5%, plus credit spread.

net of amounts  capitalized  of $2.5 million,  $2.5  million,  and $9.4 million,
approximated $59.7 million, $64.0 million, and $48.7 million, respectively.

Extraordinary Items

     In 1999 and 1998, joint ventures recognized  extraordinary  charges related
to the extinguishment of debt, primarily consisting of prepayment premiums.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

     Certain of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  have entered into interest
rate agreements to reduce their exposure to changes in the cost of floating rate
debt.  The terms of the derivative  agreements  are generally  equivalent to the
notional  amounts,  reset dates and rate bases of the underlying  hedged debt to
assure the  effectiveness  of the  derivatives  in reducing  interest rate risk.
These  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures are exposed to credit risk in the event of
nonperformance by their  counterparties to the agreements.  These Unconsolidated
Joint  Ventures  anticipate  that  their  counterparties  will be able to  fully
perform their obligations under the agreements.

Note 5 - Leases

     Shopping center space is leased to tenants and certain anchors  pursuant to
lease agreements.  Tenant leases typically provide for guaranteed  minimum rent,
percentage  rent,  and other charges to cover certain  operating  costs.  Future
minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 1999 for operating
centers,  assuming no new or renegotiated  leases or option extensions on anchor
agreements, is summarized as follows:

                      2000                       $ 152,174
                      2001                         144,389

                      Thereafter                   319,045

     Revenues  derived  from the  combined  operations  of The Limited  provided
approximately  10.1%  of  total  revenues  in 1999.  Revenues  derived  from the
combined operations of The Limited were approximately 10.5% of total revenues in
1998 and less than 10% in 1997.  Amounts due from The  Limited at  December  31,
1999 were $100 thousand.

     One Unconsolidated Joint Venture, as lessee, has a ground lease expiring in
2083 with its Joint Venture  Partner.  Rental payments under the lease were $2.0
million,  $2.0 million and $1.8 million in 1999,  1998 and 1997. TRG is entitled
to  receive   preferential   distributions   equal  to  75%  of  each   payment.
Approximately  25% of the ground lease payments over the term of the lease, on a
straight-line  basis,  are  recognized as ground rent  expense,  with 75% of the
current payment accounted for as a distribution to the Joint Venture Partner.

     The  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns  International  Plaza is the
lessee under a ground lease  agreement  that expires in 2080. The lease requires
annual  payments of  approximately  $0.1  million and when the center opens will
require additional rentals,  based on the leasable area of the center as defined
in the agreement.

     The  following is a schedule of future  minimum  rental  payments  required
under operating leases:

                      2000                      $    2,111

     TRG is one-third  owner of an entity  providing  management,  leasing,  and
development services to Arizona Mills, L.L.C. Charges from this entity were $1.4
million  and $2.5  million in 1999 and 1998,  respectively.  In  addition,  $2.8
million and $1.8 million were paid in 1999 and 1998, respectively, to one of the
Arizona Mills Joint Venture Partners for leasing and development services.

     Westfarms  previously  loaned  $2.4  million  to one of its  Joint  Venture
Partners to purchase a portion of a deceased Joint Venture  Partner's  interest.
The note bears interest at  approximately  7.9% and requires  monthly  principal
payments of $25 thousand,  plus accrued interest,  with the final payment due in
2001.  The  balance at  December  31,  1999 and 1998 was $0.6  million  and $1.0
million,  respectively.  Interest  income related to the loan was  approximately
$0.1 million in 1999, 1998, and 1997.

   Other related party transactions are described in Notes 1 and 5.

Note 7 - Subsequent Events

     In January 2000, TRG agreed to exchange property interests with its current
joint venture partner in two Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures.  Under the terms of
the  agreement,  expected to be completed in the first  quarter  2000,  TRG will
assume 100 percent  ownership of Twelve Oaks Mall and the current  joint venture
partner will become 100 percent owner of Lakeside.  Both  properties will remain
subject to the  existing  mortgage  debt ($50  million and $88 million at Twelve
Oaks and Lakeside,  respectively.)  TRG will also pay the joint venture  partner
$30 million in cash.

     In January  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns
Stamford  Town  Center  completed  a $76  million  secured  financing.  The  new
financing  bears interest at a rate of one-month  LIBOR plus 0.8% and matures in
2002 with a two-year  extension  option.  The rate is capped at 8.2% plus credit
spread for the term of the loan. The proceeds were used to repay the $54 million
participating  mortgage,  the $18.3  million  prepayment  premium,  and  accrued
interest and transaction costs.

     below.

          50,000,000  shares of preferred stock (the "Preferred  Stock"),  which
     may  be  issued  in  one  or  more  series  having  such  relative  rights,
     preferences,  priorities, privileges,  restrictions, and limitations as the
     Board of Directors may determine from time to time.

2.   Certain Powers, Rights, and Limitations of Capital Stock.

     (a) Common Stock. Subject to the rights, preferences,  and limitations that
the Board of Directors designates with respect to any series of Preferred Stock,
a statement of certain  powers,  rights,  and  limitations  of the shares of the
Common Stock is as follows:

          (i) Dividend  Rights.  The holders of shares of the Common Stock shall
     be entitled to receive  such  dividends  as may be declared by the Board of
     Directors of the Corporation  with respect to the Common Stock,  subject to
     the preferential  rights of any series of Preferred Stock designated by the
     Corporation's Board of Directors.

          (ii) Rights Upon Liquidation.  Subject to the provisions of Subsection
     (e) of this Section 2 of this Article III, in the event of any voluntary or
     involuntary liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of, or any distribution
     of the  assets  of, the  Corporation,  each  holder of shares of the Common
     Stock  shall be  entitled to  receive,  ratably  with each other  holder of
     shares of the Common Stock,  that portion of the assets of the  Corporation
     available for  distribution to its holders of shares of Common Stock as the
     number of shares of the Common Stock held by such holder bears to the total
     number of shares of Common  Stock  (including  shares of Common  Stock that
     have become Excess Stock) then outstanding.

     (b) Voting  Rights.  Subject to the  provisions of  Subsection  (e) of this
Section 2 of this  Article  III, the holders of shares of the Common Stock shall
be  entitled  to vote on all matters  (for which a common  shareholder  shall be
entitled  to  vote  thereon)  at  all  meetings  of  the   shareholders  of  the
Corporation,  and shall be  entitled  to one vote for each  share of the  Common
Stock  entitled  to  vote  at  such  meeting.  Any  action  to be  taken  by the
shareholders,  other than the  election of  directors  or  adjourning a meeting,
including, but not limited to, the approval of an amendment to these Amended and
Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  (other than an  amendment  by the Board of
Directors to establish the relative rights, preferences, priorities, privileges,
restrictions,  and  limitations of Preferred Stock as provided in Subsection (c)
of this Section 2 of this Article III, which amendment by the Board of Directors
shall require no action to be taken by the shareholders), shall be authorized if
approved by the  affirmative  vote of  two-thirds of the shares of Capital Stock
entitled to vote thereon.  Directors shall be elected if approved by a plurality
of the votes cast at an election.

                                       2

     (c) Preferred  Stock.  The Preferred Stock shall have such relative rights,
preferences,  priorities, privileges, restrictions, and limitations as the Board
of Directors may determine from time to time by one or more  amendments to these
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation.

          (i)  Series A  Preferred  Stock.  Subject  in all  cases to the  other
     provisions  of this  Section  2 of this  Article  III,  including,  without
     limitation,  those  provisions  restricting  the  Beneficial  Ownership and
     Constructive Ownership of shares of Capital Stock and those provisions with
     respect  to  Excess  Stock,  the  following  sets  forth  the  designation,
     preferences,  limitations as to dividends, voting and other rights, and the
     terms and conditions of redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock (defined
     below) of the Corporation.

               (a)  There is hereby  established  a series  of  Preferred  Stock
          designated "8.30% Series A Cumulative  Redeemable Preferred Stock, par
          value $0.01 per share" (the  "Series A Preferred  Stock"),which  shall
          consist of 8,000,000 authorized shares.

               (b) All shares of Series A Preferred Stock  redeemed,  purchased,
          exchanged,  or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be restored
          to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock.

               (c) The Series A Preferred Stock shall,  with respect to dividend
          rights,  rights  upon  liquidation,  winding  up or  dissolution,  and
          redemption  rights,  rank (i) junior to any other  series of Preferred
          Stock  hereafter  duly  established  by the Board of  Directors of the
          Corporation,  the terms of which specifically provide that such series
          shall rank prior to the Series A Preferred  Stock as to the payment of
          dividends and  distribution  of assets upon  liquidation  (the "Senior
          Preferred Stock"),  (ii) pari passu with any other series of Preferred
          Stock  hereafter  duly  established  by the Board of  Directors of the
          Corporation,  the terms of which specifically provide that such series
          shall  rank pari passu  with the  Series A  Preferred  Stock as to the
          payment of dividends and  distribution of assets upon liquidation (the
          "Parity  Preferred  Stock"),  and (iii)  prior to any  other  class or
          series of Capital Stock,  including,  without  limitation,  the Common
          Stock of the  Corporation,  whether now existing or hereafter  created
          (collectively, the "Junior Stock").

               (d) (1) Subject to the rights of any Senior  Preferred Stock, the
          holders of the then  outstanding  shares of Series A  Preferred  Stock
          shall be  entitled to  receive,  as and when  declared by the Board of
          Directors,   out  of  funds  legally  available  for  the  payment  of
          dividends,  cumulative  preferential cash dividends at the annual rate
          of 8.30% of the $25.00 per share liquidation  preference (i.e., $2.075
          per annum per share).  Such  dividends  shall accrue and be cumulative
          from  the  date of  original  issue  and  shall  be  payable  in equal
          quarterly  amounts in arrears on or before the last day of each March,
          June,  September,  and December or, if such day is not a business day,
          the next  succeeding  business day (each,  a "Dividend  Payment Date")
          (for the purposes of this  Subparagraph  (1) of this  Paragraph (d), a
          "business  day" is any day,  other than a Saturday,  Sunday,  or legal
          holiday, on which banks in Detroit,  Michigan, are open for business).
          The first dividend,  which shall be paid on December 31, 1997, will be
          for less than a full quarter.  All dividends on the Series A Preferred
          Stock,  including any dividend for any partial dividend period,  shall
          be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day
          months.  Dividends will be payable to holders of record as they appear
          in the stock  records of the  Corporation  at the close of business on
          the  applicable  record  date,  which  shall  be the  15th  day of the
          calendar month in which the applicable  Dividend Payment Date falls or
          on  such  other  date  designed  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of the
          Corporation  for the payment of dividends that is not more than 30 nor
          less  than ten days  prior to such  Dividend  Payment  Date  (each,  a
          "Dividend Record Date").

                                       3
<PAGE>

                   (2) No  dividends  on the  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  shall
          be declared by the Board of Directors or paid or set apart for payment
          by the  Corporation at such time as any agreement of the  Corporation,
          including any agreement  relating to its indebtedness,  prohibits such
          declaration,  payment,  or setting  apart for payment or provides that
          such  declaration,   payment,  or  setting  apart  for  payment  would
          constitute a breach of, or a default under,  such agreement or if such
          declaration,   payment,  or  setting  aside  shall  be  restricted  or
          prohibited by law.

          (3)  Dividends  on the Series A Preferred  Stock  shall  accrue and be
          cumulative   regardless  of  whether  the  Corporation  has  earnings,
          regardless  of  whether  there are  funds  legally  available  for the
          payment of such  dividends,  and  regardless of whether such dividends
          are declared.  Accrued but unpaid  dividends on the Series A Preferred
          Stock will  accumulate  as of the Dividend  Payment Date on which they
          first become payable.  Except as set forth below in this  Subparagraph
          (3), no  dividends  shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment
          on any Common Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock ranking, as
          to  dividends,  on a parity  with or junior to the Series A  Preferred
          Stock (other than a dividend in shares of Junior Stock) for any period
          unless full cumulative  dividends have been or  contemporaneously  are
          declared  and paid or declared  and a sum  sufficient  for the payment
          thereof is set apart for such payment on the Series A Preferred  Stock
          for all past dividend  periods and the then current  dividend  period.
          When  dividends  are not paid in full (and a sum  sufficient  for such
          full  payment is not so set apart) upon the Series A  Preferred  Stock
          and the shares of any other  series of  Preferred  Stock  ranking on a
          parity  as to  dividends  with  the  Series  A  Preferred  Stock,  all
          dividends  declared  upon the Series A  Preferred  Stock and any other
          series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the
          Series A  Preferred  Stock  shall be  declared  pro rata,  so that the
          amount of dividends declared per share of Series A Preferred Stock and
          such other series of  Preferred  Stock shall in all cases bear to each
          other the same ratio that accrued  dividends per share on the Series A
          Preferred  Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock (which shall
          not  include  any  accrual in respect  of unpaid  dividends  for prior
          dividend  periods if such  Preferred  Stock does not have a cumulative
          dividend) bear to each other.  No interest shall be payable in respect
          of any dividend payment on the Series A Preferred Stock that may be in
          arrears.  Holders of shares of the Series A Preferred  Stock shall not
          be entitled to any dividend,  whether  payable in cash,  property,  or
          stock,  in  excess  of  full  cumulative  dividends  on the  Series  A
          Preferred Stock as provided above. Any dividend payment made on shares
          of the Series A Preferred  Stock  shall first be credited  against the
          earliest  accumulated  but unpaid  dividend  due with  respect to such
          shares that remains payable.

               (4) Except as provided in Subparagraph  (3) of this Paragraph (d)
          of this  Item (i) of this  Subsection  (c) of this  Section  2 of this
          Article  III,  unless  full  cumulative  dividends  on  the  Series  A
          Preferred Stock have been or  contemporaneously  are declared and paid
          or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment  thereof is set apart
          for  payment  for all  past  dividend  periods  and the  then  current
          dividend  period:  (i) no  dividends  (other  than in shares of Junior
          Stock)  shall be  declared  or paid or set aside for payment nor shall
          any other  distribution  be declared or made upon the Common Stock (or
          any other  Preferred  Stock ranking  junior to or on a parity with the
          Series A Preferred  Stock as to  dividends or upon  liquidation);  and
          (ii) no shares of Common  Stock (or any other  Preferred  Stock of the
          Corporation  ranking  junior  to or on a  parity  with  the  Series  A
          Preferred  Stock  as  to  dividends  or  upon  liquidation)  shall  be
          redeemed,  purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (nor
          shall any moneys be paid to or made  available  for a sinking fund for
          the  redemption  of any such  shares)  by the  Corporation  (except by
          conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock).

                                       4
<PAGE>

                   (5) If  for  any  taxable  year  the  Corporation  elects  to
          designate as "capital  gains  dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of
          the Code) any portion (the  "Capital  Gains  Amount") of the dividends
          paid or made  available  for the year to  holders  of all  classes  of
          Capital Stock (the "Total Dividends"), then the portion of the Capital
          Gains  Amount  that  shall be  allocable  to the  holders  of Series A
          Preferred  Stock shall be the amount that the total  dividends paid or
          made available to the holders of the Series A Preferred  Stock for the
          year bears to the Total Dividends.

               (e) Subject to the rights of any Senior Stock, upon any voluntary
          or involuntary liquidation,  dissolution, or winding up of the affairs
          of the  Corporation,  and before any  distribution  of assets shall be
          made in  respect  of any  Junior  Stock,  the  holders of the Series A
          Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the
          Corporation  legally  available for distribution to its shareholders a
          liquidation preference of $25.00 per share in cash (or property having
          a fair market value as determined by the Board of Directors  valued at
          $25.00 per  share),  plus an amount  equal to any  accrued  but unpaid
          dividends to the date of payment.  After payment of the full amount of
          the liquidating  distributions to which they are entitled, the holders
          of Series A  Preferred  Stock  shall have no right or claims to any of
          the remaining assets of the Corporation.  Neither the consolidation or
          merger of the Corporation with or into any other  corporation,  trust,
          or entity (or of any other  corporation  with or into the Corporation)
          nor the sale,  lease, or conveyance of all or substantially all of the
          property or business of the Corporation  shall be deemed to constitute
          a liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the  Corporation  for the
          purpose of this Paragraph (e) of this Item (i).

               (f) (1) The Series A Preferred  Stock is not redeemable  prior to
          October 3, 2002. On and after October 3, 2002, the Corporation, at its
          option  upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days'  written  notice,
          may redeem  shares of the  Series A  Preferred  Stock,  in whole or in
          part, at any time and from time to time, for a cash  redemption  price
          of $25.00 per share, plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to the date
          fixed for redemption (except as provided below).

                   (2) The redemption   price of  the  Series A Preferred  Stock
          (other  than the  portion  thereof  consisting  of accrued  but unpaid
          dividends)  shall be payable  solely out of the sale proceeds of other
          "capital  stock" of the  Corporation.  For  purposes of the  preceding
          sentence,  the term "capital stock" means any equity securities of the
          Corporation  (including  Common Stock and  Preferred  Stock),  shares,
          interest,   participation,   or  other  ownership  interests  (however
          designated)  and any rights  (other than debt  securities  convertible
          into or exchangeable for equity securities) or options to purchase any
          of the foregoing.  Holders of Series A Preferred  Stock to be redeemed
          shall  surrender such shares at the place  designated in the notice of
          redemption  and  shall be  entitled  to the  redemption  price and any
          accrued and unpaid  dividends  payable upon such redemption  following
          such  surrender.  If notice of  redemption  has been  given and if the
          Corporation  has set  aside  in  trust  the  funds  necessary  for the
          redemption,  then from and after the  redemption  date:  (i) dividends
          shall cease to accrue on such shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (ii)
          such  shares of  Series A  Preferred  Stock  shall no longer be deemed
          outstanding;  and (iii) all rights of the holders of such shares shall
          terminate,  except the right to receive the redemption  price. If less
          than  all  of  the  outstanding  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  is to be
          redeemed,  the  Series  A  Preferred  Stock  to be  redeemed  shall be
          selected pro rata (as nearly as may be  practicable  without  creating
          fractional  shares) or by any other equitable method determined by the
          Corporation.

                                       5
<PAGE>

                   (3) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of  Series
          A Preferred  Stock shall have been or  contemporaneously  are declared
          and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment  thereof set
          apart for  payment,  no shares of Series A  Preferred  Stock  shall be
          redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
          simultaneously  redeemed,  and the  Corporation  shall not purchase or
          otherwise  acquire  directly  or  indirectly  any  shares  of Series A
          Preferred  Stock (except by exchange for Junior Stock);  however,  the
          foregoing  shall not prevent the purchase or  acquisition of shares of
          Series A Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made
          on the same  terms to holders  of all  outstanding  shares of Series A
          Preferred Stock.

                   (4)  Notice of redemption shall be given by  publication in a
          newspaper  of  general  circulation  in The  City  of New  York,  such
          publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks commencing
          not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. A
          similar notice shall be mailed by the  Corporation,  postage  prepaid,
          not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the  redemption  date,
          addressed  to  the  respective  holders  of  record  of the  Series  A
          Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their  respective  addresses as they
          appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. No failure to
          give or  defect  in such  notice  shall  affect  the  validity  of the
          proceedings  for the  redemption  of any shares of Series A  Preferred
          Stock  except as to the  holder to whom  notice was  defective  or not
          given.  Each notice shall state:  (i) the  redemption  date;  (ii) the
          redemption  price;  (iii) the  number of shares of Series A  Preferred
          Stock to be  redeemed;  (iv) the  place or places  where the  Series A
          Preferred  Stock is to be  surrendered  for payment of the  redemption
          price;  and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease
          to accrue on such  redemption  date.  If fewer  than all shares of the
          Series A Preferred  Stock held by any holder are to be  redeemed,  the
          notice  mailed to such holder  shall also specify the number of shares
          of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.

                   (5) The holders of Series A Preferred  Stock at the  close of
          business  on a Dividend  Record  Date shall be entitled to receive the
          dividend  payable with respect to such Series A Preferred Stock on the
          corresponding  Dividend  Payment Date  notwithstanding  the redemption
          thereof  between  such  Dividend  Record  Date  and the  corresponding
          Dividend Payment Date or the  Corporation's  default in the payment of
          the dividend due. Except as provided above,  the Corporation will make
          no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, regardless of whether in
          arrears, on called Series A Preferred Stock.

                   (6) The Series A Preferred  Stock has  no stated maturity and
          shall not be subject to any sinking fund or mandatory redemption.  The
          Series A Preferred Stock is not convertible  into any other securities
          of the Corporation, but is subject to the Excess Stock (and all other)
          provisions of this Article III.

               (g) (1)  Except  as may  be  required  by  law  or as  otherwise
          expressly  provided  in this Item (i) of this  Subsection  (c) of this
          Section 2 of this Article III, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
          shall not be entitled to vote.  On all matters  with  respect to which
          the Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to vote, each share of Series
          A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote.

                   (2)  Whenever dividends  on the  Series A Preferred Stock are
          in arrears for six or more quarterly periods,  the number of directors
          then  constituting  the Board of Directors  shall be increased by two,
          and the holders of Series A Preferred  Stock  (voting  separately as a
          class with all other series of Preferred  Stock upon which like voting
          rights  have  been  conferred  and are  exercisable)  ("Voting  Parity
          Preferred")  shall  have  the  right  to elect  two  directors  of the
          Corporation at a special meeting called by the holders of record of

                                       6
<PAGE>

          at least 10% of the  Series A  Preferred  Stock or at least 10% of any
          other Voting  Parity  Preferred so in arrears  (unless such request is
          received  less than 90 days  before the date fixed for the next annual
          or special meeting of the  shareholders) or at the next annual meeting
          of  shareholders,  and at each subsequent  annual  meeting,  until all
          dividends  accumulated  on the Series A  Preferred  Stock for the past
          dividend  periods and the then current dividend period have been fully
          paid  or  declared  and a sum  sufficient  for  the  payment  of  such
          dividends has been set aside for payment.  If and when all accumulated
          dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the
          Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for
          payment in full, the holders of the Series A Preferred  Stock shall be
          divested  of the  foregoing  voting  rights,  and  if all  accumulated
          dividends and the dividend for the then current  period have been paid
          in full or set  aside  for  payment  in full on all  series  of Voting
          Parity  Preferred,  the term of office of each  director so elected by
          the  holders of the  Series A  Preferred  Stock and the Voting  Parity
          Preferred shall terminate.

                   (3) As long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock  remain
          outstanding,  the Corporation  shall not, without the affirmative vote
          or consent of the holders of at least  two-thirds  of the  outstanding
          shares of Series A Preferred Stock (voting as a separate  class):  (i)
          authorize or create,  or increase the  authorized or issued amount of,
          any Capital Stock ranking senior to the Series A Preferred  Stock with
          respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon
          liquidation,  dissolution,  or winding up or reclassify any authorized
          Capital  Stock  of  the  Corporation  into  such  shares,  or  create,
          authorize,  or issue any  obligation or security  convertible  into or
          evidencing  the right to  purchase  any such  shares;  or (ii)  amend,
          alter, or repeal the provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles
          of Incorporation,  whether by merger, consolidation,  or otherwise (an
          "Event"),  so  as  to  materially  and  adversely  affect  any  right,
          preference, privilege, or voting power of the Series A Preferred Stock
          or the  holders  thereof;  however,  as long as the Series A Preferred
          Stock remains outstanding with its terms materially unchanged,  taking
          into account that upon the occurrence of an Event, the Corporation may
          not be the surviving  entity,  the occurrence of an Event described in
          clause  (ii)  above of this  Subparagraph  (3)  shall not be deemed to
          materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences,  privileges,
          or voting  power of the holders of Series A Preferred  Stock,  and (x)
          any increase in the amount of the  authorized  Preferred  Stock or the
          creation or issuance of any other  series of Preferred  Stock,  or (y)
          any  increase  in the  amount of  authorized  shares  of the  Series A
          Preferred  Stock or any other series of Preferred  Stock, in each case
          ranking  on a parity  with or junior to the Series A  Preferred  Stock
          with  respect to payment of dividends  or the  distribution  of assets
          upon liquidation,  dissolution,  or winding up, shall not be deemed to
          materially and adversely affect such rights, preferences,  privileges,
          or voting powers.

                   (4) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the  Series A  Preferred
          Stock  shall  not be  entitled  to  vote,  and  the  foregoing  voting
          provisions  shall not  apply,  if at or prior to the time when the act
          with  respect  to which  such vote  would  otherwise  be  required  is
          effected,  all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock have
          been redeemed or called for redemption, and sufficient funds have been
          deposited  in trust for the  benefit  of the  holders  of the Series A
          Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.

          (ii)  Series B  Preferred  Stock.  Subject  in all  cases to the other
     provisions  of this  Section  2 of this  Article  III,  including,  without
     limitation,  those  provisions  restricting  the  Beneficial  Ownership and
     Constructive Ownership of shares of Capital Stock and those provisions with
     respect  to  Excess  Stock,  the  following  sets  forth  the  designation,
     preference,  limitation  as to dividends,  voting,  and other rights of the
     Series B Preferred Stock (defined below) of the Corporation. Terms that are
     used and not otherwise defined in this Item (ii) have the meanings ascribed
     to them elsewhere

                                       7
<PAGE>

     in these  Amended  and  Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  or, if not so
     defined, their conventional meanings.

               (a)  There is hereby  established  a series  of  Preferred  Stock
          designated "Series B Non-Participating  Convertible  Preferred Stock,"
          (the "Series B Preferred  Stock"),  which shall  initially  consist of
          40,000,000 authorized shares,  subject to one or more increases in the
          authorized  shares of the  series by a further  amendment(s)  to these
          Amended and Restated  Articles of Incorporation to permit the issuance
          of additional  shares upon the issuance of additional  Units  (defined
          below) to Registered  Unitholders  (defined  below) and to accommodate
          stock dividends or stock splits as provided below.

               (b) All shares of Series B Preferred Stock purchased,  exchanged,
          or otherwise  acquired by the  Corporation  or that are converted into
          Common  Stock  shall be  restored  to the  status  of  authorized  but
          unissued shares of Preferred Stock.

               (c) Except upon the  dissolution,  liquidation,  or winding up of
          the  Corporation,  the Series B Preferred Stock shall have no right to
          any assets of the  Corporation,  and (except as expressly set forth in
          this Item (ii)) shall have no right to cash dividends or distributions
          (from  whatever  source),  but shall have the  preference  rights upon
          dissolution,  liquidation,  and  winding up that are set forth in this
          Item (ii) of this  Section 2. The Series B  Preferred  Stock ranks (i)
          junior  to the  Series A  Preferred  Stock and  junior  to any  Parity
          Preferred  Stock or Senior  Preferred  Stock (the  Series A  Preferred
          Stock,  the Parity Preferred Stock, and the Senior Preferred Stock are
          collectively  referred to as the "Series B Senior  Preferred  Stock"),
          (ii) pari passu with any other  series of  Preferred  Stock  hereafter
          duly  established  by the Board of Directors of the  Corporation,  the
          terms of which  specifically  provide that such series shall rank pari
          passu  with the Series B  Preferred  Stock as to the  distribution  of
          assets upon liquidation (the "Series B Parity Preferred  Stock"),  and
          (iii) prior to any other class or series of Capital Stock,  including,
          without limitation,  the Common Stock of the Corporation,  whether now
          existing  or  hereafter  created  (collectively,  the "Series B Junior
          Stock"). If shares of Common Stock or other securities are distributed
          on the Common Stock or other voting Capital Stock (as a stock dividend
          or otherwise) (a "Voting Stock Dividend"), then each share of Series B
          Preferred  Stock shall receive a distribution  of the number of shares
          (or  warrants  or rights  to  acquire  shares,  as the case may be) of
          Series B Preferred  Stock that would then be necessary to preserve the
          relative  voting  power of the  Series B  Preferred  Stock  (i.e.,  in
          relation  to the  voting  power of all  outstanding  shares  of voting
          Capital Stock) that existed prior to the Voting Stock Dividend.

               (d) Subject to the rights of the Series B Senior Preferred Stock,
          upon any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation, or winding
          up of the affairs of the  Corporation,  and before any distribution of
          assets  shall be made in  respect of any  Series B Junior  Stock,  the
          holders of the Series B  Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to be paid
          out  of  the  assets  of  the   Corporation   legally   available  for
          distribution  to its  shareholders a liquidation  preference of $0.001
          per  share  in  cash  (or  property  having  a fair  market  value  as
          determined  by the Board of  Directors  valued at $0.001  per  share).
          After payment of the full amount of the liquidating  distributions  to
          which they are entitled, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall
          have  no  right  or  claims  to  any of the  remaining  assets  of the
          Corporation.

               (e) The Series B Preferred Stock has no stated maturity and shall
          not be subject to redemption;  however,  the foregoing  shall not be a
          restriction on the Corporation=s otherwise lawful redemption of shares
          of Series B Preferred Stock on a consensual  basis with each holder of
          the shares to be redeemed.

                                       8

               (f) (1) The Series B Preferred Stock is convertible,  and will be
          automatically  converted under the circumstances described below, into
          Common Stock at a  conversion  ratio of  14,000:1;  i.e.,  each 14,000
          shares of Series B Preferred  Stock may be converted into one share of
          Common Stock. In lieu of issuing less than a full share (a "fractional
          share") of Common  Stock  upon the  conversion  of fewer  than  14,000
          shares  (or an  integral  multiple  of  14,000  shares)  of  Series  B
          Preferred Stock,  the Corporation  shall redeem the shares of Series B
          Preferred Stock that would otherwise be convertible  into a fractional
          share of Common  Stock (the  "Scrip  Shares"),  and from and after the
          date of the conversion, the Scrip Shares shall cease to be outstanding
          shares of Series B Preferred  Stock,  shall not  constitute  any other
          class of Capital  Stock,  and shall entitle the holder only to receive
          the cash redemption price, as provided below.

                   (2) The  Corporation   will  initially  issue  the  Series  B
          Preferred  Stock to each Person who, on the initial  date of issuance,
          is a Registered Unitholder at the rate of one share for each Unit held
          by  such  Registered   Unitholder,   if  such  Registered   Unitholder
          subscribes for the shares and pays to the  Corporation an amount equal
          to the product of $0.001  multiplied by the number of shares of Series
          B  Preferred  Stock to be issued to him.  Shares of Series B Preferred
          Stock may be issued only in  certificated,  fully  registered form and
          may be issued only to  Registered  Unitholders.  The  Corporation  may
          issue  fractional  shares of Series B Preferred  Stock.  Following the
          initial  issuance of the Series B  Preferred  Stock,  each  Registered
          Unitholder  acquiring one or more newly issued Units shall be entitled
          to receive  from the  Corporation  shares of Series B Preferred  Stock
          equal in number to the number of newly issued  Units  acquired by such
          Registered   Unitholder,   provided  that  the  Registered  Unitholder
          subscribes for the shares and pays to the  Corporation an amount equal
          to the product of $0.001  multiplied by the number of shares of Series
          B Preferred  Stock to be issued to him.  Except as provided  below,  a
          holder  of  shares of Series B  Preferred  Stock may  freely  effect a
          transfer of the shares to any Person (subject to the Transfer being in
          compliance with, or (to the  satisfaction of the  Corporation)  exempt
          from, applicable  securities laws and regulations).  Upon a Registered
          Unitholder's  Transfer  of one or more  Units  to  another  Registered
          Unitholder,  then  (to  the  extent  of  the  transferring  Registered
          Unitholder's   then  ownership  of  Series  B  Preferred   Stock)  the
          transferring Registered Unitholder shall be deemed to have transferred
          to the transferee of the Units (i) shares of Series B Preferred  Stock
          equal in number to the number of transferred Units or if, after giving
          effect to the Unit Transfer,  the transferring  Registered  Unitholder
          will cease to own any Units,  (ii) all of the transferring  Registered
          Unitholder's  shares of Series B Preferred Stock.  Notwithstanding the
          foregoing,  a Registered  Unitholder shall have the right (which shall
          be  exercised  by  delivering  written  notice at the time of the Unit
          Transfer to the Corporation and the transferee of the Units) to negate
          the  deemed  simultaneous  Transfer  of Series B  Preferred  Stock.  A
          Registered  Unitholder  desiring to sell (by  exchange  or  otherwise)
          Units  to the  Corporation  shall  be  required  to  surrender  to the
          Corporation for conversion shares of Series B Preferred Stock equal in
          number to the number of Units being sold (by  exchange or  otherwise),
          but  only  if and to the  extent  that,  after  giving  effect  to the
          Corporation's  proposed  purchase of Units,  the number of outstanding
          shares of Series B Preferred Stock will exceed the aggregate number of
          Units held by all Registered Unitholders. Shares of Series B Preferred
          Stock  surrendered  for  conversion  as  provided  in the  immediately
          preceding  sentence shall be converted into Common Stock,  as provided
          in  subparagraph  (1) of this  Paragraph  (f), upon the  Corporation's
          purchase of the Units of the surrendering  Registered Unitholder,  and
          the  Corporation  shall promptly redeem any resulting Scrip Shares for
          cash, as provided below. Except as provided above in this subparagraph
          (f)(2),  a holder of Series B Preferred  Stock shall have no voluntary
          conversion  rights with respect to the Series B Preferred  Stock,  but
          shares of Series B Preferred  Stock shall

                                       9
<PAGE>

          automatically  convert into Common  Stock as provided in  subparagraph
          (3) of this Paragraph (f).

                   (3)  After giving effec  to a Transfer  of shares of Series B
          Preferred Stock to a Registered Unitholder,  the transferee Registered
          Unitholder  is permitted to own shares of Series B Preferred  Stock up
          to (i) the number of Units then  owned by such  transferee  Registered
          Unitholder or (ii) 5% of the outstanding  shares of Series B Preferred
          Stock,  whichever  is greater  (any  shares in excess of a  transferee
          Registered  Unitholder's  permitted  ownership  of Series B  Preferred
          Stock are referred to as the "Disproportionate  Shares"). After giving
          effect to a  Transfer  of shares  of Series B  Preferred  Stock to any
          Person who is not a Registered Unitholder, the transferee is permitted
          to own up to 5% of the outstanding  shares of Series B Preferred Stock
          (any shares held by a  transferee  of Series B Preferred  Stock who is
          not a Registered Unitholder in excess of such 5% limit are referred to
          as the  "Greater  than  5%  Shares").  Upon a  Transfer  of  Series  B
          Preferred Stock resulting in the transferee  holding  Disproportionate
          Shares or Greater than 5% Shares, as applicable,  the Disproportionate
          Shares or Greater than 5% Shares, as applicable,  shall  automatically
          convert  into Common  Stock as provided  in  subparagraph  (1) of this
          Paragraph  (f)  without  action  on  the  part  of  anyone,   and  the
          Corporation shall promptly redeem any resulting Scrip Shares for cash,
          as  provided  below.   Upon  any  such  automatic   conversion,   each
          certificate  evidencing  converted  shares of Series B Preferred Stock
          shall  instead  represent  the whole  number of shares of Common Stock
          into which such shares of Series B Preferred  Stock were converted and
          the right to receive the cash redemption  payment for any Scrip Shares
          evidenced by such certificate until such certificate is surrendered to
          the  Corporation  for  cancellation  in  exchange  for a Common  Stock
          certificate and the redemption price of the Scrip Shares (if any).

                   (4) Upon  conversion  of  any  shares  of Series  B Preferred
          Stock, no payment or adjustment  shall be made on account of dividends
          declared  and  payable to holders of Common  Stock of record on a date
          prior to the date of conversion.

                   (5) As soon as practicable on or after the date of conversion
          of  shares  of  Series B  Preferred  Stock  and the  surrender  to the
          Corporation of the certificate(s) evidencing the converted shares, the
          Corporation  will  issue and  deliver  to or at the  direction  of the
          converting shareholder a certificate(s) for the whole number of shares
          of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.  The Corporation  shall
          redeem Scrip Shares resulting from a voluntary or automatic conversion
          of Series B Preferred Stock for a cash payment equal to the fair value
          of the  fractional  share of Common  Stock into which the Scrip Shares
          would otherwise be convertible (the fair value shall be the product of
          the relevant  fraction  multiplied  by the closing price of the Common
          Stock on the trading date next preceding the date of conversion on the
          principal  national  securities  exchange on which the Common Stock is
          listed (or the average of the high and low prices of the Common  Stock
          on such  date on the  principal  national  market  system on which the
          Common  Stock is traded)  or (if the Common  Stock is not so listed or
          traded) the fair value of the Common Stock on such date as  determined
          by the  Corporation's  Board of Directors).  The Corporation  shall be
          responsible  for any stamp or other  issuance  taxes  payable upon the
          issuance of Common Stock in exchange for surrendered or  automatically
          converted shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

               (g) (1) On all matters with respect to which  shareholders of the
          Corporation  vote,  each share of Series B  Preferred  Stock  shall be
          entitled to one vote.  On all matters with respect to which the Series
          B Preferred Stock is entitled to vote as a separate  class,  including
          the  nomination  of  directors  pursuant to  subparagraph  (2) of this
          Paragraph  (g), the action shall be  determined by the vote (which may
          be by non-unanimous  written consent) of a

                                       10
<PAGE>

          majority  of the  outstanding  shares  of  Series  B  Preferred  Stock
          entitled to vote.  On all other  matters,  including  the  election of
          directors,  the Series B Preferred  Stock will vote as a single  class
          with all other Capital Stock entitled to vote.

                   (2) With  respect to each annual meeting of the Corporation's
          shareholders,  commencing with the annual meeting of the Corporation's
          shareholders  to be held in 1999  (the  "1999  Annual  Meeting"),  the
          holders of shares of Series B  Preferred  Stock  shall have the right,
          voting as a separate  class,  to  designate  nominees  for election as
          directors of the  Corporation  and to have such  nominees  included as
          such in the Corporation's proxy statement and ballots (or, if none, in
          a specially  prepared  proxy  statement and ballots)  submitted to the
          shareholders  of the  Corporation  entitled to vote in a timely manner
          prior to the annual meeting.  The Corporation shall use all reasonable
          efforts,  consistent  with the  Board of  Directors'  exercise  of its
          fiduciary duties, to cause the election of the nominees  designated by
          the  holders of Series B  Preferred  Stock.  With  respect to the 1999
          Annual Meeting, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock shall have the
          right to designate  four  nominees.  With  respect to each  succeeding
          annual  meeting  of  shareholders,   the  number  of  nominees  to  be
          designated  by the  holders  of Series B  Preferred  Stock  (the "Base
          Number of Series B Nominees") shall be equal to the difference between
          (i) four and (ii) the number of directors  whose terms commenced prior
          to and will  continue  after such  meeting and who were  nominated  to
          serve such terms by the holders of Series B Preferred Stock, voting as
          a separate class.  The Base Number of Series B Nominees  calculated as
          set forth in the immediately  preceding  sentence shall be reduced (i)
          by one,  if as of the record  date for  determining  the  shareholders
          entitled to vote for the election of directors at the relevant  annual
          meeting (the "Record Date"), the Registered  Unitholders  collectively
          own less than 25% (but at least 15%) of the Fully Diluted Common Stock
          of the  Corporation,  (ii)  by  two,  if as of the  Record  Date,  the
          Registered  Unitholders  collectively  own less than 15% (but at least
          10%) of the Fully Diluted  Common Stock of the  Corporation,  (iii) by
          three,   if  as  of  the  Record  Date,  the  Registered   Unitholders
          collectively  own less than 10% (but at least 5%) of the Fully Diluted
          Common Stock of the Corporation, and (iv) to zero, if as of the Record
          Date, the Registered Unitholders  collectively own less than 5% of the
          Fully  Diluted  Common Stock of the  Corporation.  For purposes of the
          immediately preceding sentence, (i) "Fully Diluted Common Stock of the
          Corporation"  means all shares of Common Stock issued and  outstanding
          on the relevant  Record Date, plus all shares of Common Stock issuable
          upon the exercise of vested  employee  stock options to acquire Common
          Stock and issuable upon the exchange of Units owned by the  Registered
          Unitholders  (assuming a 1:1  exchange  ratio and  calculated  without
          regard to  limitations  imposed  on the  ability  or rights of certain
          Registered  Unitholders to exchange Units for Common Stock),  and (ii)
          the Registered  Unitholders shall be deemed to "collectively  own" all
          shares of Common Stock that they own in fact, that they have the right
          to acquire upon the exercise of vested  employee  stock  options,  and
          that would be issued upon the exchange  (without regard to limitations
          imposed on the ability or rights of certain Registered  Unitholders to
          exchange Units for Common Stock) of all  outstanding  Units (and Units
          issuable  upon the  exercise of options to acquire  Units) held by the
          Registered Unitholders.

               (h) At all times when the  holders of Series B  Preferred  Stock,
          voting as a separate  class,  are entitled to  designate  nominees for
          election as directors of the  Corporation,  (i) the Board of Directors
          shall consist of nine directors  (other than during any vacancy caused
          by the death, resignation,  or removal of a director), plus the number
          of directors that any series of Preferred Stock,  voting separately as
          a class, has the right to elect because of the  Corporation's  default
          in the payment of preferential  dividends due on such series, and (ii)
          a  majority  of  the  directors  shall  be  "independent"  (for  these
          purposes,   an  individual  shall  be  deemed  "independent"  if  such
          individual is neither an officer nor an employee of the

                                       11

          Corporation  or any of its direct or indirect  subsidiaries).  At such
          time as the  holders of Series B  Preferred  Stock no longer  have the
          right to  designate  any  nominees  for  election as  directors of the
          Corporation, the size of the Board of Directors shall be as determined
          in accordance with the provisions of the By-Laws of the Corporation.

               (i) For purposes of this Item (ii) of this Subsection (c) of this
          Section 2 of this Article III, the following  terms have the indicated
          meanings:

                   (1)  "Registered  Unitholder" means a Person, other than  the
          Corporation,  (i) who at the relevant time is reflected in the records
          of The Taubman  Realty Group Limited  Partnership as a partner in such
          partnership  (or who as the  result  of a  Transfer  of Units is being
          admitted  as a partner  in such  partnership)  or (ii) who is (or upon
          completion of the relevant  Transfer  (including,  for these purposes,
          the exercise of an option to acquire a Unit) will become) a beneficial
          owner of Units.

                   (2) "Units"  means  Units  of  Partnership  Interest  in  The
          Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (and its successors), and any
          securities into which such Units of Partnership  Interest (as a class)
          are  converted  or for which such  Units (as a class)  are  exchanged,
          whether by merger,  reclassification,  or otherwise. All references in
          this  Item  (ii) of this  Subsection  (c) of  this  Section  2 of this
          Article  III to  numbers of Units  shall be  adjusted  to reflect  any
          splits,  reverse splits, or  reclassifications of Units of Partnership
          Interest.

               (j) As  long  as  shares  of  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  remain
          outstanding,  the Corporation  shall not, without the affirmative vote
          or consent of the holders of a majority of the  outstanding  shares of
          Series B Preferred Stock (voting as a separate class):

                   (1) create,  authorize,  or  issue  any  securities  or   any
          obligation or security  convertible  into or  evidencing  the right to
          purchase any such  securities,  the issuance of which could  adversely
          and  (relative to the other  outstanding  Capital  Stock)  disparately
          affect the  voting  power or voting  rights of the Series B  Preferred
          Stock or the holders of Series B Preferred Stock (including the rights
          under  Paragraph (g) of this Item (ii) of this  Subsection (c) of this
          Section 2 of this Article III, and  disregarding,  for these purposes,
          the  right of any  series of  Preferred  Stock,  voting as a  separate
          class,  to elect  directors  of the  Corporation  as the result of the
          Corporation=s  default in the  payment of a  preferential  dividend to
          which the holders of such series of Preferred Stock are entitled);

                   (2) amend,  alter,  or repeal the provisions of these Amended
          and   Restated   Articles   of   Incorporation,   whether  by  merger,
          consolidation,  or otherwise,  in a manner that could adversely affect
          the voting power or voting  rights of the Series B Preferred  Stock or
          the holders of Series B Preferred  Stock  (including  the rights under
          Paragraph (g) of this Item (ii) of this Subsection (c) of this Section
          2 of this Article III, and disregarding, for these purposes, the right
          of any series of Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, to elect
          directors  of the  Corporation  as  the  result  of the  Corporation=s
          default in the payment of a preferential dividend to which the holders
          of such series of Preferred Stock are entitled);

                   (3) be a party to a material transaction (including,  without
          limitation, a merger,  consolidation,  or share exchange) (a "Series B
          Transaction")  if  the  Series  B  Transaction   could  adversely  and
          (relative to the other outstanding  Capital Stock)  disparately affect
          the voting power or voting  rights of the Series B Preferred  Stock or
          the holders of Series B Preferred  Stock  (including  the rights under
          Paragraph (g) of this Item (ii) of this

                                       12
<PAGE>

          Subsection   (c)  of  this   Section  2  of  this   Article  III,  and
          disregarding, for these purposes, the right of any series of Preferred
          Stock,  voting  as  a  separate  class,  to  elect  directors  of  the
          Corporation as the result of the Corporation=s  default in the payment
          of a  preferential  dividend  to which the  holders of such  series of
          Preferred Stock are entitled). The provisions of this subparagraph (3)
          shall apply to successive Series B Transactions; or


                   (4) issue any shares of Series B  Preferred  Stock to  anyone
          other than a Registered  Unitholder  as provided in  Paragraph  (c) or
          subparagraph (f)(2) of this Item (ii).

          (iii)  Series C  Preferred  Stock.  Subject  in all cases to the other
     provisions  of this  Section  2 of this  Article  III,  including,  without
     limitation,  those  provisions  restricting  the  Beneficial  Ownership and
     Constructive Ownership of shares of Capital Stock and those provisions with
     respect  to  Excess  Stock,  the  following  sets  forth  the  designation,
     preferences,  limitations as to dividends, voting and other rights, and the
     terms and conditions of redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock (defined
     below) of the Corporation.

               (a)  There is hereby  established  a series  of  Preferred  Stock
          designated "9% Series C Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock,  par
          value $0.01 per share" (the "Series C Preferred  Stock"),  which shall
          consist of 1,000,000 authorized shares.

               (b) All shares of Series C Preferred Stock  redeemed,  purchased,
          exchanged,  or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be restored
          to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock.

               (c) The Series C Preferred Stock shall,  with respect to dividend
          rights,  rights  upon  liquidation,  winding  up or  dissolution,  and
          redemption  rights,  rank (i) junior to any other  series of Preferred
          Stock  hereafter  duly  established  by the Board of  Directors of the
          Corporation,  the terms of which specifically provide that such series
          shall rank prior to the Series C Preferred  Stock as to the payment of
          dividends and  distribution  of assets upon  liquidation  (the "Senior
          Preferred  Stock"),  (ii) pari  passu  with the  Series A and Series B
          Preferred Stock and any other series of Preferred Stock hereafter duly
          established by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, the terms of
          which specifically provide that such series shall rank pari passu with
          the  Series C  Preferred  Stock as to the  payment  of  dividends  and
          distribution  of  assets  upon  liquidation  (the  "Parity   Preferred
          Stock"),  and  (iii)  prior to any other  class or  series of  Capital
          Stock,  including,   without  limitation,  the  Common  Stock  of  the
          Corporation,  whether now existing or hereafter created (collectively,
          the "Junior Stock").

               (d) (1) Subject to the rights of any Senior  Preferred Stock, the
          holders of the then  outstanding  shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock
          shall be  entitled to  receive,  as and when  declared by the Board of
          Directors,   out  of  funds  legally  available  for  the  payment  of
          dividends,  cumulative  preferential cash dividends at the annual rate
          of 9% of the $75 per share  liquidation  preference  (i.e.,  $6.75 per
          annum per share).  Such dividends  shall accrue and be cumulative from
          the date of  original  issue and shall be payable  in equal  quarterly
          amounts  in arrears  on or before  the last day of each  March,  June,
          September,  and  December  or, if such day is not a business  day, the
          next  succeeding  business day except that, if such business day is in
          the next  succeeding  calendar year, such payment shall be made on the
          immediately  preceding  business day, in each case with the same force
          and effect as if made on such date (each,  a "Dividend  Payment Date")
          (for the purposes of this  Subparagraph  (1) of this  Paragraph (d), a
          "business  day" is any day,  other than a Saturday,  Sunday,  or legal
          holiday, on which banks in Detroit,  Michigan, are open for business).
          The first dividend may be for less than a full quarter.  All dividends
          on the  Series C  Preferred  Stock,  including

                                       13
<PAGE>

          any dividend for any partial dividend period, shall be computed on the
          basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months.  Dividends
          will be  payable  to  holders  of record  as they  appear in the stock
          records of the  Corporation at the close of business on the applicable
          record  date,  which  shall be the 15th day of the  calendar  month in
          which the applicable Dividend Payment Date falls or on such other date
          designed by the Board of Directors of the  Corporation for the payment
          of dividends  that is not more than 30 nor less than ten days prior to
          such Dividend Payment Date (each, a "Dividend Record Date").

                   (2) No dividends on the Series C  Preferred  Stock  shall  be
          declared by the Board of Directors or paid or set apart for payment by
          the  Corporation  at such time as any  agreement  of the  Corporation,
          including any agreement  relating to its indebtedness,  prohibits such
          declaration,  payment,  or setting  apart for payment or provides that
          such  declaration,   payment,  or  setting  apart  for  payment  would
          constitute a breach of, or a default under,  such agreement or if such
          declaration,   payment,  or  setting  aside  shall  be  restricted  or
          prohibited by law.

                   (3) Dividends on the  Series  C  Preferred Stock shall accrue
          and be cumulative  regardless of whether the Corporation has earnings,
          regardless  of  whether  there are  funds  legally  available  for the
          payment of such  dividends,  and  regardless of whether such dividends
          are declared.  Accrued but unpaid  dividends on the Series C Preferred
          Stock will  accumulate  as of the Dividend  Payment Date on which they
          first become payable.  Except as set forth below in this  Subparagraph
          (3), no  dividends  shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment
          on any Common Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock ranking, as
          to  dividends,  on a parity  with or junior to the Series C  Preferred
          Stock (other than a dividend in shares of Junior Stock) for any period
          unless full cumulative  dividends have been or  contemporaneously  are
          declared  and paid or declared  and a sum  sufficient  for the payment
          thereof is set apart for such payment on the Series C Preferred  Stock
          for all past dividend  periods and the then current  dividend  period.
          When  dividends  are not paid in full (and a sum  sufficient  for such
          full  payment is not so set apart) upon the Series C  Preferred  Stock
          and the shares of any other  series of  Preferred  Stock  ranking on a
          parity  as to  dividends  with  the  Series  C  Preferred  Stock,  all
          dividends  declared  upon the Series C  Preferred  Stock and any other
          series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the
          Series C  Preferred  Stock  shall be  declared  pro rata,  so that the
          amount of dividends declared per share of Series C Preferred Stock and
          such other series of  Preferred  Stock shall in all cases bear to each
          other the same ratio that accrued  dividends per share on the Series C
          Preferred  Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock (which shall
          not  include  any  accrual in respect  of unpaid  dividends  for prior
          dividend  periods if such  Preferred  Stock does not have a cumulative
          dividend) bear to each other.  No interest shall be payable in respect
          of any dividend payment on the Series C Preferred Stock that may be in
          arrears.  Holders of shares of the Series C Preferred  Stock shall not
          be entitled to any dividend,  whether  payable in cash,  property,  or
          stock,  in  excess  of  full  cumulative  dividends  on the  Series  C
          Preferred Stock as provided above. Any dividend payment made on shares
          of the Series C Preferred  Stock  shall first be credited  against the
          earliest  accumulated  but unpaid  dividend  due with  respect to such
          shares that remains payable.

                   (4) Except as provided in Subparagraph (3)  of this Paragraph
          (d) of this Item  (iii) of this  Subsection  (c) of this  Section 2 of
          this Article  III,  unless full  cumulative  dividends on the Series C
          Preferred Stock have been or  contemporaneously  are declared and paid
          or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment  thereof is set apart
          for  payment  for all  past  dividend  periods  and the  then  current
          dividend  period:  (i) no  dividends  (other  than in shares of Junior
          Stock)  shall be  declared  or paid or set aside for payment nor shall
          any other  distribution  be declared or made upon the Common  Stock or
          the Series B Preferred  Stock

                                       14
<PAGE>

          (or any other  Preferred  Stock ranking  junior to or on a parity with
          the Series C Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation); and
          (ii) no shares of Common Stock or the Series B Preferred Stock (or any
          other  Preferred  Stock of the  Corporation  ranking junior to or on a
          parity  with the  Series C  Preferred  Stock as to  dividends  or upon
          liquidation) shall be redeemed,  purchased,  or otherwise acquired for
          any  consideration  (nor shall any moneys be paid to or made available
          for a  sinking  fund for the  redemption  of any such  shares)  by the
          Corporation (except by conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock).

                   (5) If for  any  taxable  year  the   Corporation   elects to
          designate as "capital  gains  dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of
          the Code) any portion (the  "Capital  Gains  Amount") of the dividends
          paid or made  available  for the year to  holders  of all  classes  of
          Capital Stock (the "Total Dividends"), then the portion of the Capital
          Gains  Amount  that  shall be  allocable  to the  holders  of Series C
          Preferred  Stock shall be the amount that the total  dividends paid or
          made available to the holders of the Series C Preferred  Stock for the
          year bears to the Total Dividends.

                   (6)  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  set  forth
          herein,  the  Corporation may declare and pay a dividend on the Common
          Stock,  without preserving the priority of distributions  described in
          Subparagraphs 3 and 4 of this Paragraph (d) of this Item (iii) of this
          Subsection  (c) of this Section 2 of this Article III, but only to the
          extent  such  dividends  are  required  to  preserve  the Real  Estate
          Investment Trust status of the Corporation and to avoid the imposition
          of an excise tax on the Corporation.

               (e) Subject to the rights of any Senior Stock, upon any voluntary
          or involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the affairs
          of the  Corporation,  and before any  distribution  of assets shall be
          made in  respect  of any  Junior  Stock,  the  holders of the Series C
          Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the
          Corporation  legally  available for distribution to its shareholders a
          liquidation  preference of $75 per share in cash (or property having a
          fair market value as  determined  by the Board of Directors  valued at
          $75 per  share),  plus an  amount  equal  to any  accrued  but  unpaid
          dividends to the date of payment.  After payment of the full amount of
          the liquidating  distributions to which they are entitled, the holders
          of Series C  Preferred  Stock  shall have no right or claims to any of
          the remaining assets of the Corporation.  Neither the consolidation or
          merger of the Corporation with or into any other  corporation,  trust,
          or entity (or of any other  corporation  with or into the Corporation)
          nor the sale,  lease, or conveyance of all or substantially all of the
          property or business of the Corporation  shall be deemed to constitute
          a liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the  Corporation  for the
          purpose of this Paragraph (e) of this Item (iii).

               (f) (1) The Series C Preferred  Stock is not redeemable  prior to
          September 3, 2004. On and after September 3, 2004, the Corporation, at
          its  option  upon not  less  than 30 nor  more  than 60 days'  written
          notice, may redeem shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, in whole or
          in part,  at any time and  from  time to time,  for a cash  redemption
          price of $75 per share,  plus all accrued and unpaid  dividends to the
          date fixed for redemption (except as provided below).

                   (2) The redemption  price  of  the  Series C Preferred  Stock
          (other  than the  portion  thereof  consisting  of accrued  but unpaid
          dividends)  shall be payable  solely out of the sale proceeds of other
          "capital  stock" of the  Corporation.  For  purposes of the  preceding
          sentence,  the term "capital stock" means any equity securities of the
          Corporation  (including  Common Stock and  Preferred  Stock),  shares,
          interest,   participation,   or  other  ownership  interests  (however
          designated)  and any rights  (other than debt  securities  convertible
          into or exchangeable for equity securities) or options to purchase any
          of the foregoing.  Holders of

                                       15
<PAGE>

          Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall surrender such shares at
          the place designated in the notice of redemption and shall be entitled
          to the redemption price and any accrued and unpaid  dividends  payable
          upon such redemption following such surrender. If notice of redemption
          has been given and if the Corporation has set aside in trust the funds
          necessary for the redemption, then from and after the redemption date:
          (i)  dividends  shall  cease to  accrue  on such  shares  of  Series C
          Preferred Stock; (ii) such shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall no
          longer be deemed  outstanding;  and (iii) all rights of the holders of
          such  shares  shall  terminate,   except  the  right  to  receive  the
          redemption  price.  If  less  than  all of the  outstanding  Series  C
          Preferred Stock is to be redeemed,  the Series C Preferred Stock to be
          redeemed  shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be  practicable
          without creating  fractional  shares) or by any other equitable method
          determined by the Corporation.

                   (3) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of  Series
          C Preferred  Stock shall have been or  contemporaneously  are declared
          and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment  thereof set
          apart for  payment,  no shares of Series C  Preferred  Stock  shall be
          redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
          simultaneously  redeemed,  and the  Corporation  shall not purchase or
          otherwise  acquire  directly  or  indirectly  any  shares  of Series C
          Preferred  Stock (except by exchange for Junior Stock);  however,  the
          foregoing  shall not prevent the purchase or  acquisition of shares of
          Series C Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made
          on the same  terms to holders  of all  outstanding  shares of Series C
          Preferred Stock.

                   (4)  Notice of redemption shall be given by  publication in a
          newspaper  of  general  circulation  in The  City  of New  York,  such
          publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks commencing
          not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. A
          similar notice shall be mailed by the  Corporation,  postage  prepaid,
          not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the  redemption  date,
          addressed  to  the  respective  holders  of  record  of the  Series  C
          Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their  respective  addresses as they
          appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. No failure to
          give or  defect  in such  notice  shall  affect  the  validity  of the
          proceedings  for the  redemption  of any shares of Series C  Preferred
          Stock  except as to the  holder to whom  notice was  defective  or not
          given.  Each notice shall state:  (i) the  redemption  date;  (ii) the
          redemption  price;  (iii) the  number of shares of Series C  Preferred
          Stock to be  redeemed;  (iv) the  place or places  where the  Series C
          Preferred  Stock is to be  surrendered  for payment of the  redemption
          price;  and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease
          to accrue on such  redemption  date.  If fewer  than all shares of the
          Series C Preferred  Stock held by any holder are to be  redeemed,  the
          notice  mailed to such holder  shall also specify the number of shares
          of Series C Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.

                   (5) The  holders of Series C Preferred Stock at the  close of
          business  on a Dividend  Record  Date shall be entitled to receive the
          dividend  payable with respect to such Series C Preferred Stock on the
          corresponding  Dividend  Payment Date  notwithstanding  the redemption
          thereof  between  such  Dividend  Record  Date  and the  corresponding
          Dividend Payment Date or the  Corporation's  default in the payment of
          the dividend due. Except as provided above,  the Corporation will make
          no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, regardless of whether in
          arrears, on called Series C Preferred Stock.

                   (6) The Series C Preferred  Stock has no stated  maturity and
          no  sinking  fund  shall be  required  and  shall  not be  subject  to
          mandatory redemption.  The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible
          into any other  securities of the  Corporation,  but is subject to the
          Excess Stock (and all other) provisions of this Article III.

               (g)  (1)  Except  as may  be  required  by  law  or as  otherwise
          expressly  provided in this Item (iii) of this  Subsection (c) of this
          Section 2 of this Article III, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock
          shall not be entitled to vote.  On all matters  with  respect to which
          the Series C Preferred Stock is entitled to vote, each share of Series
          C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote.

                   (2)  Whenever dividends on the Series C  Preferred  Stock are
          in arrears (which shall, with respect to any quarterly dividend,  mean
          that any such  divided has not been paid in full whether or not earned
          or declared) for six or more quarterly periods (whether consecutive or
          not), the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors
          shall be increased by two, and the holders of Series C Preferred Stock
          (voting  separately  as a class with all other series of Voting Parity
          Preferred)  shall  have  the  right  to  elect  two  directors  of the
          Corporation at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at
          least 10% of the Series C Preferred Stock or at least 10% of any other
          Voting Parity Preferred so in arrears (unless such request is received
          less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special
          meeting  of  the  shareholders)  or at  the  next  annual  meeting  of
          shareholders,  and  at  each  subsequent  annual  meeting,  until  all
          dividends  accumulated  on the Series C  Preferred  Stock for the past
          dividend  periods and the then current dividend period have been fully
          paid  or  declared  and a sum  sufficient  for  the  payment  of  such
          dividends has been set aside for payment.  If and when all accumulated
          dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the
          Series C Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for
          payment in full, the holders of the Series C Preferred  Stock shall be
          divested of the  foregoing  voting  rights (but subject  always to the
          same  provision  for the vesting of such voting  rights in the case of
          any similar future arrearages in six quarterly dividends),  and if all
          accumulated  dividends  and the dividend  for the then current  period
          have been paid in full or set aside for  payment in full on all series
          of Voting  Parity  Preferred,  the term of office of each  director so
          elected by the holders of the Series C Preferred  Stock and the Voting
          Parity Preferred shall terminate.

                   (3) As long as any  shares of Series C Preferred Stock remain
          outstanding,  the Corporation  shall not, without the affirmative vote
          or consent of the holders of at least  two-thirds  of the  outstanding
          shares of Series C Preferred Stock (voting as a separate  class);  (i)
          authorize or create,  or increase the  authorized or issued amount of,
          any Capital Stock ranking senior to the Series C Preferred  Stock with
          respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon
          liquidation,  dissolution,  or winding up or reclassify any authorized
          Capital Stock of the Corporation into or exchangeable for such shares,
          or create,  authorize, or issue any obligation or security convertible
          into or  evidencing  the right to purchase  any such  shares;  or (ii)
          amend,  alter,  or repeal the provisions of these Amended and Restated
          Articles  of  Incorporation,   whether  by  merger,  consolidation  or
          otherwise (an "Event"),  so as to materially and adversely  affect any
          right,  preference,  privilege,  or  voting  power  of  the  Series  C
          Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; however, as long as the Series
          C  Preferred  Stock  remains  outstanding  with its  terms  materially
          unchanged,  taking into account that upon the  occurrence of an Event,
          the Corporation may not be the surviving entity,  the occurrence of an
          Event  described in clause (ii) above of this  Subparagraph  (3) shall
          not  be  deemed  to  materially  and  adversely  affect  such  rights,
          preferences,  privileges,  or voting  power of the holders of Series C
          Preferred  Stock, and (x) any increase in the amount of the authorized
          Preferred  Stock or the  creation or  issuance of any other  series of
          Preferred  Stock,  or (y) any  increase  in the  amount of  authorized
          shares  of the  Series  C  Preferred  Stock  or any  other  series  of
          Preferred  Stock, in the case of either (x) or (y) ranking on a parity
          with or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock with respect to payment
          of  dividends  or  the   distribution  of  assets  upon   liquidation,
          dissolution,  or winding  up,  shall not be deemed to  materially  and
          adversely  affect  such  rights,  preferences,  privileges,  or voting
          powers.

                   (4) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the  Series  C  Preferred
          Stock  shall  not be  entitled  to  vote,  and  the  foregoing  voting
          provisions  shall not  apply,  if at or prior to the time when the act
          with  respect  to which  such vote  would  otherwise  be  required  is
          effected,  all outstanding shares of the Series C Preferred Stock have
          been redeemed or called for redemption, and sufficient funds have been
          deposited  in trust for the  benefit  of the  holders  of the Series C
          Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.

          (iv)  Series D  Preferred  Stock.  Subject  in all  cases to the other
     provisions  of this  Section  2 of this  Article  III,  including,  without
     limitation,  those  provisions  restricting  the  Beneficial  Ownership and
     Constructive Ownership of shares of Capital Stock and those provisions with
     respect  to  Excess  Stock,  the  following  sets  forth  the  designation,
     preferences,  limitations as to dividends, voting and other rights, and the
     terms and conditions of redemption of the Series D Preferred Stock (defined
     below) of the Corporation.

               (a)  There is hereby  established  a series  of  Preferred  Stock
          designated "9% Series D Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock,  par
          value $0.01 per share" (the "Series D Preferred  Stock"),  which shall
          consist of 250,000 authorized shares.

               (b) All shares of Series D Preferred Stock  redeemed,  purchased,
          exchanged,  or otherwise acquired by the Corporation shall be restored
          to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Preferred Stock.

               (c) The Series D Preferred Stock shall,  with respect to dividend
          rights,  rights  upon  liquidation,  winding  up or  dissolution,  and
          redemption  rights,  rank (i) junior to any other  series of Preferred
          Stock  hereafter  duly  established  by the Board of  Directors of the
          Corporation,  the terms of which specifically provide that such series
          shall rank prior to the Series D Preferred  Stock as to the payment of
          dividends and  distribution  of assets upon  liquidation  (the "Senior
          Preferred  Stock"),  (ii) pari passu  with the Series A,  Series B and
          Series C  Preferred  Stock and any other  series  of  Preferred  Stock
          hereafter   duly   established  by  the  Board  of  Directors  of  the
          Corporation,  the terms of which specifically provide that such series
          shall  rank pari passu  with the  Series D  Preferred  Stock as to the
          payment of dividends and  distribution of assets upon liquidation (the
          "Parity  Preferred  Stock"),  and (iii)  prior to any  other  class or
          series of Capital Stock,  including,  without  limitation,  the Common
          Stock of the  Corporation,  whether now existing or hereafter  created
          (collectively, the "Junior Stock").

               (d) (1) Subject to the rights of any Senior  Preferred Stock, the
          holders of the then  outstanding  shares of Series D  Preferred  Stock
          shall be  entitled to  receive,  as and when  declared by the Board of
          Directors,   out  of  funds  legally  available  for  the  payment  of
          dividends,  cumulative  preferential cash dividends at the annual rate
          of 9% of the $100 per share liquidation  preference  (i.e.,  $9.00 per
          annum per share).  Such dividends  shall accrue and be cumulative from
          the date of  original  issue and shall be payable  in equal  quarterly
          amounts  in arrears  on or before  the last day of each  March,  June,
          September,  and  December  or, if such day is not a business  day, the
          next  succeeding  business day except that, if such business day is in
          the next  succeeding  calendar year, such payment shall be made on the
          immediately  preceding  business day, in each case with the same force
          and effect as if made on such date (each,  a "Dividend  Payment Date")
          (for the purposes of this  Subparagraph  (1) of this  Paragraph (d), a
          "business  day" is any day,  other than a Saturday,  Sunday,  or legal
          holiday, on which banks in Detroit,  Michigan, are open for business).
          The first dividend may be for less than a full quarter.  All dividends
          on the  Series D  Preferred  Stock,  including  any  dividend  for any
          partial dividend  period,  shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day

                                       18
<PAGE>

          year consisting of twelve 30-day months.  Dividends will be payable to
          holders  of  record  as  they  appear  in  the  stock  records  of the
          Corporation  at the close of business on the  applicable  record date,
          which  shall  be the  15th day of the  calendar  month  in  which  the
          applicable  Dividend Payment Date falls or on such other date designed
          by the  Board of  Directors  of the  Corporation  for the  payment  of
          dividends  that is not more  than 30 nor less  than ten days  prior to
          such Dividend Payment Date (each, a "Dividend Record Date").

                   (2) No  dividends on the Series D Preferred  Stock  shall  be
          declared by the Board of Directors or paid or set apart for payment by
          the  Corporation  at such time as any  agreement  of the  Corporation,
          including any agreement  relating to its indebtedness,  prohibits such
          declaration,  payment,  or setting  apart for payment or provides that
          such  declaration,   payment,  or  setting  apart  for  payment  would
          constitute a breach of, or a default under,  such agreement or if such
          declaration,   payment,  or  setting  aside  shall  be  restricted  or
          prohibited by law.

                   (3) Dividends on  the  Series D Preferred  Stock shall accrue
          and be cumulative  regardless of whether the Corporation has earnings,
          regardless  of  whether  there are  funds  legally  available  for the
          payment of such  dividends,  and  regardless of whether such dividends
          are declared.  Accrued but unpaid  dividends on the Series D Preferred
          Stock will  accumulate  as of the Dividend  Payment Date on which they
          first become payable.  Except as set forth below in this  Subparagraph
          (3), no  dividends  shall be declared or paid or set apart for payment
          on any Common Stock or any other series of Preferred Stock ranking, as
          to  dividends,  on a parity  with or junior to the Series D  Preferred
          Stock (other than a dividend in shares of Junior Stock) for any period
          unless full cumulative  dividends have been or  contemporaneously  are
          declared  and paid or declared  and a sum  sufficient  for the payment
          thereof is set apart for such payment on the Series D Preferred  Stock
          for all past dividend  periods and the then current  dividend  period.
          When  dividends  are not paid in full (and a sum  sufficient  for such
          full  payment is not so set apart) upon the Series D  Preferred  Stock
          and the shares of any other  series of  Preferred  Stock  ranking on a
          parity  as to  dividends  with  the  Series  D  Preferred  Stock,  all
          dividends  declared  upon the Series D  Preferred  Stock and any other
          series of Preferred Stock ranking on a parity as to dividends with the
          Series D  Preferred  Stock  shall be  declared  pro rata,  so that the
          amount of dividends declared per share of Series D Preferred Stock and
          such other series of  Preferred  Stock shall in all cases bear to each
          other the same ratio that accrued  dividends per share on the Series D
          Preferred  Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock (which shall
          not  include  any  accrual in respect  of unpaid  dividends  for prior
          dividend  periods if such  Preferred  Stock does not have a cumulative
          dividend) bear to each other.  No interest shall be payable in respect
          of any dividend payment on the Series D Preferred Stock that may be in
          arrears.  Holders of shares of the Series D Preferred  Stock shall not
          be entitled to any dividend,  whether  payable in cash,  property,  or
          stock,  in  excess  of  full  cumulative  dividends  on the  Series  D
          Preferred Stock as provided above. Any dividend payment made on shares
          of the Series D Preferred  Stock  shall first be credited  against the
          earliest  accumulated  but unpaid  dividend  due with  respect to such
          shares that remains payable.

                   (4) Except as provided in Subparagraph (3) of this  Paragraph
          (d) of this Item (iv) of this Subsection (c) of this Section 2 of this
          Article  III,  unless  full  cumulative  dividends  on  the  Series  D
          Preferred Stock have been or  contemporaneously  are declared and paid
          or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment  thereof is set apart
          for  payment  for all  past  dividend  periods  and the  then  current
          dividend  period:  (i) no  dividends  (other  than in shares of Junior
          Stock)  shall be  declared  or paid or set aside for payment nor shall
          any other  distribution  be declared or made upon the Common Stock, or
          the Series B Preferred  Stock (or any other  Preferred  Stock  ranking
          junior to or on a parity with the Series D Preferred

                                       19
<PAGE>

          Stock as to  dividends  or upon  liquidation);  and (ii) no  shares of
          Common Stock or the Series B Preferred  Stock (or any other  Preferred
          Stock of the  Corporation  ranking  junior to or on a parity  with the
          Series D Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation) shall be
          redeemed,  purchased, or otherwise acquired for any consideration (nor
          shall any moneys be paid to or made  available  for a sinking fund for
          the  redemption  of any such  shares)  by the  Corporation  (except by
          conversion into or exchange for Junior Stock).

                   (5) If  for  any  taxable  year  the   Corporation  elects to
          designate as "capital  gains  dividends" (as defined in Section 857 of
          the Code) any portion (the  "Capital  Gains  Amount") of the dividends
          paid or made  available  for the year to  holders  of all  classes  of
          Capital Stock (the "Total Dividends"), then the portion of the Capital
          Gains  Amount  that  shall be  allocable  to the  holders  of Series D
          Preferred  Stock shall be the amount that the total  dividends paid or
          made available to the holders of the Series D Preferred  Stock for the
          year bears to the Total Dividends.

                   (6)  Notwithstanding  anything   to  the  contrary  set forth
          herein,  the  Corporation may declare and pay a dividend on the Common
          Stock,  without preserving the priority of distributions  described in
          Subparagraphs 3 and 4 of this Paragraph (d) of this Item (iii) of this
          Subsection  (c) of this Section 2 of this Article III, but only to the
          extent  such  dividends  are  required  to  preserve  the Real  Estate
          Investment Trust status of the Corporation and to avoid the imposition
          of an excise tax on the Corporation.

               (e) Subject to the rights of any Senior Stock, upon any voluntary
          or involuntary  liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the affairs
          of the  Corporation,  and before any  distribution  of assets shall be
          made in  respect  of any  Junior  Stock,  the  holders of the Series D
          Preferred  Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the
          Corporation  legally  available for distribution to its shareholders a
          liquidation preference of $100 per share in cash (or property having a
          fair market value as  determined  by the Board of Directors  valued at
          $100 per  share),  plus an  amount  equal to any  accrued  but  unpaid
          dividends to the date of payment.  After payment of the full amount of
          the liquidating  distributions to which they are entitled, the holders
          of Series D  Preferred  Stock  shall have no right or claims to any of
          the remaining assets of the Corporation.  Neither the consolidation or
          merger of the Corporation with or into any other  corporation,  trust,
          or entity (or of any other  corporation  with or into the Corporation)
          nor the sale,  lease, or conveyance of all or substantially all of the
          property or business of the Corporation  shall be deemed to constitute
          a liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of the  Corporation  for the
          purpose of this Paragraph (e) of this Item (iv).

               (f) (1) The Series D Preferred  Stock is not redeemable  prior to
          November 24, 2004. On and after November 24, 2004, the Corporation, at
          its  option  upon not  less  than 30 nor  more  than 60 days'  written
          notice, may redeem shares of the Series D Preferred Stock, in whole or
          in part,  at any time and  from  time to time,  for a cash  redemption
          price of $100 per share,  plus all accrued and unpaid dividends to the
          date fixed for redemption (except as provided below).

                   (2) The redemption  price of the  Series  D  Preferred  Stock
          (other  than the  portion  thereof  consisting  of accrued  but unpaid
          dividends)  shall be payable  solely out of the sale proceeds of other
          "capital  stock" of the  Corporation.  For  purposes of the  preceding
          sentence,  the term "capital stock" means any equity securities of the
          Corporation  (including  Common Stock and  Preferred  Stock),  shares,
          interest,   participation,   or  other  ownership  interests  (however
          designated)  and any rights  (other than debt  securities  convertible
          into or exchangeable for equity securities) or options to purchase any
          of the foregoing.  Holders of Series D Preferred  Stock to be redeemed
          shall  surrender such shares

                                       20
<PAGE>

          at the  place  designated  in the  notice of  redemption  and shall be
          entitled to the redemption  price and any accrued and unpaid dividends
          payable upon such redemption  following such  surrender.  If notice of
          redemption  has been  given  and if the  Corporation  has set aside in
          trust the funds necessary for the redemption,  then from and after the
          redemption date: (i) dividends shall cease to accrue on such shares of
          Series D Preferred Stock; (ii) such shares of Series D Preferred Stock
          shall no  longer be deemed  outstanding;  and (iii) all  rights of the
          holders of such shares  shall  terminate,  except the right to receive
          the redemption  price.  If less than all of the  outstanding  Series D
          Preferred Stock is to be redeemed,  the Series D Preferred Stock to be
          redeemed  shall be selected pro rata (as nearly as may be  practicable
          without creating  fractional  shares) or by any other equitable method
          determined by the Corporation.

                   (3) Unless full cumulative dividends on all shares of  Series
          D Preferred  Stock shall have been or  contemporaneously  are declared
          and paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the payment  thereof set
          apart for  payment,  no shares of Series D  Preferred  Stock  shall be
          redeemed unless all outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock are
          simultaneously  redeemed,  and the  Corporation  shall not purchase or
          otherwise  acquire  directly  or  indirectly  any  shares  of Series D
          Preferred  Stock (except by exchange for Junior Stock);  however,  the
          foregoing  shall not prevent the purchase or  acquisition of shares of
          Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to a purchase or exchange offer made
          on the same  terms to holders  of all  outstanding  shares of Series D
          Preferred Stock.

                   (4)  Notice of redemption shall be given by publication  in a
          newspaper  of  general  circulation  in The  City  of New  York,  such
          publication to be made once a week for two successive weeks commencing
          not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the redemption date. A
          similar notice shall be mailed by the  Corporation,  postage  prepaid,
          not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the  redemption  date,
          addressed  to  the  respective  holders  of  record  of the  Series  D
          Preferred Stock to be redeemed at their  respective  addresses as they
          appear on the stock transfer records of the Corporation. No failure to
          give or  defect  in such  notice  shall  affect  the  validity  of the
          proceedings  for the  redemption  of any shares of Series D  Preferred
          Stock  except as to the  holder to whom  notice was  defective  or not
          given.  Each notice shall state:  (i) the  redemption  date;  (ii) the
          redemption  price;  (iii) the  number of shares of Series D  Preferred
          Stock to be  redeemed;  (iv) the  place or places  where the  Series D
          Preferred  Stock is to be  surrendered  for payment of the  redemption
          price;  and (v) that dividends on the shares to be redeemed will cease
          to accrue on such  redemption  date.  If fewer  than all shares of the
          Series D Preferred  Stock held by any holder are to be  redeemed,  the
          notice  mailed to such holder  shall also specify the number of shares
          of Series D Preferred Stock to be redeemed from such holder.

                   (5) The holders of Series D Preferred  Stock at the  close of
          business  on a Dividend  Record  Date shall be entitled to receive the
          dividend  payable with respect to such Series D Preferred Stock on the
          corresponding  Dividend  Payment Date  notwithstanding  the redemption
          thereof  between  such  Dividend  Record  Date  and the  corresponding
          Dividend Payment Date or the  Corporation's  default in the payment of
          the dividend due. Except as provided above,  the Corporation will make
          no payment or allowance for unpaid dividends, regardless of whether in
          arrears, on called Series D Preferred Stock.

                   (6) The Series D Preferred  Stock has no stated  maturity and
          no  sinking  fund  shall be  required  and  shall  not be  subject  to
          mandatory redemption.  The Series D Preferred Stock is not convertible
          into any other  securities of the  Corporation,  but is subject to the
          Excess Stock (and all other) provisions of this Article III.

               (g) (1)  Except  as may  be  required  by  law  or as  otherwise
          expressly  provided in this Item (iv) of this  Subsection  (c) of this
          Section 2 of this Article III, the holders of Series D Preferred Stock
          shall not be entitled to vote.  On all matters  with  respect to which
          the Series D Preferred Stock is entitled to vote, each share of Series
          D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one vote.

                   (2)  Whenever dividends on the Series  D  Preferred Stock are
          in arrears (which shall, with respect to any quarterly dividend,  mean
          that any such  divided has not been paid in full whether or not earned
          or declared) for six or more quarterly periods (whether consecutive or
          not), the number of directors then constituting the Board of Directors
          shall be increased by two, and the holders of Series D Preferred Stock
          (voting  separately  as a class with all other series of Voting Parity
          Preferred)  shall  have  the  right  to  elect  two  directors  of the
          Corporation at a special meeting called by the holders of record of at
          least 10% of the Series D Preferred Stock or at least 10% of any other
          Voting Parity Preferred so in arrears (unless such request is received
          less than 90 days before the date fixed for the next annual or special
          meeting  of  the  shareholders)  or at  the  next  annual  meeting  of
          shareholders,  and  at  each  subsequent  annual  meeting,  until  all
          dividends  accumulated  on the Series D  Preferred  Stock for the past
          dividend  periods and the then current dividend period have been fully
          paid  or  declared  and a sum  sufficient  for  the  payment  of  such
          dividends has been set aside for payment.  If and when all accumulated
          dividends and the dividend for the then current dividend period on the
          Series D Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full or set aside for
          payment in full, the holders of the Series D Preferred  Stock shall be
          divested of the  foregoing  voting  rights (but subject  always to the
          same  provision  for the vesting of such voting  rights in the case of
          any similar future arrearages in six quarterly dividends),  and if all
          accumulated  dividends  and the dividend  for the then current  period
          have been paid in full or set aside for  payment in full on all series
          of Voting  Parity  Preferred,  the term of office of each  director so
          elected by the holders of the Series D Preferred  Stock and the Voting
          Parity Preferred shall terminate.

                   (3) As long as any shares of Series D Preferred Stock  remain
          outstanding,  the Corporation  shall not, without the affirmative vote
          or consent of the holders of at least  two-thirds  of the  outstanding
          shares of Series D Preferred Stock (voting as a separate  class);  (i)
          authorize or create,  or increase the  authorized or issued amount of,
          any Capital Stock ranking senior to the Series D Preferred  Stock with
          respect to the payment of dividends or the distribution of assets upon
          liquidation,  dissolution,  or winding up or reclassify any authorized
          Capital Stock of the Corporation into or exchangeable for such shares,
          or create,  authorize, or issue any obligation or security convertible
          into or  evidencing  the right to purchase  any such  shares;  or (ii)
          amend,  alter,  or repeal the provisions of these Amended and Restated
          Articles  of  Incorporation,   whether  by  merger,  consolidation  or
          otherwise (an "Event"),  so as to materially and adversely  affect any
          right,  preference,  privilege,  or  voting  power  of  the  Series  D
          Preferred Stock or the holders thereof; however, as long as the Series
          D  Preferred  Stock  remains  outstanding  with its  terms  materially
          unchanged,  taking into account that upon the  occurrence of an Event,
          the Corporation may not be the surviving entity,  the occurrence of an
          Event  described in clause (ii) above of this  Subparagraph  (3) shall
          not  be  deemed  to  materially  and  adversely  affect  such  rights,
          preferences,  privileges,  or voting  power of the holders of Series D
          Preferred  Stock, and (x) any increase in the amount of the authorized
          Preferred  Stock or the  creation or  issuance of any other  series
          of Preferred  Stock,  or (y) any increase in the amount of  authorized
          shares  of the  Series  D  Preferred  Stock  or any  other  series  of
          Preferred  Stock, in the case of either (x) or (y) ranking on a parity
          with or junior to the Series D Preferred Stock with respect to payment
          of  dividends  or  the   distribution  of  assets  upon   liquidation,
          dissolution,  or winding  up,  shall not be deemed to  materially  and
          adversely  affect  such  rights,  preferences,  privileges,  or voting
          powers.

                   (4) Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  the  Series D  Preferred
          Stock  shall  not be  entitled  to  vote,  and  the  foregoing  voting
          provisions  shall not  apply,  if at or prior to the time when the act
          with  respect  to which  such vote  would  otherwise  be  required  is
          effected,  all outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock have
          been redeemed or called for redemption, and sufficient funds have been
          deposited  in trust for the  benefit  of the  holders  of the Series D
          Preferred Stock to effect such redemption.

          all pension  trusts  sponsored  by the same  employer as such  pension
          trust   or   sponsored   by  any  of   such   employer's   Affiliates.
          Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  (y) above shall not apply in the case
          of  either  Motors   Insurance   Corporation   and  its   subsidiaries
          (collectively,  "MIC") or any pension trusts  sponsored by the General
          Motors Corporation,  a Delaware  corporation  ("GMC"), or the American
          Telephone and Telegraph Company, a New York corporation  ("AT&T"),  or
          by any of their respective  Affiliates,  provided that with respect to
          MIC and each such pension trust sponsored by GMC, AT&T or any of their
          respective  Affiliates,  other than the Existing Holders  described in
          (i) through  (iii) in the  definition  thereof,  all of the  following
          conditions are met: (i) each such pension trust is  administered,  and
          will  continue to be  administered,  by persons who do not serve in an
          administrative  or other  capacity  to any other  such  pension  trust
          sponsored by GMC or any  Affiliate of GMC or AT&T or any  Affiliate of
          AT&T, as applicable,  including the Existing Holders  described in (i)
          through (iv) in the definition thereof,  (it being understood that the
          fact that any two such pension  trusts may have in common one or more,
          but less than a majority,  of the persons having  ultimate  investment
          authority  for such  pension  trusts shall not cause such trusts to be
          treated as one Person,  provided  that they are  otherwise  separately
          administered  as hereinbefore  described),  (ii) day to day investment
          decisions  with  respect  to MIC  are  made  by a  person  or  persons
          different  than the person or persons who make such  decisions for the
          pension  trusts  sponsored  by GMC or its  affiliates,  including  the
          Existing  Holders  described  in (i),  (ii) and, in respect of (i) and
          (ii),  item  (iv) in the  definition  thereof,  (although  MIC and the
          pension  trusts  sponsored  by GMC may have in  common  the  person or
          persons with ultimate investment authority for such entities), and the
          investment of MIC in the  Corporation  does not exceed 2% of the value
          of the outstanding Capital Stock of the Corporation, (iii) neither MIC
          nor any such pension  trust acts or will act, in concert with MIC, any
          other pension  trust  sponsored by GMC or any Affiliate of GMC or AT&T
          or any

                                       28
<PAGE>

          Affiliate of AT&T,  as  applicable,  including  the  Existing  Holders
          described in (i) through (iv) in the definition thereof,  with respect
          to its  investment in the  Corporation,  and (iv) as from time to time
          requested by the Corporation, MIC and each pension trust shall provide
          the Corporation  with a  representation  and undertaking in writing to
          the foregoing effect.

                   (3) If  there  are  two  or  more   classes  of  stock   then
          outstanding, the total value of the outstanding Capital Stock shall be
          allocated  among the  different  classes and series  according  to the
          relative value of each class or series,  as determined by reference to
          the Market  Price per share of each such  class or  series,  using the
          date on  which  the  Transfer  occurs  as the  relevant  date,  or the
          effective  date of the change in  capital  structure  as the  relevant
          date, as appropriate.

               (g) If any shares are transferred resulting in a violation of the
          Ownership  Limit or Paragraphs  (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this Item (ii)
          of this  Subsection  (d) of this Section 2 of this  Article III,  such
          Transfer  shall be valid only with  respect  to such  amount of shares
          transferred as does not result in a violation of such limitations, and
          such Transfer otherwise shall be null and void ab initio.

          (iii) Conversion to Excess Stock.

               (a) If,  notwithstanding  the other provisions  contained in this
          Article III, at any time there is a purported Transfer or other change
          in the  capital  structure  of the  Corporation  such that any  Person
          (other than an Existing  Holder) would  Beneficially Own or any Person
          (other than an Existing  Holder)  would  Constructively  Own shares of
          Regular  Capital Stock in excess of the Ownership  Limit,  or that any
          Person who is an Existing Holder would  Beneficially Own or any Person
          who is an Existing Holder would  Constructively  Own shares of Regular
          Capital Stock in excess of the Existing Holder Limit,  then, except as
          otherwise  provided  in Item  (viii)  of this  Subsection  (d) of this
          Section  2 of this  Article  III,  such  shares  of  Common  Stock  or
          Preferred Stock, or both, in excess of the Ownership Limit or Existing
          Holder  Limit,  as the case may be,  (rounded up to the nearest  whole
          share) shall automatically  become Excess Stock. Such conversion shall
          be  effective as of the close of business on the business day prior to
          the date of the Transfer or change in capital structure.

               (b) If,  notwithstanding  the other provisions  contained in this
          Article  III,  at any time,  there is a  purported  Transfer  or other
          change  in  the  capital  structure  of  the  Corporation   which,  if
          effective, would cause the Corporation to become "closely held" within
          the  meaning of  Section  856(h) of the Code then the shares of Common
          Stock or Preferred Stock, or both, being Transferred which would cause
          the  Corporation  to be "closely  held"  within the meaning of Section
          856(h)  of the Code or held by a Person  in  excess  of that  Person's
          Ownership Limit or Existing Holder Limit, as applicable (rounded up to
          the nearest whole share) shall automatically become Excess Stock. Such
          conversion  shall be  effective  as of the  close of  business  on the
          business  day prior to the date of the  Transfer  or change in capital
          structure.

               (c) Shares of Excess Stock shall be issued and outstanding  stock
          of the Corporation.  The Purported  Transferee shall have no rights in
          such shares of Excess  Stock except as provided in  Subsection  (e) of
          this Section 2 of this Article III.

          (iv)  Notice of  Restricted  Transfer.  Any  Person  who  acquires  or
     attempts to acquire shares in violation of Item (ii) of this Subsection (d)
     of this  Section 2 of this  Article  III, or any Person who is a transferee
     such that Excess Stock results under Item (iii) of this  Subsection  (d) of
     this Section 2 of this Article III, shall  immediately  give written notice
     to the Corporation of such event

                                       29

     and  shall  provide  to  the  Corporation  such  other  information  as the
     Corporation may request regarding such Person's ownership of Capital Stock.

          (v)  Owners Required to Provide Information.

               (a)  Every  Beneficial  Owner  of  more  than 5% (or  such  other
          percentage,  as provided in the applicable  regulations  adopted under
          Sections 856 through 859 of the Code) of the outstanding shares of the
          Capital Stock of the Corporation shall, within 30 days after January 1
          of each year, give written notice to the Corporation  stating the name
          and  address  of  such   Beneficial   Owner,   the  number  of  shares
          Beneficially Owned and Constructively Owned, and a full description of
          how such shares are held. Every Beneficial Owner shall, upon demand by
          the   Corporation,   disclose  to  the  Corporation  in  writing  such
          additional  information  with respect to the Beneficial  Ownership and
          Constructive  Ownership of the Capital Stock as the Board of Directors
          deems  appropriate  or necessary (i) to comply with the  provisions of
          the Code,  regarding the  qualification  of the  Corporation as a REIT
          under the Code, and (ii) to ensure compliance with the Ownership Limit
          or the Existing Holder Limit.

               (b) Any Person who is a Beneficial Owner or Constructive Owner of
          shares of Capital Stock and any Person  (including the  shareholder of
          record)  who is  holding  Capital  Stock  for a  Beneficial  Owner  or
          Constructive  Owner, and any proposed  transferee of shares,  upon the
          determination by the Board of Directors to be reasonably  necessary to
          protect the status of the Corporation as a REIT under the Code,  shall
          provide a statement or affidavit to the Corporation, setting forth the
          number  of shares  of  Capital  Stock  already  Beneficially  Owned or
          Constructively  Owned by such  shareholder or proposed  transferee and
          any related person specified, which statement or affidavit shall be in
          the form prescribed by the Corporation for that purpose.

          (vi) Remedies Not Limited. Subject to Subsection (h) of this Section 2
     of this Article III, nothing  contained in this Article III shall limit the
     authority  of the Board of  Directors to take such other action as it deems
     necessary or advisable (i) to protect the  Corporation and the interests of
     its shareholders in the preservation of the Corporation's status as a REIT,
     and (ii) to insure  compliance  with the  Ownership  Limit and the Existing
     Holder Limit.

     of this Section 2 of this Article III,  shall be  determined or resolved by
     the Board of Directors and any such  determination  or resolution  shall be
     final and binding on the Corporation, its shareholders,  and all parties in
     interest.

          (viii)  Exceptions.  The Board of  Directors,  upon advice from, or an
     opinion from, Counsel, may exempt a Person from the Ownership Limit if such
     Person is a Look Through  Entity,  provided,  however,  in no event may any
     such exception cause such Person's  ownership,  direct or indirect (without
     taking into account such Person's ownership of interests in TRG), to exceed
     9.9% of the value of the outstanding Capital Stock.

          For a period of 90 days  following  the  purchase  of Regular  Capital
     Stock  by an  underwriter  that  (i)  is a Look  Through  Entity  and  (ii)
     participates  in a public  offering  of the  Regular  Capital  Stock,  such
     underwriter shall not be subject to the Ownership Limit with respect to the
     Regular Capital Stock purchased by it as a part of such public offering.

     Purported  Transferee,  shall demand that any certificate or other evidence
     of ownership of the shares of Excess Stock be  immediately  surrendered  to
     the Designated Agent (the "Demand").

          (ii)  Excess  Share  Distributions.  The  Designated  Agent  shall  be
     entitled  to  receive  all  Excess  Share   Distributions.   The  Purported
     Transferee of Regular  Capital Stock that has become Excess Stock shall not
     be entitled to any  dividends or other  distributions,  including,  without
     limitation,  capital gain distributions,  with respect to the Excess Stock.
     Any Excess  Share  Distributions  paid to a Purported  Transferee  shall be
     remitted to the Designated Agent within thirty business days after the date

               (a) Excess Stock shall be transferable by the Designated Agent as

               (b)  Upon  delivery  of the  certificates  or other  evidence  of
          ownership of the shares of Excess Stock to the Designated  Agent,  the
          Designated Agent shall  immediately sell such shares in an arms-length
          transaction  (over the New York Stock  Exchange or such other exchange
          over  which the  shares of the  applicable  class or series of Regular
          Capital Stock may then be traded,  if practicable),  and the Purported

                   (1)  the Net Sales Proceeds; or

                   (2) the price per share that such Purported  Transferee  paid
          for the Regular Capital Stock in the purported  Transfer that resulted
          in the Excess Stock, or if the Purported Transferee did not give value
          for such shares  (because  the Transfer  was,  for example,  through a
          gift,  devise or other  transaction),  a price per share  equal to the
          Market Price determined using the date of the purported  Transfer that
          resulted in the Excess Stock as the relevant date.

               (c) If some or all of the  shares of Excess  Stock have been sold
          prior to receiving the Demand,  such sale shall be deemed to been made
          for the benefit of and as the agent for the  Designated  Charity.  The
          Purported  Transferee shall pay to the Designated Agent, within thirty
          business  days of the date of the Demand,  the entire  gross  proceeds
          realized upon such sale.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence,  the
          Designated  Agent  may  grant  written  permission  to  the  Purported
          Transferee  to retain an amount from the gross  proceeds  equal to the
          amount the  Purported  Transferee  would have been entitled to receive
          had the Designated  Agent sold the shares as provided in Item (iii)(b)
          of this Subsection (e) of this Section 2 of this Article III.

               (d) The  Designated  Agent shall  promptly pay to the  Designated
          Charity any Excess Share  Distributions  recovered  by the  Designated
          Agent  and the  excess,  if any,  of the Net Sales  Proceeds  over the
          amount due to the Purported Transferee as provided in Item (iii)(b) of
          this Subsection (e) of this Section 2 of this Article III.

          (iv) Voting  Rights.  The  Designated  Agent shall have the  exclusive
     right to vote all

                                       31
<PAGE>

     shares of Excess Stock as the  attorney-in-fact for the Designated Charity.
     The Purported  Transferee shall not be entitled to vote such shares (except
     as  required by  applicable  law).  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  votes
     erroneously cast by a Prohibited Transferee shall not be invalidated in the
     event that the Corporation has already taken irreversible  corporate action
     to effect a reorganization, merger, sale or dissolution of the Corporation.

          (v)  Rights  Upon  Liquidation.  In  the  event  of any  voluntary  or
     involuntary liquidation,  dissolution or winding up of, or any distribution
     of the assets of the Corporation,  a Purported Transferee shall be entitled
     to receive the lesser of (i) that amount  which would have been due to such
     Purported  Transferee  had the  Designated  Agent sold the shares of Excess
     Stock as provided in Item (iii)(b) of this Subsection (e) of this Section 2
     of this  Article III and (ii) that amount  which would have been due to the
     Purported  Transferee  if the  Transfer  had been valid  under Item (ii) of
     Subsection (d) of this Section 2 of this Article III, determined (A) in the
     case of Common Stock,  pursuant to Subsection  (a)(ii) of this Section 2 of
     this Article III, and (B) in the case of Preferred  Stock,  pursuant to the
     provisions of these Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, amended
     as  authorized  by  Section 1 of this  Article  III,  which  sets forth the
     liquidation rights of such class or series of Preferred Stock. With respect
     to shares of Excess Stock, a Purported Transferee shall not have any rights
     to share in the assets of the Corporation upon the liquidation, dissolution
     or winding up of the Corporation other than the right to receive the amount
     determined  in the  preceding  sentence  and shall not be  entitled  to any
     preference or priority (as a creditor of the Corporation)  over the holders
     of the shares of Regular  Capital Stock.  Any Excess  Liquidation  Proceeds
     shall be paid to the Designated Charity.

          (vi) Action by Corporation to Enforce  Transfer  Restrictions.  If the
     Purported Transferee fails to deliver the certificates or other evidence of
     ownership and all Excess Share Distributions to the Designated Agent within
     thirty business days of the date of Demand, the Corporation shall take such
     legal  action to  enforce  the  provisions  of this  Article  III as may be
     permitted under applicable law.

     (f)  Legend.  Each  certificate  for Capital Stock shall bear the following
          legend:

          "The Amended and Restated Articles of  Incorporation,  as the same may
          be  amended  (the  "Articles"),  impose  certain  restrictions  on the
          transfer and ownership of the shares  represented by this  Certificate
          based  upon the  percentage  of the  outstanding  shares  owned by the
          shareholder.  At no  charge,  any  shareholder  may  receive a written
          statement  of the  restrictions  on transfer  and  ownership  that are
          imposed by the Articles."

     (g)  Severability.  If any provision of this Article III or any application
of any such  provision is determined to be invalid by any Federal or state court
having  jurisdiction over the issues,  the validity of the remaining  provisions
shall not be affected and other applications of such provision shall be affected
only to the extent necessary to comply with the determination of such court.

     (h) New York Stock Exchange Settlement.  Nothing contained in these Amended
and Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  shall  preclude the  settlement of any
transaction  entered into through the  facilities of the New York Stock Exchange
or of any other stock  exchange on which  shares of the Common Stock or class or
series of Preferred  Stock may be listed,  or of the Nasdaq  National Market (if
the shares are quoted on such Market) and which has conditioned  such listing or
quotation on the inclusion in the Corporation's Amended and Restated Articles of
Incorporation  of a provision  such as this  Subsection  (h).  The fact that the
settlement of any  transaction  is permitted  shall not negate the effect of any
other  provision of this Article III and any  transferee  in such a  transaction
shall be  subject to all of the  provisions  and  limitations  set forth in this
Article III.

     When a  compromise  or  arrangement  or a  plan  of  reorganization  of the
Corporation is proposed  between the  Corporation and its creditors or any class
of them or between the Corporation and its  shareholders or any class of them, a
court of equity jurisdiction within the State of Michigan, on application of the

class  of  creditors  or of the  shareholders  or class  of  shareholders  to be
affected by the proposed  compromise or  arrangement  or  reorganization,  to be

representing  75% in value of the  creditors  or class of  creditors,  or of the
shareholders or class of shareholders to be affected by the proposed  compromise
or  arrangement or a  reorganization,  agree to a compromise or arrangement or a
reorganization  of  the  Corporation  as a  consequence  of  the  compromise  or
arrangement, the compromise or arrangement and the reorganization, if sanctioned
by the court to which the application has been made, shall be binding on all the
creditors  or  class  of  creditors,  or on all the  shareholders  or  class  of
shareholders and also on the Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                       33
<PAGE>

to appoint one or more Partnership  Committee  members,  T-Co or an Affiliate of
T-Co, (iii) for so long as a Taubman Transferee (as hereinafter defined) has the
right  to  appoint  one  or  more  Partnership   Committee  members,  a  Taubman
Transferee,  or an  Affiliate of such  Taubman  Transferee,  (iv) for so long as
GMPTS has the right to appoint one or more Partnership Committee members, GMPTS,

to a foreclosure or like action in respect of a pledge of a partnership interest
in TRG, the ability of such Person to act as a substitute  partner) of A. Alfred

percentage interest in TRG being transferred exceeds 7.7%.

     For so long as the Corporation has the right to designate,  pursuant to the
Partnership Agreement, any members of the Partnership Committee, the affirmative
vote  of  both  a  majority  of the  Independent  Directors  who  do not  have a
beneficial  financial interest in the action before the Board of Directors and a

a majority of all members of the Board of Directors who do not have a beneficial

     No director of the  Corporation  shall be liable to the  Corporation or its
shareholders for monetary damages for a breach of the director's fiduciary duty;
provided,  however,  the  foregoing  provision  shall  not be  deemed to limit a
director's liability to the Corporation or its shareholders resulting from:

          (i)  a breach of the director's  duty of loyalty to the Corporation or
               its  shareholders;

                                       34

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                  Indemnification of Officers, Directors, Etc.

1.   Indemnification of Directors.

     The  Corporation  shall and does hereby  indemnify a person  (including the
heirs,  executors,  and administrators of such person) who is or was a party to,
or who is threatened to be made a party to, a threatened,  pending, or completed
action,  suit,  or  proceeding,  whether  civil,  criminal,  administrative,  or
investigative and whether formal or informal,  including, without limitation, an
action by or in the right of the  Corporation,  by reason of the fact that he or
she is or was a director of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request
of the Corporation as a director (or in a similar capacity, including serving as
a member of the  Partnership  Committee and of any other committee of TRG) or in
any other representative  capacity of another foreign or domestic corporation or
of or with respect to any other entity  (including  TRG),  whether for profit or
not, against expenses, attorneys' fees, judgments, penalties, fines, and amounts
paid in settlement  actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection
with the action,  suit,  or  proceeding.  This Section 1 of this Article VIII is
intended to grant the persons herein  described with the fullest  protection not
prohibited  by existing  law in effect as of the date of filing this Amended and
Restated  Articles  of  Incorporation  or  such  greater  protection  as  may be
permitted or not prohibited under succeeding provisions of law.

2.   Indemnification of Officers, Etc.

     The Corporation  has the power to indemnify a person  (including the heirs,
executors,  and  administrators of such person) who is or was a party to, or who
is  threatened  to be made a party to, a threatened,  pending,  or  contemplated
action,  suit,  or  proceeding,  whether  civil,  criminal,  administrative,  or
investigative  and whether formal or informal,  including an action by or in the
right of the  Corporation,  by  reason  of the fact  that he or she is or was an
officer,  employee,  or agent of the  Corporation  or is or was  serving  at the
request of the Corporation as an officer, partner,  trustee,  employee, or agent
of another foreign or domestic corporation,  partnership  (including TRG), joint
venture, trust or other enterprise, whether for profit or not, against expenses,
including  attorneys'  fees,  judgments,  penalties,  fines, and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with the
action,  suit, or proceeding,  if the person acted in good faith and in a manner
he or she  reasonably  believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of
the  Corporation or its  shareholders,  and with respect to a criminal action or
proceeding,  if the person had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct
was unlawful. Unless ordered by a court, an indemnification under this Section 2
of this Article VIII shall be made by the Corporation  only as authorized in the
specific  case  upon  a  determination  that  indemnification  of  the  officer,
employee,  or agent is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the
applicable standard of conduct set forth in this Section 2 of this Article VIII.

3.   Advancement of Expenses.

         The Corporation  shall pay the expenses  incurred by a person described
in Section 1 of this Article VIII in defending a civil or criminal action, suit,
or proceeding described in such Section 1 in advance of the final disposition of
the action, suit, or proceeding. The Corporation shall pay the expenses incurred

of an  undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay the expenses if it is
ultimately  determined  that the person is not entitled to be indemnified by the
Corporation.  Such undertaking shall be by unlimited  general  obligation of the
person on whose behalf advances are made but need not be secured.

Attention:

Ladies and Gentlemen:

1.   Certain Representations; Opinions of Counsel

     (a)  The Taubman  Realty Group  Limited  Partnership  (the  "Company")  and
          Taubman  Centers,  Inc., the managing  general  partner of the Company
          ("TCO"),  represent and warrant to the undersigned  ("Subscriber")  as
          follows:

          (i)  TCO has made with the Securities  Exchange Commission ("SEC") all
               filings  required  to be made by it (the  "SEC  Reports").  Since
               September  30,  1998,  the  Company  has  not  been,  and is not,
               required to file any reports  with the SEC.  The SEC Reports were
               prepared and filed in compliance with the Securities Exchange Act
               of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange  Act"),  or the Securities Act
               of 1933, as amended (the  "Securities  Act"), as applicable,  and
               the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder,  and
               did  not,  as of  their  respective  dates,  contain  any  untrue
               statement of a material  fact or omit to state any material  fact
               necessary in order to make the statements  contained therein,  in
               light of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
               misleading.  The financial  statements and the interim  financial
               statements  of TCO included in the SEC Reports  were  prepared in
               accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles (except
               as may be  indicated in the notes  thereto) and fairly  presented
               the financial  condition and results of operations of TCO and its
               subsidiaries  as at the dates  thereof and for the  periods  then
               ended,  subject, in the case of the interim financial statements,
               to  normal  year-end   adjustments  and  any  other   adjustments
               described therein;

          (ii) there has been no material  adverse  change in or  affecting  the
               business,  assets or financial condition of the Company since the
               most recent such filing;

          (iii)the  Company  and TCO have all  requisite  corporate  and limited
               partnership  authority  and power to  execute  and  deliver  this
               Private Placement Purchase Agreement,  the Registration Agreement
               (as hereinafter  defined),  the  Certificate  with Respect to Tax
               Matters of even date herewith executed
<PAGE>

               and delivered by the Company, and the Designation,  Distribution,
               Redemption,  Exchange, and Consent Provisions with Respect to the
               9% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Equity of the Company
               (collectively, the "Transaction Documents") and to consummate the
               transactions  contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery of
               the   Transaction   Documents   and  the   consummation   of  the
               transactions  contemplated  thereby  have been  duly and  validly
               authorized  by all  requisite  corporate  or limited  partnership
               action  on the  part  of  the  Company  and  TCO,  and  no  other
               proceedings  on the part of the Company or TCO are  necessary  to
               authorize  the   Transaction   Documents  or  to  consummate  the
               transactions  contemplated hereby. The Transaction Documents have
               been duly and validly  executed and  delivered by the Company and
               TCO.  The  Transaction  Documents  constitute  valid and  binding
               obligations  of the Company and TCO,  enforceable  in  accordance
               with their terms;

          (iv) neither  the   execution,   delivery  nor   performance   of  the
               Transaction  Documents by the Company or TCO will conflict  with,
               result in a default, right to accelerate or loss of rights under,
               or result in the  creation  of any  lien,  charge or  encumbrance
               pursuant   to,  any   provision   of  the   Company's   or  TCO's
               organizational  documents  or any  franchise,  mortgage,  deed of
               trust, lease,  license,  agreement,  understanding,  law, rule or
               regulation or any order, judgement or decree to which the Company
               or TCO is a party or by which the  Company or TCO may be bound or
               affected;

          (v)  the 1998 financial  statements of the Company and TCO,  including
               the notes thereto, and supporting schedules have been prepared in
               conformity  with GAAP  applied on a consistent  basis  (except as
               otherwise   noted  therein)  and  present  fairly  the  financial
               position of the Company and TCO as of the dates indicated and the
               results of its operations for the periods shown;

          (vi) there is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or,
               to the Company's or TCO's knowledge, currently threatened against
               the  Company or TCO that  questions  the  validity  of any of the
               Transaction  Documents or the issuance of Parity Preferred Equity
               (as defined  below),  or the right of the Company or TCO to enter
               into  any of  the  Transaction  Documents  or to  consummate  the
               transactions  contemplated  thereby or that could  reasonably  be
               expected to  interfere  with the ability of the Company or TCO to
               perform their obligations thereunder;

          (vii)the Equity (as defined below) when issued,  sold and delivered by

               (collectively,  "Encumbrances").  The Shares (as  defined  below)
               when issued in redemption of the Equity, shall be duly and valued

               up, dividends or distributions  other than the Series A Preferred
               Equity  and  Series  C  Preferred  Equity.  There  are no  equity
               interests  in TCO  authorized,  issued or  outstanding  that rank
               senior  to, or on a parity  with,  the  Shares  with  respect  to
               liquidation,  winding up, dividends or  distributions  other than
               the Series A Preferred Stock of TCO, the Series B Preferred Stock
               of TCO and the Series C Preferred  Stock of TCO, and TCO will not
               authorize,  create  or issue  any such  senior  equity  interests
               without the prior written consent of Subscriber; and

          (ix) the foregoing  representations and warranties will continue to be
               true and correct on the Closing Date (as defined below).

     (b)  The Company will make the tax and securities representations set forth
          on Exhibit B on the Closing Date.

          Preferred  Stock to be  issued to the  Company  upon  exchange  of the

          Registration  Rights  Agreement  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  D (the
          "Registration  Agreement")  which  is  being  executed  and  delivered
          simultaneously herewith.

4.   Covenants of the Company and TCO

     (a)  No later than June 30, 2000, TCO shall amend its Restated  Articles of
          Incorporation  so that TCO will have the authority to issue additional
          shares of preferred stock.  Simultaneously  therewith, TCO shall amend
          its  series  designation  creating  the  Series D  Preferred  Stock to
          increase the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock constituting
          the  series to an amount  not less than  250,000  shares.  Thereafter,
          subject  to the Second  Amendment  and  Restatement  of  Agreement  of
          Limited  Partnership  of  the  Company,  as  amended,   including  the
          Designation,  Redemption, Exchange, and Voting Provisions with Respect
          to the Series D Preferred Equity (the  "Partnership  Agreement"),  the

          value of the  Equity  for one share of Series D  Preferred  Stock,  it
          being understood that the aggregate amount in liquidation value of the
          equity shall remain $25,000,000.

5.   Subscriber's Representations.

     (a)  Subscriber  represents  and warrants that it is purchasing  the Equity
          solely for  investment  solely for its own account and not with a view
          to or for the resale or distribution thereof except as permitted under
          the Registration  Agreement or as otherwise permitted under applicable
          law, including the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities
          Act").

     (b)  Subscriber  understands  that it may sell or  otherwise  transfer  the
          Equity or the shares issuable on conversion of the Equity only if such
          transaction  is  duly  registered  under  the  Securities  Act,  or if
          Subscriber  shall have  received the  favorable  opinion of counsel to
          Subscriber,  which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to counsel
          to the Company,  to the effect that such sale or other transfer may be
          made in the absence of  registration  under the  Securities  Act,  and
          registration or qualification in every  applicable  state.  Subscriber
          realizes that the Equity is not a liquid  investment.  Subscriber  has
          the knowledge and experience to evaluate the Company and the risks and
          merits relating thereto.

     (c)  Subscriber  represents and warrants that  Subscriber is an "accredited
          investor"  as such term is  defined  in Rule 501 of the  Regulation  D
          promulgated  pursuant to the Securities  Act, and shall be such on the
          date any Equity is issued to Subscriber;

                                        4
<PAGE>

          Subscriber  acknowledges  that Subscriber is able to bear the economic
          risk of  losing  Subscriber's  entire  investment  in the  Equity  and
          understands  that an  investment in the Company  involves  substantial
          risks;  Subscriber  has the power  and  authority  to enter  into this
          Agreement,  and the execution and delivery of, and  performance  under
          this  Agreement,   shall  not  conflict  with  any  rule,  regulation,
          judgement or agreement  applicable to  Subscriber.  Subscriber has had
          the  opportunity  to discuss the Company's  affairs with the Company's
          officers.

     (d)  Subscriber  represents  and  warrants  that it was not  formed  with a
          principal purpose of permitting the Company to satisfy the 100 partner
          limitation of Treas. Reg. ss. 1.7704.1(h)(1)(ii).

6.   Execution of Partnership Agreement

     By executing this Private Placement Purchase  Agreement,  Subscriber agrees
     to be bound by and subject to the terms of the Partnership  Agreement as if
     a signatory thereto.

7.   Miscellaneous

     This Agreement may not be changed or terminated except by written agreement
     of both parties.  It shall be binding on the parties and on their permitted
     assigns. It sets forth all agreements of the parties,  and may be signed in
     counterparts.

     This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance  with, the
     laws of New York without regard to conflicts of law principles thereof. The
     federal and state courts sitting in New York, New York shall have exclusive
     jurisdiction over all matters relating to this Agreement.

     All   notices,   requests,   service  of  process,   consents,   and  other
     communications under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed
     to have been delivered (i) on the date personally delivered or (ii) one day
     after  properly  sent by  recognized  overnight  courier,  addressed to the
     respective parties at their address set forth in this Agreement or (iii) on
     the  day  transmitted  by  facsimile  so  long  as a  confirmation  copy is
     simultaneously  forwarded by  recognized  overnight  courier,  in each case
     addressed  to the  respective  parties at their  address  set forth in this
     Agreement.  Either  party  hereto  may  designate  a  different  address by

                          REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT


         THIS  REGISTRATION  RIGHTS  AGREEMENT  (this  "Agreement")  is made and
entered into as of November  24, 1999 by and between  Taubman  Centers,  Inc., a
Michigan  corporation  (the  "Company"),  and GS-MSD  Select  Sponsors,  L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership ("Holder").

         WHEREAS,  Holder is  receiving  on the date  hereof  Series D Preferred
Equity (the  "Equity")  in The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited  Partnership,  a
Delaware limited partnership (the "Partnership");

         WHEREAS,  in connection  therewith,  the Company has agreed to grant to
Holder the Registration Rights (as defined in Section 1 hereof);

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  the parties hereto, in consideration of the foregoing
and the mutual covenants and agreements  hereinafter set forth,  hereby agree as
follows:

SECTION 1.        REGISTRATION RIGHTS

         If Holder receives 9% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock of
the Company (the  "Preferred  Stock") upon exchange of the Equity (the "Exchange
Shares") pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated  Agreement of Limited
Partnership  of the  Partnership,  as the same has been and may be amended  from
time to time (the "Partnership Agreement"), then unless such Exchange Shares are
issued to Holder  pursuant to an Issuer  Registration  Statement  as provided in
Section 2 below,  Holder shall be entitled to offer for sale pursuant to a shelf
registration statement, the Exchange Shares, subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in Section 3 hereof (the "Registration Rights").

SECTION 2.        ISSUER REGISTRATION STATEMENT

         Anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event
that the  Exchange  Shares are issued by the  Company to Holder  pursuant  to an
effective registration statement (an "Issuer Registration Statement") filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"),  the Company shall be
deemed  to  have  satisfied  all  of its  registration  obligations  under  this
Agreement.

SECTION 3.        DEMAND REGISTRATION RIGHTS

         3.1 (a) Registration Procedure.  Unless such Exchange Shares are issued
pursuant to an Issuer  Registration  Statement  as provided in Section 2 hereof,
then subject to Sections  3.1(c) and 3.2 hereof,  if Holder  desires to exercise
its  Registration  Rights with  respect to the  Exchange  Shares,  Holder  shall
deliver to the Company a written notice (a "Registration  Notice") informing the
Company of such  exercise and  specifying  the number of shares to be offered by
such  Holder  (such  shares  to be  offered  being  referred  to  herein  as the
"Registrable Securities").  Such notice may be given at any time on or after the
date a notice of exchange is delivered by Holder to the Partnership  pursuant to
the Partnership Agreement, but must be given at least fifteen (15) Business Days
prior to the  anticipated  consummation  of the sale of Registrable  Securities,
which  consummation  shall  in  any  event

                                     1
<PAGE>

be subject to an effective Shelf Registration Statement (as hereinafter defined)
or an effective New Registration  Statement (as hereinafter defined). As used in
this Agreement, a "Business Day" is any Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,  Thursday or
Friday  other than a day on which  banks and other  financial  institutions  are
authorized  or  required  to be closed for  business in the State of New York or
Michigan.  Upon receipt of the Registration  Notice, the Company,  if it has not
already caused the Registrable  Securities to be included as part of an existing
shelf  registration  statement  (prior to the filing of which the Company  shall
have given ten (10) Business Days notice to Holder) and related  prospectus that
the  Company  than has on file  with the  Commission  (the  "Shelf  Registration
Statement")  (in which event the Company  shall be deemed to have  satisfied its
registration  obligation  under this Section 3), will cause to be filed with the
Commission as soon as reasonably  practicable  after receiving the  Registration
Notice a new registration  statement and related prospectus (a "New Registration
Statement")  that complies as to form in all material  respects with  applicable
Commission rules providing for the sale by Holder of the Registrable Securities,
and agrees (subject to Section 3.2 hereof) to use its best efforts to cause such
New Registration Statement to be declared effective by the Commission as soon as
practicable. (As used herein, "Registration Statement" and "Prospectus" refer to
the  Shelf  Registration   Statement  and  related  prospectus   (including  any
preliminary prospectus) or the New Registration Statement and related prospectus
(including any preliminary prospectus),  whichever is utilized by the Company to
satisfy  Holder's  Registration  Rights pursuant to this Section 3, including in
each case any documents  incorporated  therein by  reference.)  Holder agrees to
provide in a timely manner  information  regarding the proposed  distribution by
Holder of the  Registrable  Securities  and such  other  information  reasonably
requested by the Company in connection with the preparation of and for inclusion
in the  Registration  Statement.  The  Company  agrees  (subject  to Section 3.2
hereof) to use its best  efforts to keep the  Registration  Statement  effective
(including  the  preparation  and  filing  of  any  amendments  and  supplements
necessary  for that  purpose)  until the earlier of (i) the date on which Holder
consummates the sale of all of the Registrable  Securities  registered under the
Registration  Statement,  or (ii)  the  date  on  which  all of the  Registrable
Securities  are  eligible  for sale  pursuant to Rule  144(k) (or any  successor
provision) or in a single transaction  pursuant to Rule 144(e) (or any successor
provision)  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"),  provided,
that except with respect to any Shelf  Registration,  such period need to extend
beyond nine months after the effective date of the Registration  Statement;  and
provided further, that with respect to any Shelf Registration,  such period need
not extend  beyond the time period  provided in this Section  3.1(a),  and which
periods,  in any event,  shall terminate when all the Exchange Shares covered by
such Registration Statement have been sold (but not before the expiration of the
time period  provided  in Section  4(3) of the Act and Rule 174  thereunder,  if
applicable).  The  Company  agrees to provide to Holder a  reasonable  number of
copies  of the final  Prospectus  and any  amendments  or  supplements  thereto.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the  Company  may at  any  time,  in its  sole
discretion and prior to receiving any Registration  Notice from Holder,  include
all of Holder's Exchange Shares or any portion thereof in any Shelf Registration
Statement. In connection with any Registration Statement utilized by the Company
to satisfy Holder  Registration Rights pursuant to this Section 3, Holder agrees
that it will respond within ten (10) Business Days to any request by the Company
to  provide  or verify  information  regarding  Holder or  Holder's  Registrable
Securities  as may be required to be  included  in such  Registration  Statement
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Commission.

                                       2
<PAGE>

         (b)  Offers  and  Sales.  All  offers  and  sales by  Holder  under the
Registration  Statement  referred to in this Section 3 shall be completed within
the  period  during  which the  Registration  Statement  is  required  to remain
effective  pursuant to Section 3.1(a) of this Section 3, and upon  expiration of
such period Holder will not offer or sell any Registrable  Securities  under the
Registration  Statement.  If  directed  by the  Company,  Holder will return all
undistributed  copies of the Prospectus in its possession upon the expiration of
such period.

         (c) Limitations on Registration Rights. Each exercise of a Registration
Right shall be with respect to a minimum of the lesser of (i) one hundred twenty
five thousand  (125,000)  shares of Preferred  Stock or (ii) the total number of
Exchange  Shares held by Holder at such time plus the number of Exchange  Shares
that may be issued upon exchange of the Equity by Holder. The right of Holder to
deliver a Registration  Notice commences upon the first date Holder is permitted
to  exchange  the Equity  pursuant to the  Partnership  Agreement  and  Holder's
acceptance of Partnership  Agreement  pursuant to that certain Private Placement
Purchase Agreement of even date herewith between Holder and the Partnership. The
right of Holder to deliver a  Registration  Notice  shall  expire on the date on
which all of the Exchange Shares held by Holder or issuable upon exchange of the
Equity  held by Holder are  eligible  for sale  pursuant  to Rule 144(k) (or any
successor  provision) under the Act. The Registration Rights granted pursuant to
this Section 3.1 may be  exercised in  connection  with an  underwritten  public
offering  provided  that  the  Company  shall  have  the  right  to  select  the
Underwriter or Underwriters in connection with such public offering, which shall
be subject to the reasonable approval of Holder.

         3.2  Suspension  of Offering.  Upon any notice by the  Company,  either
before or after Holder has delivered a Registration  Notice,  that a negotiation
or  consummation  of a transaction by the Company or any of its  subsidiaries is
pending or an event has occurred, which negotiation, consummation or event would
require  additional  disclosure  by the Company in a  Registration  Statement of
material  information  which the  Company has a bona fide  business  purpose for
keeping  confidential  and  the  nondisclosure  of  which  in  the  Registration
Statement  might  cause  the  Registration  Statement  to  fail to  comply  with
applicable disclosure requirements (a "Materiality Notice"),  Holder agrees that
it will immediately  discontinue offers and sales of the Registrable  Securities
under the Registration  Statement until Holder receives copies of a supplemental
or amended Prospectus that corrects the misstatement(s) or omission(s)  referred
to above and  receives  notice  that any  post-effective  amendment  has  become
effective;  provided,  that the  Company  may  delay,  suspend or  withdraw  the
Registration  Statement  for such  reason for no more than sixty (60) days after
delivery of the  Materiality  Notice at any one time but may not do so more than
two times in any twelve month period. If so directed by the Company, Holder will
deliver to the Company all copies of the  Prospectus  covering  the  Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of any Materiality Notice.

         3.3  Qualification.  The  Company  agrees  to use its best  efforts  to
register  or  qualify  the  Registrable  Securities  by the time the  applicable
Registration  Statement  is  declared  effective  by the  Commission  under  all
applicable state  securities or "blue sky" laws of such  jurisdictions as Holder
shall  reasonably  request  in  writing,  to  keep  each  such  registration  or
qualification  effective  during  the  period  such  Registration  Statement  is
required  to be kept  effective  or during the period  offers or sales are being
made by Holder after delivery of a Registration Notice to the Company, whichever
is shorter,  and to do any

                                       3
<PAGE>

and all other acts and things which may be reasonably  necessary or advisable to
enable Holder to consummate  the  disposition in each such  jurisdiction  of the
Registrable  Securities  owned by Holder;  provided,  however,  that the Company
shall  not  be  required  to  (x)  qualify  generally  to  do  business  in  any
jurisdiction or to register as a broker or dealer in such jurisdiction  where it
would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section 3.3, (y) subject
itself to  taxation  in any such  jurisdiction,  or (z)  submit  to the  general
service of process in any such jurisdiction.

         3. 4 Whenever  the Company is required  to effect the  registration  of
Exchange  Shares  under the  Securities  Act  pursuant  to  Section  3.1 of this
Agreement, subject to Section 3.2 hereof, the Company shall:

         (a)  prepare  and file  with  the  Commission  (as  soon as  reasonably
practical after receiving the  Registration  Notice,  and in any event within 60
days after  receipt of such  Registration  Notice)  the  requisite  Registration
Statement to effect such registration, which Registration Statement shall comply
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the applicable form
and include all  financial  statements  required by the  Commission  to be filed
therewith,  and the Company shall use its reasonable  best efforts to cause such
Registration  Statement  to become  effective;  provided,  however,  that before
filing a  Registration  Statement or Prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto,  or  comparable  statements  under  securities  or blue sky laws of any
jurisdiction,  the  Company  shall  (i)  provide  Holder  with an  adequate  and
appropriate  opportunity to participate in the preparation of such  Registration
Statement and each Prospectus included therein (and each amendment or supplement
thereto or comparable  statement) to be filed with the  Commission  and (ii) not
file any such  Registration  Statement or Prospectus (or amendment or supplement
thereto or comparable  statement) with the Commission to which Holder's  counsel
or any underwriter  designated by the Holder and approved by the Company,  which
approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld (the  "Underwriter"),  shall have
reasonably  objected  on the  grounds  that such  filing  does not comply in all
material  respects  with  the  requirements  of  the  Act  or of  the  rules  or
regulations thereunder;

         (b)  prepare  and  file  with  the  Commission   such   amendments  and
supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary (i) to keep such Registration  Statement effective
and  (ii)  to  comply  with  the  provisions  of the  Act  with  respect  to the
disposition of the Redemption Shares covered by such Registration  Statement, in
each case until such time as all of such Redemption Shares have been disposed of
in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller(s)  thereof
set forth in such Registration Statement;  provided, that except with respect to
any Shelf Registration, such period need not extend beyond nine months after the
effective date of the Registration  Statement;  and provided further,  that with
respect to any Shelf  Registration,  such period need not extend beyond the time
period  provided  in Section  3.1(a),  and which  periods,  in any event,  shall
terminate when all the Redemption Shares covered by such Registration  Statement
have been sold (but not before the expiration of the time period  referred to in
Section 4(3) of the Act and Rule 174 thereunder, if applicable);

         (c) furnish,  without charge,  to the Holder and each  Underwriter,  if
any, of the securities  covered by such Registration  Statement,  such number of
copies of such Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in
each  case  including

                                       4
<PAGE>

all  exhibits),  and the  Prospectus  included  in such  Registration  Statement
(including each  preliminary  Prospectus) in conformity with the requirements of
the Act, and other documents,  as the Holder and such Underwriter may reasonably
request in order to  facilitate  the  public  sale or other  disposition  of the
Redemption Shares owned by the Holder;

         (d)  prior  to any  public  offering  of  Redemption  Shares,  use  its
reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the Redemption  Shares covered by
such Registration Statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions  as the Holder or the sole or lead managing  Underwriter,  if any,
may  reasonably  request to enable the Holder to consummate  the  disposition in
such  jurisdictions of the Redemption Shares owned by the Holder and to continue
such  registration or qualification  in effect in each such  jurisdiction for as
long as such Registration  Statement  remains in effect  (including  through new
filings or  amendments  or  renewals),  and do any and all other acts and things
which may be  necessary  or  advisable  to enable the Holder to  consummate  the
disposition  in  such  jurisdictions  of  the  Redemption  Shares  owned  by it,
provided,  however,  that the  Company  shall  not be  required  to (i)  qualify
generally  to do business in any  jurisdiction  where it would not  otherwise be
required to qualify but for this Section, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any
such  jurisdiction  or (iii)  consent to general  service of process in any such
jurisdiction;

         (e) promptly  notify Holder and the sole or lead managing  Underwriter,
if any: (i) when the Registration Statement,  any pre-effective  amendment,  the
Prospectus  or any  prospectus  supplement  related  thereto  or  post-effective
amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed, and, with respect to the
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective, (ii) of any request by the Commission or any state securities or blue
sky authority for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus related thereto or for additional information,  (iii) of the issuance
by  the  Commission  of any  stop  order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of the
Registration  or the initiation or threat of any  proceedings  for that purpose,
(iv) of the  receipt by the  Company  of any  notification  with  respect to the
suspension of qualification of any Exchange Shares for sale under the securities
or blue sky laws of any  jurisdiction  or the  initiation of any  proceeding for
such  purpose,  (v) of the  existence  of any fact of which the Company  becomes
aware or the  happening  of any  event  which  results  in (A) the  Registration
Statement containing an untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state
a  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or  necessary  to make  any
statements  therein  not  misleading,  or (B) the  Prospectus  included  in such
Registration  Statement  containing  an untrue  statement of a material  fact or
omitting to state a material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to
make any statements  therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading,  and (vi) of the Company's  reasonable  determination
that a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate
or that there exists  circumstances  not yet  disclosed to the public which make
further  sales  under  such  Registration  Statement  inadvisable  pending  such
disclosure and post-effective  amendment; and, if the notification relates to an
event  described in any of the clauses (v) or (vi) of this  Section,  subject to
Section 3.2, the Company shall promptly  prepare a supplement or  post-effective
amendment to such Registration  Statement or related  Prospectus or any document
incorporated  therein by reference or file any other required document,  so that
(1) such  Registration  Statement  shall not contain any untrue  statement  of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required

                                       5
<PAGE>

to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
and (2) as thereafter  delivered to the purchasers of the Exchange  Shares being
sold  thereunder,  such  Prospectus  shall not include an untrue  statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated  therein or
necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the circumstances under
which  they were made not  misleading  (and  shall  furnish  to Holder  and each
Underwriter,  if any,  a  reasonable  number  of copies  of such  Prospectus  so
supplemented or amended);  and if the notification relates to an event described
in  clauses  (ii)  through  (iv) of this  Section,  the  Company  shall  use its
reasonable best efforts to remedy such matters;

         (f) make  reasonably  available for  inspection by Holder,  any sole or
lead managing  Underwriter  participating  in any  disposition  pursuant to such
Registration Statement,  Holder's counsel and any attorney,  accountant or other
agent  retained by any such seller or any  Underwriter  material  financial  and
other relevant information concerning the business and operations of the Company
and the  properties  of the  Company and any  subsidiaries  thereof as may be in
existence at such time as shall be necessary,  in the reasonable opinion of such
Holder's and such Underwriters'  respective counsel, to enable them to conduct a
reasonable investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act, and cause the
Company's  and any  subsidiaries'  officers,  directors and  employees,  and the
independent public accountants of the Company, to supply such information as may
be reasonably requested by any such parties in connection with such Registration
Statement;

         (g) obtain an opinion from the Company's  counsel and a "cold  comfort"
letter from the Company's  independent public accountants who have certified the
Company's  financial  statements  included or  incorporated by reference in such
Registration  Statement  in  customary  form and  covering  such  matters as are
customarily  covered by such opinions and "cold  comfort"  letters  delivered to
Underwriters in underwritten public offerings, which opinion and letter shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the sole or lead managing Underwriter, if any, and to
Holder,  and  furnish  to  Holder  participating  in the  offering  and to  each
Underwriter,  if any, a copy of such opinion and letter  addressed to Holder (in
the case of the  opinion)  and  Underwriter  (in the case of the opinion and the
"cold comfort" letter);

         (h) in the case of an underwritten  offering,  make generally available
to its security-holders as soon as practicable,  but in any event not later than
eighteen  months after the  effective  date of the  Registration  Statement  (as
defined  in  Rule  158(c)),  an  earnings  statement  of  the  Company  and  its
subsidiaries (which need not be audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act
and the rules and regulations of the Commission  thereunder  (including,  at the
option of the Company, Rule 158);

         (i) use its reasonable  best efforts to cause all such Exchange  Shares
to be listed (i) on the  national  securities  exchange  on which the  Company's
common shares are then listed or (ii) if common shares of the Company are not at
the time  listed on any  national  securities  exchange  (or if the  listing  of
Exchange  Shares is not permitted  under the rules of such  national  securities
exchange  on which the  Company's  common  shares are then  listed),  on another
national securities exchange;

         (j)  furnish to Holder and the sole or lead  managing  Underwriter,  if
any,  without  charge,  at least one  manually  signed copy of the  Registration
Statement  and  any  post-effective  amendments  thereto,   including  financial
statements and schedules,  all documents

                                       6
<PAGE>

incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits (including those deemed to be
incorporated by reference);

         (k) if requested by the sole or lead managing  Underwriter or Holder of
Exchange  Shares,  incorporate  in a  prospectus  supplement  or  post-effective
amendment such information  concerning  Holder, the Underwriters or the intended
method  of  distribution  as the sole or lead  managing  Underwriter  or  Holder
reasonably  requests  to be  included  therein  and  as is  appropriate  in  the
reasonable judgment of the Company, including,  without limitation,  information
with respect to the number of Exchange  Shares  being sold to the  Underwriters,
the purchase price being paid therefor by such  Underwriters and with respect to
any other terms of the  underwritten  offering of the Exchange Shares to be sold
in such offering; and

         (l) use its reasonable  best efforts to take all other steps  necessary
to expedite or  facilitate  the  registration  and  disposition  of the Exchange
Shares contemplated hereby, including obtaining necessary governmental approvals
and effecting required filings;  entering into customary  agreements  (including
customary  underwriting  agreements,  if the public  offering is  underwritten);
cooperating  with Holder and any  Underwriters  in  connection  with any filings
required by the NASD; providing appropriate certificates not bearing restrictive
legends  representing  the  Exchange  Shares;  and  providing a CUSIP number and
maintaining a transfer agent and registrar for the Exchange Shares.

         3.5 Indemnification by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and
hold  harmless  Holder and each person,  if any, who controls  Holder within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as follows:

                  (i) against  any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage and
         expense  whatsoever,  as  incurred,  arising  out of or based  upon any
         untrue  statement  or  alleged  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact
         contained in any  Registration  Statement  (or any  amendment  thereto)
         pursuant to which the Registrable  Securities were registered under the
         Act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference,  or the
         omission or alleged  omission  therefrom of a material fact required to
         be stated  therein or  necessary  to make the  statements  therein  not
         misleading  or arising  out of or based upon any  untrue  statement  or
         alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus
         (or any  amendment or  supplement  thereto),  including  all  documents
         incorporated therein by reference,  or the omission or alleged omission
         therefrom of a material fact  necessary in order to make the statements
         therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
         not misleading;

                  (ii) against any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage and
         expense whatsoever,  as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount
         paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by
         any  governmental  agency or body,  commenced or threatened,  or of any
         claim whatsoever  based upon any such untrue statement or omission,  or
         any such alleged untrue  statement or omission,  if such  settlement is
         effected with the written consent of the Company; and

                  (iii)  against  any and all  expense  whatsoever,  as incurred
         (including  reasonable fees and  disbursements of counsel),  reasonably
         incurred  in   investigating,

                                       7
<PAGE>

         preparing or defending  against  any litigation,  or  investigation  or
         proceeding   by  any   governmental   agency  or  body,   commenced  or
         threatened,  in  each   case  whether  or not a  party,  or  any  claim
         whatsoever  based upon any such  untrue  statement or omission,  or any
         such alleged untrue statement  or omission, to the extent that any such
         expense is not paid under  subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;

provided, however, that the indemnity provided pursuant to this Section 3.4 does
not apply with respect to any loss,  liability,  claim, damage or expense to the
extent  arising out of (A) any untrue  statement  or omission or alleged  untrue
statement  or omission  made in reliance  upon and in  conformity  with  written
information  furnished  to  the  Company  by  Holder  expressly  for  use in the
Registration  Statement (or any  amendment  thereto) or the  Prospectus  (or any
amendment or supplement thereto),  or (B) Holder's failure to deliver an amended
or supplemental  Prospectus  provided to the Holder by the Company if such loss,
liability,  claim,  damage or expense  would not have  arisen had such  delivery
occurred.

         3.6  Indemnification by Holder.  Holder (and each permitted assignee of
Holder,  on a several  basis) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
and each of its directors and officers  (including  each director and officer of
the Company who signed a Registration  Statement),  and each person, if any, who
controls  the Company  within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act, as follows:

                  (i) against  any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage and
         expense  whatsoever,  as  incurred,  arising  out of or based  upon any
         untrue  statement  or  alleged  untrue  statement  of a  material  fact
         contained in any  Registration  Statement  (or any  amendment  thereto)
         pursuant to which the Registrable  Securities were registered under the
         act, including all documents incorporated therein by reference,  or the
         omission or alleged  omission  therefrom of a material fact required to
         be stated  therein or  necessary  to make the  statements  therein  not
         misleading  or arising  out of or based upon any  untrue  statement  or
         alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Prospectus
         (or any  amendment or  supplement  thereto),  including  all  documents
         incorporated therein by reference,  or the omission or alleged omission
         therefrom of a material fact  necessary in order to make the statements
         therein,  in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
         not misleading;

                  (ii) against any and all loss,  liability,  claim,  damage and
         expense whatsoever,  as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount
         paid in settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by
         any  governmental  agency or body,  commenced or threatened,  or of any
         claim whatsoever  based upon any such untrue statement or omission,  or
         any such alleged untrue  statement or omission,  if such  settlement is
         effected with the written consent of Holder; and

                  (iii)  against  any and all  expense  whatsoever,  as incurred
         (including  reasonable fees and  disbursements of counsel),  reasonably
         incurred  in   investigating,   preparing  or  defending   against  any
         litigation,  or investigation or proceeding by any governmental  agency
         or body, commenced or threatened,  in each case whether or not a party,
         or any  claim  whatsoever  based  upon any  such  untrue  statement  or
         omission,  or any such alleged  untrue  statement  or omission,  to the
         extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii)
         above;

                                       8
<PAGE>

  provided,  however,  that the indemnity  provided pursuant to this Section 3.5
  shall only apply with respect to any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense
  to the extent  arising out of (A) any untrue  statement or omission or alleged
  untrue  statement or omission  made in reliance  upon and in  conformity  with
  written  information  furnished to the Company by Holder  expressly for use in
  the  Registration  Statement (or any amendment  thereto) or the Prospectus (or
  any amendment or supplement  thereto),  or (B) Holder's  failure to deliver an
  amended or supplemental  Prospectus  provided to Holder by the Company if such
  loss,  liability,  claim,  damage or  expense  would not have  arisen had such
  delivery occurred.  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.6, Holder
  and any permitted assignee shall not be required to indemnify the Company, its
  officers, directors or control persons with respect to any amount in excess of
  the amount of the total proceeds to Holder or such permitted assignee,  as the
  case may be,  from sales of the  Registrable  Securities  of Holder  under the
  Registration Statement.

         3.7  Conduct  of  Indemnification  Proceedings.  An  indemnified  party
hereunder shall give reasonably  prompt notice to the indemnifying  party of any
action or proceeding  commenced  against it in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder,  but failure to so notify the indemnifying party (i) shall not
relieve it from any liability  which it may have under the  indemnity  agreement
provided  in  Section  3.5 or 3.6  above,  unless  and to the  extent it did not
otherwise learn of such action and the lack of notice by the  indemnified  party
results in the forfeiture by the  indemnifying  party of substantial  rights and
defenses,  and (ii) shall not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from
any  obligations  to  the  indemnified  party  other  than  the  indemnification
obligation provided under Section 3.5 or 3.6 above. If the indemnifying party so
elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice,  the  indemnifying
party may assume the defense of such action or proceeding  at such  indemnifying
party's own expense with counsel chosen by the  indemnifying  party and approved
by the indemnified  party,  which approval shall not be  unreasonably  withheld;
provided,  however,  that the indemnifying party will not settle any such action
or proceeding  without the written consent of the indemnified party unless, as a
condition to such settlement,  the indemnifying  party secures the unconditional
release of the indemnified party; and provided further,  that if the indemnified
party  reasonably  determines  that a conflict  of interest  exists  where it is
advisable for the  indemnified  party to be represented  by separate  counsel or
that, upon advice of counsel,  there may be legal defenses available to it which
are different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying  party,
then the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume such defense and the
indemnified  party shall be entitled  to  separate  counsel at the  indemnifying
party's expense. If the indemnifying party is not entitled to assume the defense
of such action or proceeding as a result of the second  proviso to the preceding
sentence,  the  indemnifying  party's  counsel  shall be entitled to conduct the
indemnifying  party's  defense and counsel  for the  indemnified  party shall be
entitled to conduct the defense of the indemnified  party,  it being  understood
that both such counsel will  cooperate with each other to conduct the defense of
such action or proceeding as efficiently as possible.  If the indemnifying party
is not so  entitled to assume the defense of such action or does not assume such
defense,  after having  received the notice referred to in the first sentence of
this paragraph, the indemnifying party will pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel for the indemnified party. In such event,  however,  the indemnifying
party will not be liable for any settlement effected without the written consent
of the indemnifying  party. If an indemnifying  party is entitled to assume, and
assumes,  the  defense of such  action or  proceeding  in  accordance  with this
paragraph,  the indemnifying party shall not be liable for

                                       9
<PAGE>

any fees and expenses of counsel for the indemnified  party incurred  thereafter
in connection with such action or proceeding.

         3.8   Contribution.   In  order  to  provide  for  just  and  equitable
contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity  agreement  provided for in
Sections  3.5 and 3.6 above is for any reason  held to be  unenforceable  by the
indemnified party although  applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company
and Holder  shall  contribute  to the  aggregate  losses,  liabilities,  claims,
damages and  expenses of the nature  contemplated  by such  indemnity  agreement
incurred by the Company and Holder,  (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect  the  relative  fault of the  Company  on the one hand and Holder on the
other,  in connection  with the  statements or omissions  which resulted in such
losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities  or expenses,  or (ii) if the allocation
provided  by clause  (i)  above is not  permitted  by  applicable  law,  in such
proportion as is  appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault of but also
the relative benefits to the Company on the one hand and Holder on the other, in
connection  with the  statements  or  omissions  which  resulted in such losses,
claims,  damages,  liabilities  or  expenses,  as  well  as any  other  relevant
equitable  considerations.  The relative benefits to the indemnifying  party and
indemnified  party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,  the
total  proceeds  received by the  indemnifying  party and  indemnified  party in
connection with the offering to which such losses, claims, damages,  liabilities
or expenses relate. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified
party shall be  determined  by  reference  to, among other  things,  whether the
action in  question,  including  any untrue or  alleged  untrue  statement  of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been
made by, or relates to information  supplied by, the  indemnifying  party or the
indemnified  party,  and the  parties'  relative  intent,  knowledge,  access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action.

         The  parties  hereto  agree that it would not be just or  equitable  if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.8 were determined by pro rata allocation
or by any  other  method  of  allocation  which  does  not take  account  of the
equitable  considerations  referred to in the immediately  preceding  paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 3.8, Holder shall not be required
to contribute any amount in excess of the amount of the total proceeds to Holder
from  sales of the  Registrable  Securities  of Holder  under  the  Registration
Statement.

         Notwithstanding   the   foregoing,   no  person  guilty  of  fraudulent
misrepresentation  (within  the  meaning of  Section  11(f) of the Act) shall be
entitled to  contribution  from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.  For purposes of this Section 3.8,  each person,  if any, who
controls  Holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act shall have the same
rights to contribution as Holder, and each director of the Company, each officer
of the Company who signed a Registration  Statement and each person, if any, who
controls the Company  within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act shall have the
same rights to contribution as the Company.



SECTION 4.  EXPENSES

         The Company shall pay all expenses  incident to the  performance by the
Company  of

                                       10
<PAGE>

the Company's registration obligations under Sections 2 and 3, including (i) all
stock exchange, Commission and state securities registration, listing and filing
fees, (ii) all expenses  incurred in connection with the  preparation,  printing
and distributing of any Issuer Registration  Statement or Registration Statement
and Prospectus,  and (iii) fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company and
of  the  independent  public  accountants  of  the  Company.   Holder  shall  be
responsible  for the payment of any  brokerage and sales  commissions,  fees and
disbursements  of Holder's  counsel,  accountants  and other  advisors,  and any
transfer taxes relating to the sale or disposition of the Registrable Securities
by Holder pursuant to Section 3 or otherwise.

SECTION 5.        RULE 144 COMPLIANCE

         The Company  covenants that it will use its best efforts to timely file
the reports  required to be filed by the Company  under the Act and the Exchange
Act so as to enable Holder to sell Registrable  Securities  pursuant to Rule 144
under the Act. In connection  with any sale,  transfer or other  disposition  by
Holder of any  Registrable  Securities  pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act,  the
Company shall  cooperate  with Holder to facilitate the timely  preparation  and
delivery of certificates  representing Registrable Securities to be sold and not
bearing any Act legend, and enable certificates for such Registrable  Securities
to be for such  number of shares  and  registered  in such  names as Holder  may
reasonably  request  at  least  ten  (10)  Business  Days  prior  to any sale of
Registrable Securities hereunder.

SECTION 6.        MISCELLANEOUS

         6.1  Integration;  Amendment.  This  Agreement  constitutes  the entire
agreement  between  the  parties  hereto  with  respect to the matters set forth
herein  and  supersedes  and  renders  of no force and  effect all prior oral or
written  agreements,  commitments  and  understandings  among the  parties  with
respect to the matters set forth herein.  Except as otherwise expressly provided
in this  Agreement,  no amendment,  modification  or discharge of this Agreement
shall be valid or binding  unless set forth in writing and duly  executed by the
Company and Holder.

         6.2 Waivers. No waiver by a party hereto shall be effective unless made
in a written  instrument  duly executed by the party against whom such waiver is
sought to be  enforced,  and only to the  extent  set forth in such  instrument.
Neither the waiver by any of the parties  hereto of a breach or a default  under
any of the provisions of this Agreement,  nor the failure of any of the parties,
on one or more occasions,  to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or
to exercise any right or privilege  hereunder shall thereafter be construed as a
waiver of any subsequent  breach or default of a similar nature,  or as a waiver
of any such provisions, rights or privileges hereunder.

         6.3 Assignment;  Successors and Assigns.  This Agreement and the rights
granted  hereunder may not be assigned by Holder without the written  consent of
the  Company,  provided,   however,  that  Holder  may  assign  its  rights  and
obligations hereunder, following at least ten (10) days' prior written notice to
the  Company,  to the direct  equity  owners  (e.g.,  partners  or  members)  or
beneficiaries,  if,  such  persons  agree in  writing  to be bound by all of the
provisions  hereof.  This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the successors and permitted assigns of all of the parties hereto.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT


         THIS EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT (the  "Agreement") is made as of November 4,
1999 by and between The Taubman Company Limited Partnership,  a Delaware limited
partnership (the "Company"), and Courtney Lord ("Lord").

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS,  the Company  wishes to employ Lord as Senior Vice  President,
and Lord  desires to work for the  Company in such  capacity  upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements
set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:

         1.       Employment.

                  The Company shall employ Lord on a full-time basis as a Senior
Vice President.  Effective January 1, 2000, Lord's employment title shall change
to Senior Vice  President-Managing  Director of Leasing. Lord shall also perform
such other leasing management and/or  administrative  duties consistent with the
office of Senior Vice  President  as from time to time may be assigned to him by
the President of the Company.  Lord shall devote his full time and attention to,
and exert his best efforts in, the performance of his duties hereunder, so as to
promote the business of the Company.

         2.       Term of Employment.

                  Lord's term of employment shall commence as of a date mutually
acceptable  to the Company and Lord,  which shall not be later than  November 5,
1999, and continue through January 1, 2005, unless  terminated  earlier pursuant
to paragraph 5 below (the "Term of Employment").

         3.       Compensation.

                  (a) Base Salary.  The Company shall pay or cause to be paid to
Lord during the Term of  Employment a base salary of not less than  $270,000 per
annum,  payable in accordance  with the Company's  payroll  practices.  The base
salary  shall be reviewed  each year and subject to normal  increases  (2% - 3%)
commencing with the March 2001 salary review.

                  (b) SSTI Bonus. Lord shall participate in the Company's Senior
Short-Term  Incentive  Plan ("SSTI") and shall have a guaranteed  bonus equal to
$195,000 for the years beginning January 1, 2000 and January 1, 2001. Other than
the bonus amount specified in the preceding statement, the SSTI payment shall be
determined in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SSTI.

                  (c) Long-Term  Incentive  Compensation.  Effective  January 1,
2000, Lord shall receive a  Participation  Grant equal to 10,000 Notional Shares
under The Taubman
<PAGE>

Company Long-Term  Performance  Compensation Plan (the "LTPC") and a Performance
Grant under the LTPC in an amount,  which amount may be zero,  determined by the
Company in its discretion. Grants are subject to all of the terms and conditions
(including the vesting schedule) of the LTPC.

                  (d) Other Benefits. During the Term of Employment,  Lord shall
be entitled to participate in any  retirement  plan or other benefit  program of
the Company now existing or established  hereafter by the Company, to the extent
that he is eligible  under the general  provisions  thereof.  Lord shall also be
entitled to participate in any group insurance, hospitalization, medical, health
and accident, disability, or similar plan or program of the Company now existing
or  established  hereafter  to the extent that he is eligible  under the general
provisions thereof.

         4.       Relocation Expenses.

                  Lord and the  Company  agree  that  Lord  shall  relocate  his
primary  family  residence  to the  Detroit  metropolitan  area  no  later  than
September 1, 2000.  The Company shall pay the  following  expenses in connection
with Lord's relocation:

                  (a)  $50,000   lump   sum  payment  within  30 days of  Lord's
employment commencement date.

                  (b)  Monthly  rental of  $2,550 for  Lord's  rental  apartment
from November 1, 1999 through March 31, 2000.

                  (c) Roundtrip  airfare  between Detroit and Aspen for Lord for
three weekends per month from November 1, 1999, until Lord's family relocates to
Detroit, but no later than July 1, 2000.

                  (d)  Roundtrip  airfare  between  Detroit and Aspen for Lord's
family for four separate visits between Lord's employment  commencement date and
July 1, 2000.

                  (e) Cost of  moving van  to move Lord's  household  goods from
Aspen to Detroit.

         All eligible  relocation  expenses shall either be paid directly by the
Company,  or the Company shall reimburse Lord upon Lord's furnishing the Company
with receipts or such other documentation as the Company requests.

         5.       Termination of Employment.

                  (a) Voluntary  Termination of Employment by Lord. In the event
Lord  terminates  his  employment  with the Company  for reasons  other than his
death,  Disability or a Termination  with Good Reason (as such terms are defined
below), such termination shall be deemed a Voluntary  Termination.  In the event
of a Voluntary  Termination  by Lord prior to January 1, 2005, the Company shall
have no further  obligation to Lord other than the  Company's  obligation to pay
any amounts that have accrued  through the employment  termination  date. Upon a
Voluntary  Termination,  the  Company  shall  have  the  right to

                                       2
<PAGE>

purchase any Additional Units (as defined below) and an equal number of Series B
Preferred  Stock  (as  defined  below)  issued to Lord and the  capital  account
allocated to the  Additional  Units for a cash lump sum payment of $50,000.  The
Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership  ("TRG")  acknowledges that the Company
has the right to purchase the Additional Units and the capital account allocated
to the Additional Units. Additional Units means Units of Partnership Interest in
TRG which have no right to receive  distributions  (except upon  liquidation  of
TRG) or allocation of partnership income or loss (or items thereto).  The number
of  Additional  Units which the  Company  has the right to purchase  pursuant to
paragraph  5(a),  (c), or (e)  corresponds to the number of Additional  Units on
Lord's employment  termination date as listed on the schedule attached hereto as
Exhibit  A.  Series B  Preferred  Stock  means  the  Series B  Non-Participating
Convertible Preferred Stock of Taubman Centers, Inc.

                  For purposes of this Agreement, a Termination with Good Reason
shall mean a termination of employment by Lord because of any of the following:

                       (i)    a material reduction in base salary and SSTI bonus
                              (other than for Cause), or

                       (ii)   a    substantial    diminution    of   duties   or
                              responsibilities.

                  (b)  Death  or   Disability  of  Lord.  In  the  event  Lord's
employment is  terminated by reason of his death or disability  (as that term is
defined in the LTPC),  he shall receive  accrued but unpaid base salary  through
the employment  termination date. Lord shall also receive any benefits otherwise
provided under the Company's  plans or programs in accordance  with the terms of
such plans or such programs.

                  (c)  Termination  by the Company  Without Cause on or Prior to
January 31, 2001. If Lord's  employment  is  terminated  by the Company  without
Cause (as defined below) on or prior to January 31, 2001, Lord shall be entitled
to receive,  and the Company  shall be  obligated to pay 50% of the amounts that
would have been payable to Lord as Base Salary and SSTI Bonus had Lord  remained
employed for the duration of the Term of Employment. The Company also shall have
the right to purchase 50% of Lord's  Additional Units, an equal number of Series
B Preferred Stock and the capital account  allocated to the Additional Units for
a cash lump sum payment of $50,000.  TRG  acknowledges  that the Company has the
right to purchase the Additional Units and the capital account  allocated to the
Additional  Units.  The Base Salary and SSTI Bonus  amounts  shall be payable as
follows:  The  Company  shall pay Lord 100% of his Base Salary and SSTI Bonus in
accordance  with the Company's  normal payroll  practice during the first twelve
months after Lord's  employment  termination date.  Thereafter,  the balance due
(i.e. 50% of Base Salary and SSTI Bonus from employment termination date through
January 1, 2005 minus Base Salary and SSTI  already  paid  pursuant to preceding
sentence)  will be payable in a lump sum payment  within 30 days after the first
anniversary of Lord's employment termination date.

                  (d) Termination by the Company Without Cause After January 31,
2001.  If Lord's  employment  is  terminated by the Company for any reason other
than cause after  January  31, 2001 but prior to January 1, 2005,  Lord shall be
entitled to receive and the

                                       3
<PAGE>

Company  shall be  obligated  to pay the balance of the amounts  that would have
been  payable to Lord as Base Salary and SSTI Bonus had Lord  remained  employed
for the duration of the Term of Employment.

                  (e)  Termination  by the  Company  for Cause.  The Company may
terminate Lord's employment and this Agreement  effective  immediately for Cause
(as defined below). If the Company  terminates Lord's employment for Cause prior
to January 1, 2005,  the Company shall have no further  obligation to Lord other
than its obligation to pay any amounts that have accrued  through the employment
termination  date. In the event Lord's  employment is terminated for Cause,  the
Company  shall have the right to  purchase  Lord's  Additional  Units,  an equal
number of Series B Preferred  Stock and the  capital  account  allocated  to the
Additional Units for a cash lump sum payment of $50,000.  TRG acknowledges  that
the  Company  has the right to  purchase  the  Additional  Units and the capital
account allocated to the Additional Units.

                  (f) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means
the willful and continual  failure to perform Lord's duties with the Company and
to perform  such duties on a  full-time  basis or Lord's  engagement  in conduct
(including  but not  limited  to fraud or theft)  which has a  material  adverse
effect  on  the  business  affairs  of the  Company,  monetarily  or  otherwise;
provided,  that cause shall have occurred only if it shall have been preceded by
a notice specifying the facts and  circumstances  claimed to provide a basis for
Cause and Lord  shall  have been  given 30 days from the date of such  notice to
cure.  For purposes of this  Agreement,  no act or failure to act on Lord's part
shall be considered "willful" unless done, or omitted to be done, by Lord not in
good faith and without  reasonable belief that his action or omission was in the
best interests of the Company.

         6.       Covenant Not to Compete.

                  Lord agrees that during the Employment  Term he will apply all
of his skill and  experience  to the business  and affairs of the Company.  Lord
further agrees that during the  Employment  Term and for a period of (a) one (1)
year after his  employment  termination  date if he is terminated by the Company
without  Cause on or prior to  January  31,  2001;  (b) two (2) years  after his
employment termination date if he is terminated for any reason after January 31,
2001,  but  prior to  January  1, 2005  (provided,  however,  if the  employment
termination  date is after January 1, 2004, but before  January 1, 2005,  Lord's
agreement not to compete will expire on January 31, 2005);  and (c) one (1) year
after his  employment  termination  date if his employment is terminated for any
reason on or after  January 1, 2005,  he shall not,  without  the prior  written
approval of the  Company,  directly or  indirectly  hold or acquire an ownership
interest  in, or perform  any  services  as a  shareholder,  director,  partner,
member,  employee,  agent,  adviser or consultant or otherwise for any person or
entity,  or any  affiliate or  subsidiary  thereof,  wherever  located,  that is
engaged in the business of  consulting,  brokering  or in any manner  leasing or
negotiating occupancy,  whether by sale, lease or otherwise,  in connection with
any traditional regional mall or value regional mall. Such restriction includes,
but  is  not  limited  to,   employment  by  a  developer  and/or  owner  acting
independently.  Lord further  agrees that during the  Employment  Term and for a
period of two (2) years after the later of (a) the date his employment  with the
Company  terminates  for any  reason,  or (b) the last  date

                                       4
<PAGE>

Lord receives any payment under this Agreement,  he shall not, without the prior
written  consent  of the  Company,  directly  or  indirectly  contact or solicit
employees of the Company other than on behalf of the Company.

         7.       Confidentiality Covenant.

                  During  the Term of  Employment  and at all times  thereafter,
Lord shall keep secret and retain in strictest confidence, and shall not use for
his own benefit or the benefit of others except in connection  with the business
and  affairs  of  the  Company,  all  Confidential  Information  and  all  other
confidential  matter relating to the business of the Company learned by him, and
shall not disclose such Confidential  Information and other confidential  matter
to anyone  outside of the Company,  either during or after  employment,  nor may
Lord  exploit  for his  own  benefit  or the  benefit  of  others  any  personal
relationships  with  tenants,  employees  or  contacts  of  the  Company  formed
heretofore or hereafter.

                  For  purposes  of this  Agreement  "Confidential  Information"
shall mean all  information  that  would  normally  be deemed to be  proprietary
including  trade secrets and all  information  relating to the Company's (or its
affiliate's)  research,  development,  accounting,  tenants  and  tenant  lists,
business  connections,  consultants,  advisors and  employees,  programming  and
formatting  information,  operational  methods,  marketing  plans or strategies,
business acquisition plans, new personnel  acquisition plans, designs and design
projects, and all other information of any kind or nature whatsoever,  which may
pertain  to or be  derived  from the  business  operations  and  affairs  of the
Company,  now or  hereafter  existing.  Notwithstanding  anything  herein to the
contrary,  the  obligations  under this paragraph do not apply to any portion of
the Confidential Information which (1) is or becomes public knowledge through no
fault of Lord,  (2) is in  lawful  possession  of Lord  prior to  engagement  by
Company,  or (3) is  disclosed  pursuant  to the  lawful  requirement  or formal
request of a government agency.

         8.       Company's Remedies Upon Breach.

                  In the event Lord breaches the non-compete or  confidentiality
covenants,  Lord  acknowledges  that he shall  forfeit all rights to any amounts
payable  under  this  Agreement,  and that the  Company  shall have the right to
purchase his Additional  Units and capital  account  allocated to the Additional
Units for $50,000.  Lord further acknowledges that the Company shall be entitled
to injunctive  relief in addition to any other remedy it may have.  Lord further
acknowledges that the Company's remedies upon breach by him of the provisions of
paragraph 6 and 7 hereof will be  inadequate.  Accordingly,  in the event of the
breach or  threatened  breach by Lord of  paragraphs 6 or 7 hereof,  the Company
shall be entitled to  injunctive  relief in addition to any other  remedy it may
have.

         12.      Assigns and Successors.

                  The rights and obligations of the Company under this Agreement

                   AMENDMENT AND RESTATEMENT OF AGREEMENT OF
                       LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF THE TAUBMAN
                        REALTY GROUP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

     Designation, Distribution, Redemption, Exchange, and Consent Provisions
     with Respect to the 9% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Equity

     THIS  ANNEX II (this  "Annex  II") TO THE  SECOND  AMENDMENT  (the  "Second
Amendment")  TO THE SECOND  AMENDMENT  AND  RESTATEMENT  OF AGREEMENT OF LIMITED
PARTNERSHIP OF THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP LIMITED  PARTNERSHIP (as amended through
the date hereof, the "Partnership  Agreement"),  entered into effective November
24, 1999,  serves as a further  amendment to the Partnership  Agreement  entered
into pursuant to Section 4.1(c) of the  Partnership  Agreement,  and is made by,
between,  and among TAUBMAN CENTERS,  INC., a Michigan  corporation  ("TCO"), TG
PARTNERS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, a Delaware limited partnership ("TG"), and TAUB-CO
MANAGEMENT,  INC., a Michigan  corporation  ("Taub-Co"),  who, as the Appointing
Persons,  pursuant to Section 13.11 of the Partnership Agreement,  have the full
power and authority to amend the  Partnership  Agreement on behalf of all of the
Partners of The Taubman  Realty Group Limited  Partnership,  a Delaware  limited
partnership  (the  "Partnership"),  with respect to the matters herein provided.
(Capitalized  terms  used  herein  that are not herein  defined,  shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Partnership Agreement.)
<PAGE>

     A. On  September  3, 1999,  TCO,  TG, and Taub-Co  entered  into the Second
Amendment  to  provide  for  the  contribution  of  preferred   capital  to  the
Partnership in exchange for a preferred equity  interest,  and for certain other
purposes.
     B. On September  3, 1999,  TCO, TG, and Taub-Co also entered into the Annex
to the Partnership Agreement entitled  "Designation,  Distribution,  Redemption,
Exchange,  and Consent  Provisions  with  Respect to the 9% Series C  Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Equity."
     C.  Pursuant  to  Section  4.1(c)  of  the  Partnership  Agreement  and  as
authorized by Section 13.11 of the  Partnership  Agreement,  the parties  hereto
wish to enter into this Annex II to provide for the  designation,  distribution,
redemption, exchange, and consent provisions with respect to that certain series
of  Parity  Preferred  Equity  herein  designated  as "9%  Series  D  Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Equity."
     NOW,  THEREFORE,  for good and  valuable  consideration,  the  receipt  and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:  (i)  Designation:  There is  hereby  established  a series  of  Parity
Preferred Equity designated "9% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Equity"
(the "Series D Preferred Equity"). The Parity Preferred Rate with respect to the
Series D Preferred  Equity is hereby  designated as nine percent (9%) per annum.
The Parity  Preferred  Return in respect  of the  Series D  Preferred  Equity is
hereinafter  referred  to as the  "Series D Return."  The holder of the Series D
Preferred Equity is hereinafter referred to as the "Series D Preferred Partner."
The  Parity  Preferred  Equity  Balance  of the  Series D  Preferred  Partner is
hereinafter  referred to as the "Series D Preferred  Equity Balance." The Unpaid
Parity  Preferred  Return  of the  Series D  Preferred  Partner  is  hereinafter
referred to as the "Unpaid Series D Preferred Return."

                                       2
<PAGE>

(ii) Payment of Distributions/Allocations:  The Series D Preferred Partner shall
be  entitled  to receive  cumulative  cash  distributions  equal to the Series D
Preferred  Return.  Such  distributions  shall  accrue  from  the  date  of  the
contribution to the Partnership of the Series D Preferred  Equity,  and shall be
payable when, as and if determined by the Managing General Partner, on or before
the last Day of each March,  June,  September,  and December of each Partnership
Fiscal  Year (a  "Distribution  Date")  and on a priority  basis as against  all
distributions  other  than  those  required  to be made  under  the  Partnership
Agreement  and other than  distributions  required  by any  series of  Preferred
Equity  existing as of the date hereof or any other  series of Parity  Preferred
Equity. The amount of the distribution  payable for any period shall be computed
on the  basis of a 360-Day  year of  twelve  30-Day  months  and for any  period
shorter than a full quarterly period for which  distributions are computed,  the
amount of the distribution  payable shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number  of  days  elapsed  in  such  a  30-Day  month.  If  any  date  on  which
distributions  are to be made on the Series D Preferred Equity is not a Business
Day, then payment of the  distribution  to be made on such date shall be made on
the next  succeeding  Day that is a Business  Day (and  without any  interest or
other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is
in the next  succeeding  Partnership  Fiscal Year, such payment shall be made on
the  immediately  preceding  Business  Day, in each case with the same force and
effect as if made on such date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no distribution
shall be made to the Series D Preferred  Partner which would reduce its Adjusted
Capital  Account  Balance  below zero.  Distributions  on the Series D Preferred
Equity  shall  be made to the  Series  D  Preferred  Partner  of  record  on the
fifteenth (15th) Day of the calendar month in which the applicable  Distribution
Date falls or such other date established by the Managing General Partner for

                                       3
<PAGE>

determining  the  holders  of record of the Series D  Preferred  Equity for such
distribution (the "Distribution Record Date"), which date shall not be more than
thirty (30) Days nor less than ten (10) Days prior to such Distribution Date. In
the event of the issuance of Series D Preferred  Stock (as defined  below),  the
Distribution Record Date for the Series D Preferred Equity shall be the Dividend
Record Date (as defined in the  Restated  Articles of  Incorporation  of TCO, as
amended) for the Series D Preferred Stock. Unpaid Series D Preferred Return will
not compound.  The Series D Preferred Equity Balance distributed to the Series D
Preferred  Partner pursuant to Section  11.1(a)(5) of the Partnership  Agreement
shall be computed after giving effect to a "book-up" of all  Partnership  assets
to their  respective  fair market values and  allocations  under the Partnership
Agreement of Profits and Losses resulting therefrom.
     In no event shall Profits for any Partnership  Fiscal Year allocated to the
Series D Preferred Partner exceed nineteen and 95/100ths percent (19.95%) of the
Profits of the Partnership for such Partnership Fiscal Year (the "19.95% Profits
Allocation Limit"),  provided however,  that the 19.95% Profits Allocation Limit
will not apply to TCO.  Further,  in  applying  Section  704(c) of the Code with
respect to the Series D Preferred  Partner,  the Partnership  shall,  consistent
with the requirements of the applicable Regulations, utilize a reasonable method
of allocation, provided that such method shall not have the effect of allocating
to the Series D  Preferred  Partner a greater  amount of taxable  income for any
Partnership  Fiscal  Year than the amount of Profits  allocated  to the Series D
Preferred Partner for such Partnership Fiscal Year.
(iii) Optional Redemption:
     (A)  Partnership's  Redemption  Right: The Series D Preferred Equity is not
redeemable  prior to November 24,  2004.  On or after  November  24,  2004,  the
Partnership,  at its option,  upon not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty
(60) Days'

                                       4
<PAGE>

written notice,  may redeem the Series D Preferred  Equity, in whole or in part,
at any time and  from  time to time,  at a  redemption  price  (the  "Redemption
Price"),  payable in cash equal in amount to the amount of  contributed  capital
plus  Unpaid  Series D  Preferred  Return,  in each case,  with  respect to that
portion of the Series D Preferred  Equity  Balance being  redeemed.  Immediately
prior to such  redemption,  the  Capital  Accounts of the  Partnership  shall be
adjusted  to give  effect  to a  "book-up"  of all  Partnership  assets to their
respective fair market values and allocations under the Partnership Agreement of
Profits  and  Losses  resulting  therefrom.  If less  than  all of the  Series D
Preferred Equity is redeemed,  the Capital Account of the holder of the Series D
Preferred  Equity shall, as a result of the  redemption,  be reduced by only the
portion of such Capital Account attributable to the interest redeemed.
     (B) Limitations on Redemption:  Unless the accrued Series D Return has been
distributed  in full for all quarterly  distribution  periods  terminating on or
prior to the date of redemption,  the  Partnership  may not redeem less than the
entire  outstanding  amount  of the  Series D  Preferred  Equity.  Further,  the
Redemption  Price (other than the portion thereof  consisting of Unpaid Series D
Preferred  Return)  shall be payable  solely out of the sale  proceeds  of other
"partnership  interests"  of the  Partnership,  or "capital  stock" of TCO.  For
purposes  of the  preceding  sentence,  the terms  "partnership  interests"  and
"capital  stock"  mean any equity  securities  of the  Partnership  and/or  TCO,
respectively  (including  "Units of Partnership  Interests,"  "preferred  equity
interests,"   "common  stock"  and   "preferred   stock"),   shares,   interest,
participation, or other ownership interests (however designated), and any rights
(other  than  debt  securities  convertible  into  or  exchangeable  for  equity
securities) or options to purchase any of the foregoing.

                                       5
<PAGE>

     (C) Procedure for Redemption:  Notice of redemption  shall be (i) faxed and
(ii) mailed by the Partnership,  by certified mail,  postage  prepaid,  not less
than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) Days prior to the Redemption  Date (as
defined below), addressed to the Series D Preferred Partner at its address as it
appears on the  records  of the  Partnership.  In  addition  to any  information
required by law,  each such notice shall  state:  (a) the  redemption  date (the
"Redemption Date"), (b) the Redemption Price, (c) the percentage of the Series D
Preferred  Equity to be  redeemed,  and (d) the  place  where a  Certificate  of
Withdrawal  in the form of Exhibit 1 hereto,  is to be delivered in exchange for
payment of the Redemption Price.
     If the Partnership  gives a notice of redemption in respect of the Series D
Preferred  Equity or any portion  thereof  (which  notice shall be  irrevocable)
then, by 12:00 noon, New York City time, on the Redemption Date, the Partnership
shall  deposit  irrevocably  in trust for the  benefit of the Series D Preferred
Partner funds  sufficient to pay the Redemption Price and shall give irrevocable
instructions  and  authority  to pay  such  Redemption  Price  to the  Series  D
Preferred  Partner upon  delivery of a  Certificate  of  Withdrawal at the place
designated in the notice of redemption.  If any date fixed for redemption of the
Series D Preferred  Equity is not a Business Day, then payment of the Redemption
Price shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day (without any interest or
any payment in respect of any such delay) except that if such Business Day falls
in the  next  calendar  year,  such  payment  shall  be made on the  immediately
preceding  Business  Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made
on the  Redemption  Date.  If  payment  of the  Redemption  Price is  improperly
withheld or refused and not paid by the Partnership,  the Series D Return on the
portion of the Series D Preferred Equity to be redeemed shall continue to accrue
from the Redemption Date to the date of payment, in which case the

                                       6
<PAGE>

actual  payment date will be  considered  the date fixed for  redemption  in the
redemption notice for purposes of calculating the applicable Redemption Price.
(iv) Exchange Rights:
     (A)  Right to Exchange:
          (1) The Series D Preferred  Equity shall be  exchangeable in whole but
not in part unless expressly  otherwise  provided herein at any time on or after
November  24, 2009 for Series D Preferred  Stock of TCO (the "Series D Preferred
Stock") at an exchange rate (the "Exchange  Rate") of One Hundred Dollars ($100)
of Series D Preferred  Equity  Balance (as  computed  after  giving  effect to a
"book-up" of all Partnership  assets to their  respective fair market values and
allocations  under the  Partnership  Agreement  of Profits and Losses  resulting
therefrom  but in no event shall such Series D Preferred  Equity  Balance (as so
computed)  exceed an amount  equal to the capital  contribution  plus any Unpaid
Series D Preferred  Return) for one (1) share of Series D Preferred  Stock to be
delivered by TCO,  subject to adjustment as described  below. In the event of an
exchange, the Unallocated Series D Preferred Return shall be reduced to zero. At
such  time  as  TCO  receives   approval  to  amend  its  Restated  Articles  of
Incorporation,  as  amended,  to  increase  the number of  authorized  shares of
Preferred Stock (as defined therein),  and further amends such Restated Articles
of  Incorporation,  as amended,  by increasing  the number of shares of Series D
Preferred  Stock,  which  amendments TCO has undertaken to use its  commercially
reasonable  efforts  to cause to be made,  the  Exchange  Rate  will be  reduced
proportionately. The terms of the Series D Preferred Stock shall be as set forth
on  Schedule A attached  hereto.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  the Series D
Preferred Equity shall become exchangeable at any time, in whole but not in part
unless expressly  provided otherwise herein, for Series D Preferred Stock if (x)
at any time the accrued Series D

                                       7
<PAGE>

Return shall not have been distributed in full to the Series D Preferred Partner
with respect to six (6) prior  quarterly  distribution  periods,  whether or not
consecutive,  provided,  however, a distribution of the Series D Return shall be
considered  timely if made within two (2) Business  Days after the  Distribution
Date for the Series D Return if at the time of such late payment there shall not
be any prior quarterly  distribution periods in respect of which the full amount
of the accrued  Series D Return was not timely  made or (y) upon  receipt by the
Series D Preferred  Partner of (a) notice from the Managing General Partner that
the  Partnership  has taken the position  that the  Partnership  is, or upon the
consummation of an identified event in the immediate future will be taxable as a
corporation  and (b) an opinion  rendered by independent  counsel  familiar with
such matters addressed to the Series D Preferred Partner that the Partnership is
or likely is, or upon the  occurrence  of an  identified  event in the immediate
future  will be or  likely  will be,  taxable  as a  corporation.  The  Series D
Preferred  Equity  may be  exchanged,  in whole  but not in part,  for  Series D
Preferred  Stock if the Series D Preferred  Partner  concludes  at any time that
there exists in the  reasonable  judgment of the Series D Preferred  Partner (as
confirmed by its independent  accountants) an imminent and substantial risk that
the Series D Preferred Partner's interest in the Partnership  represents or will
represent  more than nineteen and 95/100ths  percent  (19.95%) of the capital or
profits of the  Partnership  determined in accordance with  Regulations  Section
1.731-2(e)(4).  In addition, if the Partnership sells in one (1) or more taxable
transactions  two  (2) or  more  of (x)  the  properties  on  Schedule  E to the
Partnership  Agreement or (y) the properties,  if any,  exchanged for any of the
properties on Schedule E in a  transaction  pursuant to Section 1031 of the Code
or pursuant to any other Code section providing for  non-recognition  treatment,
and after  giving  effect to such sales (and  related tax  distributions  by the
Partnership) it is reasonably expected that the

                                       8
<PAGE>

net income of the Partnership as computed on the basis of tax  depreciation  and
not book  depreciation  will be below Eleven  Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
Dollars  ($11,250,000)  for the taxable year of the sale or the next  succeeding
taxable  year,  then the Series D Preferred  Equity  shall be  exchangeable,  in
whole,  but not in part,  at the  exchange  rate set forth above.  Further,  the
Series D Preferred Equity shall be exchangeable, in whole but not in part at the
exchange  rate set  forth  above,  if the  Series D  Preferred  Partner,  in its
reasonable  judgment (as confirmed by its independent  accountants),  determines
that less than ninety percent (90%) of the gross income of the  Partnership  for
the taxable  year of the  exchange  will or will likely  constitute  "qualifying
income" within the meaning of Section 7704(d) of the Code.
          (2)  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary set forth in Paragraph
(iv)(A)(1) above, if an Exchange Notice (as defined below) has been delivered to
TCO, then TCO may, at its option, within thirty (30) Business Days after receipt
of the Exchange Notice,  purchase  directly or elect to cause the Partnership to
redeem,  all or a  portion  of the  outstanding  Series D  Preferred  Equity  by
redeeming or, as applicable, purchasing, the corresponding portion of the Series
D Preferred  Equity  Balance (in each case, as computed after giving effect to a
"book-up" of all Partnership  assets to their  respective fair market values and
allocations  under the  Partnership  Agreement  of Profits and Losses  resulting
therefrom) for cash in an amount equal to the Series D Preferred  Equity Balance
or portion thereof being redeemed.
          (3) In the event  an  exchange  of the Series D Preferred Equity would
violate  the  provisions  on  ownership  limitation  of TCO as set  forth in the
Restated  Articles of Incorporation  of TCO, as amended,  the Series D Preferred
Partner shall be entitled to exchange,  pursuant to the  provisions of Paragraph
(iv)(A)(1) hereof, a percentage of the

                                       9
<PAGE>

Series D Preferred  Equity  Balance  that would  comply with the  provisions  on
ownership  limitation  of TCO and any portion of the Series D  Preferred  Equity
Balance not so exchanged  (the "Excess  Preferred  Equity") shall be redeemed by
the  Partnership  for cash in an amount  equal to the Series D Preferred  Equity
Balance  allocable to the Excess  Preferred  Equity,  subject to any restriction
thereon  contained in any debt  instrument or agreement of the  Partnership  and
provided  that such  redemption  would not  adversely  impact  the rating of any
outstanding debt of the Partnership.

     (B)  Procedure for Exchange and/or Redemption of Series D Preferred Equity:

          (1) Any exchange  shall be exercised  pursuant to a notice of exchange
(the "Exchange  Notice")  delivered to TCO by the Series D Preferred  Partner by
(a) fax and (b) by certified mail, postage prepaid.  TCO may effect any exchange
of the Series D Preferred Equity or exercise its option to cause the Partnership
to redeem any  portion of the Series D  Preferred  Equity for cash  pursuant  to
Paragraph  (iv)(A)(2)  above or  redeem  Excess  Preferred  Equity  pursuant  to
Paragraph (iv)(A)(3) above by delivering to the Preferred Equity Partner, within
thirty (30)  Business  Days after  receipt of the  Exchange  Notice,  (a) if TCO
elects to acquire any of the Series D Preferred Equity then  outstanding,  (1) a
written  notice  stating (A) the date of the exchange,  which may be the date of
such  written  notice or any other  date which is not later than sixty (60) Days
after  the  receipt  of the  Exchange  Notice,  and  (B)  the  place  where  the
Certificate of Withdrawal is to be delivered and (2)  certificates  representing
the Series D Preferred Stock being issued in exchange for the Series D Preferred
Equity and corresponding  Series D Preferred Equity Balance being exchanged,  or
(b) if TCO  elects  to cause  the  Partnership  to  redeem  all of the  Series D
Preferred  Equity then  outstanding  in exchange for cash or elects to cause the
Partnership  to redeem any Excess  Preferred  Equity for cash, a written  notice
stating (1) the

                                       10
<PAGE>

redemption  date, which may be the date of such written notice or any other date
which is not later  than  sixty  (60) Days  after the  receipt  of the  Exchange
Notice,  (2) the redemption  price,  and (3) the place where the  Certificate of
Withdrawal  is to be  delivered.  The Series D Preferred  Equity shall be deemed
canceled simultaneously with the delivery of the Certificate of Withdrawal (with
respect to the Series D Preferred  Equity Balance  exchanged) or  simultaneously
with the  redemption  date (with  respect to Series D Preferred  Equity  Balance
redeemed).  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained herein, any and
all Series D  Preferred  Equity to be  exchanged  for Series D  Preferred  Stock
pursuant to this Paragraph (iv) shall be so exchanged in a single transaction at
one (1) time. As a condition to exchange, TCO may require the Series D Preferred
Partner  to  make  such  representations  and  warranties   including,   without
limitation,  warranties as to ownership and absence of restrictions,  liens, and
encumbrances  and  representations  as may be  reasonably  necessary  for TCO to
establish that the issuance of Series D Preferred Stock pursuant to the exchange
shall not be required to be  registered  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as
amended (the  "Securities  Act"),  or any state  securities  laws.  Any Series D
Preferred  Stock issued  pursuant to this  Paragraph  (iv) shall be delivered as
shares which are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable,

be  issued  upon  the  exchange  but,  in lieu  thereof,  TCO  shall  pay a cash
adjustment based on the fair market value of the Series D Preferred Stock on the
Day  prior to the  exchange  date as  determined  in good  faith by the Board of
Directors of TCO.
          (3)  Adjustment  of Exchange  Price.  In the event that TCO shall be a
party  to  any   transaction   (including,   without   limitation,   a   merger,
consolidation,  statutory share exchange,  tender offer for all or substantially
all of  TCO's  capital  stock,  or sale  of all or  substantially  all of  TCO's
assets),  in each case as a result of which the Series D Preferred Stock will be

                                       12
<PAGE>

other  property  (including  cash or any  combination  thereof),  the  Series  D
Preferred  Equity  Balance will  thereafter  be  exchangeable  into the kind and
amount of shares of capital stock and other  securities and property  receivable
(including  cash or any  combination  thereof)  upon  the  consummation  of such
transaction  by a holder of that  number of Series D  Preferred  Stock of TCO or
fraction   thereof  into  which  the  Series  D  Preferred  Equity  Balance  was
exchangeable  immediately prior to such transaction.  TCO may not become a party
to any such  transaction  unless  the  terms  thereof  are  consistent  with the
foregoing.
(v) No Other Conversion  Rights.  Subject to TCO's right to convert the Series D
Preferred Equity Balance to an Additional Interest pursuant to Section 8.1(c) of
the  Partnership  Agreement,  the Series D Preferred  Partner shall not have any
right to convert the Series D Preferred  Equity  Balance or any portion  thereof

(vi) No Sinking  Fund:  No sinking fund shall be required for the  retirement or
redemption of the Series D Preferred Equity Balance.
(vii) Certain Voting Rights:  The Series D Preferred  Partner shall not have any
voting  rights or rights to  consent to any  Partnership  matter  requiring  the
consent or approval of Partners, except as set forth below.
     So long as any Series D Preferred Equity Balance remains  outstanding,  the
Partnership  shall  not,  without  the  affirmative  vote of Series D  Preferred
Partners holding at least  two-thirds  (2/3rds) of the Series D Preferred Equity
Balance at the time,  (x)  authorize or create,  or increase the  authorized  or
issued amount of, any class or series of Partnership Interests ranking senior to
the Series D Preferred Equity with respect to payment of distributions or rights
upon liquidation, dissolution, or winding up (including, without limitation, any
future issuances of Preferred Equity),  or reclassify any Partnership  Interests

                                       13
<PAGE>

of the Partnership into any such Partnership Interest,  or create,  authorize or
issue any  obligations  or  security  convertible  into or  exchangeable  for or
evidencing  the  right  to  purchase  any  such   Partnership   Interests,   (y)
consolidate,  merge  into or with,  or  convey,  transfer  or lease  its  assets
substantially  as an entirety to, any  corporation or other entity,  or amend or
alter Sections 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 5.1, 5.2(a)(i), 5.5, 5.7(a), 6.10, 8.1(a), 8.1(c),
or  11.1(a)(5)  of the  Partnership  Agreement  or  any  other  sections  of the
Partnership  Agreement  which  would  affect  such  sections,  or the  rights or
obligations of the Series D Preferred  Partner under the Partnership  Agreement,
or this Annex, whether by merger, consolidation, amendment or otherwise, in each
such case in a manner that would  materially and adversely  affect the rights of
the Series D  Preferred  Equity or the  Series D  Preferred  Partner;  provided,
however,  that with respect to the  occurrence  of any event set forth in clause
(y) above, so long as (1) the Partnership is the surviving entity and the Series
D Preferred Equity remains outstanding with the terms thereof unchanged,  or (2)
the  resulting,  surviving  or  transferee  entity  is  a  partnership,  limited
liability company,  or other pass-through entity organized under the laws of any
state and substitutes for the Series D Preferred  Equity other interests in such
entity having  substantially the same terms and rights as the Series D Preferred
Equity, including with respect to distributions,  redemptions, transfers, voting
rights, and rights upon liquidation, then the occurrence of any such event shall
not be deemed to  materially  and  adversely  affect such rights of the Series D
Preferred  Partner;  and provided further,  that any increase or issuance in the
amount of  Partnership  Interests or the creation or issuance of any other class
or series of  Partnership  Interests,  in each case  ranking  (a)  junior to the
Series D  Preferred  Equity  with  respect to payment  of  distributions  or the
distribution  of assets  upon  liquidation,  or (b) on a parity to the  Series D

                                       14
<PAGE>

Preferred Equity with respect to payment of distributions or the distribution of
assets upon  liquidation  shall not be deemed to materially and adversely affect
such rights.
     Notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein  or in  the
Partnership Agreement,  in determining what is a class or series ranking senior,
or on parity to the Series D Preferred  Equity,  the 19.95%  Profits  Allocation
Limit shall be disregarded.
     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned  Appointing Persons, in accordance with
Section  13.11 of the  Partnership  Agreement,  on behalf of all of the Partners
have entered into this Annex as of the date first above written.
