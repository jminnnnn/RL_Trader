Item 1.  BUSINESS

The Company

     Taubman Centers, Inc. (the "Company" or "TCO") was incorporated in Michigan
in 1973 and had its initial public offering  ("IPO") in 1992. Upon completion of
the IPO, the Company became the managing  general  partner of The Taubman Realty
Group Limited  Partnership (the "Operating  Partnership" or "TRG").  The Company
has a 62% partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership,  through which the
Company conducts all its operations.  The Company owns, develops,  acquires, and
operates  regional  shopping  centers  ("Centers")  and interests  therein.  The
Company's  portfolio,  as of December 31,  2000,  included 16 urban and suburban
Centers located in seven states.  One additional Center opened in March 2001 and
four other Centers are under  construction  and are expected to open in 2001 and
2002.  The Operating  Partnership  also owns certain  regional  retail  shopping
center  development  projects and more than 99% of The Taubman  Company  Limited
Partnership (the "Manager"),  which manages the shopping  centers,  and provides
other services to the Operating  Partnership  and the Company.  See the table on
pages 12 and 13 of this report for information regarding the Centers.

     The Company is a real estate  investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal
Revenue  Code of  1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code").  In order  to  satisfy  the
provisions of the Code  applicable to REITs,  the Company must distribute to its
shareholders  at least 90% of its REIT  taxable  income and meet  certain  other
requirements.   TRG's   partnership   agreement   provides  that  the  Operating
Partnership will distribute,  at a minimum,  sufficient  amounts to its partners
such  that  the  Company's  pro  rata  share  will  enable  the  Company  to pay
shareholder  dividends  (including  capital gains dividends that may be required
upon the  Operating  Partnership's  sale of an asset) that will satisfy the REIT
provisions of the Code.

Recent Developments

     For a discussion of business  developments  that occurred in 2000, see Item
7, "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of
Operations" (MD&A).

The Shopping Center Business

     There are several types of retail shopping  centers,  varying  primarily by
size and marketing  strategy.  Retail shopping  centers range from  neighborhood
centers of less than 100,000  square feet of GLA to regional and  super-regional
shopping  centers.  Retail shopping  centers in excess of 400,000 square feet of
GLA are  generally  referred  to as  "regional"  shopping  centers,  while those
centers having in excess of 800,000 square feet of GLA are generally referred to
as   "super-regional"   shopping   centers.   Thirteen   of  the   Centers   are
"super-regional" centers. In this annual report on Form 10-K, the term "regional
shopping centers" refers to both regional and  super-regional  shopping centers.
The term "GLA" refers to gross retail space,  including  anchors and mall tenant
areas, and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail space,  excluding anchors.
The term "anchor" refers to a department  store or other large retail store. The
term "mall  tenants"  refers to stores  (other than  anchors) that are typically
specialty retailers and lease space in shopping centers.


                                       1

Business of the Company

     The Company, as managing general partner of the Operating  Partnership,  is
engaged in the ownership,  management,  leasing,  acquisition,  development  and
expansion of regional shopping centers.

     The Centers:

     o    are  strategically  located  in  major  metropolitan  areas,  many  in
          communities that are among the most affluent in the country, including
          New York City,  Los Angeles,  Denver,  Detroit,  Phoenix,  Miami,  and
          Washington, D.C.;

     o    range in size between  438,000 and 1.6 million  square feet of GLA and
          between  133,000 and 614,000  square  feet of Mall GLA.  The  smallest
          Center has approximately 50 stores,  and the largest has approximately
          200 stores. Of the 16 Centers, 13 are super-regional shopping centers;

     o    have  approximately  2,200 stores  operated by its mall tenants  under
          approximately 975 trade names;

     o    have 48 anchors, operating under 15 trade names;

     o    lease  approximately  78% of Mall GLA to  national  chains,  including
          subsidiaries  or  divisions  of  The  Limited  (The  Limited,  Limited
          Express,  Victoria's  Secret,  and others),  The Gap (The Gap,  Banana
          Republic,  and others),  and Venator Group, Inc. (Foot Locker,  Champs
          Sports, and others); and

     o    are among the most productive  (measured by mall tenants'  average per
          square foot sales) in the United  States.  In 2000,  mall  tenants had
          average per square foot sales of $479, which is substantially  greater
          than the average for all  regional  shopping  centers  owned by public
          companies.

     The most important factor  affecting the revenues  generated by the Centers
is leasing to mall tenants  (primarily  specialty  retailers),  which represents
approximately  90% of  revenues.  Anchors  account for less than 10% of revenues
because many own their stores and, in general,  those that lease their stores do
so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.

     The Company's portfolio is concentrated in highly productive super-regional
shopping  centers.  Of the 16 Centers,  14 had annual rent rolls at December 31,
2000 of over $10 million.  The Company  believes that this level of productivity
is indicative of the Centers' strong competitive position and is, in significant
part,  attributable  to the  Company's  business  strategy and  philosophy.  The
Company believes that large shopping centers (including  regional and especially
super-regional shopping centers) are the least susceptible to direct competition
because (among other reasons)  anchors and large specialty  retail stores do not
find it  economically  attractive  to open  additional  stores in the  immediate
vicinity of an existing  location  for fear of  competing  with  themselves.  In
addition to the  advantage  of size,  the  Company  believes  that the  Centers'
success can be attributed in part to their other physical characteristics,  such
as design, layout, and amenities.


                                       2

Business Strategy And Philosophy

     The Company  believes  that the regional  shopping  center  business is not
simply a real estate development  business,  but rather an operating business in
which a retailing approach to the on-going management and leasing of the Centers
is essential. Thus the Company:

     o    Offers a large,  diverse  selection of retail stores in each Center to
          give  customers a broad  selection  of  consumer  goods and variety of
          price ranges.

     o    Endeavors to increase  overall mall tenants' sales by leasing space to
          a constantly  changing mix of tenants,  thereby increasing  achievable
          rents.

     o    Seeks to anticipate  trends in the retailing  industry and  emphasizes
          ongoing  introductions of new retail concepts into the Centers. Due in
          part to this strategy,  a number of successful retail trade names have
          opened  their  first mall  stores in the  Centers.  In  addition,  the
          Company has brought to the Centers "new to the market" retailers.  The
          Company believes that its execution of this leasing strategy is unique
          in  the  industry  and  is  an  important   element  in  building  and
          maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity.

     o    Provides  innovative  initiatives  that  utilize  technology  and  the
          Internet to heighten  the shopping  experience  for  customers,  build
          customer loyalty and increase tenant sales. One such initiative is the
          Company's  ShopTaubman  one-to-one  marketing program,  which connects
          shoppers and retailers through online websites.

     The Centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse,  in-depth
presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to
facilitate  customer  shopping.  While some Centers  include  stores that target
high-end,  upscale customers,  each Center is individually merchandised in light
of the  demographics  of  its  potential  customers  within  convenient  driving
distance.

     The Company's  leasing strategy  involves  assembling a diverse mix of mall
tenants in each of the Centers in order to attract customers, thereby generating
higher  sales by mall  tenants.  High  sales by mall  tenants  make the  Centers
attractive to  prospective  tenants,  thereby  increasing  the rental rates that
prospective tenants are willing to pay. The Company implements an active leasing
strategy to  increase  the  Centers'  productivity  and to set minimum  rents at
higher  levels.   Elements  of  this  strategy  include  terminating  leases  of
under-performing  tenants,  renegotiating existing leases, and not leasing space
to prospective  tenants that (though viable or attractive in certain ways) would
not enhance a Center's retail mix.

Potential For Growth

     The Company's  principal  objective is to enhance  shareholder  value.  The
Company seeks to maximize the financial results of its assets,  while pursuing a
growth strategy that concentrates  primarily on an active new center development
program.


                                       3
<PAGE>

Development of New Centers

     The  Company is  pursuing an active  program of  regional  shopping  center
development.  The  Company  believes  that  it  has  the  expertise  to  develop
economically  attractive regional shopping centers through intensive analysis of
local retail  opportunities.  The Company  believes that the  development of new
centers is the best use of its capital and an area in which the Company  excels.
At any time, the Company has numerous potential  development projects in various
stages.

     The following table includes the new centers  scheduled for opening in 2001
and 2002:

</TABLE>

     The Company's policies with respect to development  activities are designed
to reduce the risks  associated  with  development.  For  instance,  the Company
previously  entered  into an  agreement  to lease a center,  while  the  Company
investigated the  redevelopment  opportunities of the center.  Also, the Company
generally  does not intend to acquire  land  early in the  development  process.
Instead,  the Company generally  acquires options on land or forms  partnerships
with landholders holding potentially  attractive  development sites. The Company
typically  exercises the options only once it is prepared to begin construction.
In  addition,  the  Company  does  not  intend  to  begin  construction  until a
sufficient  number of anchor  stores  have  agreed to  operate  in the  shopping
center,  such that the Company is confident  that the projected  sales and rents
from Mall GLA are  sufficient to earn a return on invested  capital in excess of
the Company's cost of capital.  Having  historically  followed these principles,
the  Company's  experience  indicates  that  less  than 10% of the  costs of the
development  of a  regional  shopping  center  will  be  incurred  prior  to the
construction  period;  however,  no assurance can be given that the Company will
continue to be able to so limit pre-construction costs.

     While the Company  will  continue to evaluate  development  projects  using
criteria,  including  financial  criteria for rates of return,  similar to those
employed in the past,  no  assurances  can be given that the  adherence to these
policies will produce comparable  results in the future. In addition,  the costs
of shopping center  development  opportunities  that are explored but ultimately
abandoned  will,  to some  extent,  diminish the overall  return on  development
projects (see "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and
Results of Operations -- Liquidity  and Capital  Resources -- Capital  Spending"
for further discussion of the Company's development activities).

<PAGE>

Strategic Acquisitions

     The Company's  objective is to acquire  existing centers only when they are
compatible with the quality of the Company's portfolio (or can be redeveloped to
that  level)  and  that  satisfy  the  Company's  strategic  plans  and  pricing
requirements.

     In addition, the Company may make other investments to enhance the value of
its business. For example, in May 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to
acquire an approximately 6.7% interest in MerchantWired,  LLC, a service company
providing internet and network infrastructure to shopping centers and retailers.
Additionally,  in  April  1999,  the  Company  made a  strategic  investment  in
fashionmall.com,  an online landlord.  Visitors to the fashionmall  website find
many of the same retailers  found in Taubman  centers,  including Gap and Banana
Republic.  Also, in November 1999, the Company  acquired the retail leasing firm
Lord Associates,  which will provide additional resources for the leasing of the
four new  centers  scheduled  to open in 2001.  Lord  Associates  has  extensive
experience with value and  entertainment  specialty  centers and had worked with
the Company on the leasing of Great Lakes Crossing.

Expansions of the Centers

     Another potential element of growth is the strategic  expansion of existing
properties to update and enhance their market positions,  by replacing or adding
new anchor stores or increasing mall tenant space. Most of the Centers have been
designed to accommodate expansions.  Expansion projects can be as significant as
new  shopping  center  construction  in  terms  of  scope  and  cost,  requiring
governmental  and  existing  anchor  store  approvals,  design  and  engineering
activities, including rerouting utilities, providing additional parking areas or
decking, acquiring additional land, and relocating anchors and mall tenants (all
of which must take place with a minimum of  disruption  to existing  tenants and
customers).  For example,  food courts are under  construction at Twelve Oaks in
the suburban Detroit area and at Woodland in Grand Rapids,  Michigan.  Both food
courts are scheduled to open in the fall of 2001.

Internal Growth

     The Centers are among the most  productive  in the nation when  measured by
mall tenant's average sales per square foot. Higher sales per square foot enable
mall  tenants  to remain  profitable  while  paying  occupancy  costs that are a
greater percentage of total sales. As leases expire at the Centers,  the Company
has  consistently  been able, on a portfolio basis, to lease the available space
to existing or new tenants at higher rates.

     Augmenting this growth,  the Company is pursuing a number of new sources of
revenue  from the Centers.  For example,  the Company has entered into a 15-year
lease agreement with JCDecaux,  the world's largest street furniture and outdoor
advertising company. The agreement created an in-mall advertising program in the
Company's   portfolio   of  owned   properties,   creating   new   point-of-sale
opportunities for retailers and manufacturers as well as heightening the in-mall
experience for shoppers. In addition, the Company expects increased revenue from
its  specialty  leasing  efforts.  In  recent  years a new  industry  --  beyond
traditional  carts and  kiosks -- has  evolved,  with  more and  better  quality
specialty tenants.  The Company has in place a company-wide  program to maximize
this opportunity.

Rental Rates

     As leases have expired in the Centers,  the Company has generally been able
to rent the available space,  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant,  at
rental  rates that are higher than those of the expired  leases.  In a period of
increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations
of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or
declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for
the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older
leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated
at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for
existing leases.

     Since 1992,  the Company has disclosed  average  rents for mature  centers,
those centers owned and operated for five years.  In the fourth quarter of 2000,
the Company began  reporting  average rent per square foot for centers owned and
opened for two years,  so that the statistic will be more  consistent with other
reported statistics.  The following table contains certain information regarding
per square  foot  minimum  rent at Centers  that have been owned and open for at
least two years.

(2)  In these  years,  a higher  percentage  of space  rented  to major and mall
     tenants  at value  centers,  which  typically  have  lower  rents  than the

     tenants,  average rents per square foot expiring in 2002, 2003, 2007, 2008,
     and 2009 would be $40.57, $42.97, $44.70, $46.63, and $41.89, respectively.
</FN>
</TABLE>

     The Company  believes that the  information in the table is not necessarily
indicative  of what will occur in the future  because  of several  factors,  but
principally  because its leasing  policies and  practices  create a  significant
level of early lease  terminations  at the  Centers.  For  example,  the average
remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period 1995 to 2000
was  approximately  two years. The average term of leases signed during 2000 and
1999 was approximately eight years.

     In  addition,  mall tenants at the Centers may seek the  protection  of the
bankruptcy  laws,  which could result in the termination of such tenants' leases
and thus cause a reduction in cash flow. In 2000,  approximately  2.3% of leases
were so affected  compared to 3.1% in 1999, 1.2% in 1998, 1.5% in 1997, and 2.8%
in 1996. Since 1991, the annual provision for losses on accounts  receivable has
been less than 2% of annual revenues.

     Mall tenant average occupancy,  ending occupancy, and leased space rates of
the Centers are as follows:

Major Tenants

     No single retail company represents 10% or more of the Company's  revenues.
The combined operations of The Limited, Inc. accounted for approximately 6.6% of
Mall GLA as of December 31, 2000 and for approximately  5.5% of the 2000 minimum
rent.  The largest of these,  in terms of square  footage and rent,  is Express,
which  accounted  for  approximately  1.9% of Mall GLA and 1.5% of 2000  minimum
rent. No other single retail  company  accounted for more than 4% of Mall GLA or
2000 minimum rent. The following  table shows the ten largest  tenants and their

General Risks of the Company

Economic Performance and Value of Shopping Centers Dependent on Many Factors

     The economic  performance and value of the Company's  shopping  centers are
dependent on various  factors.  Additionally,  these same factors will influence
the Company's  decision  whether to go forward on the development of new centers
and may affect the ultimate  economic  performance  and value of projects  under
construction  (see other risks  associated  with the  development of new centers
under  "Business  of the  Company--Development  of New  Centers").  Such factors
include:

o    changes in the national, regional, and/or local economic climates,

o    competition from other shopping  centers,  discount  stores,  outlet malls,
     discount  shopping  clubs,  direct  mail  and the  Internet  in  attracting
     customers and tenants,

o    increases in operating costs,

o    the public perception of the safety of customers at the shopping centers,

o    environmental or legal liabilities,

o    availability and cost of financing, and

o    uninsured  losses,  resulting from wars,  riots,  or civil  disturbances or
     losses from  earthquakes or floods in excess of policy  specifications  and
     insured limits.

In addition, the value of shopping centers may be adversely affected by:

o    changes in government regulations, and

o    changes in real estate zoning and tax laws.

Adverse changes in the economic  performance and value of shopping centers would
adversely affect the Company's income and cash available to pay dividends.


                                       9
<PAGE>


Third Party Interests in the Centers

     Some of the  shopping  centers  which the Company  develops  and leases are
partially owned by non-affiliated  partners through joint venture  arrangements.
As a result,  the  Company may not be able to control  all  decisions  regarding
those  shopping  centers  and may be required  to take  actions  that are in the
interest of the joint venture partners but not the Company's best interests.

Bankruptcy of Mall Tenants or Joint Venture Partners

     The Company could be adversely affected by the bankruptcy of third parties.
The  bankruptcy  of a mall tenant could result in the  termination  of its lease
which would lower the amount of cash  generated by that mall. In addition,  if a
department  store operating an anchor at one of our shopping  centers were to go
into bankruptcy and cease  operating,  its closing may lead to reduced  customer
traffic and lower mall tenant sales which would,  in turn,  affect the amount of
rent our tenants pay us. The  profitability  of shopping centers held in a joint
venture could also be adversely  affected by the  bankruptcy of one of the joint
venture  partners if, because of certain  provisions of the bankruptcy laws, the
Company was unable to make  important  decisions  in a timely  fashion or became
subject to additional liabilities.

Third Party Contracts

     The Company provides property  management,  leasing,  development and other
administrative  services to centers transferred to GMPT, other third parties and
to certain  Taubman  affiliates.  The contracts  under which these  services are
provided  may be canceled or not  renewed or may be  renegotiated  on terms less
favorable  to the  Company.  Certain  costs of  providing  services  under these
contracts  would not  necessarily  be  eliminated  if the  contracts  were to be
canceled or not renewed.

Inability to Maintain Status as a REIT

o    The  Company  may not be able  to  maintain  its  status  as a real  estate
     investment  trust, or REIT, for Federal income tax purposes with the result
     that the income  distributed  to  shareholders  will not be  deductible  in
     computing  taxable  income and  instead  would be subject to tax at regular
     corporate rates. Although the Company believes it is organized and operates
     in  a  manner  to  maintain  its  REIT  qualification,  many  of  the  REIT
     requirements of the Internal Revenue Code are very complex and have limited
     judicial  or  administrative  interpretations.   Changes  in  tax  laws  or
     regulations or new administrative  interpretations  and court decisions may
     also affect the Company's ability to maintain REIT status in the future. If
     the Company  fails to qualify as a REIT,  its income may also be subject to
     the  alternative  minimum  tax. If the Company  does not  maintain its REIT
     status in any year,  it may be unable to elect to be  treated as a REIT for
     the next four taxable years. In addition,  if the Company fails to meet the
     Internal  Revenue Code's  requirement that it distribute to shareholders at
     least 90% of  otherwise  taxable  income,  the Company will be subject to a
     nondeductible 4% excise tax on a portion of its income.

o    Although  the Company  currently  intends to maintain its status as a REIT,
     future economic, market, legal, tax or other considerations may cause it to
     determine  that it would be in the  Company's  and its  shareholders'  best
     interests  to revoke its REIT  election.  As noted  above,  if the  Company
     revokes its REIT election, it will not be able to elect REIT status for the
     next four taxable years.

Environmental Matters

     All of the Centers  presently  owned by the Company (not  including  option
interests in the Development  Projects or any of the real estate managed but not
included  in  the  Company's  portfolio)  have  been  subject  to  environmental
assessments. The Company is not aware of any environmental liability relating to
the  Centers  or any  other  property,  in which  they  have or had an  interest
(whether  as an owner or  operator)  that the  Company  believes,  would  have a
material  adverse  effect on the  Company's  business,  assets,  or  results  of
operations.  No  assurances  can  be  given,  however,  that  all  environmental
liabilities  have been identified or that no prior owner,  operator,  or current
occupant  has  created  an  environmental  condition  not known to the  Company.
Moreover,  no  assurances  can be given that (i)  future  laws,  ordinances,  or
regulations  will not impose any material  environmental  liability or that (ii)
the  current  environmental  condition  of the  Centers  will not be affected by
tenants and  occupants of the Centers,  by the  condition of  properties  in the
vicinity of the Centers (such as the presence of underground  storage tanks), or
by third parties unrelated to the Company.

     There are asbestos  containing  materials  ("ACMs") at most of the Centers,
primarily in the form of floor  tiles,  roof  coatings  and  mastics.  The floor
tiles,  roof coatings and mastics are generally in good  condition.  The Manager
has developed and is  implementing  an operations and  maintenance  program that
details  operating  procedures  with respect to ACMs prior to any renovation and
that requires periodic inspection for any change in condition of existing ACMs.

Personnel

     The Company has  engaged  the  Manager to provide  real estate  management,
acquisition,  development,  and administrative  services required by the Company
and its properties.

     As of December  31,  2000,  the Manager had 478  full-time  employees.  The
following  table  provides a breakdown of employees by  operational  areas as of

Mortgage Debt

     The following table sets forth certain information  regarding the mortgages
encumbering the Centers as of December  31,2000.  All mortgage debt in the table
below is nonrecourse to the Operating  Partnership,  except for debt encumbering
Great Lakes Crossing,  Dolphin Mall,  International Plaza, The Mall at Millenia,
and The Shops at Willow Bend.  The  Operating  Partnership  has  guaranteed  the
payment of principal  and interest on the mortgage  debt of these  Centers.  The
loan agreements  provide for the reduction of the amounts  guaranteed as certain
center performance and valuation criteria are met. (See "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations - Liquidity and
Capital  Resources - Covenants  and  Commitments").  Assessment  bonds  totaling
approximately  $2.3 million,  which are not included in the table, also encumber
Biltmore.

(1)  On  September  30, 1998 the  Company  obtained a majority  and  controlling
     interest  in The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited  Partnership  (TRG or the
     Operating  Partnership) as a result of the GMPT Exchange (see  Management's
     Discussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of Operations
     (MD&A) - GMPT  Exchange  and  Related  Transactions).  As a result  of this
     transaction, the Company's ownership of the Operating Partnership increased
     to  a  majority  and  the  Company   began   consolidating   the  Operating
     Partnership.  For  years  prior  to 1998,  amounts  reflect  the  Company's
     interest in the Operating Partnership under the equity method.
(2)  In  August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire  an
     additional interest in one of its Unconsolidated Joint Ventures; TRG became
     the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks and the joint venture partner became the 100%
     owner of Lakeside.  A gain on the transaction was recognized by the Company
     representing  the  excess of the fair  value over the net book basis of the
     Company's  interest in Lakeside Mall (see  MD&A - Significant Debt, Equity,
     and Other Transactions).

Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following  Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations contains various  "forward-looking  statements" within
the  meaning of Section  27A of the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as  amended,  and
Section  21E  of  the  Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  as  amended.  These
forward-looking  statements  represent  the  Company's  expectations  or beliefs
concerning future events,  including the following:  statements regarding future
developments  and joint ventures,  rents and returns,  statements  regarding the
continuation of historical  trends and any statements  regarding the sufficiency
of the Company's  cash balances and cash  generated from operating and financing
activities for the Company's  future  liquidity and capital  resource needs. The
Company cautions that although forward-looking  statements reflect the Company's
good faith  beliefs and best  judgment  based upon  current  information,  these
statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements,  including those
risks,  uncertainties,  and factors  detailed from time to time in reports filed
with the SEC,  and in  particular  those set forth under the  headings  "General
Risks of the Company" and "Environmental Matters" in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K. The following  discussion  should be read in conjunction  with the
accompanying  Consolidated Financial Statements of Taubman Centers, Inc. and the
Notes thereto.

General Background and Performance Measurement

     The  Company  owns a managing  general  partner's  interest  in The Taubman
Realty Group Limited  Partnership  (the Operating  Partnership or TRG),  through
which the Company  conducts all of its  operations.  The  Operating  Partnership
owns, develops, acquires, and operates regional shopping centers nationally. The
Consolidated  Businesses  consist of shopping  centers  that are  controlled  by
ownership or contractual  agreement,  development  projects for future  regional
shopping  centers and The Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the Manager).
Shopping  centers  that are not  controlled  and that are  owned  through  joint
ventures with third parties  (Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures) are accounted for
under the equity method.

     The  operations  of the shopping  centers are best  understood by measuring
their  performance  as a  whole,  without  regard  to  the  Company's  ownership
interest.  Consequently,  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the
Consolidated Businesses, the operations of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures are
presented and discussed as a whole.

     In  August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire  an
additional interest in one of its Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures;  the Operating
Partnership  became the 100% owner of Twelve Oaks and the joint venture  partner
became the 100% owner of  Lakeside.  Performance  statistics  presented  include
Lakeside through the date of the transaction.

     On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10
shopping  centers (nine  Consolidated  Businesses and one  Unconsolidated  Joint
Venture)  and a  share  of  the  Operating  Partnership's  debt  for  all of the
partnership  units owned by two General  Motors  pension trusts (GMPT) (the GMPT
Exchange).   Performance   statistics   presented   exclude   these  10  centers
(transferred centers).

Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues

     Over the long  term,  the level of mall  tenant  sales is the  single  most
important  determinant of revenues of the shopping  centers because mall tenants
provide  approximately  90% of these  revenues  and because  mall  tenant  sales
determine  the  amount  of  rent,  percentage  rent,  and  recoverable  expenses
(together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However,
levels of mall tenant sales can be  considerably  more volatile in the short run
than total occupancy costs.

     The Company believes that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and
earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot
increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because
most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can
afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher
sales per square foot.

     The following table summarizes occupancy costs,  excluding  utilities,  for
mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.

                                         2000             1999             1998

Occupancy

     Historically,  average  annual  occupancy has been within a narrow band. In
the last ten years, average annual occupancy has ranged between 86.5% and 89.4%.
Mall tenant average  occupancy,  ending  occupancy and leased space rates are as
follows:

                                         2000             1999             1998

Rental Rates

     As leases have expired in the shopping  centers,  the Company has generally
been able to rent the available  space,  either to the existing  tenant or a new
tenant,  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases.  In a
period of  increasing  sales,  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants'
expectations  of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In periods of slower
growth or  declining  sales,  rents on new leases  will grow more slowly or will
decline for the opposite reason.  However, center revenues nevertheless increase
as older leases roll over or are  terminated  early and replaced with new leases
negotiated  at current  rental  rates that are  usually  higher than the average
rates for existing  leases.  The following  table contains  certain  information
regarding  per square foot minimum  rent at the shopping  centers that have been
owned and open for at least two years.

                                                   2000               1999
                                                   ----               ----

 Average minimum rent per square foot
   All mall tenants                               $40.25             $39.58
   Stores closing during year                      39.99              39.49
   Stores opening during year                      47.04              48.01


                                       19
<PAGE>


     In 1999, average minimum rent per square foot for stores opening during the
year was higher because of the leasing of smaller than average spaces at several
of the Company's most  productive  centers.  Generally,  the rent spread between
opening and closing stores is in the Company's historic range of $5.00 to $10.00
per square  foot.  This  statistic  is  difficult to predict in part because the
Company's leasing policies and practices may result in early lease  terminations
with  actual  average  closing  rents per  square  foot  which may vary from the
average rent per square foot of scheduled lease expirations.

Seasonality

     The  regional  shopping  center  industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall
tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with
lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter
holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are
generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire
in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of
the year in anticipation of the Christmas  selling  season.  Additionally,  most
percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter.  Accordingly,  revenues and
occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.

                           1st         2nd        3rd        4th

     Because the  seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature
of minimum rents and recoveries, mall tenant occupancy costs (the sum of minimum
rents,   percentage  rents  and  expense  recoveries)   relative  to  sales  are
considerably  higher in the first  three  quarters  than they are in the  fourth
quarter.

Significant Debt, Equity and Other Transactions

     In October  2000,  the 37% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns
Arizona Mills completed a $146 million secured  financing.  The financing has an
all-in rate of approximately 8.0% and matures in October 2010. The proceeds were
primarily  used to  repay  the  existing  $142.2  million  mortgage  and to fund
transaction costs. The Operating  Partnership  recognized its $0.2 million share
of an extraordinary  charge,  consisting of the write-off of deferred  financing
costs.

     Also in October 2000,  MacArthur  Center  completed a $145 million  secured
financing. The financing has an all-in rate of approximately 7.8% and matures in
October  2010.  The  proceeds  were  used to repay  the  existing  $120  million
construction  loan  and  transaction   costs.  The  remaining  net  proceeds  of
approximately $23.9 million were distributed to the Operating Partnership, which
contributed all of the equity funding for the  development of MacArthur  Center.
The Operating Partnership used the distribution to pay down its line of credit.

     In  August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire  an
additional  ownership in one of its  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Under the
terms of the  agreement,  the  Operating  Partnership  became  the 100% owner of
Twelve Oaks and the joint  venture  partner  became the 100% owner of  Lakeside.
Both properties  remained subject to the existing mortgage debt ($50 million and
$88 million at Twelve Oaks and Lakeside, respectively.) The transaction resulted
in a net payment to the joint venture partner of approximately  $25.5 million in
cash. The payment was funded by a new $100 million facility, which is secured by
an interest in Twelve Oaks and  guaranteed  by the  Operating  Partnership.  The
acquisition  of the  additional  interest in Twelve Oaks was  accounted for as a
purchase.  The excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the  acquired
interest has been allocated to properties.  The results of Twelve Oaks have been
consolidated in the Company's results  subsequent to the acquisition date (prior
to that  date,  Twelve  Oaks was  accounted  for under the  equity  method as an
Unconsolidated  Joint Venture).  The Operating  Partnership  continues to manage
Twelve  Oaks,  while  the  former  joint  venture  partner  assumed   management
responsibility  for  Lakeside.  A gain of $85.3 million on the  transaction  was
recognized by the Company representing its share of the excess of the fair value
over the net book basis of the Company's interest in Lakeside,  adjusted for the
$25.5 million paid and transaction costs.

     The Company has acquired an approximately  6.7% interest in  MerchantWired,
LLC, a service company providing internet and network infrastructure to shopping
centers and retailers.  The Company's  investment in  MerchantWired is accounted
for under the equity method.  Based on projections  received from MerchantWired,
LLC, the  Company's  share of projected  losses would reduce income per share by
approximately  one cent per share in 2001.  The Company  funded its  investment,
which was  approximately  $3 million at  December  31,  2000 and is  expected to
increase to approximately $5 million in 2001, through existing lines of credit.

     In January  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns
Stamford  Town  Center  completed  a $76  million  secured  financing.  The  new
financing  bears interest at a rate of one-month  LIBOR plus 0.8% and matures in
2002.  The loan may be extended  until August  2004.  The rate is capped at 8.2%
plus credit spread for the term of the loan. The proceeds were used to repay the
$54 million  participating  mortgage,  the $18.3 million prepayment premium, and
accrued  interest  and  transaction  costs.  The  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture
recognized an extraordinary  charge of $18.6 million,  which consisted primarily
of  the  prepayment   premium.   The  Operating   Partnership's   share  of  the
extraordinary charge was $9.3 million.

     In December  1999,  the  Operating  Partnership  acquired an  additional 5%
interest  in Great  Lakes  Crossing  for $1.2  million in cash,  increasing  the
Operating Partnership's interest in the center to 85%.

     In November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  acquired Lord  Associates,  a
retail  leasing  firm,  for $2.5  million in cash and $5 million in  partnership
units, which are subject to certain contingencies.  In addition, $1.0 million of
this purchase  price is  contingent  upon profits  achieved on acquired  leasing
contracts.


                                       21
<PAGE>


     In September and November 1999, the Operating Partnership completed private
placements of its Series C and Series D preferred  equity totaling $100 million,
with net proceeds  used to pay down lines of credit.  In August  1999,  the $177
million  refinancing of Cherry Creek was  completed,  with net proceeds of $45.2
million  being  distributed  to the Operating  Partnership  and used to pay down
lines of credit.  In April 1999 through June 1999,  $520 million of refinancings
relating to The Mall at Short  Hills,  Biltmore  Fashion  Park,  and Great Lakes
Crossing were completed.

     In March 1999, MacArthur Center, a 70% owned enclosed  super-regional mall,
opened in Norfolk,  Virginia.  MacArthur  Center is owned by a joint  venture in
which the Operating Partnership has a controlling interest, and consequently the
results of this center are consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

     In 1996,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into an  agreement to lease
Memorial  City Mall,  a 1.4  million  square  foot  shopping  center  located in
Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that enabled the
Operating  Partnership to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities and
terminate the lease  obligations in the event such  redevelopment  opportunities
were not deemed to be  sufficient.  The  Operating  Partnership  terminated  its
Memorial City lease on April 30, 2000.

Comparable Center Operations

     The  performance  of  the  Company's  portfolio  can  be  measured  through
comparisons of comparable centers' operations.  During 2000, revenues (excluding
land sales) less operating costs  (operating and recoverable  expenses) of those
centers owned and open for the entire period increased approximately two percent
in comparison to the same centers' results in the comparable period of 1999. The
Company expects that comparable  center operations will increase annually by two
to three percent.  This is a forward-looking  statement and certain  significant
factors  could  cause the  actual  results  to differ  materially;  refer to the
General Risks of the Company in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Presentation of Operating Results

     The  following  tables  contain  the  combined  operating  results  of  the
Company's Consolidated Businesses and the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.  Income
allocated to the noncontrolling  partners and preferred interests is deducted to
arrive at the results allocable to the Company's common shareowners. Because the
net equity of the Operating  Partnership is less than zero, the income allocated
to the noncontrolling partners is equal to their share of distributions. The net
equity  of  these  minority  partners  is  less  than  zero  due to  accumulated
distributions  in excess of net income and not as a result of operating  losses.
Distributions to partners are usually greater than net income because net income
includes   non-cash  charges  for  depreciation   and   amortization,   although
distributions  were  less  than net  income  during  2000 due to the gain on the
disposition  of  Lakeside  described  above.  The  Company's  average  ownership
percentage  of the  Operating  Partnership  was 63% for both 2000 and 1999.  The
results of Twelve Oaks are included in the Consolidated Businesses subsequent to
the closing of the transaction, while both Twelve Oaks and Lakeside are included
as Unconsolidated Joint Ventures for previous periods.

Consolidated Businesses

     Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $301.9 million,  a
$44.3 million or 17.2% increase over 1999. Minimum rents increased $18.0 million
of which $4.3 million was due to the opening of MacArthur Center.  Minimum rents
also increased due to the inclusion of Twelve Oaks,  tenant  rollovers,  and new
sources of rental income,  including  temporary  tenants and  advertising  space
arrangements.  Percentage  rents  increased due to increases in tenant sales and
the  inclusion of Twelve Oaks.  Expense  recoveries  increased  primarily due to
MacArthur Center and Twelve Oaks. Management,  leasing, and development revenues
increased  primarily  due to contracts  acquired as part of the Lord  Associates
transaction, partially offset by decreases due to a reduction in fees in certain
managed centers, and the timing and completion status of certain other contracts
and services.  Other revenue increased  primarily due to an increase in gains on
sales of peripheral land and interest income,  partially offset by a decrease in
lease cancellation revenue.

     Total  operating  costs were  $262.3  million,  a  $25.3  million  or 10.7%
increase  from 1999.  Recoverable  expenses and  depreciation  and  amortization
increased  primarily due to MacArthur  Center and Twelve Oaks.  Other  operating
expense  increased due to MacArthur  Center,  Twelve Oaks,  the Lord  Associates
transaction,  and an increase in bad debt  expense,  offset by a decrease in the
charge  to  operations  for  costs of  pre-development  activities.  Management,
leasing,  and development  costs increased  primarily due to the Lord Associates
contracts.  Interest expense increased  primarily due to an increase in interest
rates and  borrowings,  including  debt assumed and  incurred  related to Twelve
Oaks.  In  addition,  interest  expense  increased  because  of  a  decrease  in
capitalized  interest upon opening MacArthur Center. These increases were offset
by a  reduction  in  interest  expense  on debt paid down with  proceeds  of the
preferred equity offerings.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

     Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $230.7 million,  a
$21.3 million or 8.5% decrease from the comparable period of 1999. Minimum rents
and expense recoveries  decreased primarily because the Twelve Oaks and Lakeside
results were only included through the transaction date. Other revenue decreased
primarily due to a decrease in lease cancellation  revenue,  partially offset by
an increase in gains on sales of peripheral land.

     Total  operating  costs decreased by $4.5 million to $172.0 million for the
year ended December 31, 2000.  Recoverable  expenses decreased  primarily due to
Twelve  Oaks and  Lakeside.  Interest  expense  increased  primarily  due to the
additional  debt at  Cherry  Creek  as  well as  increases  in  interest  rates,
partially offset by Twelve Oaks and Lakeside.

     As a result of the  foregoing,  income  before  extraordinary  items of the
Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures  decreased by $17.0 million,  or 22.5%,  to $58.6
million.  The  Company's  equity in  income  before  extraordinary  items of the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures was $28.5  million,  a 27.5%  decrease  from the
comparable period in 1999.

Net Income

     As a  result  of  the  foregoing,  the  Company's  income  before  gain  on
disposition, extraordinary items, and minority and preferred interests increased
$8.1 million,  or 13.9%,  to $66.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2000.
The Company  recognized $9.5 million and $0.5 million in  extraordinary  charges
related to the extinguishment of debt during 2000 and 1999, respectively. During
2000,  the Company  recognized an $85.3 million gain on the  disposition  of its
interest  in  Lakeside.   Distributions   of  $9.0  million  to  the   Operating
Partnership's  Series C and Series D Preferred  Equity owners were made in 2000,
compared to $2.4  million in 1999.  After  payment of $16.6  million in Series A
preferred  dividends,  net income  available to common  shareowners for 2000 was
$86.4 million compared to $8.9 million in 1999.

Comparison of 1999 to 1998

     Discussion  of   significant   debt,   equity,   and  other   transactions,
acquisitions,  and openings  occurring in 1999 is included in Comparison of 2000
to 1999. Significant 1998 items are described below.

GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions

     On September 30, 1998, the Operating  Partnership exchanged interests in 10
shopping  centers  (nine wholly  owned and one  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture),
together  with  $990  million  of  debt,  for all of  GMPT's  partnership  units
(approximately 50 million units with a fair value of $675 million,  based on the
average  stock price of the  Company's  common shares of $13.50 for the two week
period  prior  to the  closing),  providing  the  Company  with a  majority  and
controlling  interest in the Operating  Partnership.  The Operating  Partnership
continues to manage the centers exchanged under management agreements with GMPT.
The management agreements are cancelable with 90 days notice.

     In anticipation of the GMPT Exchange,  the Operating  Partnership  used the
$1.2 billion  proceeds from two bridge loans to extinguish  $1.1 billion of debt
in September 1998. The remaining  proceeds were used primarily to pay prepayment
premiums and  transaction  costs.  GMPT's share of debt received in the exchange
included  the $902  million  balance  on the  first  bridge  loan,  $86  million
representing  50% of the debt on the Joint Venture owned  shopping  center,  and
$1.6 million of assessment  bond  obligations.  The $340 million  balance on the
second bridge loan was refinanced during the first half of 1999.

     Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange the Operating Partnership, expecting to
reduce  its  annual  general  and   administrative   expense,   committed  to  a
restructuring of its operations and recognized a $10.7 million charge related to
this  restructuring.  During 1999, general and administrative  expense decreased
$6.5 million from 1998.

     Because the Company's  portfolio  changed  significantly as a result of the
GMPT Exchange,  the results of operations of the  transferred  centers have been
separately  classified  within the  Consolidated  Businesses and  Unconsolidated
Joint  Ventures for  purposes of  analyzing  and  understanding  the  historical
results of the current portfolio.

Other Transactions

     In November 1998, Great Lakes Crossing,  an enclosed  super-regional  mall,
opened in Auburn Hills,  Michigan.  As Great Lakes  Crossing is owned by a joint
venture in which the  Operating  Partnership  has a  controlling  interest,  its
results are consolidated in the Company's financial statements.

     At  Cherry  Creek,  a  137,000  square  foot  expansion  opened  in  stages
throughout the fall of 1998.

     In January 1998, the Operating Partnership redeemed a partner's 6.1 million
units of partnership interest for approximately $77.7 million (including costs).
The  redemption  was funded  through  the use of an  existing  revolving  credit
facility.

     The Company's average ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership was
63% for 1999 and 43% for 1998 (including  averages of 39% for the period through
the GMPT Exchange and 63% thereafter).

Consolidated Businesses

     Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $257.6 million,  a
$65.0 million or 33.7% increase over 1998, excluding revenues of the transferred
centers. Minimum rents increased $34.1 million of which $30.6 million was caused
by the opening of MacArthur Center and Great Lakes Crossing.  Minimum rents also
increased due to tenant rollovers. Expense recoveries increased primarily due to
the new centers.  Revenues from management,  leasing,  and development  services
increased  primarily due to the management  agreements with GMPT.  Other revenue
decreased  primarily  due to a decrease  in gains on sales of  peripheral  land,
partially  offset by  increases in garage and trash  removal  services and lease
cancellation revenue.

     Total operating costs were $237.0 million,  a $5.5 million or 2.3% decrease
from 1998, excluding expenses other than depreciation, amortization and interest
of the transferred  centers.  Recoverable  expenses  increased  primarily due to
Great Lakes Crossing and MacArthur Center. Other operating expense increased due
to an  increase  in the  charge  to  operations  for  costs  of  pre-development
activities, the new centers, and bad debt expense. Costs of management,  leasing
and development  services increased  primarily due to the management  agreements
with GMPT. General and  administrative  expense decreased $6.5 million primarily
due to  decreases  in payroll  costs,  travel and  professional  fees.  Interest
expense decreased primarily due to the assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the
GMPT  Exchange and debt paid down with the proceeds of the Series C and Series D
Preferred  Equity  offerings,  partially  offset by an  increase in debt used to
finance Great Lakes Crossing and MacArthur  Center and a decrease in capitalized
interest  related  to these  centers.  Depreciation  and  amortization  expenses
decreased due to the transferred centers, partially offset by an increase due to
the new centers.

     During 1998,  a $10.7  million loss on the  restructuring  was  recognized,
which  primarily  represented  the cost of certain  involuntary  terminations of
personnel.

Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

     Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $252.0 million,  a
$12.9  million or 5.4% increase from the  comparable  period of 1998,  excluding
revenues of the transferred center. Minimum rents increased due to the expansion
at Cherry Creek and tenant rollovers.  Expense recoveries also increased because
of the Cherry Creek expansion and an increase in property taxes recoverable from
tenants at certain centers.

     Total  operating  costs  decreased by $20.2 million (of which $17.7 million
represented the expenses other than interest,  depreciation, and amortization of
the transferred  center) to $176.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1999.
Recoverable  expenses increased  primarily due to the Cherry Creek expansion and
an  increase in  property  taxes at certain  centers.  Other  operating  expense
increased  primarily  due to increases  in bad debt  expense.  Interest  expense
decreased  primarily  due to the  assumption of debt by GMPT as part of the GMPT
Exchange. Depreciation and amortization decreased due to the transferred center,
offset by an increase due to the Cherry Creek expansion.

     Income before  extraordinary  items of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures
decreased by $14.1 million, or 15.7%, to $75.6 million.  The Company's equity in
income before extraordinary items of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures was $39.3
million, a 15.3% decrease from the comparable period in 1998.

Net Income

     As a result of the  foregoing,  the Company's  income before  extraordinary
items,  minority and preferred  interests  decreased $12.0 million, or 17.0%, to
$58.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. The Company  recognized $0.5
million in  extraordinary  losses related to the  extinguishment  of debt during
1999, while an extraordinary  charge of $50.8 million for the  extinguishment of
debt, primarily related to the GMPT Exchange, was recognized in 1998. The income
of the Operating Partnership allocable to minority partners increased to a total
of $30.0  million,  from $6.0  million in 1998,  primarily  due to the  minority
partners'   $30.7   million  share  of  the   extraordinary   charges  in  1998.
Distributions of $2.4 million to the Operating Partnership's Series C and Series
D Preferred  Equity owners were made in 1999.  After payment of $16.6 million in
Series A preferred dividends,  net income (loss) available to common shareowners
for 1999 was $8.9 million compared to $(3.0) million in 1998.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

     In the following  discussion,  references to beneficial  interest represent
the  Operating  Partnership's  share  of the  results  of its  consolidated  and
unconsolidated  businesses.  The  Company  does not have,  and has not had,  any
parent company  indebtedness;  all debt discussed represents  obligations of the
Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries and joint ventures.

     The Company  believes that its net cash  provided by operating  activities,
distributions  from its joint  ventures,  the  unutilized  portion of its credit
facilities,  and its  ability  to access the  capital  markets  assure  adequate
liquidity  to  conduct  its  operations  in  accordance  with its  dividend  and
financing policies.

     As of December 31,  2000,  the Company had a  consolidated  cash balance of
$18.8  million.  Additionally,  the Company has a secured  $200  million line of
credit.  This line had $63.0  million of  borrowings as of December 31, 2000 and
expires in September  2001. The Company also has available a second secured bank
line of credit of up to $40 million. The line had $26.3 million of borrowings as
of December 31, 2000 and expires in August 2001.

Debt and Equity Transactions

     Discussion of  significant  debt and equity  transactions  occurring in the
three years ended  December 31, 2000 is contained in Results of  Operations.  In
addition to the transactions  described therein, the following transactions have
occurred  which will affect the  Company's  liquidity  and capital  resources in
future periods.

     In  November  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is
developing  The  Mall  at  Millenia  closed  on a  $160.4  million  construction
facility.  The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 1.95% and the facility matures
in November 2003, with two one-year extension options. The Operating Partnership
has  guaranteed  the payment of 50% of the principal and interest.  The rate and
the amount  guaranteed  may be reduced once certain  performance  and  valuation
criteria are met. There was no balance outstanding at December 31, 2000.

     In June 2000, the Operating Partnership closed on a $220 million three-year
construction  facility  for The  Shops at Willow  Bend.  The rate on the loan is
LIBOR plus 1.85%. The loan has two one-year  extension  options.  The balance at
December 31, 2000 was $99.7 million.

     In March 2000, the Company's Board of Directors  authorized the purchase of
up to $50 million of the  Company's  common stock in the open market.  The stock
may be purchased from time to time as market conditions  warrant. As of December
31, 2000, the Company had purchased 2.3 million shares for  approximately  $25.8
million.

     In June 2000, the Company  finalized an agreement that  securitized the $40
million bank line of credit and extended its maturity to August 2001.

     In  November  1999,  the 26% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is
developing   International   Plaza  closed  on  a  $193.5  million,   three-year
construction  financing,  with a  one-year  extension  option.  The  rate on the
facility  is LIBOR plus  1.90%.  The  balance  at  December  31,  2000 was $67.5
million.

     In  October  1999,  the 50%  owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is
developing  Dolphin  Mall  closed  on a $200  million,  three-year  construction
facility.  The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 2%,  decreasing  to LIBOR plus
1.75% when a certain coverage ratio is met. The rate on the loan is capped at 7%
plus credit spread until maturity.  Under the interest rate agreement,  the rate
is swapped to a fixed rate of 6.14%, plus credit spread, when LIBOR is less than
6.7%.  The maturity  date may be extended one year.  The balance at December 31,
2000 was $116.9 million.

Summary of Investing Activities

     Net cash used in investing  activities  was $219.7 million in 2000 compared
to $197.4  million in 1999 and $270.0  million in 1998.  Cash used in  investing
activities was impacted by the timing of capital expenditures, with additions to
properties in 2000,  1999, and 1998 for the  construction  of MacArthur  Center,
Great Lakes Crossing, The Mall at Wellington Green, The Shops at Willow Bend, as
well as other  development  activities  and other  capital  items  (see  Capital
Spending below). During 2000, $3.0 million was invested in MerchantWired,  while
in 1999,  $18.5  million was used to purchase  investments  in  Fashionmall.com,
Inc., Swerdlow Real Estate Group, and Lord Associates. In addition, during 2000,
$23.6 million in costs were incurred (net of cash  acquired) in connection  with
the exchange of interests in centers.  Proceeds  from sales of  peripheral  land
increased  in  2000  by  $6.4  million,   to  $8.2  million.   Contributions  to
Unconsolidated   Joint  Ventures  are  impacted   primarily  by  the  timing  of
construction  and expansion  activities,  which in 2000, 1999, and 1998 included
significant projects at Dolphin Mall, International Plaza, The Mall at Millenia,
Fair Oaks, Lakeside, Twelve Oaks, Cherry Creek, and Woodland. Distributions from
Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures  decreased in 2000 due to the transfers of Twelve
Oaks and  Lakeside.  Also,  distributions  from  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures
included  excess  mortgage  refinancing  proceeds of $45.2  million in 1999 from
Cherry  Creek and $45.9  million  in 1998 from Fair Oaks.  In 1998,  the loss of
distributions from Woodfield after the GMPT Exchange were offset by increases in
distributions at other centers.

Summary of Financing Activities

     Financing  activities  contributed  cash of $99.7  million  in 2000,  $91.3
million in 1999,  and $131.3  million in 1998.  Borrowings net of repayments and
issuance  costs  increased by $130.3 million to $231.2 million in 2000. In 1999,
borrowings net of debt repayments and issuance costs decreased by $244.5 million
from 1998 to $100.9 million. In 1999, $97.3 million was provided by the issuance
of preferred equity.

     Distributions and dividends were $107.5 million, $100.1 million, and $131.2
million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively. Distributions were higher in 1998
due to the Company's larger pre-GMPT Exchange equity base.  Approximately  $24.2
million was used in 2000 to repurchase  common shares under the stock repurchase
program  initiated in 2000. In 1998, cash was used for the $77.7 million partner
redemption and transaction costs incurred in connection with the GMPT Exchange.

Beneficial Interest in Debt

     At December 31, 2000, the Operating  Partnership's  debt and its beneficial
interest  in the debt of its  Consolidated  and  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures
totaled $1,588.7 million. As shown in the following table, there was no unhedged
floating  rate debt at December  31, 2000.  Interest  rates shown do not include
amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items
are reported as interest expense in the results of operations. In the aggregate,
these costs added 0.45% to the effective rate of interest on beneficial interest
in debt at December 31, 2000.  Included in  beneficial  interest in debt is debt
used to fund development and expansion costs.  Beneficial  interest in assets on
which  interest is being  capitalized  totaled $499.8 million as of December 31,
2000. Beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $30.7 million for the year
ended December 31, 2000.

Sensitivity Analysis

     The Company has exposure to interest rate risk on its debt  obligations and
interest  rate  instruments.  Based on the  Operating  Partnership's  beneficial
interest  in debt and  interest  rates in effect at  December  31,  2000,  a one
percent  increase in interest  rates on floating  rate debt would  decrease cash
flows by  approximately  $3.2  million  and,  due to the  effect of  capitalized
interest,  annual earnings by approximately $1.8 million. A one percent decrease
in interest  rates on floating  rate debt would  increase  cash flows and annual
earnings by approximately $6.0 million and $3.7 million, respectively.  Based on
the  Company's  consolidated  debt and interest  rates in effect at December 31,
2000, a one percent  increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of
debt by  approximately  $40.9 million,  while a one percent decrease in interest
rates would increase the fair value of debt by approximately $44.0 million.

Covenants and Commitments

     Certain loan agreements  contain various  restrictive  covenants  including
limitations  on net worth,  minimum  debt  service  and fixed  charges  coverage
ratios, a maximum payout ratio on distributions, and a minimum debt yield ratio,
the  latter  being  the  most  restrictive.  The  Operating  Partnership  is  in
compliance with all of such covenants.

     Payments of principal and interest on the loans in the following  table are
guaranteed by the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2000. All of the loan
agreements  provide for a reduction of the amounts  guaranteed as certain center
performance and valuation criteria are met.

Funds from Operations

     A principal factor that the Company  considers in determining  dividends to
shareowners is Funds from  Operations  (FFO),  which is defined as income before
extraordinary  items,  real  estate  depreciation  and  amortization,   and  the
allocation to the minority interest in the Operating Partnership, less preferred
dividends and  distributions.  Gains on  dispositions  of depreciated  operating
properties are excluded from FFO.

     Funds from  Operations  does not represent cash flows from  operations,  as
defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be
considered  to be an  alternative  to net income as an  indicator  of  operating
performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However,
the National  Association of Real Estate  Investment  Trusts suggests that Funds
from Operations is a useful  supplemental  measure of operating  performance for
REITs.

     In October 1999,  NAREIT approved certain  clarifications of the definition
of  FFO,   including   that   non-recurring   items  that  are  not  defined  as
"extraordinary"   under  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  should  be
reflected in the  calculation  of FFO.  The  clarified  definition  is effective
January 1, 2000 and restatement of all periods  presented is recommended.  Under
the  clarified  definition,  there  would  have been no  change  to the  amounts
reported for 1999.

Dividends

     The Company  pays  regular  quarterly  dividends to its common and Series A
preferred shareowners. Dividends to its common shareowners are at the discretion
of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash  available to the Company,  its
financial condition,  capital and other requirements,  and such other factors as
the Board of Directors deems relevant.  Preferred dividends accrue regardless of
whether earnings, cash availability, or contractual obligations were to prohibit
the current payment of dividends.

     On December 12, 2000,  the Company  declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.25
per common share payable  January 22, 2001 to  shareowners of record on December
29, 2000. The Board of Directors also declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.51875
per share on the Company's 8.3% Series A Preferred Stock, paid December 29, 2000
to shareowners of record on December 19, 2000.


                                       32
<PAGE>

     Common dividends declared totaled $0.985 per common share in 2000, of which
$0.4402 represented return of capital,  $0.4799 represented ordinary income, and
$0.0649  represented  capital  gain,  compared to dividends  declared in 1999 of
$0.965 per common  share,  of which  $0.4534  represented  return of capital and
$0.5116  represented  ordinary  income.  The tax  status  of total  2001  common
dividends  declared and to be  declared,  assuming  continuation  of a $0.25 per
common share quarterly dividend,  is estimated to be approximately 30% return of
capital,  and  approximately 70% ordinary income.  Series A preferred  dividends
declared  were $2.075 per  preferred  share in 2000 and 1999,  of which  $1.9382
represented ordinary income and $0.1368 represented capital gains in 2000, while
the entire dividend represented ordinary income in 1999. The tax status of total
2001  dividends  to be paid on Series A Preferred  Stock is estimated to be 100%
ordinary income.  These are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant
factors could cause the actual results to differ materially,  including:  1) the
amount of dividends  declared;  2) changes in the Company's share of anticipated
taxable  income of the Operating  Partnership  due to the actual  results of the
Operating  Partnership;  3) changes in the number of the  Company's  outstanding
shares;  4) property  acquisitions or dispositions;  5) financing  transactions,
including  refinancing of existing debt; and 6) changes in the Internal  Revenue
Code or its application.

     The annual  determination  of the  Company's  common  dividends is based on
anticipated Funds from Operations available after preferred  dividends,  as well
as financing considerations and other appropriate factors.  Further, the Company
has decided that the growth in common  dividends will be less than the growth in
Funds from Operations for the immediate future.

     Any inability of the Operating  Partnership or its Joint Ventures to secure
financing as required to fund maturing debts,  capital  expenditures and changes
in working capital, including development activities and expansions, may require
the utilization of cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly reducing
distributions  to partners of the Operating  Partnership  and funds available to
the Company for the payment of dividends.

Capital Spending

     Capital  spending  for  routine  maintenance  of the  shopping  centers  is
generally recovered from tenants. Capital spending not recovered from tenants is
summarized in the following tables:

     The Operating Partnership's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot
leased during the year,  excluding  expansion  space and new  developments,  was
$16.39 in 2000 and $12.76 in 1999.  In  addition,  the  Operating  Partnership's
share of capitalized leasing costs in 2000, excluding new developments, was $7.6
million,  or $10.54 per square foot leased and $6.2 million or $10.82 per square
foot leased during the year in 1999.

     In September  1999,  the Company  finalized a  partnership  agreement  with
Swerdlow Real Estate Group to jointly develop Dolphin Mall, a 1.4 million square
foot value regional center located in Miami, Florida. The center opened in March
2001.  Although  certain  permitting and certificate of occupancy issues limited
the  Company's  ability to  maximize  occupancy  at opening,  approximately  150
retailers  opened  initially with an additional 50 tenants opening over a two to
three month period.  Dolphin is presently  anticipated to cost up to $20 million
higher than  originally  projected or  approximately  $290 million.  The Company
currently  estimates an unleveraged  return of  approximately  9% in 2001 on its
share of average  spending of approximately  $145 million.  The returns for 2002
and 2003 are expected to be approximately 10.5% and 11.0%, respectively.

     The  Shops  at  Willow  Bend,  a  1.5  million  square  foot  center  under
construction  in Plano,  Texas,  will be anchored by Neiman  Marcus,  Saks Fifth
Avenue, Lord & Taylor, Foley's and Dillard's. The center is scheduled to open in
August 2001; Saks Fifth Avenue will open in 2004. The Mall at Wellington  Green,
a 1.3 million square foot center under  construction  in west Palm Beach County,
Florida,  will initially be anchored by Lord & Taylor,  Burdines,  Dillard's and
JCPenney. A fifth anchor,  Nordstrom, is obligated under the reciprocal easement
agreement to open within 24 months of the opening of the center and is presently
expected to open in 2003. The center, scheduled to open in October 2001, will be
owned  by a  joint  venture  in  which  the  Operating  Partnership  has  a  90%
controlling interest.

     Additionally,  the Company is developing International Plaza, a 1.3 million
square foot center  under  construction  in Tampa,  Florida.  The center will be
anchored  by  Nordstrom,  Lord & Taylor,  Dillard's  and Neiman  Marcus,  and is
scheduled to open in September  2001.  The Company  originally had a controlling
50.1% interest in the partnership  (Tampa Westshore) that owns the project.  The
Company was responsible for providing the funding for project costs in excess of
construction  financing in exchange for a preferential return. In November 1999,
the Company entered into agreements with a new investor,  which provided funding
for the  project  and  thereby  reduced  the  Company's  ownership  interest  to
approximately  26%.  It  is  anticipated  that  given  the  preferential  return
arrangements,  the original  49.9% owner in Tampa  Westshore  will not initially
receive  cash  distributions.  The  Company  expects to be  initially  allocated
approximately 33% of the net operating income of the project, with an additional
7% representing return of capital.

     The  Company  expects  returns  on The Mall at Willow  Bend,  International
Plaza,  and The Mall at Wellington  Green to average  slightly under 10% for the
four months on average that these  centers will be open in 2001.  The  Company's
share of costs for the three  centers  is  projected  to be  approximately  $525
million  during  these four months.  For 2002,  the Company  expects  returns to
average above 10.5% on approximately  $565 million of costs and in 2003, expects
returns of 11%.  These  returns  exclude  land sale  gains  upon which  interest
expense  savings  on the gains  will add  approximately  0.25% to the  projects'
returns, based on interest savings due to the reduction of debt.

     The Operating  Partnership  has entered into a joint venture to develop The
Mall at Millenia currently under construction in Orlando,  Florida. This project
is expected to open in October  2002.  The Mall at Millenia  will be anchored by
Bloomingdale's, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus.

     The total cost, prior to anticipated recoveries,  of these five projects is
anticipated  to  be  approximately  $1.3  billion.   The  Company's   beneficial
investment in the projects will be approximately $810 million,  as four of these
projects are joint ventures.  While the Company intends to finance approximately
75% of each new center with  construction  debt, the Company is responsible  for
more than its  proportionate  share of the project  equity  (approximately  $259
million).  Substantially  all  of the  project  equity  for  the  five  projects
currently under construction has been funded through the Operating Partnership's
preferred equity offerings,  contributions from the new joint venture partner in
the  International  Plaza project,  and borrowings  under the Company's lines of
credit.  With respect to the construction loan financing,  the Company completed
financings for Dolphin Mall, The Shops at Willow Bend,  International Plaza, and
The Mall at Millenia.  The financing of The Mall at Wellington Green is expected
to be completed in the first half of 2001.

     Additionally, food courts at Twelve Oaks, in the suburban Detroit area, and
Woodland in Grand  Rapids,  Michigan are  scheduled to open in the fall of 2001.
The Operating  Partnership's  share of the cost of these projects is expected to
be approximately $12.5 million.

     The Operating Partnership and The Mills Corporation have formed an alliance
to develop value  super-regional  projects in major  metropolitan  markets.  The
ten-year  agreement  calls for the two  companies to jointly  develop and own at
least seven of these centers,  each representing  approximately  $200 million of
capital  investment.  A number of  locations  across the nation are targeted for
future initiatives.

     The following  table  summarizes  planned  capital  spending,  which is not
recovered from tenants and assumes no acquisitions during 2001:

     The  Operating  Partnership   anticipates  that  its  share  of  costs  for
development  projects  scheduled  to be completed in 2002 will be as much as $46
million in 2002.  Estimates of future  capital  spending  include only  projects
approved by the Company's Board of Directors and,  consequently,  estimates will
change as new projects are approved.  Estimates  regarding capital  expenditures
presented above are  forward-looking  statements and certain significant factors
could cause the actual results to differ  materially,  including but not limited
to: 1) actual results of negotiations with anchors, tenants and contractors;  2)
changes  in the scope and number of  projects;  3) cost  overruns;  4) timing of
expenditures; 5) financing considerations;  6) actual time to complete projects;
7) changes in economic climate;  8) competition from others  attracting  tenants
and customers; and 9) increases in operating costs.

Cash Tender Agreement

     A. Alfred  Taubman has the annual  right to tender to the Company  units of
partnership interest in the Operating  Partnership  (provided that the aggregate
value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered
interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the
trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender
Agreement).  At A. Alfred Taubman's election, his family, and certain others may
participate  in  tenders.  The  Company  will  have the  option to pay for these
interests  from  available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the  proceeds of an
offering of the  Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the  Company  expects to
finance  these  purchases  through  the sale of new  shares  of its  stock.  The
tendering  partner  will bear all market risk if the market  price at closing is
less than the  purchase  price and will bear the costs of sale.  Any proceeds of
the offering in excess of the purchase price will be for the sole benefit of the
Company.

     Based on a market  value at December  31, 2000 of $10.94 per common  share,
the  aggregate  value of  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  that may be
tendered under the Cash Tender  Agreement was  approximately  $264 million.  The
purchase  of these  interests  at December  31, 2000 would have  resulted in the
Company owning an additional 29% interest in the Operating Partnership.

New Accounting Pronouncement

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  133
requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and
liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those  derivatives  would be accounted for depending on the use of
the  derivatives  and whether  they qualify for hedge  accounting.  SFAS 133, as
amended and interpreted,  is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000.  The  Company's   derivatives  consist  primarily  of  interest  rate  cap
agreements  which the Company  purchases  to reduce its exposure to increases in
rates on its floating rate debt. The Company  expects that the primary impact of
its adoption of SFAS 133 will be the timing of the  recognition in income of the
costs of these  agreements.  This may cause earnings  volatility as the value of
these  agreements  may change  from  period to  period.  In  addition,  the swap
agreement  on the  Dolphin  Mall  construction  loan does not  qualify for hedge
accounting under SFAS 133. As a result,  the Company will recognize its share of
losses and income  related to this  agreement  in  earnings  as the value of the
agreement  changes.  The Company expects to recognize an unrealized loss on this
agreement  of  approximately  $1  million  in the first  quarter  because of the
decline in interest rates since year end.

     The  Company  will  recognize  a loss of  approximately  $8.8  million as a
transition  adjustment  to mark its share of interest  rate  agreements  to fair
value as of January 1, 2001, the Company's  transition  date. Of this amount,  a
$0.8  million  loss  will be  charged  to other  comprehensive  income  with the
remainder   representing  the  cumulative  effect  of  a  change  in  accounting
principle.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance  sheets of Taubman
Centers,  Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related
consolidated  statements of operations,  shareowners' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2000.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards  require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  such consolidated  financial statements present fairly, in
all material  respects,  the financial  position of Taubman Centers,  Inc. as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the results of its operations and its cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2000 in conformity
with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion,  such financial  statement  schedules,  when considered in
relation  to the  basic  consolidated  financial  statements  taken  as a whole,
present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       Three Years Ended December 31, 2000

Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Organization and Basis of Presentation

     Taubman Centers, Inc. (the Company or TCO), a real estate investment trust,
or REIT,  is the managing  general  partner of The Taubman  Realty Group Limited
Partnership (the Operating  Partnership or TRG). The Operating Partnership is an
operating  subsidiary  that  engages  in  the  ownership,  management,  leasing,
acquisition,  development, and expansion of regional retail shopping centers and
interests therein. The Operating Partnership's portfolio as of December 31, 2000
included 16 urban and suburban shopping centers in seven states. Four additional
centers are under  construction  in Florida and Texas;  another opened in Miami,
Florida in March 2001.

     On September  30,  1998,  the Company  obtained a majority and  controlling
interest in the Operating  Partnership as a result of a transaction in which the
Operating Partnership exchanged interests in 10 shopping centers,  together with
$990 million of its debt, for all of the partnership  units owned by two General
Motors pension trusts (GMPT),  representing  approximately  37% of the Operating
Partnership's equity (the GMPT Exchange) (Note 3).

     The consolidated  financial  statements of the Company include all accounts
of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries; all
intercompany balances have been eliminated. Shopping centers owned through joint
ventures  with  third  parties  not  unilaterally  controlled  by  ownership  or
contractual  obligation  (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under
the equity method.

     Since the Company's interest in the Operating Partnership has been its sole
material  asset  throughout all periods  presented,  references in the following
notes  to  "the  Company"  include  the  Operating  Partnership,   except  where
intercompany  transactions are discussed or as otherwise noted,  even though the
Operating  Partnership did not become a consolidated  subsidiary until September
30, 1998.

     Dollar  amounts  presented  in tables  within  the  notes to the  financial
statements are stated in thousands of dollars, except share data or as otherwise
noted.

Income Taxes

     Federal income taxes are not provided by the Company because it operates in
such a manner as to  qualify  as a REIT  under the  provisions  of the  Internal
Revenue Code;  therefore,  applicable  taxable income is included in the taxable
income of its shareowners,  to the extent distributed by the Company. As a REIT,
the  Company  must  distribute  at least 90% of its REIT  taxable  income to its
shareowners and meet certain other requirements.  Additionally, no provision for
income taxes for consolidated  partnerships has been made, as such taxes are the
responsibility of the individual partners.

     Dividends per common share  declared in 2000 were $0.985,  of which $0.4402
represented return of capital,  $0.4799 represented ordinary income, and $0.0649
represented  capital  gains.  Dividends  per common share  declared in 1999 were
$0.965,  of which $0.453  represented  return of capital and $0.512  represented
ordinary  income.  Dividends per common share  declared in 1998 were $0.945,  of
which  $0.854  represented  return of capital  and $0.091  represented  ordinary
income.  The tax status of the Company's common dividends in 2000, 1999 and 1998
may not be indicative of future periods.  Dividends per Series A preferred share
declared  in both  2000 and 1999  were  $2.075,  of  which  $1.9382  represented
ordinary income and $0.1368  represented capital gains in 2000, while the entire
dividend  represented ordinary income in 1999. The difference between net income
for financial  reporting  purposes and taxable  income  results  primarily  from
differences in  depreciation  expense and the 2000 gain on the  disposition of a
center (Note 2).

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

     Shopping center space is generally leased to specialty retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on the  straight-line  method.  Percentage  rent is
accrued when lessees' specified sales targets have been met. Expense recoveries,
which  include an  administrative  fee, are  recognized as revenue in the period
applicable costs are chargeable to tenants. Management,  leasing and development
revenue is recognized as services are rendered.

Depreciation and Amortization

     Buildings,  improvements  and equipment are depreciated on straight-line or
double-declining  balance bases over the  estimated  useful lives of the assets,
which range from 3 to 50 years. Tenant allowances and deferred leasing costs are
amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases.

Capitalization

     Costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement
of properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction
is  substantially  complete.  Assets are  reviewed for  impairment  if events or
changes  in  circumstances  indicate  that  the  carrying  amounts  may  not  be
recoverable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Deferred Charges

     Direct financing and interest rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

Stock-Based Compensation Plans

     Stock-based  compensation  plans are  accounted  for under APB  Opinion 25,
"Accounting  for Stock  Issued to  Employees"  and related  interpretations,  as
permitted under FAS 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."

Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

     Premiums paid for interest rate caps are amortized to interest expense over
the terms of the cap agreements.  Amounts  received under the cap agreements are
accounted  for on an accrual  basis,  and  recognized as a reduction of interest
expense.

Partners' Equity of TRG Allocable to Minority Partners

     Because the net equity of the  partnership  unitholders  is less than zero,
the interest of the noncontrolling unitholders is presented as a zero balance in
the balance  sheet as of December  31, 2000 and December  31,  1999.  Also,  for
periods   subsequent  to  the  GMPT  Exchange,   the  income  allocated  to  the
noncontrolling  unitholders  in the Company's  financial  statements is equal to
their  share of  distributions.  The net  equity  of the  Operating  Partnership
unitholders is less than zero because of accumulated  distributions in excess of
net income and not as a result of operating  losses.  Distributions  to partners
are usually greater than net income because net income includes non-cash charges
for  depreciation  and  amortization.  Distributions  were less than net  income
during 2000 due to a gain on the  disposition  of an interest in a center  (Note
2).

Use of Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets,  liabilities and disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the
date of the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and
expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results could differ from those
estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of financial instruments:

          The carrying  value of cash and cash  equivalents,  accounts and notes
          receivable,  and accounts payable  approximates  fair value due to the
          short maturity of these instruments.

          The fair value of mortgage  notes and other notes payable is estimated
          based on quoted market prices if available,  or the amount the Company
          would pay to terminate the debt, with prepayment penalties, if any, on
          the reporting date.

          The fair value of interest rate hedging instruments is the amount that
          the Company  would  receive or pay to terminate  the  agreement at the
          reporting date, taking into account current interest rates.

Operating Segment

     The Company has one reportable  operating  segment;  it owns,  develops and
manages  regional  shopping  centers.  The shopping centers are located in major
metropolitan  areas,  have similar tenants (most of which are national  chains),
and share common economic  characteristics.  No single retail company represents
10% or more of the Company's revenues.

Reclassifications

     Certain  prior  year  amounts  have been  reclassified  to  conform to 2000
classifications.

Note 2 - Twelve Oaks and Lakeside Transaction

     In  August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire  an
additional  ownership in one of its  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Under the
terms of the  agreement,  the  Operating  Partnership  became  the 100% owner of
Twelve  Oaks and its joint  venture  partner  became the 100% owner of  Lakeside
subject to the  existing  mortgage  debt ($50  million and $88 million at Twelve
Oaks and Lakeside,  respectively.) The transaction  resulted in a net payment to
the  joint  venture  partner  of  approximately   $25.5  million  in  cash.  The
acquisition  of the  additional  interest in Twelve Oaks was  accounted for as a
purchase.  The excess of the fair value over the net book basis of the  interest
acquired  in  Twelve  Oaks has  been  allocated  to  properties.  The  Operating
Partnership  continues to manage Twelve Oaks,  while the joint  venture  partner
assumed management  responsibility for Lakeside.  A gain of $85.3 million on the
transaction was recognized by the Company,  representing  the excess of the fair
value over the net book basis of the  Company's  interest in Lakeside,  adjusted
for the $25.5 million paid and transaction costs.

Note 3 - The GMPT Exchange and Related Transactions

     On September 30, 1998, the Company  obtained a controlling  interest in the
Operating   Partnership  due  to  the  following   transaction.   The  Operating
Partnership  transferred  interests  in 10 shopping  centers  (nine wholly owned
(Briarwood,  Columbus  City  Center,  The  Falls,  Hilltop,  Lakeforest,  Marley
Station,  Meadowood Mall,  Stoneridge,  and The Mall at Tuttle Crossing) and one
Unconsolidated Joint Venture  (Woodfield)),  together with $990 million of debt,
for all of the partnership units of GMPT  (approximately 50 million units with a
fair value of $675  million,  based on the average  stock price of the Company's
common  shares of $13.50 for the two week period prior to the closing) (the GMPT
Exchange). The Operating Partnership continues to manage the transferred centers
under agreements with GMPT (Note 12).

     As of the date of the GMPT  Exchange,  the excess of the Company's  cost of
its  investment in the  Operating  Partnership  over the Company's  share of the
Operating Partnership's  accumulated deficit was $390.4 million, of which $176.6
million  and  $213.8  million  were  allocated  to the  Company's  bases  in the
Operating  Partnership's  properties  and  investment  in  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures, respectively.

     In September  1998, in  anticipation  of the GMPT  Exchange,  the Operating
Partnership  used the $1.2 billion  proceeds from two bridge loans to extinguish
approximately  $1.1 billion of debt. The remaining  proceeds were used primarily
to pay prepayment  premiums and transaction  costs. An  extraordinary  charge of
approximately $49.8 million,  consisting primarily of prepayment  premiums,  was
incurred in connection with the extinguishment of the debt.

     The balance on the first bridge loan of $902 million was assumed by GMPT in
connection with the GMPT Exchange. The second loan had a balance of $340 million
as of December 31, 1998 and was refinanced during the first half of 1999.

     Concurrently with the GMPT Exchange, the Operating Partnership committed to
a restructuring of its operations. A restructuring charge of approximately $10.7
million was incurred,  primarily  representing  the cost of certain  involuntary
terminations of personnel.  Pursuant to the restructuring plan, approximately 40
employees were terminated across various administrative functions.  During 1998,
termination  benefits of $6.1 million  were paid.  Substantially  all  remaining
benefits were paid by the end of the first quarter of 1999.

Note 4 - Investment in the Operating Partnership

     The  partnership  equity of the  Operating  Partnership  and the  Company's
ownership therein are shown below:

   2000     82,819,463           50,984,397            62%              63%
   1999     85,116,709           53,281,643            63%              63%
   1998     84,395,817           52,995,904            63%              43%

     Net income and  distributions  of the Operating  Partnership  are allocable
first to the preferred equity interests (Note 13), and the remaining  amounts to
the general and limited Operating  Partnership partners in accordance with their
percentage ownership.  The number of TRG units outstanding decreased in 2000 due
to redemptions  made in connection with the Company's  ongoing share  repurchase
program (Note 13).  Included in the total units outstanding at December 31, 2000
and 1999 are 348,118 units and 435,148 units, respectively, issued in connection
with the 1999 acquisition of Lord Associates that do not receive  allocations of
income or distributions.

Note 5 - Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures

     Following are the Company's  investments in  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures
that own regional  retail  shopping  centers.  The Operating  Partnership is the
managing  general partner in these  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures,  except for
those denoted with an (*).

     In April 2000, the Company entered into an agreement to develop The Mall at
Millenia in Orlando, Florida. This 1.2 million square foot center is expected to
open in October 2002.

     The Company is developing  International  Plaza,  a 1.3 million square foot
regional center under construction in Tampa, Florida,  which is expected to open
September 2001. The Company  originally had a controlling  50.1% interest in the
partnership (Tampa Westshore) that owns the project. The Company was responsible
for providing funding for project costs in excess of the construction  financing
in  exchange  for  a  preferential  return.  In  November  1999,  the  Operating
Partnership entered into agreements with a new investor,  which provided funding
for the project and thereby  reduced the  Company's  ownership to  approximately
26%.

     In September  1999, the Company  entered into a partnership  agreement with
Swerdlow Real Estate Group to jointly develop Dolphin Mall, a 1.4 million square
foot value regional center in Miami, Florida, which opened in March 2001.

     During 2000,  1999, and 1998, the  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures  incurred
extraordinary   charges  related  to  the  extinguishment  of  debt,   primarily
consisting of prepayment premiums and the writeoff of deferred financing costs.

     The Company's  carrying  value of its  Investment in  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures  differs  from its share of the  deficiency  in assets  reported in the
combined  balance  sheet of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  due to (i) the
Company's  cost of its investment in excess of the historical net book values of
the  Unconsolidated   Joint  Ventures  and  (ii)  the  Operating   Partnership's
adjustments  to the  book  basis,  including  intercompany  profits  on sales of
services  that  are  capitalized  by  the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  The
Company's  additional  basis allocated to depreciable  assets is recognized on a
straight-line  basis over 40 years. The Operating  Partnership's  differences in
bases are amortized over the useful lives of the related assets.

     Combined balance sheet and results of operations  information are presented
below (in  thousands) for all  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures,  followed by the
Operating  Partnership's   beneficial  interest  in  the  combined  information.
Beneficial interest is calculated based on the Operating Partnership's ownership
interest in each of the Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.  The accounts of Lakeside
and Twelve Oaks,  formerly 50%  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures,  are included in
these results through the date of the  transaction  (Note 2). Also, the accounts
of Woodfield Associates, formerly a 50% Unconsolidated Joint Venture transferred
to GMPT (Note 3) are included in these results  through  September 30, 1998, the
date of the GMPT Exchange.

million  of notes  receivable  relating  to certain  land  sales  with  original
maturities  of September  2000 were  delinquent.  The  purchasers  are currently
negotiating  with third parties to sell their  interest in the  properties.  The
Operating  Partnership  expects to fully  recover the amounts due under the land
contracts.  The  delinquent  notes bear interest at an annual rate of 9% and are
secured by the related land parcels.

     In  May  2000,  the  Company  entered  into  an  agreement  to  acquire  an
approximately  6.7% interest in MerchantWired,  LLC, a service company providing
internet and network  infrastructure  to shopping  centers and retailers.  As of
December 31, 2000, the Company had invested  approximately $3 million in the new
venture.  The  investment  in  MerchantWired  is accounted  for under the equity
method.

     In November 1999, the Operating  Partnership  acquired Lord  Associates,  a
retail leasing firm, for approximately  $7.5 million,  representing $2.5 million
in cash and  435,153  partnership  units (and an equal  number of the  Company's
Series B Non-Participating Convertible Preferred Stock.) The units and stock are
being released over a five-year  period,  with $1.1 million of units having been
released  in  2000.  The  owner of the  partnership  units  is not  entitled  to
distributions  or  income  allocations,   and  an  affiliate  of  the  Operating
Partnership  has voting rights to the stock,  until release of the units. Of the
cash  purchase  price,  approximately  $1.0 million was paid at closing and $1.5
million  will be paid over five years;  $1.0  million of the  purchase  price is
contingent upon profits achieved on acquired leasing contracts. The final 65,271
partnership  units are  collateral  if the profit  contingency  is not met.  The
acquisition of Lord  Associates was accounted for as a purchase (cost  amortized
over five  years),  with the  results of  operations  of Lord  Associates  being
included in the income  statement of the Company  subsequent to the  acquisition
date.

     In September  1999, the Company  acquired an  approximately  5% interest in
Swerdlow Real Estate Group, a privately held real estate  investment  trust, for
approximately $10 million. The investment in Swerdlow is accounted for under the
cost method.

     In April 1999, the Company invested in an e-commerce  company that markets,
promotes,  advertises,  and sells fashion  apparel and related  accessories  and
products over the Internet.  The Company  obtained  824,084  preferred shares of
Fashionmall.com,  Inc., a 9.9% interest in the company,  for $7.4  million.  The
Company's  option to convert the  preferred  shares to an equal number of common
shares expires in May 2001. The investment in Fashionmall.com, Inc. is accounted
for under the cost method.

Extraordinary Items

     During the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, extraordinary charges to
income of $9.5  million  and $0.5  million,  respectively,  were  recognized  in
connection  with the  extinguishment  of debt at  consolidated  entities and the
Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  During  1998,  extraordinary  charges of $50.8
million were  recognized  related to the  extinguishment  of debt,  primarily in
connection with the GMPT Exchange.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

     The Company enters into interest rate  agreements to reduce its exposure to
changes  in the  cost of its  floating  rate  debt.  The  derivative  agreements
generally match the notional  amounts,  reset dates and rate bases of the hedged
debt to assure the  effectiveness  of the derivatives in reducing  interest rate
risk. As of December 31, 2000, the following  interest rate cap agreements  were
outstanding:

                          Frequency
  Notional    LIBOR        of Rate
   Amount   Cap Rate       Resets                            Term
 --------   --------      ---------        -------------------------------------
 $100,000     7.25%        Monthly         December 2000 through March 2002
  170,000     7.25%        Monthly         September 2000 through March 2002
   50,000     8.55%        Monthly         December 1996 through October 2001
   70,000     7.00%        Monthly         October 2000 through September 2003
   77,000(1)  7.15%        Monthly         June 2000 through May 2003

(1)  The  notional  amount on the cap,  which  hedges a  construction  facility,
     accretes $7 million a month until it reaches $147 million.

     The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the
counterparties to its interest rate cap agreements, but has no off-balance sheet
risk of loss. The Company anticipates that its counterparties will fully perform
their obligations under the agreements.

2000 and $7.0  million  in both 1999 and 1998.  Included  in these  amounts  are
related party office rental payments of $2.7 million in each year.

     The  following is a schedule of future  minimum  rental  payments  required
under operating leases:

                   2001                        $    7,045
                   2002                             6,891

                   2005                             4,917
                   Thereafter                     167,467

     The table above  includes $2.7 million,  $2.8 million,  $2.8 million,  $2.8
million,  and $0.9 million of related party amounts in 2001,  2002,  2003, 2004,
and 2005.

Memorial City Mall Lease

     In 1996,  the  Operating  Partnership  entered  into an  agreement to lease
Memorial  City Mall,  a 1.4  million  square  foot  shopping  center  located in
Houston,  Texas.  The lease was subject to certain  provisions  that enabled the
Operating  Partnership to explore  significant  redevelopment  opportunities and
terminate the lease  obligations in the event such  redevelopment  opportunities
were not deemed to be  sufficient.  In April  2000,  the  Operating  Partnership
terminated the lease.

Note 11 - Transactions with Affiliates

     The revenue from management, leasing and development services includes $4.2
million,  $2.5 million,  and $3.2 million from  transactions with affiliates for
the years ended  December  31,  2000,  1999,  and 1998,  respectively.  Accounts
receivable from related parties  includes  amounts related to  reimbursement  of
third-party (non-affiliated) costs.

     During 1997,  the Operating  Partnership  acquired an option from a related
party to purchase  certain real estate on which the  Operating  Partnership  was
exploring the possibility of developing a shopping center.  The option agreement
required  option  payments of $150 thousand during each of the first five years,
$400 thousand in the sixth year, and $500 thousand in the seventh year.  Through
December 31, 2000, the Operating Partnership had made payments of $450 thousand.
In 2000,  the Operating  Partnership  decided not to go forward with the project
and reached an agreement with the optionor to be reimbursed,  at the time of the
sale or lease of the real  estate,  for an amount  equal to the lesser of 50% of
the project costs to date or $350 thousand.  Under the agreement,  the Operating
Partnership's  obligation to make further  option  payments was  suspended.  The
Operating  Partnership expects to receive $350 thousand in total  reimbursements
and after receipt of such amount, the option will be terminated.

     Other related party transactions are described in Notes 7, 10, and 12.

Note 12 - The Manager

     The  Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership  (the  Manager),  which  is 99%
beneficially owned by the Operating  Partnership,  provides property management,
leasing,  development  and other  administrative  services to the  Company,  the
shopping  centers,  and Taubman  affiliates.  In addition,  the Manager provides
services to centers transferred to GMPT under management  agreements  cancelable
with 90 days notice, and services to other third parties.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

     The Manager has a voluntary  retirement saving plan established in 1983 and
amended and restated effective January 1, 1994 (the Plan). The Plan is qualified
in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code (the Code).  The
Manager  contributes  an  amount  equal  to 2% of  the  qualified  wages  of all
qualified employees and matches employee  contributions in excess of 2% up to 7%
of  qualified   wages.   In  addition,   the  Manager  may  make   discretionary
contributions  within the limits prescribed by the Plan and imposed in the Code.
Costs relating to the Plan were $1.9 million in 2000,  $1.6 million in 1999, and
$1.7 million in 1998.

     The Operating Partnership has an incentive option plan for employees of the
Manager.  Currently,  options for 7.7 million Operating Partnership units may be
issued under the plan,  substantially  all of which have been issued.  Incentive
options generally become  exercisable to the extent of one-third of the units on
each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. Options
expire  ten years  from the date of grant.  The  Operating  Partnership's  units
issued in connection with the incentive  option plan are exchangeable for shares
of the Company's common stock under the Continuing Offer (Note 14).

     A summary  of the  status  of the plan for each of the  three  years in the
period ended December 31, 2000 is presented below:

</TABLE>

     Options outstanding at December 31, 2000 have a remaining  weighted-average
contractual  life of 3.4 years and range in exercise price from $9.39 to $13.89.
The weighted average fair value per unit of options granted during 2000 and 1999
was $1.40 and $1.24,  respectively.  The Company used a binomial  option pricing
model to determine the grant date fair values based on the following assumptions
for 2000 and 1999, respectively:  volatility rates of 21.0% and 20.4%, risk-free
rates of  return  of  approximately  6.4%  and  5.3%,  and  dividend  yields  of
approximately 8.6% and 7.8%.

     The  Company  applies  APB  Opinion  25  and  related   interpretations  in
accounting for the plan. The exercise price of all options  outstanding  granted
under the plan was equal to market value on the date of grant.  Accordingly,  no
compensation expense has been recognized for the plan. Had compensation cost for
the plan been  determined  based on the fair  value of the  options at the grant
dates,  consistent with the method of FAS Statement 123, the pro forma effect on
the Company's earnings and earnings per share would have been approximately $0.2
million,  or less than $0.01 per share in 2000,  approximately $0.7 million,  or
$0.01 per share, in 1999 and approximately $0.1 million,  or less than $0.01 per
share in 1998.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Note 13 - Common and Preferred Stock and Equity of TRG

     The 8.3% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred
Stock) has no stated maturity,  sinking fund or mandatory  redemption and is not
convertible  into any other  securities  of the Company.  The Series A Preferred
Stock has a liquidation  preference  of $200 million ($25 per share).  Dividends
are  cumulative  and accrue at an annual rate of 8.3% and are payable in arrears
on or before the last day of each calendar  quarter.  All accrued dividends have
been paid. The Series A Preferred Stock can be redeemed by the Company beginning
in October  2002 at $25 per share plus any  accrued  dividends.  The  redemption
price can be paid solely out of the sale of capital  stock of the  Company.  The
Company owns a corresponding Series A Preferred Equity interest in the Operating
Partnership that entitles the Company to income and  distributions  (in the form
of  guaranteed  payments)  in  amounts  equal to the  dividends  payable  on the
Company's Series A Preferred Stock.

     In connection with the GMPT Exchange, the Company became obligated to issue
to  the  minority   interest,   upon   subscription,   one  share  of  Series  B
Non-Participating  Convertible  Preferred  Stock (Series B Preferred  Stock) for
each of the  Operating  Partnership  units held by the minority  interest.  Each
share of Series B Preferred Stock entitles the holder to one vote on all matters
submitted  to the  Company's  shareholders.  The  holders of Series B  Preferred
Stock,  voting as a class,  have the right to designate up to four  nominees for
election as  directors  of the  Company.  On all other  matters,  including  the
election of  directors,  the holders of Series B Preferred  Stock will vote with
the holders of common  stock.  The  holders of Series B Preferred  Stock are not
entitled to dividends or earnings.  Under  certain  circumstances,  the Series B
Preferred Stock is convertible  into common stock at a ratio of 14,000 shares of
Series B Preferred Stock for one share of common stock.

     In September 1999 and November 1999,  the Operating  Partnership  completed
private placements of $75 million 9% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Partnership
Equity  (Series C Preferred  Equity) and $25  million 9%  Cumulative  Redeemable
Preferred Partnership Equity (Series D Preferred Equity), respectively. Both the
Series  C  and  Series  D  Preferred  Equity  were  purchased  by  institutional
investors, and have a fixed 9% coupon rate, no stated maturity,  sinking fund or
mandatory redemption requirements.

     The holders of Series C Preferred Equity have the right, beginning in 2009,
to exchange $37.50 in liquidation value of such equity for one share of Series C
Preferred  Stock.  The holders of the Series D Preferred  Equity have the right,
beginning in 2009, to exchange $100 in liquidation  value of such equity for one
share of Series D Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock and
Series D  Preferred  Stock are  substantially  similar  to those of the Series C
Preferred  Equity and Series D  Preferred  Equity.  Like the Series A  Preferred
Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock are non-voting.

     In March 2000, the Company's Board of Directors  authorized the purchase of
up to $50 million of the  Company's  common stock in the open market.  The stock
may be purchased from time to time as market conditions warrant.  For each share
of the Company's stock repurchased,  an equal number of the Company's  Operating
Partnership  units are  redeemed.  As of  December  31,  2000,  the  Company had
purchased  and the  Operating  Partnership  had redeemed 2.3 million  shares and
units for approximately $25.8 million. Existing lines of credit provided funding
for the purchases.  Approximately  $1.6 million was accrued at December 31, 2000
for the repurchase of 150 thousand shares that settled in January 2001.

Note 14 - Commitments and Contingencies

     At the time of the Company's  initial public offering (IPO) and acquisition
of its partnership  interest in the Operating  Partnership,  the Company entered
into an agreement with A. Alfred Taubman,  who owns an interest in the Operating
Partnership,  whereby he has the annual right to tender to the Company Operating
Partnership  units  (provided that the aggregate  value is at least $50 million)
and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered  interests  at a purchase  price
based on a market  valuation  of the  Company on the  trading  date  immediately
preceding the date of the tender (the Cash Tender  Agreement).  The Company will
have the option to pay for these interests from available  cash,  borrowed funds
or from the proceeds of an offering of the Company's  common  stock.  Generally,
the Company expects to finance these purchases through the sale of new shares of
its stock.  The tendering  partner will bear all market risk if the market price
at closing is less than the purchase  price and will bear the costs of sale. Any
proceeds of the  offering in excess of the  purchase  price will be for the sole
benefit of the Company. At A. Alfred Taubman's election,  his family and certain
others may participate in tenders.

     Based on a market  value at December  31, 2000 of $10.94 per common  share,
the  aggregate  value of  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  that may be
tendered under the Cash Tender  Agreement was  approximately  $264 million.  The
purchase  of these  interests  at December  31, 2000 would have  resulted in the
Company owning an additional 29% interest in the Operating Partnership.

     The Company has made a continuing, irrevocable offer to all present holders
(other than certain excluded holders, including A. Alfred Taubman), assignees of
all present  holders,  those  future  holders of  partnership  interests  in the
Operating  Partnership  as the  Company  may, in its sole  discretion,  agree to
include in the continuing offer, and all existing and future optionees under the
Operating  Partnership's  incentive  option plan (Note 12) to exchange shares of
common  stock  for  partnership  interests  in the  Operating  Partnership  (the
Continuing  Offer).  Under  the  Continuing  Offer  agreement,  one  unit of the
Operating  Partnership  interest is exchangeable  for one share of the Company's
common stock.

     Shares  of common  stock  that were  acquired  by GMPT and the AT&T  Master
Pension  Trust in  connection  with  the IPO may be sold  through  a  registered
offering.  Pursuant to a registration  rights  agreement  with the Company,  the
owners of each of these  shares  have the annual  right to cause the  Company to
register and  publicly  sell their  shares of common  stock  (provided  that the
shares  have an  aggregate  value of at least $50 million and subject to certain
other restrictions).  All expenses of such a registration are to be borne by the
Company,  other than the underwriting  discounts or selling  commissions,  which
will be borne by the exercising party.

     The  Company is  currently  involved in certain  litigation  arising in the
ordinary course of business.  Management  believes that this litigation will not
have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.

Note 15 - Earnings Per Share

     Basic  earnings  per  common  share are  calculated  by  dividing  earnings
available  to  common  shareowners  by  the  average  number  of  common  shares
outstanding  during each  period.  For diluted  earnings per common  share,  the
Company's  ownership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership  (and  therefore
earnings)  are  adjusted  assuming  the  exercise  of all  options  for units of
partnership  interest under the Operating  Partnership's  incentive  option plan
having exercise prices less than the average market value of the units using the
treasury  stock method.  For the years ended  December 31, 2000,  1999 and 1998,
options  for 4.5  million,  0.7 million  and 0.3  million  units of  partnership
interest   with  average   exercise   prices  of  $11.99,   $13.38  and  $13.81,
respectively,  were excluded from the computation of diluted  earnings per share
because the options'  exercise prices were greater than the average market price
for the period calculated.

requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and
liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those  derivatives would be accounted for depending on the uses of
the  derivatives  and whether  they qualify for hedge  accounting.  SFAS 133, as
amended and interpreted,  is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000.  The  Company's   derivatives  consist  primarily  of  interest  rate  cap
agreements  which the Company  purchases  to reduce its exposure to increases in
rates on its floating rate debt. The Company  expects that the primary impact of
its adoption of SFAS 133 will be the timing of the  recognition in income of the
costs of these  agreements.  This may cause earnings  volatility as the value of
these  agreements  may change  from  period to  period.  In  addition,  the swap
agreement  on the  Dolphin  Mall  construction  loan does not  qualify for hedge
accounting under SFAS 133. As a result,  the Company will recognize its share of
losses and income  related to this  agreement  in  earnings  as the value of the
agreement changes.

     The  Company  will  recognize  a loss of  approximately  $8.8  million as a
transition  adjustment  to mark its share of interest  rate  agreements  to fair
value as of January 1, 2001, the Company's  transition  date. Of this amount,  a
$0.8  million  loss  will be  charged  to other  comprehensive  income  with the
remainder   representing  the  cumulative  effect  of  a  change  in  accounting
principle.

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.

     We have audited the accompanying  combined balance sheets of Unconsolidated
Joint   Ventures  of  The  Taubman   Realty  Group  Limited   Partnership   (the
"Partnership")  (a  consolidated  subsidiary  of  Taubman  Centers,  Inc.) as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the related  combined  statements of operations,
accumulated  deficiency in assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period  ended  December  31, 2000.  Our audits also  included the  financial
statement  schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These financial  statements
and financial  statement  schedules are the  responsibility of the Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on the  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States of America.  Those standards  require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements.  An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant  estimates  made by  management,  as well as evaluating  the overall
financial  statement  presentation.   We  believe  that  our  audits  provide  a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  such combined financial  statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the combined  financial  position of  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures of The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership as of December 31, 2000
and 1999, and the combined  results of their  operations and their combined cash
flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  2000 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  Also,  in  our  opinion,  such  financial  statement  schedules,  when
considered in relation to the basic  combined  financial  statements  taken as a
whole,  present  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the  information set forth
therein.

     In April  2000,  TRG  entered  into an  agreement  to  develop  The Mall at
Millenia in Orlando, Florida. This 1.2 million square foot center is expected to
open in October 2002.

     In August  2000,  TRG  completed  a  transaction  to acquire an  additional
interest in one of its  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures.  Under the terms of the
agreement,  TRG  became  the 100%  owner of Twelve  Oaks and its  joint  venture
partner became the 100% owner of Lakeside, subject to the existing mortgage debt
($50  million and $88 million at Twelve Oaks and  Lakeside,  respectively.)  The
results of the transferred  centers are included in these statements through the
date of the  transaction.  At the date of the  transaction,  the  combined  book
values of these centers'  assets and  liabilities  were $66.6 million and $146.8
million, respectively.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     TRG is developing  International  Plaza, a 1.3 million square foot regional
center under  construction in Tampa,  Florida,  expected to open September 2001.
TRG  originally  had a  controlling  50.1%  interest in the  partnership  (Tampa
Westshore) that owns the project.  TRG was responsible for providing funding for
project  costs  in  excess  of the  construction  financing  in  exchange  for a
preferential  return.  In November 1999, TRG entered into  agreements with a new
investor,  who  contributed  funding for the project and thereby  reduced  TRG's
ownership interest in Tampa Westshore to approximately 26%.

     In September  1999, TRG entered into a partnership  agreement with Swerdlow
Real Estate Group to jointly  develop  Dolphin  Mall, a 1.4 million  square foot
value regional  center under  construction  in Miami,  Florida,  which opened in
March 2001.

     On September  30,  1998,  TRG  completed a  transaction  that  included the
transfer  of  interests   in  nine   consolidated   shopping   centers  and  one
Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  (the GMPT  Exchange).  The accounts of Woodfield
Associates  (Woodfield),  a 50%  owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that was
transferred,  are  included  in  these  combined  financial  statements  through
September 1998. On the date of the GMPT Exchange, the book values of Woodfield's
assets and  liabilities  were  approximately  $107.4 million and $196.9 million,
respectively.

Revenue Recognition

     Shopping center space is generally leased to specialty retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on the  straight-line  method.  Percentage  rent is
accrued when lessees' specified sales targets have been met. Expense recoveries,
which  include an  administrative  fee, are  recognized as revenue in the period
applicable costs are chargeable to tenants.

Depreciation and Amortization

     Buildings,  improvements and equipment,  stated at cost, are depreciated on
straight-line or double-declining  balance bases over the estimated useful lives
of the assets  that range from 3 to 55 years.  Tenant  allowances  and  deferred
leasing  costs are  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the lives of the
related leases.

Capitalization

     Costs  related  to  the   acquisition,   development,   construction,   and
improvement of properties are capitalized.  Interest costs are capitalized until
construction is substantially  complete.  Properties are reviewed for impairment
if events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amounts of the
properties may not be recoverable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

     Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Deferred Charges

     Direct financing and interest rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

     Premiums paid for interest rate cap  instruments  are amortized to interest
expense  over the  terms  of the  agreements.  Amounts  received  under  the cap
agreements are accounted for on an accrual basis,  and recognized as a reduction
of interest expense.  The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements
is accounted for on an accrual basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest
expense.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value
of financial instruments:

     The  carrying  value of cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  and  notes
       receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short
       maturity of these instruments.

     The fair value of mortgage notes and other notes payable is estimated based
       on quoted  market  prices if  available, or the amount the Unconsolidated
       Joint   Ventures   would   pay   to   terminate the debt, with prepayment
       penalties, if any, on the reporting date.

     The fair value of  interest  rate  hedging  instruments  is the  amount the
       Unconsolidated  Joint Venture would  pay  or  receive  to  terminate  the
       agreement at the reporting date.

Use of Estimates

     The  preparation  of financial  statements  in conformity  with  accounting
principles   generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of  America  requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities,  disclosure of contingent  assets and liabilities at the
date of the  financial  statements,  and the  reported  amounts of revenues  and
expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results could differ from those
estimates.

Reclassifications

     Certain  prior  year  amounts  have been  reclassified  to  conform to 2000
classifications.

Note 2 - Properties

     Properties at December 31, 2000 and 1999, are summarized as follows:

                                                    2000             1999

                                               ============      ===========

     Depreciation  expense  for  2000,  1999 and 1998 was $26.2  million,  $26.0
million and $26.7 million. Construction in process includes costs related to the
construction of Dolphin Mall, The Mall at Millenia,  and International Plaza, as
well as  expansions  and other  improvements  at various  centers.  Assets under
capital  lease of $0.6  million and $3.7  million at December 31, 2000 and 1999,
respectively,  are included in the table above in  buildings,  improvements  and
equipment.

     During 2000 and 1999,  non-cash investing  activities included $1.3 million
and  $83.4  million,  respectively,  contributed  to  the  Unconsolidated  Joint
Ventures developing International Plaza, Dolphin Mall, and The Mall at Millenia.
This amount  primarily  consists of the net book value of project costs expended
prior to the creation of the joint ventures. Additionally, during 2000 and 1999,
non-cash   additions  to  properties   of  $15.5  million  and  $11.0   million,
respectively,  were recorded,  representing  accrued  construction  costs of new
centers and expansions.

               NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

     In  November  2000,  the 50% owned  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that is
developing  The  Mall  at  Millenia  closed  on a  $160.4  million  construction
facility.  The rate on the facility is LIBOR plus 1.95% and the facility matures
in November 2003, with two one-year  extension  options.  TRG has guaranteed the
payment of 50% of the principal and interest. The rate and the amount guaranteed
may be reduced once certain  performance  and valuation  criteria are met. There
was no outstanding balance at December 31, 2000.

     In November  1999,  the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture that is  developing
International  Plaza  closed  on  a  $193.5  million,   three-year  construction
financing,  with a one-year  extension option. TRG has guaranteed the payment of
100% of the  principal and  interest;  however,  the new investor in the venture
(Note 1) has indemnified TRG to the extent of 25% of the amounts guaranteed. The
loan agreement  provides for reductions of the rate and the amount guaranteed as
certain center performance criteria are met.

     The maximum availability on the Dolphin Mall construction  facility is $200
million and its rate decreases to LIBOR plus 1.75% when a certain coverage ratio
is met.  TRG has  guaranteed  the  payment of 50% of any  outstanding  principal
balance  and 100% of all  accrued  and unpaid  interest.  The  guaranty  will be
reduced as certain  performance  conditions  are met. The  maturity  date may be
extended one year.

     Scheduled principal payments on mortgage debt are as follows as of December
31, 2000:

Extraordinary Items

     In 2000, 1999, and 1998, joint ventures  recognized  extraordinary  charges
related  to the  extinguishment  of debt,  primarily  consisting  of  prepayment
premiums and the writeoff of deferred financing costs.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

     Certain of the  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  have entered into interest
rate agreements to reduce their exposure to changes in the cost of floating rate
debt.  The terms of the derivative  agreements  are generally  equivalent to the
notional  amounts,  reset dates and rate bases of the underlying  hedged debt to
assure the effectiveness of the derivatives in reducing interest rate risk.

     As of December 31, 2000, the following  interest rate cap  agreements  were
outstanding (Note 7):

Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures anticipate that their counterparties will be able
to fully perform their obligations under the agreements.

Note 5 - Leases and Other Commitments

     Shopping center space is leased to tenants and certain anchors  pursuant to
lease agreements.  Tenant leases typically provide for guaranteed  minimum rent,
percentage  rent,  and other charges to cover certain  operating  costs.  Future
minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 2000 for operating
centers,  assuming no new or renegotiated  leases or option extensions on anchor
agreements, is summarized as follows:

                                 2001                  $      121,050

     One Unconsolidated Joint Venture, as lessee, has a ground lease expiring in
2083 with its Joint Venture  Partner.  Rental payments under the lease were $2.0
million  in  2000,  1999 and  1998.  TRG is  entitled  to  receive  preferential
distributions  equal to 75% of each  payment.  Approximately  25% of the  ground
lease  payments  over the  term of the  lease,  on a  straight-line  basis,  are
recognized as ground rent expense, with 75% of the current payment accounted for
as a distribution to the Joint Venture Partner.

     The  Unconsolidated  Joint  Venture  that owns  International  Plaza is the
lessee under a ground lease  agreement  that expires in 2080. The lease requires
annual  payments of  approximately  $0.1  million and when the center opens will
require additional rentals,  based on the leasable area of the center as defined
in the agreement.

     The  following is a schedule of future  minimum  rental  payments  required
under operating leases:

                                 2001                     $     2,111

Capital Lease Obligations

     Certain  Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures have entered into lease  agreements
for property improvements with remaining lease terms through 2002; substantially
all of the capital  lease  obligation  at  December  31, 2000 will be settled in
2001.

Special Tax Assessment

     Dolphin Mall will be subject to annual special tax  assessments for certain
infrastructure improvements related to the property. The annual assessments will
be based on allocations of the cost of the infrastructure between the properties
that  benefit.  Presently,  the  total  allocation  of cost to  Dolphin  Mall is
estimated to be  approximately  $55.7 million with a first annual  assessment of
approximately  $3.4 million.  A portion of these  assessments  is expected to be
recovered from tenants.

     Certain entities related to TRG or its joint venture partners are providing
management, leasing and development services to Arizona Mills, L.L.C. and Forbes
Taubman  Orlando  L.L.C.  Charges from these  entities were $4.0  million,  $4.2
million, and $4.3 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998, respectively.

     Westfarms  previously  loaned  $2.4  million  to one of its  Joint  Venture
Partners to purchase a portion of a deceased Joint Venture  Partner's  interest.
The note bears interest at  approximately  7.9% and requires  monthly  principal
payments of $25 thousand,  plus accrued interest,  with the final payment due in
2001.  The  balance at  December  31,  2000 and 1999 was $0.2  million  and $0.6
million,  respectively.  Interest  income related to the loan was  approximately
$0.1 million in 2000, 1999, and 1998.

     Other related party transactions are described in Note 4.

Note 7 - New Accounting Pronouncement

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities."  SFAS  133
requires  companies  to record  derivatives  on the balance  sheet as assets and
liabilities,  measured at fair value.  Gains or losses resulting from changes in
the values of those  derivatives would be accounted for depending on the uses of
the  derivatives  and whether  they qualify for hedge  accounting.  SFAS 133, as
amended and interpreted,  is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2000.  The  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures'  derivatives  consist  primarily of
interest  rate cap  agreements  which  were  purchased  to  reduce  exposure  to
increases in rates on floating  rate debt.  The  Unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures
expect that the primary  impact of their adoption of SFAS 133 will be the timing
of the  recognition in income of the costs of these  agreements.  This may cause
earnings  volatility as the value of these  agreements may change from period to
period.  In addition,  the swap agreement on the Dolphin Mall  construction loan
does not qualify for hedge  accounting  under SFAS 133. As a result,  losses and
income  related to this agreement will be recognized in earnings as the value of
the agreement changes. The combined Unconsolidated Joint Ventures will recognize
a loss of  approximately  $4.9  million as a transition  adjustment  to mark the
interest  rate  agreements to fair value as of January 1, 2001,  the  transition
date.  Of  this  amount,  a loss of  $1.6  million  will  be  charged  to  other
comprehensive income with the remainder  representing the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle.

(1)  In  August  2000,  the  Company  completed  a  transaction  to  acquire  an
     additional interest in one of its Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.  Under the
     terms of the agreement,  the Operating  Partnership  became the 100 percent
     owner of Twelve Oaks and its joint venture  partner  became the 100 percent
     owner  of  Lakeside.  A  gain  of  $85.3  million  on the  transaction  was
     recognized  by the Company  representing  the excess of the fair value over
     the net book basis of the  Company's  interest in  Lakeside,  adjusted  for
     $25.5 million paid and transaction costs.
(2)  On September  30,  1998,  the Company  obtained a majority and  controlling
     interest  in TRG, as a result of the GMPT  Exchange.  Upon  obtaining  this
     controlling  interest,  the Company  consolidated  the  accounts of TRG for
     1998. The Company previously  accounted for its investment in TRG under the
     equity  method.  The  Company  does not have,  and has not had,  any parent
     company outstanding  indebtedness.  Prior to October, 1997, the Company had
     no preferred stock.
(3)  Amounts   include  TRG's  pro  rata  share  of  capitalized   interest  and
     amortization of previously capitalized interest of the Unconsolidated Joint
     Ventures.
