                                     PART I

Item 1.  BUSINESS

The Company

  Taubman Centers, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in Michigan in 1973 and
had its initial public offering ("IPO") in 1992. Upon completion of the IPO, the
Company became the managing  general partner of The Taubman Realty Group Limited
Partnership  ("TRG"),  an operating  partnership  that engages in the ownership,
operation,   management,  leasing,  acquisition,   development,   redevelopment,
expansion,  financing,  and  refinancing  of regional  shopping  centers.  As of
December 31, 1996,  the Company  holds a 36.68% interest in TRG. TRG owns as its
primary  assets  interests in regional  retail  shopping  centers (the  "Taubman
Shopping  Centers" or the  "Centers").  TRG also owns  development  projects for
future regional shopping centers (the "Development  Projects") and approximately
99% of The Taubman Company Limited  Partnership (the  "Manager"),  which manages
the Taubman  Shopping  Centers and  provides  services to the  Company.  Certain
Taubman  Shopping Centers are partially owned through joint ventures (the "Joint
Ventures").  See the  table on pages 13 and 14 of this  report  for  information
regarding the Taubman Shopping Centers and TRG's interests in them.

  The Company is a real estate  investment  trust,  or REIT,  under the Internal
Revenue  Code of  1986,  as  amended  (the  "Code").  In order  to  satisfy  the
provisions of the Code  applicable to REITs,  the Company must distribute to its
shareholders  at least 95% of its REIT  taxable  income and meet  certain  other
requirements.  TRG's partnership agreement provides that TRG will distribute, at
a minimum,  sufficient  amounts to its partners such that the Company's pro rata
share will enable the Company to pay shareholder  dividends  (including  capital
gains  dividends  that may be  required  upon TRG's sale of an asset)  that will
satisfy the REIT provisions of the Code.

Recent Developments

  For a  discussion  of business  developments  that  occurred in 1996,  see the
response to Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations."

The Shopping Center Business

  There are several types of retail shopping centers,  varying primarily by size
and marketing strategy.  Retail shopping centers range from neighborhood centers
of less than 100,000 square feet of GLA to regional and super-regional  shopping
centers.  Retail  shopping  centers in excess of 400,000  square feet of GLA are
generally referred to as "regional" shopping centers, while those centers having
in  excess  of  800,000  square  feet  of  GLA  are  generally  referred  to  as
"super-regional"  shopping centers. In this annual report on Form 10-K, the term
"regional shopping centers" refers to both regional and super-regional  shopping
centers. The term "GLA" refers to gross retail space, including anchors and mall
tenant areas,  and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail  space,  excluding
anchors.  The term "anchor"  refers to a department  store or other large retail
store.  The term "mall  tenants"  refers to stores (other than anchors) that are
typically specialty retailers and lease space in shopping centers.

  Most regional shopping centers compete for consumer retail dollars by offering
fashion merchandise, hard goods, and services, generally in an enclosed, climate
controlled  environment with convenient parking.  Regional shopping centers have
differing   strategies  with  regard  to  price  levels  of  the  merchants  and
merchandise offered, from very high-end presentations,  on the one extreme, to a
strategy of leasing exclusively to outlet stores, at the other.


                                        1

<PAGE>



  Regional shopping centers usually have two or more anchors. Anchors either own
their stores, the land under them, and adjacent parking areas, or they lease the
ground or buildings  from shopping  center owners for long periods at rates that
are  substantially  lower than the rents  charged to mall  tenants.  In enclosed
regional shopping  centers,  anchors are usually located at the ends of enclosed
common area corridors.  This layout is intended to maximize  pedestrian  traffic
for the mall  tenant  stores.  Mall GLA is leased to a wide  variety  of smaller
stores.  In a regional  shopping center,  substantially all revenues are derived
from Mall GLA.

  The  anchors  and the owner of the  shopping  center  typically  enter into an
agreement  among  themselves,  generally  referred to as a  reciprocal  easement
agreement,   covering,   among  other  things,   operational  matters,   initial
construction, and future expansions.

  Mall tenants usually pay rent comprised of several elements. The first element
is a fixed base, or "minimum", rent,  often subject to increases  according to a
schedule agreed upon at the time of lease inception. In addition, this base rent
is often  supplemented by increases based upon inflation,  often tied to changes
in the Consumer Price Index.  Finally,  tenants  generally are required to pay a
percentage  of their sales in addition to these other  elements of rent,  to the
extent sales of the tenant exceed certain negotiated levels.

  Both anchors and mall tenants generally  contribute funds to pay for upkeep of
common areas,  property  taxes,  advertising,  and other  expenditures  (such as
security, utilities, and cleaning) that are related to the day-to-day operations
of the shopping center.

  As lease terms  expire,  shopping  center owners may have the  opportunity  to
change base rents,  to revise lease terms and conditions,  to relocate  existing
tenants,  to reconfigure or expand tenant spaces, and to introduce new retailers
and retail concepts to the shopping center.

  The regional  shopping  center  industry in the United States has  significant
barriers to entry. In addition,  new regional  shopping center  developments are
inhibited by several factors.  Such barriers and inhibiting  factors include the
following:

  o most major markets are already served by regional retail centers;

  o land for  suitable  sites has become more  difficult  and more  expensive to
    assemble;

  o due to growing environmental concerns and demands from local governments and
    citizen groups, zoning and environmental  approvals have become increasingly
    time consuming, expensive, and difficult to obtain;

  o many of the strong national  specialty  retailers  needed to occupy Mall GLA
    are already well represented in existing regional shopping centers; and

  o department  stores are  generally  not willing to deal with  non-established
    developers.

    While  consumers make  purchases  through a variety of retail  formats,  the
  Company  believes  that the  Taubman  Shopping  Centers,  and  other  dominant
  regional and super-regional  shopping centers,  will continue in the future to
  be an attractive shopping destination for significant numbers of consumers. By
  providing  a  convenient  shopping  environment  offering  access  to a  broad
  selection of retailers, services, and food establishments,  these centers have
  generated high levels of customer  traffic and, as a consequence,  high tenant
  sales.  The  ability  of  tenants  to achieve  higher  sales  levels  than are
  generally  achieved  at  smaller  centers  or  stand-alone  locations  in turn
  supports higher levels of rent than at less productive locations.

Business of the Company

  The Company,  as managing general partner of TRG, is engaged in the ownership,
operation,   management,  leasing,  acquisition,   development,   redevelopment,
expansion, financing, and refinancing of regional shopping centers and interests
therein.

  The Taubman Shopping Centers:

  o are strategically  located in major metropolitan  areas, many in communities
    that are among the most  affluent in the country,  including  New York City,
    Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit, Phoenix, and Washington, D.C.;

  o range in size between 438,000 and 2.3 million square feet of GLA and between
    133,000  and  971,000  square  feet of Mall GLA.  The  smallest  Center  has
    approximately 50 stores,  and the largest has  approximately  250 stores. Of
    the 21 Centers, 18 are super-regional shopping centers;

  o have  approximately   2,900  stores  operated  by  its  mall  tenants  under
    approximately 1,000 trade names;

  o have 77 anchors, operating under 18 trade names;

  o lease   approximately  79%  of  Mall  GLA  to  national  chains,   including
    subsidiaries  or  divisions of The Limited (The  Limited,  Limited  Express,
    Victoria's  Secret,  and others),  The Gap (The Gap,  Banana  Republic,  and
    others), and Woolworth Corporation  (Footlocker,  Kinney Shoes, and others);
    and

  o are among the most productive  (measured by mall tenants' average per square
    foot  sales) in the United  States.  In 1996,  mall  tenants in the  Taubman
    Shopping  Centers  portfolio  as of December 31, 1996 had average per square
    foot sales of $365, which is substantially  greater than the average for all
    regional shopping centers.

  The most  important  factor  affecting  the revenues  generated by the Taubman
Shopping  Centers is leasing to mall tenants  (primarily  specialty  retailers),
which represents over 90% of revenues.  Anchors account for  approximately 5% of
revenues  because many own their stores and, in general,  those that lease their
stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.

  TRG's  ownership  is  concentrated  in large and  highly  productive  regional
shopping  centers.  Of its 21 Centers,  15 had annual rent rolls in 1996 of over
$10  million  and 17 had  sales-per-square-foot  in excess of $300.  The Company
believes  that this level of  productivity  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers is
indicative of their strong  competitive  position and is, in  significant  part,
attributable  to TRG's business  strategy and philosophy.  The Company  believes
that large shopping centers  (including  regional and especially  super-regional
shopping centers) are the least susceptible to direct competition because (among
other  reasons)  anchors  and  large  specialty  retail  stores  do not  find it
economically  attractive to open additional stores in the immediate  vicinity of
an existing  location for fear of competing with themselves.  In addition to the
advantage  of size,  the  Company  believes  that the  Centers'  success  can be
attributed  in part to their  other  physical  characteristics,  such as design,
layout, and amenities.


                                        3

Business Strategy And Philosophy

  The Company and TRG believe that the regional  shopping center business is not
simply a real estate development  business,  but rather an operating business in
which a retailing approach to the on-going management and leasing of the Taubman
Shopping Centers is essential. Thus TRG:

  o offers a large,  diverse  selection of retail  stores in each Center to give
    customers a broad selection of consumer goods and variety of price ranges;

  o endeavors to increase  overall mall  tenants'  sales,  and thereby  increase
    achievable rents, by leasing space to a constantly  changing mix of tenants;
    and

  o seeks to anticipate trends in the retailing  industry and emphasizes ongoing
    introductions  of new retail concepts into the Centers.  Due in part to this
    strategy,  a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first
    mall stores in the Taubman Shopping Centers. TRG believes that its execution
    of this  leasing  strategy  is unique in the  industry  and is an  important
    element in building and  maintaining  customer  loyalty and increasing  mall
    productivity.


  The Taubman  Shopping  Centers  compete for retail consumer  spending  through
diverse,  in-depth  presentations  of  predominantly  fashion  merchandise in an
environment  intended  to  facilitate  customer  shopping.  While  some  Taubman
Shopping Centers include stores that target high-end,  upscale  customers,  each
Center  is  individually  merchandised  in  light  of  the  demographics  of its
potential customers within convenient driving distance.

  TRG's leasing  strategy  involves  assembling a diverse mix of mall tenants in
each of the  Taubman  Shopping  Centers in order to attract  customers,  thereby
generating  higher  sales by mall  tenants.  High sales by mall tenants make the
Taubman Shopping Centers attractive to prospective  tenants,  thereby increasing
the rental rates that prospective  tenants are willing to pay. TRG implements an
active leasing strategy to increase the Taubman Shopping  Centers'  productivity
and to set minimum rents at higher  levels.  Elements of this  strategy  include
terminating leases of under-performing  tenants,  renegotiating existing leases,
and not leasing space to  prospective  tenants that (though viable or attractive
in certain ways) would not enhance a Taubman Shopping Center's retail mix.

  TRG's  strategy  is  carried  out by the  Manager,  which  is  more  than  99%
beneficially  owned  by TRG and  which  has been  engaged  to  provide  property
management  and leasing  services for each Taubman  Shopping  Center  (including
wholly and  partially  owned  Centers)  and to provide  corporate,  development,
administrative,  and acquisition services for TRG and the Company. The Manager's
predecessor was a leading  developer and manager in the regional shopping center
business for more than 25 years.

Potential For Growth

  TRG's  strategy  is to  increase  the  amount of cash  flow.  In  addition  to
increased  cash flow through the growth in mall tenant  sales and market  rental
rates, TRG believes that its cash flow will increase over time due to expansions
of the Centers, acquisitions, and development of new centers.

Expansions of the Taubman Shopping Centers
- ------------------------------------------

  Most of the  Taubman  Shopping  Centers  have  been  designed  to  accommodate
expansions.  Expansion  projects can be as  significant  as new shopping  center
construction  in terms of scope and cost,  requiring  governmental  and existing
anchor store approvals,  design and engineering activities,  including rerouting
utilities,  providing additional parking areas or decking,  acquiring additional
land, and relocating anchors and mall tenants (all of which must take place with
a minimum of  disruption  to  existing  tenants  and  customers).  In 1996,  for
example,  Sears became the fourth anchor at Marley  Station and the fifth anchor
at Stoneridge.  Additionally,  construction is in process on expansions of three
of the Taubman Shopping Centers:

  o Westfarms -- the addition of  approximately  135,000 square feet of Mall GLA
    and Nordstrom as an anchor will open in the summer of 1997;

  o Biltmore  Fashion  Park --  over  30,000  square  feet  of new  Mall  GLA is
    scheduled to open beginning in the spring of 1997; and

  o Cherry Creek -- a newly  constructed  Lord & Taylor will open in the fall of
    1997.  Additionally,  a 132,000  square foot  expansion of the Mall GLA will
    open in the fall of 1998.

  Consolidation of department stores has also strengthened  TRG's portfolio,  as
retailers  continue to be  attracted  to TRG's  dominant  and highly  productive
locations.  Recent department store conversions  include Macy's at both Biltmore
Fashion  Park and Paseo  Nuevo,  and Lord & Taylor at both  Lakeforest  and Fair
Oaks. Also, Bloomingdale's at Beverly Center opened in March of 1997. When these
projects are  completed,  13 of TRG's 21  properties  will have  benefited  from
expansions or anchor conversions since 1995.

Acquisitions
- ------------

  In 1996, TRG completed three acquisitions  totaling over $150 million. TRG has
completed approximately $400 million of acquisitions in the four years since the
Company has been public.

  In  December  1996,  TRG  acquired  La Cumbre  Plaza (La  Cumbre),  a regional
shopping  center located 3.5 miles north of downtown Santa Barbara,  California.
The 478,000 square foot open-air Center is anchored by Robinsons-May  and Sears.
In June 1996, TRG acquired Paseo Nuevo,  a regional  shopping  center located in
downtown Santa Barbara.  The 438,000 square foot open-air  Center is anchored by
Macy's and Nordstrom.  Together,  La Cumbre and Paseo Nuevo dominate an affluent
market that stretches 60 miles along the California coastline.

  Additionally,  in July 1996, TRG completed  transactions  that resulted in the
acquisition  of the 75% interest in Fairlane  Town Center  previously  held by a
Joint Venture Partner.  In connection with the transaction,  TRG issued units of
partnership interest to the former Joint Venture Partner.

  See "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results
of Operations -- Results of Operations -- Acquisitions and Disposition" and Note
3 to the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  of TRG for further  discussion of
these acquisitions.

  The Company and TRG believe  that TRG will have  additional  opportunities  to
acquire regional shopping centers,  or interests therein,  and will have certain
advantages in doing so.

  o First, the management  expertise of the Manager will enhance the leasing and
    operation of newly acquired  regional  shopping  centers.  If  opportunities
    exist to expand,  remodel, or re-merchandise the center through new leasing,
    the  Manager's  expertise  will assist TRG in making an informed  and timely
    evaluation  of  the  economic  consequences  of  such  activities  prior  to
    acquisition, as well as facilitate implementation of such activities.


                                        5

<PAGE>



  o Second,  a center  can be  acquired  for any  combination  of cash or equity
    interests in TRG or (subject to certain  limitations) the Company,  possibly
    creating the opportunity  for  tax-advantaged  transactions  for the seller,
    thereby  reducing the price that might  otherwise  have to be paid in an all
    cash transaction or making an opportunity available that would not otherwise
    exist. TRG is able to offer partnership  interests in itself in exchange for
    shopping center  interests,  allowing  sellers to diversify their interests,
    attain  liquidity not otherwise  available,  possibly defer taxes that might
    otherwise be due if the  interests  were instead sold for cash,  maintain an
    investment in the regional  shopping center  business,  and resolve concerns
    sellers  otherwise may have regarding future management of their properties.
    For  instance,  Biltmore  Fashion  Park's  selling  group  included  private
    investors who found it tax efficient to accept TRG partnership units as part
    of the consideration when TRG acquired the Center in 1994.

Development of New Centers
- --------------------------

  The Company  believes that TRG has attractive  development  opportunities  and
intends to continue  to pursue an active  program of  regional  shopping  center
development.  The  Company  believes  that TRG has the  expertise,  through  the
Manager,  to develop  economically  attractive regional shopping centers through
intensive analysis of local retail opportunities, and that its expertise in this
regard is more important than macroeconomic  conditions in determining the scope
and number of opportunities available to it.

  Development  of new Taubman  Shopping  Centers is expected to be an  important
source of growth in revenues and operating income before interest,  depreciation
and amortization.  In 1996, two projects moved forward from the  pre-development
phase. Construction began on Arizona Mills in Tempe, Arizona (20 miles southwest
of downtown Phoenix) with the August 1996  groundbreaking.  Arizona Mills, a 1.2
million square foot value-oriented mall, will open in November 1997. The project
is a  joint  venture  in  which  TRG  has  a  37%  interest.  In  January  1996,
groundbreaking  ceremonies were held for MacArthur  Center,  a new center being
developed  by TRG in Norfolk,  Virginia,  which is expected to total 1.1 million
square feet. The  three-level  center,  scheduled to open in the spring of 1999,
will  initially  be  anchored  by  Nordstrom  and  Virginia's   first  Dillard's
Department  Store.  The  project  is a  joint  venture  in  which  TRG has a 70%
interest.  Construction also continued on The Mall at Tuttle Crossing (northwest
Columbus,  Ohio),  which will open in July 1997.  Sears,  JCPenney,  Lazarus and
Marshall Field's will anchor this new 980,000 square foot center.

  TRG's  policies with respect to  development  activities are designed to limit
the risks otherwise associated with development.  For instance, TRG entered into
an agreement to lease  Memorial City Mall, a center  adjacent to one of the most
affluent  residential  areas in  Houston,  Texas,  while  TRG  investigates  the
redevelopment  opportunities  of the center (see  "Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis of Financial  Condition  and Results of  Operations  --  Liquidity  and
Capital   Resources  --  Capital   Spending"  for  further   discussion  of  the
transaction).  Also,  TRG generally does not intend to acquire land early in the
development  process, but will instead generally acquire options on land or form
partnerships with landholders holding potentially  attractive development sites,
typically exercising options only once it is prepared to begin construction.  In
addition, TRG does not intend to begin construction until a sufficient number of
anchor  stores have agreed to operate in the shopping  center,  such that TRG is
confident  that the  projected  sales and rents from Mall GLA are  sufficient to
earn a return on  invested  capital in excess of TRG's cost of  capital.  Having
historically followed these two principles, TRG's experience indicates that less
than 20% of the costs of the  development of a regional  shopping center will be
incurred prior to the construction  period;  however,  no assurance can be given
that TRG will continue to be able to so minimize pre-construction costs.

  While the Company  anticipates that TRG will continue to evaluate  development
projects  using  criteria,  including  financial  criteria  for rates of return,
similar  to those  employed  in the past,  no  assurances  can be given that the
adherence to these policies will produce  comparable  results in the future.  In
addition,  the  costs of  shopping  center  development  opportunities  that are
explored but  ultimately  abandoned  will, to some extent,  diminish the overall
return on development projects.

Major Tenants

  The combined  operations of The Limited,  Inc. accounted for approximately 11%
of leased Mall GLA as of December 31, 1996 and for approximately 10% of the 1996
base rent.  The largest of these,  in terms of square  footage and rent,  is The
Limited, which accounted for approximately 2.5% of leased Mall GLA and 1996 base
rent. No other single retail  company  accounted for more than 4% of leased Mall
GLA or more than 5% of the 1996 base rent.

Lease Expirations

  The following table shows lease expirations (based on information available as

(1)  Excludes leases that expire in 1997 for which renewal leases or leases with
     replacement tenants have been executed as of December 31, 1996.
</TABLE>

  The Company  believes that the  information  in the table is not indicative of
what will  occur in the  future  because of  several  factors,  but  principally
because TRG's leasing policies and practices create a significant level of early
lease  terminations at the Taubman Shopping  Centers.  For example,  the average
remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the period 1991 to 1996
was  approximately  1.9 years. The average term of leases signed during 1995 and
1996 was approximately 7.4 years.

  In addition,  mall tenants at Taubman Shopping Centers may seek the protection
of the bankruptcy  laws,  which could result in the termination of such tenants'
leases and thus cause a  reduction  in the cash flow  generated  by the  Taubman
Shopping Centers. Prior to 1992, such bankruptcies had not affected more than 3%
of leases in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers in any one calendar  year.  In 1996,
approximately  2.8% of leases were so affected compared to 3.2% in 1995, 3.1% in
1994, 4.0% in 1993 and 4.5% in 1992. Since 1991, the annual provision for losses
on accounts receivable has been less than 2% of TRG's annual revenues.

Occupancy

  Average Mall GLA occupancy rates of the Taubman  Shopping Centers for the last
five years are as follows:

                 Year                  Average Mall GLA Occupancy
                 ----                  --------------------------
                 1992                             88.1%
                 1993                             86.5%
                 1994                             86.6%
                 1995                             88.0%
                 1996                             87.4%

  Historically,  average  annual  occupancy for TRG as a whole has been within a
narrow band. In the last ten years,  average annual occupancy has ranged between
86.5% and 88.8%.

Rental Rates

  As leases have expired in the Taubman Shopping Centers, TRG has generally been
able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant,
at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of
increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations
of future growth become more optimistic. In periods of declining sales, rents on
new  leases  will grow more  slowly or will  decline  for the  opposite  reason.
However,  Center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are
terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates
that are  usually  higher  than the  average  rates  for  existing  leases.  The
following  table  contains  certain  information  regarding per square foot base
rent,  excluding renewals,  at Taubman Shopping Centers that have been owned and
open for five years.

(2)  Includes 17 centers owned and open prior to January 1, 1990.
(3)  Includes 18 centers owned and open prior to January 1, 1991.

  TRG anticipates  that the spread between opening and closing rents will narrow
in 1997.  This  statistic is difficult to predict in part because  TRG's leasing
policies  and  practices  may result in early  lease  terminations  with  actual
average  closing  rents which may vary from the average  rent per square foot of
scheduled lease expirations. In addition, the opening or closing of large tenant
spaces,  which  generally  pay a lower rent per square foot,  can  significantly
change the spread in a given year. The spread between  opening and closing store
rents narrowed in 1993,  principally  due to the timing of openings and closings
of certain large tenants.

  Although  during the past eight years  department  store  companies  owning 18
anchors at 11 Centers have filed for bankruptcy,  none of the anchors at Taubman
Shopping Centers are now owned by companies in bankruptcy.  Of those 18 anchors,
12  are  now  owned  and  operated  by   Federated   Department   Stores,   Inc.
("Federated").  Federated  closed  the  Emporium  at  Hilltop  in  1996.  TRG is
considering alternate uses of the anchor space. Two other anchor stores formerly
owned by Woodward & Lothrop  Incorporated  were  acquired by the May  Department
Stores Company ("May Company"). After remodeling,  these stores, which closed in
November  1995,  reopened in 1996 as Lord & Taylor  stores (an  existing  Lord &
Taylor  store at one of these  Centers has  closed,  and May Company and TRG are
considering  various  options  for the  store).  The  former  sites of two other
anchors, B. Altman and Bonwit Teller, are part of the completed expansion of The
Mall at Short Hills, which added  approximately  100,000 square feet of Mall GLA
and three anchors:  Nordstrom;  Neiman Marcus; and Saks Fifth Avenue. The former
site of another  anchor  (Sage-Allen  at Westfarms)  opened as a Filene's  Men's
Store/Furniture Gallery in 1995.

Environmental Matters

  All of the Taubman  Shopping  Centers  presently  owned by TRG (not  including
option  interests in the Development  Projects or any of the real estate managed
by the  Manager  but not  included  in TRG's  portfolio)  have been  subject  to
environmental  assessments.  The Company,  TRG, and the Manager are not aware of
any  environmental  liability  relating to the Taubman  Shopping  Centers or any
other  property  in which they have or had an  interest  (whether as an owner or
operator) that the Company  believes would have a material adverse effect on the
Company's  business,  assets,  or results of  operations.  No assurances  can be
given, however, that all environmental  liabilities have been identified or that
no prior  owner,  operator,  or current  occupant  has created an  environmental
condition not known to the Company, TRG, or the Manager. Moreover, no assurances
can be given that (i) future laws,  ordinances,  or regulations  will not impose
any  material  environmental  liability  or that (ii) the current  environmental
condition  of the Taubman  Shopping  Centers will not be affected by tenants and
occupants of the Taubman Shopping Centers, by the condition of properties in the
vicinity of the Taubman  Shopping  Centers (such as the presence of  underground
storage  tanks),  or by third  parties  unrelated to TRG,  the  Company,  or the
Manager.

  With respect to the matters described below, while there can be no assurances,
the Company  believes that such matters will not have a material  adverse effect
on the Company's business, assets, or results of operations.

  Hilltop  is  located in a region in  Richmond,  California  that has been used
extensively to store various petroleum  products.  Three petroleum storage tanks
were previously  located on Hilltop's site. In connection with the  construction
of Hilltop,  numerous  borings and drillings were conducted,  and no evidence of
petroleum  discharges  was  identified.  In  addition,   extensive  grading  and
excavation were performed  during such  construction,  and no material  residual
contamination  from the storage tanks was noted. The Company is not aware of any
environmental  liability  associated  with the storage  tanks that were formerly
located on the Hilltop site.

  Beverly  Center is located over an oil field and several  abandoned oil wells,
and is adjacent to an active oil production  facility that operates numerous oil
and gas wells.  In the Los  Angeles  basin,  where  Beverly  Center is  located,
pockets of methane gas may be found in oil fields;  however,  elevated levels of
methane have not been detected at Beverly Center.

  Cherry  Creek is situated  on land that was used as a landfill  prior to 1950.
Because  of the past use of the site as a  landfill,  the site is  listed on the
United  States   Environmental   Protection   Agency's   ("EPA")   Comprehensive
Environmental  Response,  Compensation  and Liability  Information  System list.
Various  soil and  groundwater  samples  have been  taken on and near the Cherry
Creek site since 1979. In addition, in 1991 and 1992, as part of a review of all
former  landfill sites in the Denver area,  including the Cherry Creek site, the
EPA and the Colorado  Department  of Health  completed a series of  groundwater,
soil,  and surface  water tests around the border of the Cherry Creek  property.
Although a single sample taken in 1988 found  elevated  levels of cadmium in the
groundwater at Cherry Creek, and groundwater  samples taken in connection with a
former gasoline station on the property indicate elevated levels of benzene,  no
other samples taken have  indicated  any levels of  contamination  that exceeded
applicable  environmental  standards.  In  addition,  the results of the samples
taken by the EPA and the Colorado  Department of Health  indicate no evidence of
contamination.

  Paseo  Nuevo is  located  in an area of  known  groundwater  contamination  by
tetrachloroethylene  ("PCE"). The groundwater under and around the site has been
monitored for six years before, during, and after construction of the center. No
on-site sources of PCE were identified during  construction.  The Regional Water
Quality Control Board has given approval to discontinue the monitoring  program,
because the PCE levels remained relatively constant over the six-year period and
do not exceed the state standard for PCE in drinking water.

  There  are  asbestos  containing  materials  ("ACMs")  at most of the  Taubman
Shopping  Centers,  primarily  in the form of floor  tiles,  roof  coatings  and
mastics.  The floor  tiles,  roof  coatings  and mastics are  generally  in good
condition.  Fire-proofing material containing asbestos is present at some of the
Taubman  Shopping  Centers in limited  concentrations  or in limited areas.  The
Manager has developed and is implementing an operations and maintenance  program
that details  operating  procedures with respect to ACMs prior to any renovation
and that requires  periodic  inspection  for any change in condition of existing
ACMs.

Personnel

  The Company has engaged the Manager to provide certain management, accounting,
and other administrative services to the Company. TRG has engaged the Manager to
provide all real estate management, acquisition, development, and administrative
services required by (or of) TRG or any of its properties.

  As of  December  31,  1996,  the  Manager  had 410  full-time  employees.  The
following  table  provides a breakdown of employees by  operational  areas as of
December 31, 1996:

Item 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------------------------------

  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Selected Financial
Data, the Financial  Statements of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. and the Notes thereto
and the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements of The Taubman Realty Group Limited
Partnership and the Notes thereto.

General Background and Performance Measurement

  The Company,  through its interest in and as managing  general partner of TRG,
participates in TRG's Managed Businesses.  TRG's Managed Businesses include: (i)
wholly owned Taubman Shopping Centers,  development projects for future regional
shopping  centers  (Development   Projects)  and  The  Taubman  Company  Limited
Partnership (the Manager), (collectively, the Consolidated Businesses); and (ii)
Taubman  Shopping   Centers   partially  owned  through  joint  ventures  (Joint
Ventures).

  TRG consolidates the wholly owned Taubman  Shopping  Centers,  the Development
Projects, and the Manager. The Joint Ventures are accounted for under the equity
method in TRG's Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Certain  aspects  of  the  performance  of the  Managed  Businesses  are  best
understood by measuring  their  performance as a whole,  without regard to TRG's
ownership interest. For example, mall tenant sales and shopping center occupancy
trends fit this  category  and are so analyzed  below.  In  addition,  trends in
certain  items of revenue  and  expense  are often best  understood  in the same
fashion, and the discussions following take this approach when appropriate. When
relevant,  these  items  are  also  discussed  separately  with  regard  to  the
Consolidated Businesses and the Joint Ventures.

Mall Tenant Sales and Center Revenues

  Over  the long  term,  the  level of mall  tenant  sales  is the  single  most
important  determinant of revenues of the Taubman  Shopping Centers because mall
tenants  provide  over 90% of these  revenues  and  because  mall  tenant  sales
determine  the  amount  of  rent,  percentage  rent,  and  recoverable  expenses
(together,  total occupancy costs) that mall tenants can afford to pay. However,
levels of mall tenant sales can be  considerably  more volatile in the short run
than total occupancy costs.

  The Company  believes that the ability of tenants to pay  occupancy  costs and
earn  profits  over long  periods of time  increases  as sales per  square  foot
increase, whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending. Because
most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses, the occupancy costs that they can
afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher
sales per square foot.

  The following table summarizes occupancy costs, excluding utilities,  for mall
tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales.

                                         1994          1995          1996

Occupancy

  Historically,  average  annual  occupancy for TRG as a whole has been within a
narrow band. In the last ten years,  average annual occupancy has ranged between
86.5% and 88.8%.

Rental Rates

  As leases have expired in the Taubman Shopping Centers, TRG has generally been
able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant,
at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. In a period of
increasing sales, rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants' expectations
of future  growth  become  more  optimistic.  In  periods  of  slower  growth or
declining  sales,  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for
the opposite reason.  However,  Center revenues  nevertheless  increase as older
leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated
at current  rental  rates that are usually  higher  than the  average  rates for
existing leases. The following table contains certain information  regarding per
square foot base rent, excluding renewals, at Taubman Shopping Centers that have
been owned and open for five years.

1994 (1)                     $34.72       $30.46        $41.02        $10.56

1996 (2)                     $37.90       $33.39        $42.39        $ 9.00

(1)  Includes 17 centers owned and open prior to January 1, 1990.
(2)  Includes 18 centers owned and open prior to January 1, 1991.

  TRG anticipates  that the spread between opening and closing rents will narrow
in 1997.  This  statistic is difficult to predict in part because  TRG's leasing
policies  and  practices  may result in early  lease  terminations  with  actual
average  closing  rents which may vary from the average  rent per square foot of
scheduled lease expirations. In addition, the opening or closing of large tenant
spaces,  which  generally  pay a lower rent per square foot,  can  significantly
change the spread in a given year.

Seasonality

  The regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature,  with mall tenant
sales  highest in the  fourth  quarter  due to the  Christmas  season,  and with
lesser, though still significant,  sales fluctuations associated with the Easter
holiday and  back-to-school  events.  While  minimum  rents and  recoveries  are
generally not subject to seasonal  factors,  most leases are scheduled to expire
in the first quarter,  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of
the year in anticipation of the Christmas selling season. Accordingly,  revenues
and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter.


                                       21

  The following  table  summarizes  certain  quarterly  operating data for TRG's
Managed Businesses for 1996:

  Because the  seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of
minimum rents and  recoveries,  mall tenant  occupancy costs (the sum of minimum
rents,   percentage  rents  and  expense  recoveries)   relative  to  sales  are
considerably  higher in the first  three  quarters  than they are in the  fourth
quarter.  The following table summarizes  occupancy costs,  excluding utilities,
for mall tenants as a percentage of sales for each quarter of 1996:

Results of Operations

Equity Transactions

  In December  1996,  the  Company  purchased  3,048  newly  issued TRG units of
partnership  interest with the $75 million proceeds from the Company's  December
1996 offering of 5.97 million  shares of common stock.  TRG bore all expenses of
the  Company's  offering  which have been  accounted  for as a reduction  of the
proceeds  from TRG's  issuance of units.  TRG used the net  proceeds to pay down
short term floating  rate debt and to acquire La Cumbre Plaza (see below).  Also
in  December  1996,  the  Company  exchanged  common  shares  for TRG  units  of
partnership   interest   newly  issued  under  TRG's   incentive   option  plan.
Additionally  in 1996,  TRG  issued  3,096  units  of  partnership  interest  in
connection  with the  acquisition  of the  remaining  interest in Fairlane  Town
Center (see below). As a result of these transactions,  at December 31, 1996 the
Company had 50.7 million shares of common stock  outstanding  and TRG had 69,998
units of partnership interest outstanding, of which the Company owned 36.68%.

Acquisitions and Disposition

  The  following  discussion  of  TRG's  acquisitions  contains  forward-looking
statements  regarding  the  impact of these  acquisitions  on EBITDA  (EBITDA is
defined and described in Liquidity and Capital Resources -- Distributions).  The
actual  impact  may  vary  based  on a  variety  of  factors,  including  actual
occupancy,  rents achieved and operating expenses of the Centers.  See Note 3 to
TRG's   consolidated   financial   statements  for  further  discussion  of  the
acquisitions.

Acquisition of La Cumbre Plaza
- ------------------------------

  In December 1996,  TRG acquired a 100%  leasehold  interest in La Cumbre Plaza
(La Cumbre) located in Santa Barbara, California for $22.25 million in cash. The
acquisition  was  funded  with  proceeds  from  an  issuance  of  TRG  units  of
partnership  interest (see Equity Transactions  above). The operating results of
La  Cumbre  have  been  consolidated  in  TRG's  financial  statements  from the
acquisition  date.  The  acquisition  had an immaterial  effect on net income in
1996.  The  acquisition  is expected to add EBITDA in excess of $2.8  million in
1997.

- ---------------------------------------------------------

  In July 1996, TRG completed  transactions  that resulted in the acquisition of
the 75% interest in Fairlane Town Center  (Fairlane)  previously held by a Joint
Venture Partner.  In connection with the  transaction,  TRG issued to the former
Joint Venture  Partner 3,096 units of  partnership  interest,  exchangeable  for
approximately  6.1 million  shares of the Company's  common  stock,  which had a
closing  price of $10.75 per share on the day prior to the  issuance  date.  TRG
also assumed mortgage debt of approximately $26 million, representing the former
Joint  Venture  Partner's  beneficial  interest  in the $34.6  million  mortgage
encumbering  the property.  TRG used unsecured debt to fund the repayment of the
9.73% mortgage and the prepayment  penalty of  approximately  $1.2 million.  The
operating  results  of  Fairlane  have  been  consolidated  in  TRG's  financial
statements  from the acquisition  date.  Prior to the  acquisition  date,  TRG's
interest  in  Fairlane  was  accounted  for under the  equity  method as a Joint
Venture.  The acquisition is expected to  incrementally  add  approximately  $11
million to EBITDA over the twelve months following the purchase date.

Acquisition of Paseo Nuevo
- --------------------------

  In June 1996, TRG acquired a 100% leasehold  interest in Paseo Nuevo,  located
in Santa  Barbara,  California,  for $37 million in cash. TRG borrowed under its
existing lines of credit to fund the acquisition. The operating results of Paseo
Nuevo have been consolidated in TRG's financial  statements from the acquisition
date.  The  acquisition  had an  immaterial  effect on net  income in 1996.  The
acquisition  is  expected  to produce  EBITDA of over $3.7  million in its first
twelve months following the purchase date.

Disposition of Bellevue Center
- ------------------------------

  In  December  1995,  the bank  group  holding  the $99.5  million  nonrecourse
mortgage  encumbering  Bellevue  Center  acquired  title to the Center through a
nonjudicial  foreclosure  sale.  The mortgage  matured on November 1, 1995.  TRG
ceased to recognize  the results of Bellevue  Associates  (Bellevue),  TRG's 60%
owned Joint Venture that owned the Center,  as of November 1, 1995.  TRG's share
of Bellevue's net loss from operations for 1994 and the ten months ended October
31, 1995, was $1.1 million and $0.7 million,  respectively.  The Company's share
of the net loss was $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively.

  In  1995,  TRG  recognized  an  extraordinary  gain of  $18.9  million  on the
extinguishment  of debt and an ordinary gain of $5.0 million on the  disposition
of the Center,  which was based on the  carrying  value of TRG's  investment  in
Bellevue.  The Company's share of these gains was $6.6 million and $1.8 million,
respectively.

  Bellevue's  operations,  which included the effect of the below current market
mortgage  interest rate of 5.91%,  contributed  in 1994 and the ten months ended
October 31, 1995, $1.4 million and $1.1 million,  respectively, to Distributable
Cash  Flow  and  for  these  same  periods,   $0.5  million  and  $0.4  million,
respectively,  to Funds from Operations  (Distributable Cash Flow and Funds from
Operations  are defined and  discussed  in  Liquidity  and Capital  Resources --
Distributions).

Memorial City Mall Lease

  In November  1996,  TRG entered into an agreement to lease  Memorial City Mall
(Memorial  City), a 1.4 million square foot shopping  center located in Houston,
Texas. The lease of this unencumbered property grants TRG the exclusive right to
manage,  lease and operate the  property.  TRG has the option to  terminate  the
lease  after the third full lease year by paying $2 million to the  lessor.  TRG
will use this option period to evaluate the  redevelopment  opportunities of the
Center.  As a  development  project,  Memorial  City has been  excluded from all
operating  statistics in this report,  and Memorial City's results of operations
have been  presented as a net line item in the following  tabular  comparison of
TRG's 1996 results of operations to the prior year. Memorial City is expected to
have an immaterial effect on EBITDA and net income during the option period.

Comparison of Fiscal Year 1996 to Fiscal Year 1995

Taubman Centers, Inc.

  The  Company  is the  managing  general  partner  of TRG and  shares  in TRG's
financial  performance to the extent of its ownership  percentage.  During 1996,
the Company's ownership of TRG changed as a result of several  transactions (see
Equity  Transactions  above). The Company's average ownership  percentage of TRG
was 34.5% for 1996 and 35.1% for  1995.  The  Company's  ownership  in TRG as of
December  31, 1996 was 36.68%.  As of December  31,  1996,  the Company had 50.7
million shares outstanding, up from 44.1 million at December 31, 1995.

  Equity in income of TRG consists of the Company's $29.1 million  proportionate
share of TRG's income before  extraordinary items for 1996 and $28.0 million for
1995.  These  amounts  were  reduced by $7.6 million in 1996 and $8.1 million in
1995,  representing  adjustments arising from the Company's  additional basis in
TRG's net assets.  Equity in income of TRG for 1995 includes a $1.8 million gain
related to the disposition of Bellevue Center (see  Acquisitions and Disposition
above).  Income before  extraordinary  items for 1996 was $20.7 million or $0.47
per share as compared to $19.3 million or $0.44 per share in 1995.

  The  Company  recognized  an  extraordinary  item of $(0.4)  million  in 1996,
consisting   of  its  share  of  TRG's   extraordinary   item   related  to  the
extinguishment of debt. In 1995, the Company recognized  extraordinary  items of
$5.8 million consisting of its share of TRG's extraordinary items related to the
disposition of Bellevue  Center (see  Acquisitions  and  Disposition  above) and
other extinguishment of debt. Net income for 1996 was $20.3 million or $0.46 per
share compared to $25.1 million or $0.57 per share in 1995.

TRG

Occupancy and Mall Tenant Sales

  Average  occupancy  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers was 87.4% in 1996 versus
88.0% in 1995. Ending occupancy for the Taubman Shopping Centers at December 31,
1996 was 88.0% versus  89.4% at December 31, 1995.  Leased space at December 31,
1996 was 89.0% compared to 90.6% at the same date in 1995. Average occupancy for
1996 was somewhat  less than the previous  year's level but  comfortably  within
TRG's historic range of average annual  occupancy.  TRG expects that it will not
achieve year over year increases in average  occupancy before the fourth quarter
of 1997.

  Total sales for Taubman Shopping Center mall tenants increased in 1996 by 3.2%
to $2.83  billion  from $2.74  billion  in 1995.  Tenant  sales per square  foot
increased  by 5.2% to $365 in 1996 from $346 in 1995.  Sales per square  foot in
1995 was $352, excluding Bellevue. Mall tenant sales for Centers that were owned
and open for all of 1996 and 1995 (which excludes Paseo Nuevo and Bellevue) were
$2.81  billion,  a 3.9%  increase  over 1995.  Sales  statistics  for the fourth
quarter  of 1996  were  negatively  affected  by new  competition  near  certain
Centers.  TRG expects that the effect of the  competition on sales will moderate
after the anniversary date of the opening of the competing centers.

  Occupancy  and mall  tenant  sales  statistics  for 1996,  other  than  ending
occupancy and leased space, do not include La Cumbre.

TRG --Consolidated Businesses
- -----------------------------

  Total revenues for 1996 were $260.9 million, a $32.0 million or 14.0% increase
from 1995. Minimum rents for 1996 increased $18.8 million, of which $8.7 million
was caused by the Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo acquisitions. The results of Fairlane
have been  consolidated  in TRG's  results  subsequent to the  acquisition  date
(prior to that date  Fairlane  was  accounted  for under the equity  method as a
Joint Venture). Minimum rent also increased due to the expansions at Short Hills
and Meadowood and tenant rollovers.  The increase in expense recoveries was also
primarily  due to the Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo  acquisitions  and  recoveries of
increased  maintenance  costs and property taxes. The increase in other revenues
of $3.0 million was  primarily  due to  increases  in revenue  from  management,
leasing, and development services, rental fees on exterior advertising signs and
gains on sales of  peripheral  land,  partially  offset by a  decrease  in lease
cancellation revenue.

  Total operating  costs  increased $22.1 million,  or 10.7%, to $229.2 million.
The  increase in  recoverable  expenses  for 1996 was due to Fairlane  and Paseo
Nuevo and to increases in maintenance costs and property taxes,  including those
related to the expansion at Short Hills.  Other operating expenses increased due
to Fairlane and Paseo  Nuevo,  and an increase in the charge to  operations  for
development  pre-construction  reserves.  General  and  administrative  expenses
increased  $2.0 million due  primarily to increases in  compensation,  including
costs of the new long-term  performance  compensation plan and the allocation of
internal  acquisition costs,  travel, and professional fees in 1996, offset by a
decrease  resulting  from a $0.8  million  charge  in  1995  for  severance  and
termination  benefits.  Interest expense increased $4.7 million due primarily to
an increase in debt levels,  including  debt used to finance the  acquisition of
Paseo Nuevo and capital  expenditures and the assumption of debt relating to the
Fairlane acquisition,  and a decrease in capitalized interest,  partially offset
by decreased  interest rates.  The increase in depreciation and amortization was
due primarily to the acquisitions of Fairlane and Paseo Nuevo and the expansions
at Short Hills and Meadowood.

  Revenues  and expenses as  presented  in the  preceding  table differ from the
amounts  shown  in  TRG's   consolidated   income   statements  by  the  amounts
representing  Memorial City's revenues and expenses,  which are presented in the
preceding table as a net amount.

Joint Ventures
- --------------

  Total revenues for 1996 were $265.3 million,  a $25.8 million or 8.9% decrease
from 1995, primarily  representing a $23.8 million decrease caused by the change
in Fairlane from a Joint Venture to a Consolidated  Business and by the November
1995  disposition  of  Bellevue.  Minimum  rent  decreases  due to Fairlane  and
Bellevue  were offset by increases  due to the expansion at Woodfield and tenant
rollovers.  Expense recoveries decreased primarily due to Fairlane and Bellevue,
offset by increases at other  Centers.  Other income  decreased due to a gain on
the sale of  peripheral  land in 1995 and  decreased  interest  income  in 1996,
offset by an increase in lease cancellation revenue in 1996.

  Total operating  costs decreased by $12.7 million,  or 6.9%, to $171.1 million
for 1996,  representing  a $19.9 million  decrease due to Fairlane and Bellevue,
offset by  increases  at other  Centers.  Recoverable  expenses  decreased  $6.4
million due to Fairlane and Bellevue,  offset by increases in maintenance  costs
and property taxes.  Other  operating  costs  increased $0.5 million  reflecting
increases in property  management  costs,  promotion and advertising  costs, bad
debt expense and a nonrecurring  $0.5 million payment to an anchor at one of the
Centers,  offset by decreases  due to Bellevue and  Fairlane.  Interest  expense
decreased  $5.1  million  due to a  decrease  in debt  related to  Fairlane  and
Bellevue and an increase in capitalized interest,  partially offset by increases
due to an increase in debt used to finance  capital  expenditures  and to higher
interest rates on certain debt refinanced in 1995.  Operating costs as presented
in the preceding table differ from the amounts shown in the combined, summarized
financial  statements  of the  unconsolidated  Joint  Ventures  (Note 4 to TRG's
financial statements) by the amount of intercompany profit.

<PAGE>



  As a result of the foregoing,  income before  extraordinary items of the Joint
Ventures was $94.3 million in 1996, a decrease of 12.1% from 1995.  TRG's equity
in income  before  extraordinary  items of the  Joint  Ventures  decreased  $5.7
million, or 9.8%, to $52.2 million for 1996.

Net Income
- ----------

  As a  result  of  the  foregoing,  TRG's  income  before  extraordinary  items
increased by $4.4 million,  or 5.5%,  to $84.1  million for 1996.  In 1996,  TRG
recognized a $(1.3)  million  extraordinary  charge related to the prepayment of
Fairlane's  debt. In 1995,  TRG recognized an $18.9 million  extraordinary  gain
related to the  disposition  of  Bellevue  and $(2.2)  million in  extraordinary
charges  related  to the  prepayment  of  debt  at TRG  and at one of its  Joint
Ventures.  Net income for 1996 was $82.8  million,  compared to $96.3 million in
1995.

Comparison of Fiscal Year 1995 to Fiscal Year 1994

Taubman Centers, Inc.

  The acquisition of Biltmore Fashion Park (Biltmore) in December 1994, resulted
in the Company's ownership percentage of TRG changing from 35.97% to 35.10% (see
TRG -- Consolidated Businesses below).

  Equity in income of TRG consists of the Company's $28.0 million  proportionate
share of TRG's income before  extraordinary items for 1995 and $26.0 million for
1994.  These  amounts  were  reduced by $8.1 million in 1995 and $8.3 million in
1994,  representing  adjustments arising from the Company's  additional basis in
TRG's net assets.  Equity in income of TRG for 1995 includes a $1.8 million gain
related to the disposition of Bellevue.  Income before  extraordinary  items for
1995 was $19.3  million or $0.44 per share as compared to $17.0 million or $0.38
per share in 1994.

  The Company recognized extraordinary items of $5.8 million in 1995, consisting
of its share of TRG's extraordinary items related to the disposition of Bellevue
and other extinguishment of debt. In 1994, the Company recognized  extraordinary
charges  of  $(16.1)   million,   representing  the  Company's  share  of  TRG's
extraordinary charges related to the extinguishment of debt. Net income for 1995
was $25.1  million or $0.57 per share  compared  to $927  thousand  or $0.02 per
share in 1994.

TRG

Occupancy and Mall Tenant Sales

  Average  occupancy  in the Taubman  Shopping  Centers was 88.0% in 1995 versus
86.6% in 1994. Ending occupancy for the Taubman Shopping Centers at December 31,
1995 was 89.4% versus  89.3% at December 31, 1994.  Leased space at December 31,
1995 was 90.6% compared to 90.9% at the same date in 1994.

  Occupancy rates increased in part due to a change in the method of calculating
occupancy  statistics to be consistent  with  International  Council of Shopping
Centers guidelines. The change increased reported average occupancy for the year
by  approximately  one percent.  The acquisition of Biltmore also contributed to
the increases.

  Total sales for Taubman  Shopping  Centers mall  tenants  increased in 1995 by
6.9% to $2.74 billion from $2.56  billion in 1994.  Tenant sales per square foot
increased  by 3.3% to $346 in 1995 from $335 in 1994.  Tenant  sales per  square
foot reached  $352 in 1995,  excluding  Bellevue.  Mall tenant sales for Centers
that were owned and open for all of 1995 and 1994 (which  excludes  Bellevue and
Biltmore) were $2.61 billion, a 4.0% increase over 1994.

TRG --Consolidated Businesses
- -----------------------------

  In December 1994, TRG acquired Biltmore, a regional shopping center located in
Phoenix,  Arizona,  for $81.5 million in cash and 1,540 TRG units of partnership
interest  (exchangeable for approximately  three million shares of the Company's
common  stock).  TRG  borrowed  $81.5  million  to fund the cash  portion of the
purchase  price.  The operating  results of Biltmore have been  consolidated  in
TRG's financial  statements  from the  acquisition  date. The acquisition had an
immaterial effect on net income in 1994 and 1995.

  Total revenues for 1995 were $228.9 million, a $31.8 million or 16.1% increase
from 1994,  of which $13.7  million was due to Biltmore.  Minimum rents for 1995
increased   $19.1   million,   of  which  $7.8  million  was  due  to  Biltmore.
Additionally,  minimum  rents  increased  because  of tenant  rollovers  and the
expansion at Short Hills.  The increase in percentage  rent was due primarily to
Biltmore.  The increase in expense  recoveries was caused by higher  recoverable
expenses  and  Biltmore.   Other  income   increased   primarily  due  to  lease
cancellation income, interest income, and insurance recoveries.

  Total  operating  costs increased by $30.9 million or 17.5%, to $207.1 million
for 1995,  of which  $4.7  million  was due to  Biltmore's  operating  expenses,
excluding interest and depreciation and amortization.  The $4.5 million increase
in recoverable  expenses for 1995 was primarily due to Biltmore and increases in
property  taxes and  maintenance  costs.  General  and  administrative  expenses
increased by $1.9 million,  primarily due to a $0.8 million charge for severance
and  termination  benefits and increases in  professional  fees and office rent.
Interest  expense  for 1995  increased  by  $18.1  million  primarily  due to an
increase  in debt  levels,  including  debt used to finance the  acquisition  of
Biltmore  and  capital  expenditures,   and  to  increases  in  interest  rates.
Depreciation and amortization  also increased,  primarily due to the acquisition
of Biltmore and the expansion at Short Hills.

Joint Ventures
- --------------

  Total revenues for 1995 were $291.1 million,  a $22.3 million or 8.3% increase
from  1994,  of  which  $8.3  million  was due to a gain on the  disposition  of
Bellevue.  The increase in minimum rents was caused by tenant  rollovers and the
expansions  at  Woodfield  and Cherry  Creek,  offset by an  approximately  $1.4
million decrease due to Bellevue.  The increase in expense recoveries was due to
the increase in recoverable  expenses.  Other income increased  primarily due to
lease cancellation  income and interest income. The $8.3 million gain related to
the disposition of Bellevue represents the difference between the fair value and
the carrying value of the Center (net of accumulated  intercompany profit). As a
result,  this  amount  differs  from the  amount  included  in  revenues  in the
combined,  summarized  financial statements of the unconsolidated Joint Ventures
(Note 4 to TRG's financial statements).

  Total operating  costs  increased by $8.9 million,  or 5.1%, to $183.8 million
for  1995.  Recoverable  expenses  increased  $4.7  million,  primarily  due  to
increases in property taxes and maintenance  costs.  Interest expense  increased
$6.3  million,  primarily  due to  increased  debt  levels and  interest  rates.
Operating  costs as  presented  in the  preceding  table differ from the amounts
shown in the combined,  summarized  financial  statements of the  unconsolidated
Joint  Ventures  (Note  4 to  TRG's  financial  statements)  by  the  amount  of
intercompany profit.

  As a result of the foregoing,  income before  extraordinary items of the Joint
Ventures  was $107.3  million in 1995,  an  increase  of 14.3% from 1994.  TRG's
equity in income  before  extraordinary  items of the Joint  Ventures  was $57.9
million in 1995, an increase of 12.9% from 1994.

Net Income
- ----------

  As a result of the foregoing, TRG's income before extraordinary items for 1995
increased by $7.5 million,  or 10.4%, to $79.7 million.  In 1995, TRG recognized
an $18.9 million  extraordinary  gain related to the  extinguishment  of debt at
Bellevue and $(2.2) million in  extraordinary  charges related to the prepayment
of debt at TRG and at one of its Joint  Ventures.  TRG also  recognized  $(44.7)
million in  extraordinary  charges in 1994,  consisting  primarily of prepayment
penalties,  related to the  extinguishment of debt. Net income in 1995 was $96.3
million, compared to $27.5 million in 1994.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Taubman Centers, Inc.

  As of December 31, 1996,  the Company had a cash balance of $9.4 million,  the
source  of  which  was  primarily  TRG's  distributions,  and  had  incurred  no
indebtedness.  During 1996 and 1995, the Company received distributions from TRG
of $41.3  million and $40.8  million,  respectively.  On December 10, 1996,  the
Company declared a quarterly  dividend of $0.23 per common share payable January
20, 1997 to shareholders of record December 31, 1996.

  The Company pays regular quarterly dividends to its shareowners. The Company's
ability to pay dividends is affected by several factors,  most importantly,  the
receipt of distributions  from TRG (see Distributions  below).  Dividends by the
Company are at the  discretion  of the Board of Directors and depend on the cash
available  to  the  Company,   its  financial   condition,   capital  and  other
requirements, and such other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant.

  Dividends  declared  totaled  $0.89 per common  share in 1996,  of which $0.41
represented return of capital and $0.48 represented ordinary income, compared to
dividends declared in 1995 of $0.88 per common share, of which $0.52 represented
return of capital and $0.36 represented ordinary income. The tax status of total
1997 dividends declared and to be declared, assuming continuation of a $0.23 per
common share quarterly dividend,  is estimated to be approximately 35% return of
capital,  and  approximately  65% of ordinary income.  This is a forward-looking
statement  and certain  significant  factors  could cause the actual  results to
differ materially, including: 1) the amount of dividends declared; 2) changes in
the  Company's  share of  anticipated  taxable  income of TRG due to the  actual
results of TRG; 3) changes in the number of the Company's outstanding shares; 4)
property  acquisitions or  dispositions;  5) financing  transactions,  including
refinancing of existing debt; and 6) changes in the Internal Revenue Code or its
application.

  In December 1996, the Company issued 5.97 million shares of common stock under
a $250 million equity shelf  registration  statement.  The $75 million  proceeds
were used to acquire newly issued units of partnership interest in TRG.

  The  Company's  Board of Directors  has  authorized  the purchase of up to 750
thousand shares of the Company's common stock in the open market.  The stock may
be  purchased  from  time to time as  market  conditions  warrant.  The  Company
purchased 19 thousand shares of its common stock for approximately $0.2 million,
436 thousand shares for approximately $4.2 million, and 36.8 thousand shares for
approximately $0.3 million in 1994, 1995 and 1996, respectively.  As of December
31, 1996, the Company had purchased a cumulative  total of 491.8 thousand shares
of its common stock for  approximately  $4.7 million.  Funding for the purchases
was  provided by excess  cash that  otherwise  would have been  invested in cash
equivalents.

  As of December  31,  1996,  the Company had 50.7  million  shares  outstanding
compared to 44.1 million at December 31, 1995.

TRG

  As of December  31,  1996,  TRG had a cash  balance of $7.9  million.  TRG had
available  for  general  partnership  purposes  an  unsecured  revolving  credit
facility of $200  million,  which was  scheduled to expire in May 1998. In March
1997, TRG completed the  renegotiation  of terms increasing the facility to $300
million,  reducing the current  contractual  interest rate by 60 basis points to
LIBOR plus 90 basis points and extending the maturity until March 2000. Included
in the credit  facility is a competitive  bid option program which allows TRG to
hold auctions,  among the banks  participating  in the facility,  for short term
borrowings of up to $150 million.  There were no borrowings  under this facility
at December 31, 1996. TRG also has available an unsecured bank line of credit of
up to $30 million with  borrowings of $10.1  million at December 31, 1996.  This
line expires in August 1998. TRG also has available a secured  commercial  paper
facility of up to $75 million,  with  borrowings  of $45 million at December 31,
1996.  Commercial paper is generally sold with a 30 day maturity.  This facility
is supported by a line of credit  facility,  which is renewable  quarterly for a
twelve month period.

  Proceeds from short term  borrowings of $121.2  million  provided  funding for
1996 compared to $67.7 million in 1995. The proceeds in 1996 were used primarily
for the $37  million  acquisition  in June  1996 of Paseo  Nuevo  and the  $65.6
million acquisition in July 1996 of the 75% interest in Fairlane previously held
by TRG's Joint Venture Partner, and related acquisition costs. Proceeds of $65.6
million  from the  issuance of TRG units of  partnership  interest to the former
Joint  Venture  Partner  were used to repay short term  borrowings.  Also during
1996,  proceeds of $81.4  million from the issuance of TRG units of  partnership
interest  were used to pay down short term  floating rate debt and for the $22.3
million   acquisition   of  La  Cumbre  (see  Results  of  Operations  -  Equity
Transactions and Acquisitions and Disposition).

  During 1996, TRG issued $154 million of unsecured  notes under its medium-term
note program compared to $133.4 million in 1995. In 1996, the notes were used to
pay down TRG's  floating rate bank lines as well as to pay off the $34.6 million
mortgage on Fairlane and the related  prepayment  penalty of approximately  $1.2
million, leaving the wholly owned property unencumbered. In 1995, the notes were
used to pay down floating rate debt under TRG's revolving  credit  facilities as
well as to pay off the $22.6  million  mortgage  securing a wholly owned Center.
TRG has issued a total of $287 million of medium-term  notes since the program's
inception in 1995 under TRG's $500 million shelf registration statement.

  Scheduled  principal payments on installment notes were $793 thousand and $897
thousand in 1996 and 1995, respectively.

  At December 31, 1996,  TRG's debt and its  beneficial  interest in the debt of
its Joint  Ventures  (excluding  $42.3  million  of capital  lease  obligations)
totaled $1,398.4 million. As shown in the following table, there was no unhedged
floating  rate debt at December  31, 1996.  Interest  rates shown do not include
amortization of debt issuance costs and interest rate hedging costs. These items
are  reported  as  interest  expense  in TRG's  results  of  operations.  In the
aggregate,  these costs accounted for 0.37% of the effective rate of interest on
TRG's  beneficial  interest  in debt at  December  31,  1996.  Included in TRG's
beneficial  interest  in  debt  at  December  31,  1996  is  debt  used  to fund
development and expansion costs.  TRG's  beneficial  interest in assets on which
interest is being  capitalized  totaled  $157.0 million as of December 31, 1996.
TRG's beneficial interest in capitalized interest was $8.9 million for 1996.

(1) Includes TRG's $100 million  floating rate notes due in November 1997, which
    were swapped to a fixed rate of 6.15% until  maturity.  The interest rate on
    the  refinancing  of this debt is  hedged  via an  interest rate cap for the
    period  November  1997 to December  1998 at a three  month LIBOR cap rate of
    6.5%.
(2) Denotes weighted average interest rate.
(3) This debt is additionally hedged via an interest rate cap for the period 
    July 1997 through July 2002 at a one month LIBOR cap rate of 9.95%.

  TRG's loan  agreements and indenture  contain  various  restrictive  covenants
including  limitations  on the amount of secured and unsecured  debt and minimum
debt service coverage ratios,  the latter being the most restrictive.  TRG is in
compliance with all of such covenants.

  In January  1997,  Arizona  Mills,  L.L.C.  closed on a secured  $145  million
construction  facility  maturing in 2002.  The loan bears  interest at one month
LIBOR plus 1.3%. The loan is hedged until maturity at a one month LIBOR cap rate
of 9.5%.  The payment of the  principal  and interest is recourse to each of the
owners of Arizona Mills, L.L.C. to the extent of their ownership percentage. TRG
owns a 37% interest in Arizona Mills, L.L.C.

Distributions

  A  principal  factor  considered  by TRG in  deciding  upon  distributions  to
partners is an amount,  which TRG defines as  Distributable  Cash Flow, equal to
EBITDA less TRG's Beneficial  Interest Expense and non-real estate  depreciation
and  amortization.  This  measure  of  performance  is  influenced  not  only by
operations but also by capital structure.  EBITDA is defined as TRG's beneficial
interest in revenues,  less operating costs before  interest,  depreciation  and
amortization,  meaning  TRG's  pro  rata  share of this  result  for each of the
Managed Businesses, after recording appropriate intercompany eliminations. TRG's
Beneficial  Interest Expense is defined as 100% of the interest expense of TRG's
Consolidated  Businesses and TRG's pro rata share of the interest expense on the
debt of the Joint  Ventures.  Funds from  Operations is calculated by adding the
Company's  beneficial interest in TRG's Distributable Cash Flow to the Company's
other income, less the Company's operating expenses. EBITDA,  Distributable Cash
Flow and Funds from Operations do not represent cash flows from  operations,  as
defined  by  generally  accepted  accounting  principles,   and  should  not  be
considered  to be an  alternative  to net income as an  indicator  of  operating
performance or to cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity. However,
the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) suggests that
Funds from Operations is a useful supplemental measure of operating  performance
for REITs.

  In March 1995,  NAREIT issued a clarification  of the definition of Funds from
Operations.  Beginning in 1996,  the Company  modified its  calculation of Funds
from  Operations  and  TRG's  calculation  of  Distributable  Cash  Flow  to  be
consistent with NAREIT's  clarified  definition.  As a result,  TRG adjusted the
depreciation  and  amortization  amount added back to net income to include only
depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely  significant to the real estate
industry.  Distributable  Cash Flow and Funds from Operations for 1995 have been
restated in the table below to reflect the clarified definition.

  The following table summarizes TRG's Distributable Cash Flow and the Company's
Funds from Operations for the years ended December 31, 1995 and 1996:

  For 1996,  EBITDA and  Distributable  Cash Flow were $229.8 million and $129.7
million,  compared to $216.1 million and $117.8 million,  as restated,  in 1995.
TRG  distributed  $119.1  million to its  partners  in 1996,  compared to $116.2
million in 1995. The Company's Funds from Operations for 1996 was $44.1 million,
compared to $40.8 million, as restated, in 1995.

  The Partnership  Committee of TRG makes an annual determination of appropriate
distributions   for  each  year.  The  determination  is  based  on  anticipated
Distributable  Cash Flow,  as well as  financing  considerations  and such other
factors  as  the  Partnership  Committee  considers  appropriate.  Further,  the
Partnership  Committee has decided that the growth in distributions will be less
than the growth in Distributable Cash Flow for the immediate future.

<PAGE>
  Except under unusual  circumstances,  TRG's  practice is to  distribute  equal
monthly  installments of the determined  amount of distributions  throughout the
year.  Due  to  seasonality  and  the  fact  that  cash  available  to  TRG  for
distributions  may be  more  or less  than  net  cash  provided  from  operating
activities  plus  distributions  from Joint  Ventures  during the year,  TRG may
borrow  from  unused  credit  facilities  (described  in  Liquidity  and Capital
Resources -- TRG above) to enable it to  distribute  the amount  decided upon by
the TRG Partnership Committee.


                                       34

<PAGE>



  Distributions  by each Joint Venture may be made only in  accordance  with the
terms of its  partnership  agreement.  TRG acts as the managing  partner in each
case and, in general,  has the right to determine  the amount of cash  available
for  distribution  from the Joint Venture.  In general,  the provisions of these
agreements  require the  distribution  of all available cash (as defined in each
partnership agreement), but most do not allow borrowing to finance distributions
without approval of the Joint Venture Partner.

  As a result,  distribution  policies of many Joint  Ventures will not parallel
those of TRG.  While TRG may not,  therefore,  receive as much in  distributions
from each Joint Venture as it intends to  distribute  with respect to that Joint
Venture,   the  Company  does  not  believe  this  will  impede  TRG's  intended
distribution  policy  because  of TRG's  overall  access  to  liquid  resources,
including borrowing capacity.

  Any inability of TRG or its Joint Ventures to secure  financing as required to
fund  maturing  debts,  capital  expenditures  and  changes in working  capital,
including development activities and expansions,  may require the utilization of
cash to satisfy such  obligations,  thereby possibly  reducing  distributions to
partners of TRG and funds available to the Company for the payment of dividends.

  In  addition,  if the GM Trusts  exercise  their  rights under the Cash Tender
Agreement (see Liquidity and Capital  Resources -- Cash Tender Agreement below),
TRG will be  required  to pay the GM  Trusts  $10.9  million  and may  borrow to
finance such expenditures.

Capital Spending

  Capital  spending for routine  maintenance of the Taubman  Shopping Centers is
generally recovered from tenants. Capital spending by the Managed Businesses not
recovered from tenants is summarized in the following table:

  In 1995 and 1996, TRG's share of mall tenant allowances per square foot leased
during the year,  excluding expansion space and new developments,  was $7.72 and
$9.96,  respectively.  In addition,  TRG's share of its Consolidated Businesses'
and Joint Ventures' capitalized leasing costs,  excluding new developments,  was
$6.7 million, or $10.40 per square foot leased during the year in 1995, and $8.5
million or $10.47 per square foot leased during the year in 1996.

  An expansion  at  Westfarms,  which will open in the summer of 1997,  will add
approximately  135,000  square  feet of mall  GLA and  Nordstrom  as an  anchor.
Approximately  75% of  this  space  has  been  leased  or  has  leases  out  for
signatures.  The expansion is expected to cost  approximately  $100 million.  An
expansion at Cherry Creek will include a newly  constructed Lord & Taylor store,
which will open in the fall of 1997,  and the addition of 132,000 square feet of
mall GLA, which will open in the fall of 1998. The expansion is expected to cost
approximately $50 million. TRG has a 79% and 50% ownership interest in Westfarms
and Cherry Creek, respectively.

  Additionally,  a project is now under  construction  to add over 30,000 square
feet of new mall tenant  space in the  building  vacated  when Saks Fifth Avenue
moved to the I. Magnin site at Biltmore.  The new stores are presently  expected
to open beginning in the spring of 1997. The project is expected to cost between
$5 and $10 million.

  The Mall at  Tuttle  Crossing,  a 980,000  square  foot  Center  in  northwest
Columbus,  Ohio,  will be anchored by Marshall  Field's,  Lazarus,  JCPenney and
Sears. TRG is leasing the land and mall buildings from Tuttle Holding Co., which
owns the land on which the Center is being  built.  TRG will make ninety  annual
minimum lease  payments of $4.4 million  beginning when the Center opens in July
1997. Substantially all of each payment in the first ten years of operation will
be recognized as interest  expense.  TRG will also pay additional  rent based on
achieved  levels of net  operating  income,  a measure of operating  performance
before rent payments,  as specified in the agreement (NOI);  100% of the portion
of NOI which is over $11.6 million but less than or equal to $14.4 million,  30%
of the portion of NOI between  $14.4 million and $18.3  million,  and 50% of the
portion of NOI over $18.3 million.  TRG estimates this  additional  rent,  which
will be recognized as other operating expense, will approximate $2 million to $3
million annually  beginning in 1999.  Substantially all of the Center's mall GLA
has been  leased.  The Center is expected to cost  approximately  $115  million,
including capital lease assets of $55 million.

  Arizona Mills, an enclosed value  super-regional  mall in Tempe,  Arizona,  is
opening in November 1997. TRG has a 37% ownership interest in Arizona Mills. The
1.2 million square foot  value-oriented  mall is expected to cost  approximately
$180 million.

  MacArthur Center, a new Center being developed by TRG in Norfolk, Virginia, is
expected  to open in the  spring of 1999.  The Center is  expected  to total 1.1
million  square feet and will  initially be anchored by Nordstrom and Dillard's.
This Center will be owned by a joint venture in which TRG has a 70% interest and
is projected to cost approximately $150 million.

  In 1996,  TRG entered  into an agreement  to lease  Memorial  City Mall, a 1.4
million square foot shopping center located in Houston,  Texas. Memorial City is
anchored by Sears, Foley's,  Montgomery Ward and Mervyn's. TRG has the option to
terminate  the  lease  after the third  full  year by paying $2  million  to the
lessor.   TRG  is  using  this  option  period  to  evaluate  the  redevelopment
opportunities  of the  Center.  Under the terms of the lease,  TRG has agreed to
invest a minimum of $3  million  during the three  year  option  period.  If the
redevelopment  proceeds,  TRG is required to invest an additional $22 million in
property  expenditures not recoverable from tenants during the first 10 years of
the lease term.

(1) Costs are net of intercompany profits.
(2) Includes  costs  related  to  leasehold improvements  at The Mall at  Tuttle
    Crossing;  excludes  capital lease assets (see Note 9 to TRG's  consolidated
    financial statements).
(3) Includes  costs related to expansion projects at Westfarms and Cherry Creek.
    Also includes construction costs for MacArthur Center and Arizona Mills.
(4) Includes  costs to explore the  possibilities  of  building an enclosed  1.7
    million square foot value super-regional mall in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
    Also includes the costs to evaluate the redevelopment of Memorial  City and
    required property expenditures under the terms of the lease.

  TRG's share of costs for  development and expansion  projects  scheduled to be
completed in 1998 and 1999 is  anticipated  to be as much as $60 million in 1998
and $19 million in 1999.

  TRG's   estimates   regarding   capital   expenditures   presented  above  are
forward-looking  statements  and  certain  significant  factors  could cause the
actual  results to differ  materially,  including  but not limited to: 1) actual
results of negotiations with anchors, tenants and contractors; 2) changes in the
scope of projects;  3) cost overruns;  4) timing of expenditures;  and 5) actual
time to complete projects.

Capital Resources

  TRG believes that its net cash provided by operating activities, together with
distributions  from the Joint  Ventures,  the  unutilized  portion of its credit
facilities  and its ability to generate  cash from the  issuance of  medium-term
notes under TRG's shelf registration  statement,  other securities  offerings or
mortgage  financings,  assure  adequate  liquidity to conduct its  operations in
accordance with its distribution and financing policies.

  The financing of TRG is intended to maintain an investment grade credit rating
for  TRG  and  (i)  minimize,  to the  extent  practical,  secured  indebtedness
encumbering  TRG's wholly owned  properties,  (ii)  mitigate  TRG's  exposure to
increases  in  floating  interest  rates,  (iii)  assure that the amount of debt
maturing in any future year will not pose a significant  refinancing  risk, (iv)
provide for additional capital and liquidity resources, and (v) maintain average
maturities  for TRG's  debt  obligations  of between  five and ten years.  TRG's
intent to continue to minimize  secured  indebtedness  is  dependent  on actions
taken by credit rating agencies and market conditions.

  TRG  expects to  finance  its  capital  requirements,  including  development,
expansions and working capital,  with available cash, borrowings under its lines
of credit and cash from future  securities  offerings under its medium-term note
program, other securities offerings,  or mortgage financings.  TRG's acquisition
activities are discretionary in nature, and will only be undertaken by TRG after
arranging  adequate  financing on terms that are consistent with TRG's financing
policies.  TRG's Joint  Ventures  expect to finance  development  and  expansion
spending with secured debt to the extent it is available.

  TRG's  borrowings are not and will not be recourse to the Company  without its
consent.

Cash Tender Agreement

  A. Alfred  Taubman  and the GM Trusts each have the annual  right to tender to
the Company units of  partnership  interest in TRG (provided  that the aggregate
value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered
interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the
trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender
Agreement).  The Company  will have the option to pay for these  interests  from
available  cash,  borrowed  funds,  or from the  proceeds  of an offering of the
Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the  Company  expects  to  finance  these
purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock.  The tendering  partners
will  bear all  market  risk if the  market  price at  closing  is less than the
purchase  price.  Any proceeds of the  offering in excess of the purchase  price
will be for the sole benefit of the Company.  At A. Alfred  Taubman's  election,
his family, and Robert C. Larson and his family may participate in tenders.  The
GM Trusts will be entitled  to receive  from TRG an amount (not to exceed  $10.9
million in the aggregate over the term of the Partnership)  equal to 5.5% of the
amounts that the Company pays to the GM Trusts under the Cash Tender Agreement.

  Based on a market  value at  December  31, 1995 and 1996 of $10.00 and $12.875
per common share,  the aggregate  value of interests in TRG that may be tendered
under the Cash Tender Agreement was approximately $743 million and $954 million,
respectively.  Purchase  of these  interests  at  December  31,  1996 would have
resulted in the Company owning an additional 53% interest in TRG.

  Although certain partners in TRG have pledged,  and other partners may pledge,
their  units of  partnership  interest,  the Company is not aware of any present
intention of any partner to sell its interest in TRG.

Board of Directors and Shareowners
Taubman Centers, Inc.


  We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Taubman Centers, Inc. as of
December  31,  1995  and  1996,  and  the  related   statements  of  operations,
shareowners'  equity  and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the period
ended December 31, 1996. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

  We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion,  such financial  statements  present  fairly,  in all material
respects,  the financial  position of Taubman  Centers,  Inc. as of December 31,
1995 and 1996,  and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the three  years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1996 in  conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.

                          NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       Three Years Ended December 31, 1996




Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

  The Company,  a real estate investment trust, or REIT, is the managing general
partner  of,  and  owns  an  interest  in,  The  Taubman  Realty  Group  Limited
Partnership  (TRG).  TRG  is  an  operating  partnership  that  engages  in  the
ownership,   operation,    management,   leasing,   acquisition,    development,
redevelopment,  expansion, financing and refinancing of regional retail shopping
centers (Taubman Shopping Centers) and interests  therein.  The Taubman Shopping
Centers are located primarily in major  metropolitan areas in the United States,
including  New  York  City,  Chicago,  Los  Angeles,  San  Francisco,   Detroit,
Washington, D.C., and Phoenix.

  The Company  accounts  for its  investment  in TRG under the equity  method of
accounting.  The excess of the Company's  cost of its investment in TRG over its
proportionate share of TRG's accumulated deficiency in assets has been allocated
to the  Company's  bases  in the  underlying  assets  and  liabilities  of  TRG.
Depreciation related to amounts allocated to depreciable assets is recognized by
the Company on a straight-line  basis over 40 years. The excess of the Company's
cost of its investment in TRG over its proportionate  share of TRG's accumulated
deficiency  in assets at  December  31,  1995 and 1996,  was $448.6  million and
$476.3 million, respectively.

Income Taxes

  Federal  income  taxes  are not  provided  because  the  Company  believes  it
qualifies as a REIT under the  provisions  of the  Internal  Revenue  Code,  and
therefore  applicable  taxable  income is included in the taxable  income of its
shareowners.  As a REIT,  the Company must  distribute  at least 95% of its REIT
taxable income to its shareowners and meet certain other requirements.

  Dividends  per  common  share  declared  in 1996 were  $0.89,  of which  $0.41
represented return of capital and $0.48 represented  ordinary income.  Dividends
per common share declared in 1995 were $0.88, of which $0.52 represented  return
of capital and $0.36  represented  ordinary  income.  Dividends per common share
declared in 1994 were $0.88,  of which $0.86  represented  return of capital and
$0.02 represented  ordinary income. The tax status of the Company's dividends in
1994,  1995 and 1996 may not be indicative  of future  periods.  The  difference
between net income for financial  reporting  purposes and taxable income results
primarily from differences in depreciation expense.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash  equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Earnings per Common Share

  Computations  of earnings per common  share are based on the weighted  average
number of shares outstanding during the year. The TRG partnership units issuable
under  TRG's  incentive  option  plan  (Note 5) have not  been  included  in the
computation  because  the number of units  issuable  (using the  treasury  stock
method) had a minimal effect on the Company's  percentage  ownership in TRG and,
consequently, earnings per common share.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets,  liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.


Note 2 - Investment in TRG

  The  Company's  investment  in TRG at December 31, 1995 and 1996 consists of a
35.10% and 36.68%,  respectively,  managing general  partnership  interest.  Net
income and  distributions  are allocable to the general and limited TRG partners
in  accordance  with their  percentage  ownership.  During 1996,  the  Company's
ownership of TRG changed as a result of several transactions.

  In December  1996,  the  Company  purchased  3,048  newly  issued TRG units of
partnership  interest with the $75 million proceeds from the Company's  December
1996  offering of 5.97  million  shares of common  stock under its $250  million
equity shelf  registration  statement.  TRG bore all  expenses of the  Company's
offering.  TRG used the net proceeds to pay down short term  floating  rate debt
and to acquire La Cumbre Plaza.  Also in December  1996, TRG issued 333 units of
partnership  interest in connection with the exercise of incentive options.  The
Company  exchanged 652 thousand  shares of common stock for the newly issued 333
units of TRG partnership  interest  pursuant to the Company's  Continuing  Offer
(Note 5).  Additionally in 1996, TRG issued 3,096 units of partnership  interest
in connection  with its  acquisition of the 75% interest in Fairlane Town Center
held by a joint venture partner.  The units are  exchangeable for  approximately
6.1 million  shares of the  Company's  common stock  pursuant to the  Continuing
Offer. As a result of these transactions,  at December 31, 1996, the Company had
50.7  million  shares of common  stock  outstanding  and TRG had 69,998 units of
partnership  interest  outstanding,  of which  the  Company  owned  36.68%.  The
Company's  average  ownership  percentage in TRG for 1994,  1995,  and 1996, was
35.9%, 35.1%, and 34.5%, respectively.

  In  December  1995,  the bank  group  holding  the $99.5  million  nonrecourse
mortgage  encumbering  Bellevue  Center  acquired  title to the Center through a
nonjudicial  foreclosure  sale.  The mortgage  matured on November 1, 1995.  TRG
ceased to recognize  the results of Bellevue  Associates  (Bellevue),  TRG's 60%
owned joint venture that owned the Center,  as of November 1, 1995.  TRG's share
of Bellevue's net loss from operations for 1994 and the ten months ended October
31, 1995, was $1.1 million and $0.7 million,  respectively.  The Company's share
of the net loss was $0.4 million and $0.3 million,  respectively. TRG recognized
an  extraordinary  gain of $18.9  million on the  extinguishment  of debt and an
ordinary gain of $5.0 million on the  disposition  of the Center.  The Company's
share of these gains was $6.6 million and $1.8 million, respectively.

  In December 1994,  TRG purchased  Biltmore  Fashion Park, a regional  shopping
center in Phoenix, Arizona, for a combination of $81.5 million in cash and 1,540
units of partnership  interest.  The units are  exchangeable  for  approximately
three million  shares of the Company's  common stock  pursuant to the Continuing
Offer.

  The Company's  proportionate share of TRG's income before  extraordinary items
for the years ended December 31, 1994, 1995, and 1996, was $26.0 million,  $28.0
million  (including  the  $1.8  million  gain  related  to  the  disposition  of
Bellevue),  and $29.0  million,  respectively,  reduced  by $8.3  million,  $8.1
million, and $7.6 million,  respectively,  representing adjustments arising from
the Company's additional basis in TRG's net assets.

  In 1994,  1995, and 1996, TRG recognized  extraordinary  items relating to the
extinguishment of debt. Of the 1995 amount, an $18.9 million gain was recognized
related to the disposition of Bellevue. Extraordinary charges in 1994, 1995, and
1996 consisted primarily of prepayment  penalties.  The Company's share of TRG's
extraordinary items was approximately  $(16.1) million, $5.8 million, and $(0.4)
million in 1994, 1995, and 1996, respectively.

  TRG's  summarized  balance  sheet and results of  operations  information  (in
thousands) are presented below,  followed by information  about TRG's beneficial
interest in the  operations of its  unconsolidated  joint  ventures.  Beneficial
interest is calculated  based on TRG's  ownership  interest in each of the joint
ventures.

additional 250 thousand shares of the Company's common stock in the open market.
The stock may be purchased from time to time as market conditions warrant. As of
December 31, 1996, the Company had purchased a cumulative total of approximately
492 thousand shares of its common stock for approximately $4.7 million.  Funding
for the  purchases  was provided by excess cash that  otherwise  would have been
invested in cash equivalents.


Note 5 - Commitments and Contingencies

  At the time of the Company's  initial public offering (IPO) and acquisition of
its  interest  in TRG,  the Company  entered  into an  agreement  with A. Alfred
Taubman  and The  General  Motors  Hourly-Rate  Employes  Pension  Trust and the
General Motors  Salaried  Employes  Pension Trust (the GM Trusts),  each of whom
indirectly owns an interest in TRG,  whereby each has the annual right to tender
to the Company units of partnership interest in TRG (provided that the aggregate
value is at least $50  million)  and cause the Company to purchase  the tendered
interests at a purchase price based on a market  valuation of the Company on the
trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of the tender  (the Cash  Tender
Agreement).  The Company  will have the option to pay for these  interests  from
available  cash,  borrowed  funds or from the  proceeds  of an  offering  of the
Company's  common  stock.  Generally,  the  Company  expects  to  finance  these
purchases  through the sale of new shares of its stock.  The tendering  partners
will bear the  costs of sale.  Any  proceeds  of the  offering  in excess of the
purchase  price will be for the sole  benefit of the  Company.  At Mr. A. Alfred
Taubman's  election,  his  family  and  Robert  C.  Larson  and his  family  may
participate  in tenders.  The GM Trusts will be entitled to receive  from TRG an
amount  (not to  exceed  $10.9  million  in the  aggregate  over the term of the
Partnership) equal to 5.5% of the amounts that the Company pays to the GM Trusts
under the Cash Tender Agreement.

                   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  Based on a market  value at December  31, 1995 and 1996 of $10.00 and $12.875,
respectively,  per common share,  the aggregate  value of interests in TRG which
may be tendered under the Cash Tender Agreement was  approximately  $743 million
and $954 million, respectively, at December 31, 1995 and 1996. Purchase of these
interests  at  December  31, 1996 would have  resulted in the Company  owning an
additional 53% interest in TRG.

  The Company has made a continuing,  irrevocable  offer to all present  holders
(other than certain  excluded  holders,  including A. Alfred  Taubman and the GM
Trusts),  assignees of all present holders,  those future holders of partnership
interests in TRG as the Company may, in its sole discretion, agree to include in
the  continuing  offer,  and all  existing  and  future  optionees  under  TRG's
incentive  option plan (described  below) to exchange shares of common stock for
partnership  interests in TRG (the  Continuing  Offer).  The number of shares of
common stock to be  exchanged  is based on a market  valuation of the Company on
the  trading  date  immediately  preceding  the date of  exchange.  The offer is
subject  to certain  restrictions  relating  to the  minimum  value of  interest
exchanged and ownership limitations.

  The GM Trusts and the AT&T  Master  Pension  Trust are able to sell  shares of
common stock that they acquired in connection  with the IPO through a registered
offering.  Pursuant to a registration rights agreement with the Company, each of
the Trusts has the annual  right to cause the Company to register  and  publicly
sell their  shares of common stock  (provided  that the shares have an aggregate
value of at least $50 million and subject to certain  other  restrictions).  The
annual right is deemed to have been exercised if they initiate or participate in
a sale pursuant to the Cash Tender  Agreement,  as described above. All expenses
of  such a  registration  are  to be  borne  by  the  Company,  other  than  the
underwriting  discounts  or  selling  commissions,  which  will be  borne by the
exercising party.

  TRG has an incentive  option plan for  employees  of the  Manager.  Currently,
4,500 units of  partnership  interest may be issued under the plan. The exercise
price of all  outstanding  options was equal to market  value on the date of the
grant. Incentive options generally become exercisable to the extent of one-third
of the units on each of the third,  fourth, and fifth  anniversaries of the date
of grant.  Options expire ten years from the date of grant.  Options outstanding
at December 31, 1996 have a remaining  weighted-average  contractual life of 6.3
years and range in exercise price from $18.5 thousand to $27.4  thousand.  There
were no grants in 1996.

   A summary of the status of the plan as of December 31, 1994,  1995, and 1996,
and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

                          INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT





Partners
The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership


  We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of The Taubman
Realty Group Limited  Partnership  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and
1996,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  accumulated
deficiency  in assets,  and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended  December  31, 1996.  Our audits also  included  the  financial  statement
schedules  listed  in the  Index  at Item 14.  These  financial  statements  and
financial  statement  schedules  are  the  responsibility  of the  Partnership's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to  express  an  opinion  on the  financial
statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

  We  conducted  our  audits in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion, such consolidated  financial statements present fairly, in all
material  respects,  the financial  position of The Taubman Realty Group Limited
Partnership  and  subsidiaries as of December 31, 1995 and 1996, and the results
of their  operations  and their  cash  flows for each of the three  years in the
period ended December 31, 1996 in conformity with generally accepted  accounting
principles.  Also, in our opinion,  such  financial  statement  schedules,  when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the  information  set forth
therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       Three Years Ended December 31, 1996


Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

  The Taubman Realty Group Limited  Partnership  (TRG) engages in the ownership,
operation,   management,  leasing,  acquisition,   development,   redevelopment,
expansion,  financing  and  refinancing  of  regional  retail  shopping  centers
(Taubman Shopping Centers) and interests  therein.  The Taubman Shopping Centers
are located primarily in major metropolitan areas in the United States including
New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco,  Detroit,  Washington,  D.C.
and Phoenix. Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO) is the managing general partner of TRG.
The GMPTS Limited Partnership  (GMPTS), TG Partners Limited Partnership (TG) and
Taub-Co Management, Inc. are also general partners.

  At  December  31,  1996,  TRG  had  69,998  units  of   partnership   interest
outstanding,  of which 54,209 units represent general partnership interests.  At
December  31,  1996,  TRG was owned  36.68% by TCO,  36.18% by GMPTS,  20.23% by
certain  present and former key executives (and certain of their family members)
of the  predecessor  to The Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership,  the Manager
(collectively,  the Taubman  Group),  and TG, and 6.91% by certain  former joint
venture  partners and certain of the former  owners of Biltmore.  The members of
the Taubman Group (other than TG and Taub-Co Management, Inc.), the former joint
venture partners and the former owners of Biltmore are limited partners of TRG.

  At both  December  31,  1994 and 1995,  TRG had  63,521  units of  partnership
interest  outstanding  (of which  50,828  units at  December  31,  1994 and 1995
represented general partnership interests).  At both December 31, 1994 and 1995,
TRG was owned 35.10% by TCO,  39.87% by GMPTS,  22.29% by the Taubman  Group and
TG, and 2.74% by a former joint venture partner and certain of the former owners
of Biltmore.

  Net income and losses and  distributions  of TRG are  allocated to the general
and limited partners of TRG in accordance with their percentage  ownership.  The
financial  statements  include only those  assets,  liabilities,  and results of
operations  which relate to the business of TRG. No provision  has been made for
income  taxes  since  these  taxes  are  the  responsibility  of the  individual
partners.

Basis of Presentation

  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of TRG and its
consolidated  subsidiaries.  Investments in entities unilaterally  controlled by
ownership or contractual  agreements are  consolidated;  investments in entities
not unilaterally  controlled (Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity
method.

  The Manager,  which is approximately  99% beneficially  owned by TRG, provides
all property  management and leasing  services for all Taubman  Shopping Centers
and provides  corporate,  development  and  acquisition  services.  Intercompany
balances and profits are eliminated in consolidation.

  Dollar  amounts  presented  in tables  within  the  notes to the  consolidated
financial statements are stated in thousands of dollars, except for unit data in
Notes 3, 11 and 14 or as otherwise noted.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Revenue Recognition

  Shopping  center space is generally  leased to specialty  retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis as earned,  the result of which
does not differ  materially from a straight-line  method.  Percentage  rents are
recognized on an accrual basis as earned.  Expense recoveries,  which include an
administrative fee, are recognized as revenue in the period applicable costs are
chargeable to tenants.

Depreciation and Amortization

  Buildings,  improvements  and equipment,  stated at cost,  are  depreciated on
straight-line or double-declining  balance bases over the estimated useful lives
of the assets,  which range from 5 to 50 years.  Tenant  allowances and deferred
leasing  costs are  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the lives of the
related leases.

Earnings Per Unit of Partnership Interest

  The computation of net income per unit of partnership interest is based on net
income and the weighted average number of partnership units outstanding. The TRG
units of partnership  interest  issuable under TRG's incentive option plan (Note
11) have not been  included  in the  computation  because  the  number  of units
issuable  (using the treasury stock method) had a minimal effect on earnings per
partnership unit.

Capitalization

  Costs related to the acquisition, development, construction and improvement of
properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction is
substantially  complete.  Properties  are reviewed for  impairment  if events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amounts of the properties
may  not  be  recoverable.   Costs  of  potentially   unsuccessful   development
pre-construction  activities  are  provided  for by  charges to  operations  and
written off if abandoned.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash  equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

Deferred Charges

  Direct  financing  and interest  rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

Stock-based Compensation Plans

  Stock-based  compensation  plans are  accounted  for under APB  Opinion 25 and
related interpretations.

<PAGE>


                  THE TAUBMAN REALTY GROUP LIMITED PARTNERSHIP
            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

  Premiums paid for interest  rate caps are  amortized to interest  expense over
the terms of the cap agreements.  Amounts  received under the cap agreements are
accounted  for on an accrual  basis,  and  recognized as a reduction of interest
expense. The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements is accounted
for on an accrual basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
financial instruments:

   The carrying  value  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  and  notes
       receivable, and accounts payable approximates fair value due to the short
       maturity of these instruments.

   The fair value of TRG's debt is estimated  based on quoted  market  prices if
       available,  or on the current rates  available to TRG for debt of similar
       terms and  maturity and the  assumption  that debt will be prepaid at the
       earliest possible date.

   The fair value of interest  rate hedging  instruments  is the amount that TRG
       would receive or pay to terminate  the  agreement at the reporting  date,
       taking into account current interest rates.


Note 2 - Equity Transactions

  In December 1996,  TRG issued 3,048 units of  partnership  interest to TCO for
the $75 million proceeds from TCO's December 1996 equity offering.  TRG bore all
expenses of TCO's offering,  which have been accounted for as a reduction of the
proceeds from TRG's  issuance of units.  Also in December  1996,  TRG issued 333
units of  partnership  interest in  connection  with the  exercise of  incentive
options (Note 11).  Concurrently under TCO's continuing offer to exchange shares
of common stock for certain  partnership  interests in TRG,  TCO  exchanged  652
thousand  shares  of  common  stock  for  the  newly  issued  333  units  of TRG
partnership  interest.  TRG used the net proceeds  from the issuance of units to
pay down short term  floating rate debt and to acquire La Cumbre Plaza (Note 3).
Additionally  in 1996,  TRG  issued  3,096  units  of  partnership  interest  in
connection  with the  acquisition  of the  remaining  interest in Fairlane  Town
Center (Note 3).

  In December 1994, TRG issued 1,540 units of partnership interest in connection
with the acquisition of Biltmore Fashion Park (Biltmore) (Note 3).

Note 3 - Acquisitions

Acquisition of La Cumbre Plaza

  In December  1996,  TRG acquired La Cumbre Plaza (La Cumbre) in Santa Barbara,
California  for  $22.25  million in cash.  The Center is subject to four  ground
leases  (three of which  are  participating).  The  leases  expire in 2028.  The
acquisition was accounted for at fair value. The operating  results of La Cumbre
have been consolidated in TRG's financial  statements from the acquisition date.
The pro forma effect of the  acquisition on 1995 and 1996 operating  results was
immaterial.

Acquisition of Remaining Interest in Fairlane Town Center

  In July 1996, TRG completed  transactions  that resulted in the acquisition of
the 75% interest in Fairlane Town Center (Fairlane),  previously held by a Joint
Venture Partner.  In connection with the transactions,  TRG issued to the former
Joint Venture  Partner 3,096 units of  partnership  interest,  exchangeable  for
approximately 6.1 million shares of TCO common stock,  which had a closing price
of $10.75  per share on the day prior to the  issuance  date.  The units  issued
represent  limited   partnership  units.  TRG  also  assumed  mortgage  debt  of
approximately  $26  million,  representing  the former Joint  Venture  Partner's
beneficial interest in the $34.6 million mortgage encumbering the property.  TRG
used  unsecured  debt to fund the repayment of the 9.73% mortgage and prepayment
penalty of approximately  $1.2 million.  The acquisition,  which resulted in TRG
owning 100% of Fairlane,  was accounted for at fair value. The operating results
of  Fairlane  have been  consolidated  in TRG's  financial  statements  from the
acquisition  date. Prior to the acquisition date, TRG's interest in Fairlane was
accounted for under the equity method as a Joint Venture.

  Pro forma results of TRG's operations,  assuming the Fairlane  acquisition had
occurred on January 1, 1995, are as follows:

Acquisition of Paseo Nuevo

  In June 1996, TRG acquired  Paseo Nuevo located in Santa Barbara,  California,
for $37 million in cash. The Center is owned subject to two participating ground
leases with remaining  terms of  approximately  70 years.  The  acquisition  was
recorded  at fair  value.  The  operating  results  of  Paseo  Nuevo  have  been
consolidated  in TRG's financial  statements from the acquisition  date. The pro
forma effect of the acquisition on 1995 and 1996 net income was immaterial.

Acquisition of Biltmore Fashion Park

  In December 1994, TRG acquired  Biltmore Fashion Park  (Biltmore),  a regional
shopping center located in Phoenix, Arizona, for $81.5 million in cash and 1,540
TRG units of partnership interest  (exchangeable for approximately three million
shares of TCO common stock, having a closing price of $9.875 on the day prior to
the purchase date). The units issued represent  limited  partnership  interests.
TRG also assumed  assessment  bond  obligations  of  approximately  $3.6 million
encumbering the Center.  The bond service costs are recovered from tenants.  The
acquisition was accounted for at fair value.  The operating  results of Biltmore
have been consolidated in TRG's financial  statements from the acquisition date.
The  pro  forma  effect  of  the  acquisition  on  1994  operating  results  was
immaterial.


Note 4 - Investments in Joint Ventures

  Following are TRG's  investments  in various real estate Joint  Ventures which
own regional retail shopping  centers.  TRG is also the managing general partner
of these Joint Ventures. TRG's interest in each Joint Venture is as follows:

                                                                   TRG's %

  Arizona Mills, L.L.C. is developing Arizona Mills, a value super-regional mall
in  Tempe,  Arizona,  which  will  open  in  November  1997.  Taubman  MacArthur
Associates  Limited  Partnership  is  developing  MacArthur  Center in  Norfolk,
Virginia.  MacArthur  Center is  expected  to open in the  spring  of 1999.  TRG
transferred  to these Joint  Ventures  its  accumulated  pre-construction  costs
related to these projects (Note 5).

  In  December  1995,  the bank  group  holding  the $99.5  million  nonrecourse
mortgage  encumbering  Bellevue  Center  acquired  title to the Center through a
nonjudicial  foreclosure  sale.  The mortgage  matured on November 1, 1995.  TRG
ceased to recognize  the results of Bellevue  Associates  (Bellevue),  TRG's 60%
owned Joint Venture that owned the Center,  as of November 1, 1995.  TRG's share
of Bellevue's net loss from operations for 1994 and the ten months ended October
31, 1995, was $1.1 million and $0.7 million, respectively.

            NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)


  As a result of the foreclosure and debt extinguishment, Bellevue recognized an
extraordinary gain of approximately  $31.4 million,  representing the difference
between the carrying value of the debt and the fair value of the Center,  net of
related transaction costs on the extinguishment of debt, and an ordinary gain of
approximately  $4.4  million,  representing  the excess of the fair value of the
Center over its carrying value.  TRG's share of the  extraordinary  gain and its
gain on the disposition of the Center,  which was based on the carrying value of
TRG's investment in Bellevue, were $18.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively.
The carrying value of TRG's investment in Bellevue differed from TRG's 60% share
of Bellevue's  net deficiency in assets due to the  elimination of  intercompany
profits on sales of services.

  In May 1994,  West  Farms  Associates  (Westfarms)  redeemed  a  portion  of a
deceased Joint Venture Partner's interest for $12.7 million. As a result,  TRG's
ownership of Westfarms increased to approximately 79%.

  TRG reduces its investment in Joint Ventures to eliminate intercompany profits
on sales of services that are  capitalized by the Joint  Ventures.  As a result,
the  carrying  value of TRG's  investment  in Joint  Ventures is less than TRG's
share  of the  deficiency  in  assets  reported  in  the  Balance  Sheet  of the
Unconsolidated Joint Ventures of the Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership by
$4.8 million and $8.6 million in 1995 and 1996. These  differences are amortized
over the useful lives of the related assets.

  Depreciation expense for 1994, 1995 and 1996 was $21.8 million,  $26.6 million
and $29.6  million.  Peripheral  land  consists  primarily of  undeveloped  land
generally  adjacent to the Taubman  Shopping  Centers.  Construction  in process
includes costs related to expansions and other  improvements at various existing
centers and leasehold improvements for The Mall at Tuttle Crossing (Note 9).

  TRG  actively  pursues  opportunities  for  the  development  of new  regional
shopping  centers.  Development  pre-construction  activities,  including market
research,  site location,  environmental  work,  zoning permits and obtaining of
anchor  commitments,  may  take  years  to  accomplish  and  ultimately  may  be
abandoned.  TRG provides a reserve for the cost of such potentially unsuccessful
pre-construction activities.

  The activity in development pre-construction costs and the related reserve for
1995 and 1996 is summarized as follows:

Agreement)  pursuant to which the GM Trusts have certain  rights to cause TCO to
purchase  their  interests  in TRG. TRG will pay the GM Trusts an amount (not to

  Commercial  paper is generally  sold with a 30 day  maturity.  The  underlying
credit facility is renewable quarterly for a twelve month period.

  As of December 31, 1996, TRG had available for general partnership purposes an
unsecured  revolving  credit  facility of $200  million,  which was scheduled to
expire in May 1998.  In March 1997,  TRG completed  the  renegotiation  of terms
increasing  the  facility to $300  million,  reducing  the  current  contractual
interest rate by 60 basis points to LIBOR plus 90 basis points and extending the
maturity until March 2000.  Included in the credit facility is a competitive bid
option program which allows TRG to hold auctions,  among the banks participating
in the facility,  for short term borrowings of up to $150 million.  The facility
agreements contain various restrictive  covenants,  including limitations on the
amount of secured and unsecured debt and minimum debt service  coverage  ratios,
the latter being the most restrictive. TRG is in compliance with all covenants.

Interest Expense

   Interest  paid in 1994,  1995 and 1996,  net of amounts  capitalized  of $7.1
million,  $6.9  million and $5.7  million in 1994,  1995 and 1996,  approximated
$47.7 million, $62.2 million and $69.8 million.

Extraordinary Items

   In 1996,  TRG  recognized an  extraordinary  charge to income of $1.3 million
primarily  consisting of a prepayment  penalty related to the  extinguishment of
debt at a wholly owned Center. In 1995, TRG recognized an extraordinary  gain of
approximately  $18.9 million,  related to the extinguishment of debt at Bellevue
(Note 4) and $2.2  million of  extraordinary  charges,  consisting  primarily of
prepayment  penalties,  related to the extinguishment of debt of TRG and a Joint
Venture. TRG recognized  extraordinary  charges to income in 1994, consisting of
prepayment   penalties   of   approximately   $44.7   million   related  to  the
extinguishment of secured debt of TRG and certain of its Joint Ventures.

the cost of its  floating  rate debt.  As of December 31,  1996,  the  following
interest rate cap agreements were outstanding:


      Notional                  Frequency

         100          6.5%       Monthly       January 1997 to January 1998
         100          6.5%    Three Months    November 1997 to December 1998

  TRG also has a swap agreement  which hedges TRG's Floating Rate Notes due 1997
(see Unsecured Notes Payable above).

  TRG  is  exposed  to  credit  risk  in  the  event  of  nonperformance  by the
counterparties  to its  interest  rate  cap  and  swap  agreements,  but  has no
off-balance  sheet risk of loss. TRG anticipates  that its  counterparties  will
fully perform their obligations under the agreements.

10%  participation in cash flow for years 2022 to 2076 and  supplemental  ground
rent under the lease of another  property,  and participation in cash flows over
amounts specified in leases of two other  properties.  Contingent rental expense
was $65 thousand in 1996.  Future  minimum  rental  payments are  summarized  as
follows:

                     1997                   $ 9,205
                     1998                     8,318
                     1999                     8,388
                     2000                     8,219
                     2001                     7,890
                     Thereafter             199,970

   The table above  includes $2.6  million,  $2.8  million,  $2.9 million,  $2.8
million,  $2.5 million and $8.4 million of related party amounts in 1997,  1998,
1999, 2000, 2001 and thereafter.

   Included in  deferred  charges is  approximately  $6.1  million  representing
lump-sum  payments  for base rent on two parcels of adjacent  land (a  leasehold
interest in a third parcel was sold in 1996).  These costs are being  charged to
operations over the 87 and 99 year terms of the leases.

Memorial City Mall Lease

   In November  1996, TRG entered into an agreement to lease Memorial City Mall,
located in Houston,  Texas. The lease of this  unencumbered  property grants TRG
the exclusive right to manage,  lease and operate the property.  The annual rent
is  initially $7 million.  TRG has the option to  terminate  the lease after the
third full lease year by paying $2 million to the lessor. Accordingly, the lease
will be accounted for as an operating  lease during the option period.  TRG will
use this  option  period to  evaluate  the  redevelopment  opportunities  of the
center.

   If TRG does not exercise its option to terminate  the lease at the end of the
third full lease year, the lease continues for another 52 years and provides for
increases  in rent every ten years based on 75% of the  increase in the Consumer
Price  Index  between  1996 and the then  current  year.  Under the terms of the
lease,  TRG has agreed to invest a minimum  of $3 million  during the three year
option  period.  If the  redevelopment  proceeds,  TRG is  required to invest an
additional $22 million in property  expenditures  not  recoverable  from tenants
during the first 10 years of the lease term.

Capital Lease Obligation

   In November  1995,  TRG completed an agreement with Tuttle Holding Co., which
owns the land on which The Mall at Tuttle Crossing is located, to lease the land
and mall  buildings,  which are currently  under  construction.  The term of the
lease is from the date of  signing  the  lease to 90 years  from the date of the
opening of the Center. The Center will open in July 1997. Minimum lease payments
of $4.4 million will be due annually  after the opening of the Center.  TRG will
also pay  additional  rent based on achieved  levels of net operating  income as
specified in the agreement (NOI); 100% of the portion of NOI which is over $11.6
million  but less  than or equal to $14.4  million,  30% of the  portion  of NOI
between  $14.4  million  and $18.3  million,  and 50% of the portion of NOI over
$18.3 million.

   As of December 31, 1996, future minimum lease payments for this capital lease
are as follows:

       1997                                             $   1,943

Note 10 - Transactions with Affiliates

  The  revenue  from  management,  leasing and  development  services is derived
primarily from  transactions with affiliates.  Accounts  receivable from related
parties    includes    amounts   related   to   reimbursement   of   third-party
(non-affiliated) costs.

  Other related party transactions are described in Notes 9, 11 and 15.


Note 11 - The Manager

  The  Manager,  The Taubman  Company  Limited  Partnership,  provides  property
management, leasing and development services to the Taubman Shopping Centers and
affiliates.

  The Manager has a voluntary  retirement  savings plan  established in 1983 and
amended and restated effective January 1, 1994 (the Plan). The Plan is qualified
in accordance with Section 401(k) of the Internal  Revenue Code (the Code).  The
Manager  contributes  an  amount  equal  to 2% of  the  qualified  wages  of all
qualified employees and matches employee  contributions in excess of 2% up to 7%
of  qualified   wages.   In  addition,   the  Manager  may  make   discretionary
contributions  within the limits prescribed by the Plan and imposed in the Code.
Costs  relating  to the Plan were $1.5  million in each of the three years ended
December 31, 1994, 1995 and 1996.

  TRG has an incentive  option plan for  employees  of the  Manager.  Currently,
4,500 units of  partnership  interest  may be issued  under the plan.  Incentive
options generally become  exercisable to the extent of one-third of the units on
each of the third, fourth, and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant. Options
expire ten years from the date of grant.

   A summary of the status of the plan as of December 31, 1994,  1995, and 1996,
and changes during the years ending on those dates is presented below:

</TABLE>

  The weighted  average fair value per unit of options  granted  during 1995 was
$2.7 thousand.  There were no grants in 1996.  TRG used a binomial  option price
model to  determine  the grant  date fair  values of the 1995  grants.  The 1995
calculations of fair value are based on the following assumptions:  a volatility
rate of 22%,  a  risk-free  rate of return of  approximately  8%, and a dividend
yield of  approximately  9%.  Options  outstanding  at December  31, 1996 have a
remaining  weighted-average  contractual life of 6.3 years and range in exercise
price from $18.5 thousand to $27.4 thousand.

  TRG applies APB Opinion 25 and related  Interpretations  in accounting for the
plan. The exercise price of all  outstanding  options granted under the plan was
equal to market value on the date of grant. Accordingly, no compensation expense
has been  recognized  for the  plan.  Had  compensation  cost for the plan  been
determined  based on the fair value of the  options at the grant  dates for 1995
awards (there were no grants in 1996) under the plan  consistent with the method
of FASB  Statement  123, the pro forma effect on TRG's earnings and earnings per
unit of partnership interest would not have been material.

  Effective  January 1, 1996, the Manager adopted The Taubman Company  Long-Term
Performance  Compensation  Plan.  Annually,  eligible  employees will be granted
contingent  notional TRG units of partnership  interest,  the ultimate number of
which will be based on the employee's performance. These awards, which will vest
on the  third  anniversary  of the  date  of  grant,  will  also  accrue  deemed
distributions  in the form of  additional  notional  units each time TRG makes a
distribution  to its partners.  Upon vesting,  additional  notional units may be
granted based on the performance of the employee and the Manager and/or TRG. The
awards will be paid to the employee in cash upon vesting,  based on the value of
TRG's units of partnership interest, unless the employee elects to defer payment
as provided in the plan.  The cost of this plan was  approximately  $2.0 million
for 1996.

Partners
The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership

  We  have audited  the  accompanying  combined balance sheets of Unconsolidated
Joint   Ventures  of  The  Taubman   Realty  Group  Limited   Partnership   (the
"Partnership")  as of  December  31,  1995 and 1996,  and the  related  combined
statements of operations,  accumulated  deficiency in assets, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 1996.  Our audits also
included the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 14. These
financial statements and financial statement schedules are the responsibility of
the Partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
financial statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

  We conducted  our audits  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

  In our opinion,  such combined  financial  statements  present fairly,  in all
material respects,  the financial  position of Unconsolidated  Joint Ventures of
The Taubman  Realty Group Limited  Partnership as of December 31, 1995 and 1996,
and the results of their  operations  and their cash flows for each of the three
years in the  period  ended  December  31,  1996 in  conformity  with  generally
accepted accounting  principles.  Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
schedules,   when  considered  in  relation  to  the  basic  combined  financial
statements  taken  as a whole,  present  fairly  in all  material  respects  the
information set forth therein.

  Arizona Mills, L.L.C. is developing Arizona Mills, a value super-regional mall
in Tempe,  Arizona,  which will open in November  1997. In 1996,  Arizona Mills,
L.L.C.  purchased for $24.8 million approximately 116 acres of land on which the
Center is being  constructed  from an  affiliate  of a  partner  in TRG and of a
former owner in Arizona Mills (Note 7).  Taubman  MacArthur  Associates  Limited
Partnership  (MacArthur) is developing  MacArthur  Center in Norfolk,  Virginia.
MacArthur  Center is expected to open in the spring of 1999.  Also in 1996,  TRG
and the  other  owners  of  Arizona  Mills and  MacArthur  contributed  non-cash
pre-construction costs related to these projects totaling $15.7 million.

  In July 1996, TRG completed transactions that resulted in it acquiring the 75%
interest in Fairlane Town Center  (Fairlane)  previously held by a Joint Venture
Partner.   TRG  also  assumed  mortgage  debt  of  approximately   $26  million,
representing the former Joint Venture Partner's beneficial interest in the $34.6
million mortgage encumbering the property. The accounts of Fairlane are included
in these  combined  financial  statements  until the  acquisition  date.  On the
acquisition  date,  the book values of Fairlane's  assets and  liabilities  were
approximately $25 million and $39 million, respectively.

  In  December  1995,  the  bank  group  holding the $99.5  million  nonrecourse
mortgage  encumbering  Bellevue  Center  acquired  title to the Center through a
nonjudicial  foreclosure  sale.  The mortgage  matured on November 1, 1995.  TRG
ceased to recognize  the results of Bellevue  Associates  (Bellevue),  TRG's 60%
owned  Joint  Venture  that owned the  Center,  as of  November  1,  1995,  and,
accordingly,  the  accounts of  Bellevue  Associates  are not  included in these
combined financial statements from that date.

  As a result of the foreclosure and debt extinguishment, Bellevue recognized in
1995 an  extraordinary  gain of  approximately  $31.4 million,  representing the
difference  between  the  carrying  value of the debt and the fair  value of the
Center, net of related  transaction costs, and an ordinary gain of approximately
$4.4 million,  representing  the excess of the fair value of the Center over its
carrying  value.  The  extinguishment  of the debt and write off of the Center's
carrying value represent non-cash transactions.

  In May 1994,  West Farms  Associates  redeemed  a portion of a deceased  Joint
Venture  Partner's  interest for $12.7  million.  As a result,  TRG's  ownership
increased to approximately  79%, up from 68%. The excess of the redemption price
over the book value of the interests was allocated to properties.

Revenue Recognition

  Shopping  center space is generally  leased to specialty  retail tenants under
short and intermediate  term leases which are accounted for as operating leases.
Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis as earned,  the result of which
does not differ  materially from a straight-line  method.  Percentage  rents are
recognized on an accrual basis as earned.  Expense recoveries,  which include an
administrative fee, are recognized as revenue in the period applicable costs are
chargeable to tenants.

Depreciation and Amortization

  Buildings,  improvements  and equipment,  stated at cost,  are  depreciated on
straight-line or double-declining  balance bases over the estimated useful lives
of the assets  which range from 3 to 55 years.  Tenant  allowances  and deferred
leasing  costs are  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis  over the lives of the
related leases.

Capitalization

  Costs related to the acquisition,  development,  construction, and improvement
of properties are capitalized. Interest costs are capitalized until construction
is substantially  complete.  Properties are reviewed for impairment if events or
changes in  circumstances  indicate that the carrying  amounts of the properties
may not be recoverable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

  Cash  equivalents  consist of highly liquid  investments with a maturity of 90
days or less at the date of purchase.

              NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (Continued)


Deferred Charges

  Direct  financing  and interest  rate hedging costs are deferred and amortized
over the terms of the related  agreements  as a component  of interest  expense.
Direct costs related to leasing  activities are  capitalized  and amortized on a
straight-line  basis over the lives of the related  leases.  All other  deferred
charges are amortized on a straight-line  basis over the terms of the agreements
to which they relate.

Interest Rate Hedging Agreements

  Premiums paid for interest  rate caps are  amortized to interest  expense over
the terms of the cap agreements.  Amounts  received under the cap agreements are
accounted  for on an accrual  basis,  and  recognized as a reduction of interest
expense. The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements is accounted
for on an accrual basis and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

  The following  methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
financial instruments:

  The  carrying  value  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  accounts  and  notes
    receivable, and  accounts payable approximates fair  value due to the short
    maturity of these instruments.

  The fair value of mortgage notes and other notes payable is estimated  based
    on quoted market prices if available, or  on the  current rates  available
    to  the Joint  Ventures for  debt of similar  terms and  maturity  and  the
    assumption that debt will be prepaid at the earliest possible date.

  The fair value of interest rate hedging  instruments is the  amount the Joint
    Venture  would pay or  receive to terminate  the agreement at the reporting
    date, taking into account current interest rates.

Use of Estimates

  The preparation of financial  statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,  disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses  during the reporting  period.  Actual  results
could differ from those estimates.

  The December  31, 1996 balance also  includes a $172 million note due in 1998.
The  interest  rate on $93.5  million of this note was swapped to maturity at an
effective  annual rate of 5.4%. The rate on the balance of the financing,  which
was  capped to  maturity  at a maximum  annual  rate of 6.5%,  including  credit
spread,  floats at a rate of three  month  LIBOR  plus  0.5%.  A portion  of the
proceeds of this financing was restricted to fund expansion costs.

  An additional  floating rate financing of $50 million is due in 2001. The rate
on the financing floats at LIBOR plus 0.45%.  The Joint Venture  purchased a cap
instrument  with a notional amount of $50 million and a seven year term. The cap
rate, including credit spread, from December 1996 until maturity is 9.00%. Up to
$50 million in additional notes may be issued in the future.

  A $130 million  secured bank financing  maturing in 1998 has options to extend
the loan up to an additional  three years.  The facility has an interest rate of
LIBOR  plus  0.75%.  The rate has been  capped at 7.25%  from  November  1996 to
February 1998 and then at 9.1% until maturity, including credit spread.

Interest Rate Hedging Instruments

  Certain  of  the  Joint  Ventures have entered into interest rate swap and cap
agreements  to reduce  their  exposure to changes in the cost of  floating  rate
debt.  These  Joint  Ventures  are  exposed  to  credit  risk  in the  event  of
nonperformance  by  their   counterparties  to  the  agreements,   but  have  no
off-balance  sheet risk of loss.  These  Joint  Ventures  anticipate  that their
counterparties  will  be able to  fully  perform  their  obligations  under  the
agreements.

Note 5 - Leases

  Shopping  center  space is leased to tenants and certain  anchors  pursuant to
lease agreements.  Tenant leases typically provide for guaranteed  minimum rent,
percentage  rent and other  charges to cover  certain  operating  costs.  Future
minimum rent under operating leases in effect at December 31, 1996 for operating
centers,  assuming no new or renegotiated  leases or option extensions on anchor
agreements, is summarized as follows:

                      1997                 $151,705
                      1998                  146,381
                      1999                  135,721
                      2000                  120,401
                      2001                  103,685
                      Thereafter            290,246

  Minimum rent  received from former  related  parties was $2.1 million and $0.9
million in 1994 and 1995. There are no related party amounts in the table above.

  One Joint  Venture,  as lessee,  has a ground lease  expiring in 2083.  Rental
payments  under the lease were $1.7 million in each of 1994,  1995 and 1996. All
of the ground lease rental  payments and  scheduled  future  payments  represent
minimum rental expense payable to its Joint Venture Partner.

Note 7 - Subsequent Events

  TRG's  ownership interest  in Arizona Mills, L.L.C.  increased in January 1997
to 37% as a result of Arizona  Mills,  L.L.C.  redemption of a former owner's 5%
interest for $2.8 million. The former owner is an affiliate of a partner in TRG.
Also in January 1997,  Arizona  Mills,  L.L.C.  closed on a secured $145 million
construction  facility  maturing in 2002.  The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus
1.3%.  The  facility is hedged  until  maturity at a one month LIBOR cap rate of
9.5%. The payment of principal and interest is recourse to each of the owners of
Arizona Mills to the extent of their ownership percentage.
