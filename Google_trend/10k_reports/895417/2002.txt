ITEM 1.  BUSINESS

                                  THE COMPANY

GENERAL

     Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, the "Company") is a fully integrated company which owns and
operates manufactured home communities ("Communities"). Communities are
residential developments designed and improved for the placement of detached,
single-family manufactured homes which are produced off-site and installed and
set on residential sites ("Site Set") within the Community. The owner of each
home leases the site on which it is located. Modern Communities are similar to
typical residential subdivisions, containing centralized entrances, paved
streets, curbs and gutters and parkways. In addition, these Communities often
provide a clubhouse for social activities and recreation and other amenities,
which may include swimming pools, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, laundry
facilities and cable television service. In some cases, utilities are provided
or arranged for by the owner of the Community, otherwise, the resident contracts
the utility directly. Some Communities provide water and sewer service through
municipal or regulated utilities, while others provide these services to
residents from on-site facilities.

     Each Community is generally designed to attract, and is marketed to one of
two types of residents -- (1) retirees and empty nesters or (2) families and
first-time homeowners. The Company believes both types of Communities are
attractive investments and focuses on owning Communities in or near large
metropolitan markets and retirement destinations.

     The Company was formed to continue the property operations, business
objectives and acquisition strategies of an entity that had owned and operated
Communities since 1969. As of December 31, 2001, the Company owned or had an
ownership interest in a portfolio of 148 Communities and recreational vehicle
("RV") resorts (the "Properties") located throughout the United States
containing 50,761 residential sites. The Properties are located in 23 states
(with the number of Properties in each state shown parenthetically) -- Florida
(49), California (25), Arizona (17), Michigan (11), Colorado (10), Delaware (7),
Nevada (5), Indiana (3), Oregon (3), Illinois (2), Iowa (2), New York (2), Utah
(2), Pennsylvania (1), Maryland (1), Minnesota (1), Montana (1), New Mexico (1),
Ohio (1), Texas (1), Virginia (1), West Virginia (1), and Washington (1). As of
December 31, 2001, the Company also owned a commercial building located in
California.

     The Company has approximately 800 full-time employees dedicated to carrying
out the Company's operating philosophy and strategies of value enhancement and
service to residents. The Company typically utilizes a one or two-person
management team for the on-site management of each of the Properties. Typically,
clerical and maintenance workers are employed to assist these individuals in the
management and care of the Properties. Direct supervision of on-site management
is the responsibility of the Company's regional vice presidents and regional and
district managers. These individuals have significant experience in addressing
the needs of residents and in finding or creating innovative approaches to
maximize value and increase cash flow from property operations. Complementing
this field management staff are approximately 60 corporate employees who assist
on-site management in all property functions.

FORMATION OF THE COMPANY

     The Company, formed in March 1993, is a Maryland corporation which has
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The Company
generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it distributes
its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of
organizational and operational requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as
a REIT, its income is taxable at regular corporate rates. Even if the Company
qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and
local taxes on its income and property and Federal income and excise taxes on
its undistributed income.

     The operations of the Company are conducted through certain entities which
are owned or controlled by the Company. MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership") is the entity through which the Company conducts
substantially all of its operations. Subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership
have been created to: (i) facilitate mortgage financing (the "Financing
Partnerships"); (ii) facilitate the Company's ability to provide financing to
the owners of Communities ("Lending Partnership"); and (iii) own the assets and
operations of certain utility companies which service the Properties ("MHC
Systems"). The financial results of the Operating Partnership and subsidiaries
(together, the "Subsidiaries") are consolidated in the Company's consolidated
financial statements. The operations of the Company are managed on a
property-by-property basis therefor the results of our financing, lending and
property management and utility operations are not reviewed separately by
management to make decisions regarding allocation of resources or to assess
performance.

                                        3
<PAGE>

     In addition, since certain activities, if performed by the Company, may not
have been qualifying REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), the Company has invested in the non-voting preferred stock
of various corporations which engage in such activities. Realty Systems, Inc.
("RSI") is a preferred stock subsidiary of the Company that, doing business as
Carefree Sales, is engaged in the business of purchasing, selling, leasing and
financing manufactured homes that are located or will be located in Properties
owned and managed by the Company. Carefree Sales also provides brokerage
services to residents at such Properties. Typically, residents move from a
Community but do not relocate their homes. Carefree Sales may provide brokerage
services, in competition with other local brokers, by seeking buyers for the
homes. Carefree Sales also leases homes to prospective residents with the
expectation that the tenant eventually will purchase the home. LP Management
Corp. leases from the Operating Partnership certain real property within or
adjacent to certain of the Properties consisting of golf courses, pro shops,
restaurants and RV areas. The Company believes that the activities of RSI and LP
Management Corp. (collectively, "Affiliates") benefit the Company by maintaining
and enhancing occupancy at the Properties. The Company accounts for its
investment in and advances to Affiliates using the equity method of accounting.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND OPERATING STRATEGIES

     The Company seeks to maximize both current income and long-term growth in
income. The Company focuses on Communities that have strong cash flow and
expects to hold such Properties for long-term investment and capital
appreciation. In determining cash flow potential, the Company evaluates the
Community's ability to attract and retain high quality residents who take pride
in their Community and in their home. These business objectives and their
implementation are determined by the Company's Board of Directors and may be
changed at any time. The Company's investment and operating approach includes:

          - Providing consistently high levels of services and amenities in
            attractive surroundings to foster a strong sense of community and
            pride of home ownership;

          - Efficiently managing the Properties to increase operating margins by
            controlling expenses, increasing occupancy and maintaining
            competitive market rents;

          - Increasing income and property values by continuing the strategic
            expansion and, where appropriate, renovation of the Properties;

          - Utilizing management information systems to evaluate potential
            acquisitions, identify and track competing properties and monitor
            resident satisfaction; and

          - Selectively acquiring Communities that have potential for long-term
            cash flow growth and to create property concentrations in and around
            major metropolitan areas and retirement destinations to capitalize
            on operating synergies and incremental efficiencies.

     The Company is committed to enhancing its reputation as the most respected
brand name in the industry. Its strategy is to own and operate the highest
quality Communities in major metropolitan areas and retirement destinations
across the United States. The focus is on creating an attractive residential
environment for homeowners by providing a well-maintained, comfortable Community
with a variety of organized recreational and social activities and superior
amenities. In addition, the Company regularly surveys rental rates of
competing properties and conducts satisfaction surveys of residents to determine
the factors residents consider most important in choosing a manufactured home
community.

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS

     The Company acquired or gained a controlling interest in eighty-eight
Properties during 1997 through 1999, more than doubling its portfolio. The
Company believes that opportunities for property acquisitions are still
available and in general consolidation within the industry will continue
(see -- The Industry -- Industry Consolidation). However, the Company believes
that transactions occurring during 1999 and 2000 in the private marketplace are
at valuations significantly in excess of the Company's current public market
valuation. As a result, during 1999 and 2000 the Company accelerated its stock
repurchase program. The Company's Board of Directors continues to review the
conditions under which the Company will repurchase its stock. These conditions
include, but are not limited to, market price, balance sheet flexibility, other
opportunities and capital requirements. (For more information on the Company's
stock repurchase program see Note 4 to the accompanying financial


                                        4

statements.) Increasing acceptability of and demand for Site Set homes and
continued constraints on development of new Communities continue to add to their
attractiveness as an investment. The Company believes it has a competitive
advantage in the acquisition of new Communities due to its experienced
management, significant presence in major real estate markets and substantial
capital resources. The Company is actively seeking to acquire additional
Communities and currently is engaged in various stages of negotiations relating
to the possible acquisition of a number of Communities.

     The Company anticipates that newly acquired properties will be located in
the United States. The Company utilizes market information systems to identify
and evaluate acquisition opportunities, including a market database to review
the primary economic indicators of the various locations in which the Company
expects to expand its operations. Acquisitions will be financed from the most
appropriate sources of capital, which may include undistributed funds from
operations, issuance of additional equity securities, sales of investments,
collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings and issuance of debt securities.
In addition, the Company may cause the Operating Partnership to issue units of
limited partnership interest ("OP Units") to finance acquisitions. The Company
believes that an ownership structure which includes the Operating Partnership
will permit the Company to acquire additional Communities in transactions that
may defer all or a portion of the sellers' tax consequences.

     When evaluating potential acquisitions, the Company will consider such
factors as: (i) the replacement cost of the property; (ii) the geographic area
and type of property; (iii) the location, construction quality, condition and
design of the property; (iv) the current and projected cash flow of the property
and the ability to increase cash flow; (v) the potential for capital
appreciation of the property; (vi) the terms of tenant leases, including the
potential for rent increases; (vii) the potential for economic growth and the
tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is
located; (viii) the potential for expansion of the physical layout of the
property and the number of sites; (ix) the occupancy and demand by residents for
properties of a similar type in the vicinity and the residents profile; (x) the
prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the property;
and (xi) competition from existing Communities and the potential for the
construction of new Communities in the area. The Company expects to purchase
Communities with physical and market characteristics similar to the Properties
in its current portfolio.

PROPERTY EXPANSIONS

     Several of the Company's Properties have available land for expanding the
number of sites available to be leased to residents. Development of these sites
("Expansion Sites") is predicated by local market conditions and permitted by
zoning and other applicable laws. When justified, development of Expansion Sites
allows the Company to leverage existing facilities and amenities to increase the
income generated from the Properties. Where appropriate, facilities and
amenities may be upgraded or added to certain Properties in order to make those
Properties more attractive in their markets. The Company's acquisition
philosophy has included the desire to own Properties with potential Expansion
Site development, and the Company has been successful in acquiring a number of
such Properties. Several examples of these Properties include the 1994
acquisition of Bulow Village with potential development of approximately 725
Expansion Sites, the 1997 acquisition of Golf Vista Estates with potential
development of approximately 128 Expansion Sites and the acquisition in 1999
of Coquina Crossing with potential development of approximately 393 Expansion
Sites, and the acquisition in 2001 of Grand Island and The Lakes at
Countrywood with combined potential Expansion Sites of 224 sites.

     Of the Company's 148 Properties, ten may be expanded consistent with
existing zoning regulations. In 2002, the Company expects to develop an
additional 141 Expansion Sites within three of these Properties. As of December
31, 2001, the Company had approximately 817 Expansion Sites available for
occupancy in 24 of the Properties. The Company filled 205 Expansion Sites in
2001 and expects to fill an additional 200 to 250 Expansion Sites in 2002.

LEASES

     The typical lease entered into between the resident and the Company for the
rental of a site is for a month-to-month or year-to-year term, renewable upon
the consent of both parties or, in some instances, as provided by statute. These
leases are cancelable, depending on applicable law, for non-payment of rent,
violation of community rules and regulations or other specified defaults.
Non-cancelable long-term leases, with remaining terms ranging up to ten years,
are in effect at certain sites within 22 of the Properties. These leases are
subject to rental rate increases based on the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), in
some instances taking into consideration certain floors and ceilings and
allowing for pass-throughs of certain items such as real estate taxes, utility
expenses and capital expenditures. Generally, market rate adjustments are made
on an annual basis.

REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE

     General.  Communities are subject to various laws, ordinances and
regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as
swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas. The Company believes that
each Property has the necessary permits and approvals to operate.

     Rent Control Legislation.  State and local rent control laws, principally
in California and Florida, limit the Company's ability to increase rents and to
recover increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements at
certain Properties. Enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time
in other jurisdictions. The Company presently expects to continue to maintain
Communities, and may purchase additional properties, in markets that are either
subject to rent control or in which rent-limiting legislation exists or may be
enacted. For example, Florida has enacted a law that generally provides that
rental increases must be reasonable. Also, certain jurisdictions in California
in which the Company owns Properties limit rent increases to changes in the CPI
or some percentage thereof.

     Insurance.  Management believes that the Properties are covered by adequate
fire, flood, property, earthquake and business interruption insurance (where
appropriate) provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable
deductibles and limits. Due to the lack of available commercially reasonable
coverage, the company is self-insured for terrorist incidents. The Company
believes its insurance coverage is adequate based on the Company's assessment of
the risks to be insured, the probability of loss and the relative cost of
available coverage. The Company has obtained title insurance insuring fee title
to the Properties in an aggregate amount which the Company believes to be
adequate.

                                    INDUSTRY

THE INDUSTRY

     The Company believes that modern Communities, such as the Properties,
provide an opportunity for increased cash flows and appreciation in value. These
may be achieved through increases in occupancy rates and rents, as well as
expense controls, expansion of existing Properties and opportunistic
acquisitions, for the following industry specific reasons:

     - Barriers to Entry:  The Company believes that the supply of new
       Communities will be constrained due to barriers to entry into the
       industry. The most significant barrier has been the difficulty in
       securing zoning from local authorities. This has been the result of
       (i) the public's historically poor perception of the industry, and
       (ii) the fact that Communities generate less tax revenue because the
       homes are treated as personal property (a benefit to the home owner)
       rather than real property. Another factor that creates substantial
       barriers to entry is the length of time between investment in the
       Community's development and the attainment of stabilized occupancy
       and the generation of revenues. The initial development of the
       infrastructure may take up to two or three years. Once the Community
       is ready for occupancy, it may be difficult to attract residents to
       an empty Community. Substantial occupancy levels may take several years
       to achieve.

     - Industry Consolidation:  According to an industry analyst's industry
       report, there are approximately 50,000 Communities in the United States,
       and approximately 6.5% or 3,250 of the Communities have more than 200
       sites and would be considered "investment-grade" properties. The five
       public REITs that own Communities own approximately 532 or about 16% of
       the "investment-grade" Communities. In addition, based on a report
       prepared by one analyst, the top 150 owners of Communities own
       approximately 69% of the "investment-grade" assets. The Company believes
       that this relatively high degree of fragmentation in the industry
       provides the Company, as a national organization with experienced
       management and substantial financial resources, the opportunity to
       purchase additional Communities.

     - Stable Tenant Base:  The Company believes that Communities tend to
       achieve and maintain a stable rate of occupancy due to the following
       factors: (i) residents own their own homes, (ii) Communities tend to
       foster a sense of community as a result of amenities such as clubhouses,
       recreational and social activities and (iii) since moving a Site Set home
       from one Community to another involves substantial cost and effort,
       residents often sell their home in-place (similar to site-built
       residential housing) with no interruption of rental payments.

SITE SET HOUSING

     Based on the current growth in the number of individuals living in Site Set
homes, the Company believes that Site Set homes are increasingly viewed by the
public as an attractive and economical form of housing. According to the
industry's trade association, nearly one in four new single family homes sold in
the United States today is Site set.

     The Company believes that the growing popularity of Site Set housing is
primarily the result of the following factors:

     - Importance of Home Ownership.  According to the Fannie Mae ("FNMA") 2000
       National Housing Survey renters' desire to own a home continues to be a
       top priority. According to the report, "A home is more than merely
       shelter. Owning a home provides a sense of financial security...Americans
       view owning a home as the second most important action a person can take
       to achieve financial security, behind stating an IRA [401(k)] or other
       type of retirement account.

     - Affordability.  For a significant number of persons, Site Set housing
       represents the only means of achieving home ownership. In addition, the
       total cost of housing in a Community (home cost, site rent and related
       occupancy costs) is competitive with and often lower than the total cost
       of alternative housing, such as apartments and condominiums, and
       generally substantially lower than "stick-built" residential
       alternatives.

     - Lifestyle Choice.  As the average age of the United States population has
       increased, Site Set housing has become an increasingly popular housing
       alternative for retirement and "empty-nest" living. According to FNMA,
       the surviving baby-boom generation -- the 80 million people born between
       1945 and 1964 -- will constitute 18% of the U.S. population within the
       next 30 years and more than 32 million will reach age 55 within the next
       ten years. Among those people who are nearing retirement (age 40 to 54),
       approximately 33% plan on moving upon retirement. The Company believes
       that Site Set housing is especially attractive to such individuals when
       located within a Community that offers an appealing amenity package,
       close proximity to local services, social activities, low maintenance
       and a secure environment.

     - Construction Quality. Since 1976, all Site Set housing has been required
       to meet stringent Federal standards, resulting in significant increases
       in the quality of the industry's product. The Department of Housing and
       Urban Development's standards for Site Set housing construction quality
       are the only Federally regulated standards governing housing quality of
       any type in the United States. Site Set homes produced since 1976 have
       received a "red and silver" government seal certifying that they were
       built in compliance with the Federal code. The code regulates Site Set
       home design and construction, strength and durability, fire resistance
       and energy efficiency, and the installation and performance of heating,
       plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. In newer
       homes, top grade lumber and dry wall materials are common. Also,
       manufacturers are required to follow the same fire codes as builders of
       site-built structures.

     - Comparability to Site-Built Homes. The Site Set housing industry has
       experienced a recent trend towards multi-section homes. Many modern Site
       Set homes are longer (up to 80 feet compared to 50 feet in the 1960's)
       and wider than earlier models. Many homes have vaulted ceilings,
       fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms, and closely resemble single
       family ranch style site-built homes.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     The Company believes that the Properties provide attractive amenities and
common facilities that create a comfortable and attractive Community for the
residents, with most offering a clubhouse, a swimming pool, laundry facilities
and cable television service. Many also offer additional amenities such as
sauna/whirlpool spas, golf courses, tennis, shuffleboard and basketball courts
and exercise rooms. Since residents own their homes, it is their responsibility
to maintain their homes and the surrounding area. It is management's role to
ensure that residents comply with Community policies and to provide maintenance
of the common areas, facilities and amenities. The Company holds periodic
meetings of its property management personnel for training and implementation of
the Company's strategies. The Properties historically have had, and the Company
believes they will continue to have, low turnover and high occupancy rates.

     The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects
the Company's belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the
portfolio from regional economic influences. The Company intends to target new
acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located and will also
consider acquisitions of properties outside such markets. The Company's five
largest markets of Properties owned are Florida (49 Properties), California (25
Properties), Arizona (17 Properties), Michigan (11 Properties) and Colorado (10
Properties). These markets accounted for 36%, 17%, 9%, 3%, and 10%,
respectively, of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31,
2001. The Company also has Properties located in the following markets:
Northeast, Northwest, Midwest, and Nevada/Utah/New Mexico. The Company's largest
Property, Bay Indies, located in Venice, Florida, accounted for 3% of the
Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

 DEANZA SANTA CRUZ MOBILE ESTATES

     The residents of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a property located in
Santa Cruz, California (the "City") previously brought several actions opposing
certain fees and charges in connection with water service at the Property. This
summary provides the history and reasoning underlying the Company's defense of
the residents' claims and explains the Company's decision to continue to defend
its position, which the Company believes is fair and accurate.

     DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates is a 198-site Community overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. It is subject to the City's rent control ordinance which limits
annual rent increases to 75% of CPI. The Company purchased this Property in
August 1994 from certain unaffiliated DeAnza entities ("DeAnza"). Prior to the
Company's purchase in 1994, DeAnza made the decision to submeter and separately
bill tenants at the Property for both water and sewer in 1993 in the face of the
City's rapidly rising utility costs.

     Under California Civil Code Section 798.41, DeAnza was required to reduce
rent by an amount equal to the average cost of usage over the preceding 12
months. This was done. With respect to water charges, because DeAnza did not
want to be regulated by the California Public Utility Commission ("CPUC"),
DeAnza relied on California Public Utilities Code Section 2705.5 ("CPUC Section
2705.5") to determine what rates would be charged for water on an ongoing basis
without becoming a public utility. DeAnza and the Company interpreted the
statute as providing that in a submetered mobile home park, the property owner
is not subject to regulation and control of the CPUC so long as the users are
charged what they would be charged by the utility company if users received
their water directly from the utility company. In Santa Cruz, customers
receiving their water directly from the City's water utility were charged a
certain lifeline rate for the first 400 ccfs of water and a greater rate for
usage over 400 ccfs of water, a readiness to serve charge of $7.80 per month and
tax on the total. In reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5, DeAnza implemented its
billings on this schedule notwithstanding that it did not receive the discount
for the first 400 ccfs of water because it was a commercial and not a
residential customer.

     A dispute with the residents ensued over the readiness to serve charge and
tax thereon. The residents argued that California Civil Code Section 798.41
required that the Property owner could only pass through its actual costs of
water (and that the excess charges over the amount of the rent rollback were an
improper rent increase) and that CPUC Section 2705.5 was not applicable. DeAnza
unbundled the utility charges from rent consistent with California Civil Code
Section 798.41 and it has generally been undisputed that the rent rollback was
accurately calculated.

     In August 1994, when the Company acquired the Property, the Company
reviewed the respective legal positions of the Santa Cruz Homeowners Association
("HOA") and DeAnza and concurred with DeAnza. DeAnza's reliance on CPUC Section
2705.5 made both legal and practical sense in that residents paid only what they
would pay if they lived in a residential neighborhood within the City and
permitted DeAnza to recoup part of the expenses of operating a submetered system
through the readiness to serve charge.

     Over a period of 18 months from 1993 into May of 1995, a series of
complaints were filed by the HOA and Herbert Rossman, a resident, against
DeAnza, and later, the Company. DeAnza and the Company demurred to each of these
complaints on the grounds that the CPUC had exclusive jurisdiction over the
setting of water rates and that residents under rent control had to first
exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding in a civil action. At
one point, the case was dismissed (with leave to amend) on the basis that
jurisdiction was with the CPUC and, at another point, Mr. Rossman was dismissed
from the case because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies.

     On June 29, 1995, a hearing was held before a City rent control officer on
billing and submetering issues related to both water and sewer. The Company and
DeAnza prevailed on all issues related to sewer and the rent rollback related to
water, but the hearing officer determined that the Company could only pass
through its actual cost of water, i.e., a prorated readiness to serve charge and
tax thereon. The hearing officer did not deal with the subsidy being given to
residents through the quantity charge and ordered a rebate in a fixed amount per
resident. The Company and DeAnza requested reconsideration on this issue, among
others, which reconsideration was denied by the hearing officer.

                                        13
<PAGE>
     The Company then took a writ of mandate (an appeal from an administrative
order) to the Superior Court and, pending this appeal, the residents, the
Company and the City agreed to stay the effect of the hearing officer's decision
until the Court rendered judgment.

     In July 1996, the Superior Court affirmed the hearing officer's decision
without addressing concerns about the failure to take the subsidy on the
quantity charge into account.

     The Company requested that the City and the HOA agree to a further stay
pending appeal to the court of appeal, but they refused and the appeal court
denied the Company's request for a stay in late November 1996. Therefore, on
January 1, 1997, the Company reduced its water charges at this Property to
reflect a pass-through of only the readiness to serve charge and tax at the
master meter (approximately $0.73) and to eliminate the subsidy on the water
charges. On their March 1, 1997 rent billings, residents were credited for
amounts previously "overcharged" for readiness to serve charge and tax. The
amount of the rebate given by the Company and DeAnza was $36,400. In calculating
the rebate, the Company and DeAnza took into account the previous subsidy on
water usage although this issue had not yet been decided by the court of appeal.
The Company and DeAnza felt legally safe in so doing based on language in the
hearing officer's decision that actual costs could be passed through.

     On March 12, 1997, the Company also filed an application with the CPUC to
dedicate the water system at this Property to public use and have the CPUC set
cost-based rates for water usage. The Company believed it was obligated to take
this action because of its consistent reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5 as a safe
harbor from CPUC jurisdiction. That is, when the Company could no longer charge
for water as the local serving utility would charge, it was no longer exempt
from the CPUC's jurisdiction and control under CPUC Section 2705.5.

     On March 20, 1998, the court of appeal issued the writ of mandate requested
by the Company on the grounds that the hearing officer had improperly calculated
the amount of the rebate (meaning the Company had correctly calculated the rent
credits), but also ruling that the hearing officer was correct when he found
that the readiness to serve charge and tax thereon as charged by DeAnza and the
Company were an inappropriate rent increase. The decision primarily reflected
the court of appeal's view that CPUC Section 2705.5 operated as a ceiling and
that California Civil Code Section 798.41 allowed for a charge based on actual
costs, including costs of administration, operation and maintenance of the
system, but that the Company had not to provide evidence of such costs. The
court of appeal further agreed with the Company that the City's hearing officer
did not have the authority under California Civil Code Section 798.41 to
establish rates that could be charged in the future.

     Following this decision, the CPUC granted the Company its certificate of
convenience and necessity on December 17, 1998 and approved cost-based rates and
charges for water that exceed what residents were paying under the Company's
reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5. Concurrently, the CPUC also issued an Order
Instituting Investigation ("OII") confirming its exclusive jurisdiction over the
issue of water rates in a submetered system and commencing an investigation into
the confusion and turmoil over billings in submetered properties. Specifically,
the OII states: "The Commission has exclusive and primary jurisdiction over the
establishment of rates for water and sewer services provided by private
entities."

     Specifically, the CPUC ruling regarding the Company's application stated:
"The ultimate question of what fees and charges may or may not be assessed,
beyond external supplier pass-through charges, for in-park facilities when a
mobile home park does not adhere to the provisions of CPUC Section 2705.5, must
be decided by the Commission."

     After the court of appeal decision, the HOA brought all of its members back
into the underlying civil action for the purpose of determining damages,
including punitive damages, against the Company. The trial was continued from
July 1998 to January 1999 to give the CPUC time to act on the Company's
application. Notwithstanding the action taken by the CPUC in issuing the OII in
December 1998, the trial court denied the Company's motion to dismiss on
jurisdictional grounds and trial commenced before a jury on January 11, 1999.

     Not only did the trial court not consider the Company's motion to dismiss,
the trial court refused to allow evidence of the OII or the Company's CPUC
approval to go before the jury. Notwithstanding the Company's strenuous
objections, the judge also allowed evidence of the Company's and DeAnza's
litigation tactics to be used as evidence of bad faith and oppressive actions
(including evidence of the application to the CPUC requesting a $22.00 readiness
to serve charge). The Company's motion for a mistrial based upon these
evidentiary rulings was denied. On January 22, 1999, the jury returned a verdict
awarding $6.0 million of punitive damages against the Company and DeAnza. The
Company had previously agreed to indemnify DeAnza on the matter.

                                        14
<PAGE>

     On April 19, 1999, the trial court denied all of the Company's and DeAnza's
post-trial motions for judgement notwithstanding the verdict, new trial and
remittur. The trial court also awarded $700,000 of attorneys' fees to
plaintiffs. The Company appealed the jury verdict and attorneys' fees award
(which also accrues interest at the statutory rate of 10.0% per annum). The
Company bonded the judgment pending appeal in accordance with California
procedural rules, which require a bond equal to 150% of the amount of the
judgment. Post-judgment interest will accrue at the statutory rate of 10.0% per
annum.

     On December 21, 2001 the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District
reversed the $6.0 million punitive damage award, the related award of attorneys'
fees, and, as a result, all post-judgement interest thereon, on the basis that
punitive damages are not available as a remedy for a statutory violation of the
MRL. The decision of the appellate court left the HOA with the right to seek a
new trial in which it must prove its entitlement to either the statutory penalty
and attorneys' fees available under the MRL or punitive damages based on causes
of action for fraud, misrepresentation or other tort. The HOA has filed in
Superior Court, seeking statutory penalties and attorneys' fees, which may be
heard in late March, 2002. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself
against these claims.

     In two related appeals, the Company had argued that the trial court's
ability to enter an award of attorneys' fees in favor of the HOA and to take
certain other actions was preempted by the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by
the CPUC over the issue of how to set rates for water in a submetered mobile
home park. During 2000, the California court of appeal rejected the Company's
preemption argument with respect to these prior rulings in favor of plaintiffs,
one of which had awarded plaintiffs approximately $100,000 of attorneys' fees.
The California Supreme Court declined to accept the case for review and the
Company paid the judgment, including post-judgment interest thereon, and settled
the matter for approximately $200,000 late in 2000.

     In a separate matter, in December 2000 the HOA and certain individual
residents of the Property filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California,
County of Santa Cruz (No. CV 139825) against the Company, certain affiliates of
the Company and certain employees of the Company. The new lawsuit seeks damages,
including punitive damages, for intentional infliction of emotional distress,
unfair business practices, and unlawful retaliation purportedly arising from
allegedly retaliatory rent increases which were noticed by the Company to
certain residents in September 2000. The Company believes that the residents who
received rent increase notices with respect to rent increases above those
permitted by the local rent control ordinance were not covered by the ordinance
either because they did not comply with the provisions of the ordinance or
because they are exempted by state law. On December 29, 2000, the Superior Court
of California, County of Santa Cruz enjoined such rent increases. The Company
intends to vigorously defend the matter, which may go to trial in the summer of
2002.

 ELLENBURG COMMUNITIES

     The Company and certain other parties entered into a settlement agreement
("the Settlement"), which was approved by the Los Angeles County Superior Court
in April 2000. The Settlement resolved substantially all of the litigation and
appeals involving the Ellenburg Properties, and transactions arising out of the
settlement closed on May 22, 2000 (see Note 5). Only the appeals of the two
entities remain, neither of which is expected to materially affect the Company.

     In connection with the Ellenburg Acquisition, on September 8, 1999,
Ellenburg Fund 20 ("Fund 20") filed a cross complaint in the Ellenburg
dissolution proceeding against the Company and certain of its affiliates
alleging causes of action for fraud and other claims in connection with the
Ellenburg acquisition. The Company subsequently successfully had the cross
complaint against the Company and its affiliates dismissed with prejudice by the
California Superior Court. However, Fund 20 has appealed. This appeal was one
not resolved by the Settlement. The Company believes Fund 20's allegations are
without merit and will vigorously defend itself.

     In October 2001, Fund 20 sued the Company and certain of its affiliates
again, this time in Almeda County, California making substantially the same
allegations. The Company obtained an injunction preventing the case from
proceeding until the Fund 20 appeal is decided and other related proceedings in
Arizona (from which the Company has already been dismissed with prejudice) are
concluded.

 CANDLELIGHT PROPERTIES, L.L.C

     In 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Lending Partnership made loans to Candlelight
Properties, L.L.C. ("Borrower") in the aggregate principal amount of $8,050,000
(collectively, the "Loan". The Loan was secured by a mortgage on Candlelight
Village ("Candlelight"), a Property in Columbus, Indiana, and was guaranteed by
Ronald E. Farren, the 99% owner of Borrower. The Company accounted for the Loan
as an investment in real estate and, accordingly, Candlelight's rental revenues
and operating costs were included with the Company's rental revenues and
operating costs for financial reporting purposes. Concurrently with the funding
of the Loan, Borrower granted the Operating Partnership the option to acquire
Candlelight upon the maturity of the Loan. The Operating Partnership notified
Borrower that it was exercising its option to acquire Candlelight in March 1999,
and the Loan subsequently matured on May 3, 1999. However, Borrower failed to
repay the Loan and refused to convey Candlelight to the Operating Partnership.

     Borrower filed suit in the Circuit Court of Bartholomew County, Indiana
("Court") on May 5, 1999, seeking declaratory judgment on the validity of the
exercise of the option. The Lending Partnership filed suit in the Court the next
day, seeking to foreclose its mortgage, and the suits were consolidated by the
Court.

     On September 20, 2001, the parties entered into a settlement agreement
providing for a cash payment of $10.8 million to the Lending Partnership and
dismissal with prejudice of all litigation among the parties and their
affiliates, among other terms. The closing under the Settlement Agreement
occurred on October 5, 2001. The Company accounted for the Settlement as a
disposition of the property.

 WESTWINDS

     The Operating Partnership is the ground lessee ("Lessee") of certain
property in San Jose, California under ground leases ("Leases") from the
Nicholson Family Trust ("Lessor"). On February 13, 2001, Lessor filed a petition
for arbitration of disputes over whether certain items constitute "gross
revenue" under the Leases in which petition Lessor seeks damages and termination
of the Leases. Lessee responded on March 12, 2001 disputing Lessor's
contentions. Lessor claims that "gross revenue" for the purpose of calculating
percentage rent owing to Lessor under the ground leases includes certain amounts
Lessee has recouped from tenants of the Property (who are protected by rent
control) related to ground rent already paid to Lessor. Lessee has successfully
been able to pass-through to tenants at the property increases in ground rent
under the Leases. Lessee contends that this pass-through results in
reimbursement of lease expense, not "gross revenue." Lessor also contends that
the "net income" of RSI. from the Property should be included in the gross
revenue calculation. Lessee disputes this for many reasons, including, but not
limited to, the fact that RSI is not a lessee under the Leases, the sales
activity is not conducted by Lessee, and RSI is a separate company from Lessee.

     Lessor's motion for summary judgment on the pass-through issue was denied
by an arbitration panel on November 2, 2001. Lessor and Lessee have agreed to
mediate the dispute prior to arbitration. The Company does not believe that the
amounts in question are material even if resolved against the Lessee and, based
upon advice of counsel, does not believe that the Lessor will be successful in
terminating the Leases.

(1) See the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included elsewhere
    herein.

(2) The Company believes that the book value of the Properties, which reflects
    the historical costs of such real estate assets less accumulated
    depreciation, is less than the current market value of the Properties.

(3) The Company generally considers Funds From Operations ("FFO") to be an
    appropriate measure of the performance of an equity Real Estate Investment
    Trust ("REIT"). FFO was redefined by the National Association of Real Estate
    Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") in October 1999, effective January 1, 2000, as
    net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles ["GAAP"]), before allocation to minority interests, excluding
    gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and
    after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. For
    purposes of presenting FFO, the revised definition of FFO has been given
    retroactive treatment. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors
    as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash
    flows from operating activities, financing activities and investing
    activities, it provides investors an understanding of the ability of the
    Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. The
    Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition which may
    differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity
    REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs
    computations. FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated from
    operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be
    considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's
    performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by
    GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash
    available to fund cash needs.

(4) During the year ended December 31, 1997, 39 Properties were acquired; net
    operating income attributable to such Properties during 1997 was
    approximately $3.8 million, which included approximately $1.7 million of
    depreciation and amortization expense. During the year ended December 31,
    1998, 41 Properties were acquired; net operating income attributable to such
    Properties during 1998 was approximately $7.6 million, which included
    approximately $3.9 million of depreciation and amortization expense. During
    the year ended December 31, 1999, two Properties were acquired; net
    operating income attributable to such Properties during 1999 was
    approximately $87,000, which included approximately $104,000 of depreciation
    expense. During the year ended December 31, 2000, three Properties and a
    water and wastewater treatment company were sold; net operating income
    attributable to such Properties during 2000 was approximately $1.6 million,
    which included approximately $623,000 of depreciation expense. During the
    year ended December 31, 2001, two Properties were purchased; net operating
    income attributable to such Properties during 2001 was approximately $1.3
    million, which included approximately $396,000 of depreciation expense. Also
    during the year ended December 31, 2001, eight Properties were sold; net
    operating income attributable to such Properties during 2001 was $1.0
    million, which included approximately $235,000 of depreciation expense.

(5) Excludes recreational vehicle sites and sites held through unconsolidated
    joint ventures.

TRENDS

     Occupancy in the Company's Properties as well as the ability to increase
rental rates directly affects revenues. In 2001, occupancy in the Company's Core
Portfolio has remained relatively stable. Also during 2001, average monthly base
rental rates for the Core Portfolio increased approximately 4.5%. The Company
believes these trends will continue through 2002.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

     The Company's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
which require the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the
reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related
disclosures. The Company believes that the following critical accounting
policies, among others, affect its more significant judgments and estimates used
in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements.

     The Company periodically evaluates its long-lived assets, including its
investments in real estate for impairment indicators. The judgments regarding
the existence of impairment indicators, are based on factors such as operational
performance, market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur
which would cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an
impairment loss is warranted.

     The valuation of financial instruments under SFAS No. 107 and SFAS No. 133
requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value
of the instruments. The Company, where possible, bases the fair values of its

 COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000

     Since December 31, 1999, the gross investment in real estate increased from
$1,264 million to $1,238 million as of December 31, 2001, due primarily to the
aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period.
The total number of sites owned or controlled decreased from 54,002 as of
December 31, 1999 to 50,761 as of December 31, 2001.

     The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for
the Core Portfolio and the Total Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2001
and 2000.

(1) During 2001, at certain Properties the amounts charged to residents for
    utilities were separated ("Unbundled") from their base rent charges and
    recorded as utility income. For comparison purposes, a reclassification was
    made to base rental income for 2000 on this table. This reclassification is
    also reflected in the monthly base rent per site amounts for 2000.

(2) Income from operations for the Core Portfolio does not include an allocation
    of income from affiliates, interest income, corporate general and
    administrative expense, interest expense and related amortization or
    depreciation on corporate assets.

(3) Site and occupancy information does not include the Properties owned through
    unconsolidated joint ventures or the RV Properties.

 Revenues

     The 4.7% increase in base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a
4.5% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 0.2% increase in
average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for the Core
Portfolio is due primarily to increases in pass through items such as utilities
and real estate taxes -- which resulted from higher expenses for these items.
For the Total Portfolio, changes in base rental income and utility and other
income generally reflect those of the Core Portfolio and the effect of
acquisition and disposition of the Non-Core Properties.

     Equity in income of affiliates decreased 24.8%, reflecting lower sales
volumes. Combined home sales revenue decreased approximately $4.0 million, of
which $3.3 million is attributable to a decline in new home inventory sales
volume. Sales volumes for new home inventory, used home inventory and brokered
home sales were 485, 250 and 1,114, respectively, for the year ended December
31, 2001, and 535, 290 and 1,271, respectively, for the year ended December 31,
2000.

     The decrease in interest income is primarily due to the repayment of
certain notes receivable, fewer short-term investments and lower interest rates.
Short-term investments had average balances for the years ended December 31,
2001 and 2000 of approximately $1.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively,
which earned interest income at an effective rate of 3.8% and 6.0% per annum,
respectively.

 Operating Expenses

     The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core
Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility expenses passed through and
included in utility income. Expenses for the Core Portfolio also reflect
increases in payroll and property insurance expenses. Core Portfolio real estate
taxes increased 2.8% generally due to higher assessed values on certain
Properties. The increase in Total Portfolio property operating and maintenance
expense and real estate taxes is also impacted by acquisition and disposition of
Non-Core Properties. Property management expense allocated to the Core
Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties and is estimated
based on a percentage of Property revenues, increased 5.8%.

     General and administrative expenses ("G&A") increased 4.1% due to increased
public company costs and related expenses and promotional costs. G&A for 2001
includes a charge for additional amortization of deferred compensation offset by
a reversal of legal expenses previously accrued related to the Ellenburg
settlement.

     Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower interest rates
during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years
ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 were $713.2 million and $707.5 million,
respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.0% and 7.4% per annum for the
years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     Depreciation on corporate assets increased due to fixed asset additions
related to information and communication systems. Depreciation on real estate
assets and other costs increased due primarily to the acquisition and
disposition of Non-Core Properties.

 COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999

     Since December 31, 1998, the gross investment in real estate decreased from
$1,237 million to $1,218 million as of December 31, 2000, due primarily to the
aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period.
The total number of sites owned or controlled decreased from 53,009 as of
December 31, 1998 to 51,452 as of December 31, 2000.

 Revenues

     The 4.5% increase in base rental income for the Core Portfolio reflects a
3.9% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 0.6% increase in
average occupied sites. The 4.3% increase in base rental income for the Total
Portfolio reflects a 3.8% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a
0.5% increase in average occupied sites and also reflects the acquisition and
disposition of Non-Core Properties. The increase in utility and other income for
the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in pass through items such as
utilities and real estate taxes -- which resulted from higher expenses for these
items. The decrease in Total Portfolio utility and other income is due primarily
to the sale of Mesa Regal RV resort and other changes in the Non-Core
Properties. Also included in other income is a gain on the sale of the FFEC-Six
water and wastewater treatment company of $719,000, partially offset by an
impairment loss on the DeAnza Santa Cruz water and wastewater service company of
$701,000.

     The decrease in interest income is primarily due to the repayment of
certain notes receivable and fewer short-term investments. Short-term
investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 2000
and 1999 of approximately $1.5 million and $2.8 million, respectively, which
earned interest income at an effective rate of 6.0% and 6.3% per annum,
respectively.

 Operating Expenses

     The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core
Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility expenses passed through and
included in utility income. Expenses for the Core Portfolio also reflect
increases in repairs and maintenance expense, payroll and property general and
administrative expenses partially offset by decreased insurance and other
expenses. Core Portfolio real estate taxes increased 2.4% generally due to
higher property assessments on certain Properties. The increase in Total
Portfolio property operating and maintenance expense and real estate taxes is
also impacted by acquisition and disposition of Non-Core Properties. Property
management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the
Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property revenues,
increased 6.1%.

     General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased
payroll resulting from salary increases and increased public company related
expenses.

     Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower weighted average
outstanding debt balances during the period. The weighted average outstanding
debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 were $707.5 million
and $738.1 million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.4% and 7.2%
per annum for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     Depreciation on corporate assets increased due to fixed asset additions
related to information and communication systems. Depreciation on real estate
assets and other costs decreased due primarily to the acquisition and
disposition of Non-Core Properties.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 LIQUIDITY

     As of December 31, 2001, the Company had $1.4 million in cash and cash
equivalents and $133.8 million available on its line of credit. The Company
expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its
distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by
operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit. The
Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as
scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by
long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings
under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or
additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to working capital.

     In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company
must distribute 95% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains). The
following distributions have been declared and/or paid to common stockholders
and minority interests since January 1, 1999.

     The Operating Partnership paid distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125
million of Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units ("Preferred
Units"). Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid quarterly on the last
calendar day of each quarter beginning December 31, 1999. The Company expects to
continue to make regular quarterly distributions and has set its 2002
distribution to common stockholders at $1.90 per share per annum.

 MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES

     On October 29, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement, fixing the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") on $100 million of
the Company's floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period
October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the swap require monthly
settlements on the same dates interest payments are due on the debt. In
accordance with SFAS No. 133 as herein defined, the interest rate swap will be
reflected at market value. The Company believes the swap is a perfectly
effective cash flow hedge, under SFAS No. 133 and there will be no effect on net
income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustments.

     During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company borrowed $46.0 million
on its line of credit and paid down $89.7 million on the line of credit. The
line of credit bears interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 1.125%.

     In July of 2001, the Company paid off three maturing mortgages in the
amount of $12.1 million. The payoffs were funded with borrowings on the line of
credit.
                                        26
<PAGE>

     On August 3, 2001, the Company entered into a $50.0 million mortgage note
(the "Stagecoach Mortgage") collateralized by 7 Properties beneficially owned by
MHC Stagecoach, L.L.C. The Stagecoach Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 6.98%
per annum, amortizes beginning September 1, 2001 over 10 years and matures
August 31, 2011. Proceeds from the financing were used to reduce borrowings on
the line of credit by $37.9 million.

     On February 24, 2000, the Company entered into mortgage agreements
collateralizing two Properties for a total of $14.6 million. The mortgage notes
mature on March 1, 2010, amortize beginning March 1, 2000 over 30 years and bear
interest at a rate of approximately 8.3% per annum.

     On April 3, 2000, the Company extended to April 3, 2002 the maturity of its
$100 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of banks with
interest only payable monthly at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%. On
February 8, 2002, the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement with the
same group of banks, which extended the Term Loan to August 9, 2005.

     On June 30, 2000, the Company obtained $110 million in debt financing
consisting of two mortgage notes -- one for $94.3 million and one for $15.7
million -- secured by seven Properties. The proceeds of the financing were used
to repay $60 million of mortgage debt secured by the seven Properties, to repay
amounts outstanding under the Company's line of credit and for working capital
purposes. The Company recorded a $1.0 million extraordinary loss (net of
$264,000 allocated to Minority Interests) in connection with the early repayment
of the $60 million of mortgage debt.

     On August 9, 2000, the Company amended its unsecured line of credit with a
bank (the "Credit Agreement") bearing interest at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus
1.125%. Among other things, the amendment lowered the total facility under the
Credit Agreement to $150 million and extended the maturity to August 9, 2003.
The Company pays a quarterly fee on the average unused amount of such credit
equal to 0.15% of such amount. As of December 31, 2001, $133.8 million was
available under the Credit Agreement.

     Certain of the Company's mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants
and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured
debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed
charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
("EBITDA"), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.

 ACQUISITIONS, DISPOSITIONS AND INVESTMENTS

     On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase
agreement (as amended by a supplemental agreement on December 17, 1997) to
acquire 37 manufactured home communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from
partnerships having Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general
partner, for a purchase price in excess of $300 million. During 1997 and 1998,
the Company closed on the acquisition of 31 of the Ellenburg Communities for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $278 million and gained control of an
additional five Ellenburg Communities with acquisition advances of approximately
$57 million to the partnerships which owned such Ellenburg Communities. All
fundings related to the acquisition were funded by the Company with borrowings
under the Company's line of credit, term bank facilities, assumed debt and the
issuance of Common OP Units.

     During 1998, the Company received approximately $14.3 million, including
approximately $365,000 of interest income, which was being held subject to the
completion of due diligence procedures on the Ellenburg Communities. The $14.3
million was initially recorded as a liability until 1999 when a settlement of
certain related issues was substantially complete and accordingly, in a non-cash
transaction, relieved the liability and adjusted the purchase price of the
Ellenburg Communities.

     In April 2000, the California Superior Court approved a settlement
agreement (the "Settlement") in connection with the dissolution proceeding of
ECC and its affiliated partnerships. As part of the Settlement, the Company
received $13.5 million previously held in escrow in connection with the purchase
of the Ellenburg Communities and recorded $3.0 million of interest income
related to these funds. In connection with the Settlement, the Company sold
three communities -- Mesa Regal RV Resort, Mon Dak and Naples Estates -- for an
aggregate sales price of $59.0 million, including cash proceeds of $40.0 million
and assumption of debt by the purchaser of $19.0 million. The Company recorded a
$9.1 million gain on the sale of these Properties. Proceeds from the Settlement
and property sales were used to pay down the Company's line of credit.


                                        27
<PAGE>
     On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3 million loan (the "Meadows
Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan was collateralized by The
Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. On
April 1, 1999, the Company effectively exchanged the Meadows Loan for an equity
and debt interest in the partnership that owns The Meadows. The Company includes
The Meadows in investment in real estate and the related results of operations
in the Statement of Operations.

     On July 23, 1999, the Company acquired Coquina Crossing, located in St.
Augustine, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $10.4 million. The
acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.
Coquina Crossing is a 748-site senior community with 274 developed sites and
zoned expansion potential for 479 sites. In addition, Realty Systems, Inc.
("RSI"), an affiliate of the Company, purchased the model home inventory at the
community for approximately $1.1 million.

     On February 29, 2000, MHC Systems, Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of the
Company, disposed of the water and wastewater service company and facilities
known as FFEC-Six in a cash sale. Net proceeds from the sale of approximately
$4.2 million were used to pay down the Company's line of credit .

     On December 28, 2000, the Company, through its joint venture with Meadows
Management Company, acquired a 50% economic interest in Voyager RV Resort, a
1,576 site RV resort in Tucson, Arizona, for total consideration of $8.0
million. The Company's investment included cash of $3.0 million, its 50%
interest in land held through the joint venture valued at $2.0 million and notes
receivable from the principals of Meadows Management Company totaling $3.0
million.

     On January 3, 2001, the Company acquired two Florida Properties, totaling
730 sites, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $16.3 million. The
Lakes at Countrywood is a 421-site community in Plant City, near Tampa, Florida,
and includes approximately 23 acres for expansion. Grand Island is a 309-site
community in Grand Island, near Orlando, Florida, and includes a marina with 50
boat docks. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line
of credit.

     On February 13, 2001, the Company completed the disposition of seven
Properties, totaling 1,281 sites, in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, for a total
sale price of approximately $17.4 million. A gain of $8.1 million was recorded
on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Proceeds from the
sale were used to reduce the amount outstanding on the Company's line of credit.

     On October 5, 2001, the Company finalized a settlement agreement between
the Lending Partnership, the Operating Partnership and the limited liability
partnership which owns Candlelight Village in Columbus, Indiana. In 1996, the
Company funded a recourse loan to the owner of Candlelight Village and accounted
for the loan as an investment in real estate. The Company received $10.8 million
in proceeds from the settlement, which was accounted for as a sale of real
estate and recorded a $75,000 gain on the sale. Proceeds from the sale were used
as working capital.

 CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

     Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as
recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and
corporate headquarters costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $12.7 million
and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively.
Of these expenditures, the Company believes that approximately $7.1 million or
$142 per site for 2001 and $6.5 million or $130 per site for 2000 are
non-revenue producing improvements which are necessary in order to increase
and/or maintain occupancy levels and maintain competitive market rents for new
and renewing residents. Site development costs were approximately $9.7 million
and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's
Properties.

 EQUITY TRANSACTIONS

     On March 26, 1999, the Operating Partnership repurchased and cancelled
200,000 OP Units from a limited partner of the Operating Partnership.


                                        28
<PAGE>
     On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125 million
private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Units ("POP
Units") to two institutional investors. The POP Units, which are callable by the
Company after five years, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net
proceeds from the offering of $121 million were used to repay amounts
outstanding under the Company's line of credit facility and for other corporate
purposes.

     In March 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a common stock
repurchase plan whereby the Company was authorized to repurchase and retire
shares of its common stock. No shares of Common Stock were repurchased during
the year ended December 31, 2001. However, under the plan, the Company
repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of Common Stock at an average price
of $24.06 per share during the year ended December 31, 2000 and 4.1 million
shares of Common Stock at an average price of $23.40 per share during the year
ended December 31, 1999, using proceeds from borrowings on the line of credit.

 INFLATION

     Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or
annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve
increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of
leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.

 FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

     FFO was redefined by NAREIT in October 1999, effective January 1, 2000, as
net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority
interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate
depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint
ventures. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition,
which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other
equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REIT's
computations. Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO less
non-revenue producing capital expenditures and amortization payments on mortgage
loan principal. The Company believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as
a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows
from operating activities, financing activities and investing activities, they
provide investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and
service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO and FAD in and of themselves
do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with
GAAP and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an
indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating
activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

     The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years
ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (amounts in thousands):

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF MARKET RISK

     The Company's earnings are affected by changes in interest rates, as a
portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on
LIBOR. The Company's $150 million line of credit ($16.3 million outstanding at
December 31, 2001) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% per annum and the
Company's $100 million Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0% per annum. If
LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0% during 2001, interest expense would have
increased/decreased by approximately $1.4 million based on the combined average
balance outstanding under the Company's line of credit and Term Loan for the
year ended December 31, 2001.

     In July 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
"1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at
6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only
of legal costs that were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap was
impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been
entered into on December 31, 1999, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have
been approximately 6.57%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap
rate for the 1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus
its current value by approximately $28,000. The Company accounted for the 1998
Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap were accounted for as
an adjustment to interest expense. On January 10, 2000, the Company unwound the
1998 Swap and received $1.0 million of proceeds which is amortized into interest
expense through March 2003.

     On October 29, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement, fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at
approximately 3.7% for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of
the swap require monthly settlements on the same dates that interest payments
are due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the interest rate swap is
reflected at market value. The Company believes the swap is a perfectly
effective cash flow hedge per SFAS No. 133 and there will be no effect on net
income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustment. The value of the hedge as
of December 31, 2001 was approximately $489,000 and is recorded as an asset and
included in other assets. Mark-to-market change in the value of the swap are
included in other comprehensive income.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities" and its amendments, Statements 137 and 138 in June 1999 and
June 2000, respectively. SFAS No. 133 permits early adoption as of the beginning
of any fiscal quarter after its issuance. In June 1999, the FASB issued
Statement No. 137 which deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to all
fiscal quarters for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company
adopted SFAS No. 133 effective January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires the
Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income.
If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in
the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair
value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings.

are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Manufactured
Home Communities, Inc. at December 31, 2001 and 2000, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2001, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                      MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, the "Company"), formed in March 1993, is a Maryland corporation
which has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The
Company owns or has a controlling interest in 148 manufactured home communities
(the "Properties") located in 23 states, consisting of 50,761 sites. The Company
generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it distributes
its REIT taxable income to its stockholders.

     The operations of the Company are conducted through certain entities that
are owned or controlled by the Company. MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership") is the entity through which the Company conducts
substantially all of its operations. The Company contributed the proceeds from
its initial public offering to the Operating Partnership for a general
partnership interest. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership (the
"Common OP Unitholders") receive an allocation of net income which is based on
their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership which is
shown on the Consolidated Financial Statements as Minority Interests -- Common
OP Units. As of December 31, 2001, the Minority Interests -- Common OP Units
represented 5,426,374 units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") which
are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of the Company's Common
stock. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or common OP Units
changes the respective ownership of the Operating Partnership for both the
Minority Interests and the Company.

     Subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership have been created to (i)
facilitate mortgage financing (the "Financing Partnerships"); (ii) facilitate
the Company's ability to provide financing to owners of manufactured home
communities ("Lending Partnership"); (iii) own the management operations of the
Company ("Management Partnership"); and (iv) own the assets and operations of
certain utility companies which service the Company's Properties ("MHC
Systems").

     The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated financial
information of the Company and its subsidiaries. Due to the Company's ability as
general partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating
Partnership, the Financing Partnerships, the Lending Partnership, the Management
Partnership and MHC Systems, each such subsidiary has been consolidated with the
Company for financial reporting purposes.

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, "Disclosures about
Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" ("SFAS No. 131") requires
certain disclosures of selected information about operating segments in the
annual financial statements and related disclosures about products and services,
geographic areas, and major customers. The adoption of SFAS No. 131, in June
1998, did not affect the results of operations or financial position of the
Company. The Company manages operations on a property by property basis. Since
each property has similar economic and operational characteristics, the Company
has one reportable segment, which is the operation of manufactured home
communities. The Company has concentrations of Properties within the following
states: Florida (49 Properties), California (25 Properties), Arizona (17
Properties), Michigan (11 Properties) and Colorado (10 Properties). These
concentrations of Properties accounted for 36%, 19%, 8%, 4% and 8%,
respectively, of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31,
2001. The Company also has Properties located in the following areas of the
United States: Northeast, Northwest, Midwest, and Nevada/Utah/New Mexico. The
Company's largest Property, Bay Indies, located in Venice, Florida, accounted
for 3% of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001. The
distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects the
Company's belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio
from regional economic influences. The Company intends to target new
acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located and will also
consider acquisitions of properties outside such markets.

NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

  (a) Basis of Consolidation

     The Company consolidates all majority owed subsidiaries due to its ability
  to control the operations of the subsidiaries. All inter-company transactions
  have been eliminated in consolidation.

                                      F-7

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

 (b) Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
 principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make
 estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
 liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
 the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
 during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

 (c) Real Estate

     Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. The Company
 evaluates rental Properties for impairment when conditions exist which may
 indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows
 (undiscounted) from a Property is less than its carrying value. Upon
 determination that a permanent impairment has occurred, rental Properties are
 reduced to fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2001, permanent
 impairment conditions did not exist at any of the Company's Properties. During
 the year ended December 31, 2000, MHC Acquisition One L.L.C., a consolidated
 subsidiary of the Company, recorded an impairment loss on the DeAnza Santa Cruz
 water and wastewater service company business (see Notes 5 and 17). In August
 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial
 Accounting Standards No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived
 Assets" which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001.
 The application of the provisions of this Statement is not expected to affect
 the earnings and financial position of the Company.

     Certain costs, including legal costs, relative to efforts by the Company to
 effectively change the use and operations of several Properties are currently
 recorded in other assets. These costs, to the extent these efforts are
 successful, are capitalized to the extent of the established value of the
 revised project and included in the net investment in real estate for the
 appropriate Properties. To the extent these efforts are not successful, these
 costs will be expensed.

     Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated
 useful lives of the assets. The Company uses a 30-year estimated life for
 buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year
 estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life
 for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance
 and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and significant renovations
 and improvements that improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset
 are capitalized over their estimated useful life. Initial direct leasing costs
 are expensed as incurred. Total depreciation expense was $36.1 million, $35.6
 million and $35.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999,
 respectively.

 (d) Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The Company considers all demand and money market accounts and certificates
 of deposit with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash
 equivalents.

 (e) Notes Receivable

     Notes receivable generally are stated at their outstanding unpaid principal
 balances net of any deferred fees or costs on originated loans, or unamortized
 discounts or premiums. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal
 balance. Discounts or premiums are amortized to income using the interest
 method.

 (f) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires disclosures about the fair value
 of financial instruments whether or not such instruments are recognized in the
 balance sheet. The Company's financial instruments include short-term
 investments, notes receivable, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other
 accrued expenses, mortgage notes payable and interest rate hedge arrangements.
 The fair values of all financial instruments, including notes receivable, were
 not materially different from their carrying values at December 31, 2001 and
 2000.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

 (g) Deferred Financing Costs

     Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain
 long-term financing. The costs are being amortized over the terms of the
 respective loans on a level yield basis. Unamortized deferred financing fees
 are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date. Accumulated
 amortization for such costs was $3.0 million and $1.9 million at December 31,
 2001 and 2000, respectively.

 (h) Revenue Recognition

     Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when earned from tenants.
 The Company will reserve for receivables when the Company believes the ultimate
 collection is less than probable.

 (i) Minority Interests

     Net income is allocated to Common OP Unitholders based on their respective
 ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. An ownership percentage is
 represented by dividing the number of Common OP Units held by the Common OP
 Unitholders (5,426,374 and 5,514,330 at December 31, 2001 and 2000,
 respectively) by OP Units and Common Stock outstanding. Issuance of additional
 shares of Common Stock or common OP Units changes the percentage ownership of
 both the Minority Interests and the Company. Due in part to the exchange rights
 (which provide for the conversion of Common OP Units into Common Stock on a
 one-for-one basis), such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are treated as
 capital transactions and result in an allocation between stockholders' equity
 and Minority Interests to account for the change in the respective percentage
 ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

     On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125 million
 private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Units ("POP
 Units") with two institutional investors. The POP Units, which are callable by
 the Company after five years, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption,
 have no voting rights and are not convertible into OP Units or Common Stock.
 Income is allocated to the POP Units at a preferred rate per annum of 9.0% on
 the original capital contribution of $125 million. Costs related to the
 placement of $3.1 million were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in
 capital.

 (j) Income Taxes

     Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT, the results of operations
 contain no provision for Federal income taxes. However, the Company may be
 subject to certain state and local income, excise or franchise taxes. The
 Company paid state and local taxes of approximately $50,000, $78,000 and
 $85,000 during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.
 As of December 31, 2001, net investment in real estate and notes receivable had
 a Federal tax basis of approximately $710 million and $20 million,
 respectively.

 (k) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
 Statement No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
 Hedging Activities" and its amendments, Statements 137 and 138 in June of 1999
 and June of 2000, respectively. The Company adopted SFAS No. 133 effective
 January 1, 2001. SFAS No. 133 requires the Company to recognize all derivatives
 on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be
 adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending
 on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of derivatives will
 either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets,
 liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other
 comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. On
 October 29, 2001, the Company entered into a swap agreement. (see Note 10)

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 3 -- EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

     Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of
 common shares outstanding during each year. Statement of Financial Accounting
 Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128") defines the
 calculation of basic and fully diluted earnings per share. Basic and fully
 diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted average shares outstanding
 during each year and basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of
 options, warrants and convertible securities. The conversion of OP Units has
 been excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation. The conversion of
 an OP Unit to a share of common stock has no material effect on earnings per
 common share.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
 earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, 1999 (amounts
 in thousands):

NOTE 4 -- COMMON STOCK AND OTHER EQUITY RELATED TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     In March 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Common Stock
repurchase plan whereby the Company was authorized to repurchase and retire
shares of its Common Stock. No shares of Common Stock were repurchased during
the year ended December 31, 2001. However, under the plan, the Company
repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of Common Stock at an average price
of $24.06 per share during the year ended December 31, 2000 and approximately
4.0 million shares of Common Stock at an average price of $23.40 per share
during the year ended December 31, 1999, using proceeds from borrowings on the
line of credit.

     During the year ended December 31, 2000, the Operating Partnership
repurchased and cancelled approximately 60,000 OP Units from various holders. On
March 26, 1999, the Operating Partnership repurchased and cancelled 200,000 OP
Units from a limited partner of the Operating Partnership.

     On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125 million
private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Units ("POP
Units") with two institutional investors. The POP Units, which are callable by
the Company after five years, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption.
Net proceeds from the offering of $121 million were used to repay amounts
outstanding under the Company's line of credit facility and for other corporate
purposes.

     The following distributions have been declared and/or paid to common
stockholders and Minority Interests since January 1, 1999.

The Operating Partnership pays distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125
million of POP Units. Distributions on the POP Units were paid quarterly on the

Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). Pursuant to the ESPP, certain employees
and directors of the Company may each annually acquire up to $250,000 of Common
Stock of the Company. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available
under the ESPP shall not exceed 1,000,000, subject to adjustment by the Board of
Directors. The Common Stock may be purchased monthly at a price equal to 85% of
the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share of Common Stock on the last day
of such month; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share of
Common Stock on the first day of such month, and (ii) the average closing price
for a share of Common Stock for all the business days in the month. Shares of
Common Stock issued through the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000

NOTE 5 -- INVESTMENT IN REAL ESTATE

     Land improvements consist primarily of improvements such as grading,
landscaping and infrastructure items such as streets, sidewalks or water mains.
Depreciable property consists of permanent buildings in the Properties such as
clubhouses, laundry facilities, maintenance storage facilities, and furniture,
fixtures and equipment.

     On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase
agreement (as amended by a supplemental agreement on December 17, 1997) to
acquire 37 manufactured home communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from
partnerships having Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general
partner, for a purchase price in excess of $300 million. During 1997 and 1998,
the Company closed on the acquisition of 31 of the Ellenburg Communities for an
aggregate purchase price of approximately $278 million and gained control of an
additional five Ellenburg Communities with acquisition advances of approximately
$57 million to the partnerships which owned such Ellenburg Communities. All
fundings related to the acquisition were funded by the Company with borrowings
under the Company's line of credit, term bank facilities, assumed debt and the
issuance of Common OP Units.

     During 1998, the Company received approximately $14.3 million, including
approximately $365,000 of interest income, which was being held subject to the
completion of due diligence procedures on the Ellenburg Communities. The $14.3
million was initially recorded as a liability until 1999 when a settlement of
certain related issues was substantially complete and accordingly, in a non-cash
transaction, relieved the liability and adjusted the purchase price of the
Ellenburg Communities.

     In April 2000, the California Superior Court approved a settlement
agreement (the "Settlement") in connection with the dissolution proceeding of
ECC and its affiliated partnerships. As part of the Settlement, the Company
received $13.5 million previously held in escrow in connection with the purchase
of the Ellenburg Communities and recorded $3.0 million of interest income
related to these funds. In connection with the Settlement, the Company sold
three communities -- Mesa Regal RV Resort, Mon Dak and Naples Estates -- for an
aggregate sales price of $59.0 million, including cash proceeds of $40.0 million
and assumption of debt by the purchaser of $19.0 million. The Company recorded a
$9.1 million gain on the sale of these Properties. Proceeds from the Settlement
and property sales were used to pay down the Company's line of credit. See Note
17 for further discussion of the Settlement.

     On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3 million loan (the "Meadows
Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan was collateralized by The
Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. On
April 1, 1999, the Company effectively exchanged the Meadows Loan for an equity
and debt interest in the partnership that owns The Meadows. The Company includes
The Meadows in investment in real estate and the related results of operations
in the statement of operations.

     On July 23, 1999, the Company acquired Coquina Crossing, located in St.
Augustine, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $10.4 million. The
acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.
Coquina Crossing is a 748-site senior community with 269 developed sites and
zoned expansion potential for 479 sites. In addition, Realty Systems, Inc.
purchased the model home inventory at the community for approximately $1.1
million.

     In March 2000, in accordance with SFAS No. 121 "Accounting for the
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed of ",
MHC Acquisition One L.L.C., a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, recorded
an impairment loss on the DeAnza Santa Cruz water and wastewater service company
business. Management's estimates indicated that the undiscounted future cash
flows from the business would be less than the carrying value of the business
and its related assets. The Company recorded an asset impairment loss of
$701,000 (or $0.03 per fully diluted share) which is included as a reduction of
other income in the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2000. This loss represents the difference between the carrying
value of the DeAnza Santa Cruz water and wastewater service company business and
its related assets and their estimated fair market value.

     On February 29, 2000, MHC Systems, Inc., a consolidated subsidiary of the
Company, disposed of the water and wastewater service company known as FFEC-Six
in a cash sale. Net proceeds from the sale of approximately $4.2 million were
used to pay down the Company's line of credit and a gain on the sale of $719,000
(or $0.03 per fully diluted share) was recorded in other income on the
accompanying statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2000.

     On January 3, 2001, the Company acquired two Florida communities, totaling
730 sites, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17.3 million. The
Lakes at Countrywood is a 422-site community in Plant City, near Tampa, Florida
and includes approximately 23 acres for expansion. Grand Island is a 308-site
community in Grand Island, near Orlando, Florida, and includes a marina with 50
boat docks. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line
of credit.

     On February 13, 2001, the Company completed the disposition of the
following seven communities, totaling 1,281 sites, in Kansas, Missouri and
Oklahoma, for a total sale price of approximately $17.4 million:

                  Rockwood................      264 sites
</Table>

A gain of $8.1 million was recorded on the sale. Proceeds from the sale were
used to reduce the amount outstanding on the Company's line of credit.

     Effective June 30, 2001, the Company terminated its lease to a third-party
operator for the campground and RV resort facilities at the Property known as
Bulow Plantation in Flagler Beach, Florida, and assumed operation of these
facilities directly. Beginning July 1, 2001 the Company no longer records lease
income from Bulow RV Resort, however, the results of operations for Bulow RV
Resort are included in the Company's results of operations.

     On October 5, 2001, the Company finalized a settlement agreement between
MHC Lending Partnership, the Operating Partnership and the limited liability
company which owns Candlelight in Columbus, Indiana. In 1996, the Company funded
a recourse loan to the owner of Candlelight Village and accounted for the loan
as an investment in real estate. The Company received $10.8 million in proceeds
from the settlement, which was accounted for as a sale of real estate and
recorded a $75,000 gain on the sale. Proceeds from the sale were used as working
capital.

     The acquisitions have been accounted for utilizing the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired assets are
included in the statements of operations from the dates of acquisition. The
Company acquired all of the Properties from unaffiliated third parties.

     During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company capitalized
approximately $2.4 million of costs, including legal costs, relative to efforts
by the Company to effectively change the use and operations of several
Properties which are currently recorded in other assets. These costs will be
expensed if management determines these efforts will not be successful.

     The Company is actively seeking to acquire additional manufactured home
communities and currently is engaged in negotiations relating to the possible
acquisition of a number of communities. At any time these negotiations are at
varying stages which may include contracts outstanding to acquire certain
manufactured home communities which are subject to satisfactory completion of
the Company's due diligence review.

NOTE 6 -- INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE

     On March 18, 1998, the Company joined Plantation Company, L.L.C. and Trails
Associates, L.L.C., two 50% joint venture investments with the principals of
Meadows Management Company, to own two manufactured home communities known as
"Plantation on the Lake" and "Trails West", for approximately $6.5 million.
Plantation on the Lake is located in Riverside, California and consists of 385
developed sites and 122 expansion sites. Trails West is located in Tucson,
Arizona and consists of 488 developed sites. The Company's investments were
funded with a $3.9 million borrowing under the Company's line of credit and with
the issuance of approximately $2.6 million in OP Units.

     On December 28, 2000, the Company, through a joint venture with the
principals of Meadows Management Company (the "Voyager Joint Venture"), acquired
a 25% interest in Voyager RV Resort, a 1,576 site RV resort in Tucson, Arizona,
for total consideration of $4.0 million. Voyager RV Resort is adjacent to Trails
West. The Company's investment included cash of $3.0 million and its 50%
interest in land held through the Trails West joint venture valued at $2.0
million.

     Due to the Company's inability to control the joint ventures, the Company
accounts for its investment in the joint ventures using the equity method of
accounting. The Company recorded approximately $283,000 and $8,000 of net income
from joint ventures in the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively;
and received approximately $1.6 million and $400,000 in distributions.

Common OP Units and partnership interests in this and other joint ventures. The
notes bear interest at prime plus 0.5% per annum, require quarterly interest
payments and mature on December 31, 2011. The outstanding balance on these notes
as of December 31, 2001 is $1.5 million.

NOTE 9 -- EMPLOYEE NOTES RECEIVABLE

     As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, the Company had employee notes receivable
of approximately $3.8 million and $4.2 million respectively, collateralized by
the Company's Common Stock. These notes are presented as a reduction of
Stockholder's Equity.

     In December 1992, certain directors, officers and other individuals each
entered into subscription agreements with the Company to acquire a total of
440,000 shares of the Company's common stock at $7.25 per share. The Company
received from these individuals notes (the "1993 Employee Notes") in exchange
for their shares. The 1993 Employee Notes accrue interest at 6.77% per annum,
mature on March 2, 2003, and are recourse against the employees in the event the
pledged shares are insufficient to repay the obligations.

     On January 2, 1996, certain members of management of the Company entered
into subscription agreements with the Company to acquire a total of 270,000
shares of the Company's Common Stock at $17.375 per share, the market price on
that date. The Company received from these individuals notes (the "1996 Employee
Notes") in exchange for their shares. The 1996 Employee Notes accrue interest at
5.91% per annum, mature on January 2, 2005, and are recourse against the
employees in the event the pledged shares are insufficient to repay the
obligations.

NOTE 10 -- LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

     As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the Company had outstanding
mortgage indebtedness of approximately $590.4 million and $556.6 million,
respectively, encumbering 77 and 73 of the Company's Properties, respectively.
As of December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000, the carrying value of such
Properties was approximately $693 million and $631 million, respectively.

     On August 3, 2001, the Company entered into a $50.0 million mortgage note
(the "Stagecoach Mortgage") collateralized by 7 Properties. The proceeds were
used to repay amounts under the Company's line of credit and for working capital
purposes.

     The outstanding mortgage indebtedness as of December 31, 2001 consists of:

     - A $265.0 million mortgage note (the "$265 Million Mortgage")
       collateralized by 29 Properties beneficially owned by MHC Financing
       Limited Partnership. The $265 Million Mortgage has a maturity date of
       January 2, 2028 and pays interest at 7.015%. There is no principal
       amortization until February 1, 2008, after which principal and interest
       are to be paid from available cash flow and the interest rate will be
       reset at a rate equal to the then 10-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus
       2.0%. The $265 Million Mortgage is presented net of a settled hedge of
       $3.0 million (net of accumulated amortization of $137,000) which is being
       amortized into interest expense over the life of the loan.

     - A $65.9 million mortgage note (the "College Heights Mortgage")
       collateralized by 18 Properties. The College Heights Mortgage bears
       interest at a rate of 7.19%, amortizes beginning July 1, 1999 over 30
       years and matures July 1, 2008.

     - A $93.0 million mortgage note (the "DeAnza Mortgage") collateralized by 6
       Properties beneficially owned by MHC-DeAnza Financing Limited
       Partnership. The DeAnza Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 7.82%,
       amortizes beginning August 1, 2000 over 30 years and matures July 1,
       2010.

       1, 2001 over 10 years and matures September 1, 2011.

     - A $22.5 million mortgage note (the "Bay Indies Mortgage") collateralized
       by one Property beneficially owned by MHC-Bay Indies Financing Limited
       Partnership. The Bay Indies Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 7.48%,
       amortizes beginning August 1, 1994 over 27.5 years and matures July 1,
       2004.

     - A $15.6 million mortgage note (the "Date Palm Mortgage") collateralized
       by one Property beneficially owned by MHC Date Palm, L.L.C. The Date Palm
       Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 7.96%, amortizes beginning August 1,
       2000 over 30 years and matures July 1, 2010.

     - Approximately $78.5 million of mortgage debt on 15 other various
       Properties, which was recorded at fair market value with the related
       discount or premium being amortized over the life of the loan using the
       effective interest rate. Scheduled maturities for the outstanding
       indebtedness are at various dates through November 30, 2020, and fixed
       interest rates range from 7.15% to 8.75%. Included in this debt, the
       Company has a $2.4 million loan recorded to account for a direct
       financing lease entered into in May 1997.

     On August 9, 2000, the Company amended its unsecured line of credit with a
group of banks (the "Credit Agreement") bearing interest at the London Interbank
Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.125%. Among other things, the amendment lowered
the total facility under the Credit Agreement to $150 million and extended the
maturity to August 9, 2003. The Company pays a quarterly fee on the average
unused amount of such credit equal to 0.15% of such amount. As of December 31,
2001, $133.8 million was available under the Credit Agreement.

NOTE 10 -- LONG-TERM BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)

     The Company has a $100 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") with a
group of banks with interest only payable monthly at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%.
The Term Loan maturity has been extended to April 3, 2002. On February 8, 2002,
the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement with the same group of
banks, which extended the Term Loan to August 9, 2005.

     On October 29, 2001, the Company entered into an interest rate swap
agreement, fixing at LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt
at approximately 3.7% for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms
of the swap require monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments are
due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the interest rate swap will be
reflected at market value. The Company believes the swap is a perfectly
effective cash flow hedge under SFAS No. 133 and there will be no effect on net
income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustment. As of December 31, 2001 the
swap had a market value of $489,000 which is included in other assets. The
effect of the mark-to-market adjustment, is reflected in other comprehensive
income.

     In July 1998, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
"1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at
6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The value of the 1998 Swap was impacted
by changes in the market rate of interest. The Company accounted for the 1998
Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap were accounted for as
an adjustment to interest expense. On January 10, 2000, the Company terminated
the 1998 Swap and received $1.0 million of proceeds which is being amortized as
an adjustment to interest expense through March 2003.

     The Company has approximately $2.2 million of installment notes payable,
secured by a letter of credit, each with an interest rate of 6.5%, maturing
September 1, 2002. Approximately $900,000 of the notes pay principal annually
and interest quarterly and the remaining $1.3 million of the notes pay interest
only quarterly.

     Aggregate payments of principal on long-term borrowings for each of the
next five years and thereafter are as follows (amounts in thousands):

NOTE 11 -- LEASE AGREEMENTS

     The leases entered into between the tenant and the Company for the rental
of a site are month-to-month or for a period of one to ten years, renewable upon
the consent of the parties or, in some instances, as provided by statute.
Noncancelable long-term leases are in effect at certain sites within 22 of the
Properties. Rental rate increases at these Properties are primarily a function
of increases in the Consumer Price Index, taking into consideration certain
floors and ceilings. Additionally, periodic market rate adjustments are made as
deemed necessary. Future minimum rents are scheduled to be received under

NOTE 14 -- STOCK OPTION PLAN AND STOCK GRANTS

     A Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") was adopted by the Company in December
1992. Pursuant to the Plan, certain officers, directors, employees and
consultants of the Company may be offered the opportunity to acquire shares of
Common Stock through the grant of stock options ("Options"), including
non-qualified stock options and, for key employees, incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Compensation
Committee will determine the vesting schedule, if any, of each Option and the
term, which term shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. As to the
Options that have been granted through December 31, 2001, generally, one-third
are exercisable one year after the initial grant, one-third are exercisable two
years following the date such Options were granted and the remaining one-third
are exercisable three years following the date such Options were granted. The
Plan allows for 10,000 Options to be granted annually to each director. The
Common Stock with respect to which the Options may be granted during any
calendar year to any grantee shall not exceed 250,000 shares. In addition, the
Plan provides for the granting of stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and
restricted stock grants ("Stock Grants"). A maximum of 4,000,000 shares of
Common Stock were available for grant under the Plan as of December 31, 2001.

     In 2001, 2000 and 1999, the Company issued 0, 19,181 and 14,666 shares
related to Stock Grants, respectively, which represented a portion of certain
employee bonuses. The fair market value of these Stock Grants of approximately
$0, $525,000 and $352,000 at the date of grant was recorded as compensation
expense by the Company in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

     In 1998, the Company awarded 233,500 Stock Grants to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Grants vest over five years, but
may be restricted for a period of up to ten years depending upon certain
performance benchmarks tied to increases in funds from operations being met. The
fair market value of these Stock Grants of approximately $5.7 million as of the
date of grant was treated in 1998 as deferred compensation. The Company
amortized approximately $2.0 million and $593,000 related to these Stock Grants
in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The balance of unamortized deferred compensation
related to these Stock Grants is $2,206,000 as of December 31, 2001.

     In 1999, the Company awarded 65,000 Stock Grants to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Grants vest over three years with
one-half vesting in 1999. The fair market value of these Stock Grants of
approximately $1.5 million as of the date of grant was treated in 1999 as
deferred compensation. The Company amortized approximately $386,000 and $385,000
related to these Stock Grants in 2001 and 2000, respectively.

     In 2000, the Company awarded 69,750 Stock Grants to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Grants vest over three years with
one-half vesting in 2000. The fair market value of these Stock Grants of
approximately $1.9 million as of the date of grant was treated in 2000 as
deferred compensation. The Company amortized approximately $478,000 and $955,000
related to these Stock Grants in 2001 and 2000 respectively. The balance of
unamortized deferred compensation related to these Stock Grants is $478,000 as
of December 31, 2001.

     In 2001, the Company awarded 43,000 Stock Grants to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Grants vest over five years, but
may be restricted for a period of up to ten years depending upon certain
performance benchmarks tied to increases in funds from operations being met. The
fair market value of these Stock Grants of approximately $1.2 million as of the
date of grant was treated in 2001 as deferred compensation. The Company
amortized approximately $239,000 related to these Stock Grants in 2001. The
balance of unamortized deferred compensation related to these Stock Grants is
approximately $957,000 as of December 31, 2001.

     In 1999, the Plan was amended to provide a Stock Grant of 2,000 shares
vesting over three years in lieu of the 10,000 Options granted after the
amendment to each director, if the director so elects. The fair market value of
Stock Grants awarded to directors of approximately $386,000, $401,000 and
$432,000 in 1999, 2000 and 2001 respectively, were treated as deferred
compensation. The Company amortized approximately $406,280 related to these
Stock Grants in 2001. The balance of unamortized deferred compensation
related to the 1999, 2000, and 2001 Stock Grants is $0, $134,000 and $288,000
respectively as of December 31, 2001.

NOTE 14 -- STOCK OPTION PLAN AND STOCK GRANTS (CONTINUED)

     The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related
Interpretations in accounting for its Options and Stock Grants because, as
discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under FASB
Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No. 123")
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
Company's Options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Additionally, the amount
recognized as expense for the Stock Grants during any given year of the
performance period is dependent on certain performance benchmarks being met.

     Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its Options and Stock Grants under the fair value method of that
Statement. The fair value for the Options was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively: risk-free interest rates of
3.5%, 5.5% and 6.3%; dividend yields of 6.3%, 6.3% and 6.3%; volatility factors
of the expected market price of the Company's common Stock of .19, .20 and .21;
and a weighted-average expected life of the Options of 5 years. The fair value
of the Stock Grants granted in 2001, 2000 and 1999 has been estimated at
approximately 30% below the calculated fair market value on the date of grant
because these Stock Grants may remain restricted even after they become fully
vested.

     The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company's Options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of the Company's Options. In addition, the existing
models are not representative of the effects on reported net income for future
years.

     For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
Options is amortized to expense over the Options' vesting period and the
estimated fair value of the Stock Grants is amortized to expense over the same
period. The pro forma effect of SFAS No. 123 on the Company's net income for the
years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $648,000 ($0.02 per share),
$134,000 ($0.0 per share) and $138,000 ($0.0 per share), respectively.

 DEANZA SANTA CRUZ MOBILE ESTATES

     The residents of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a property located in
Santa Cruz, California (the "City") previously brought several actions opposing
certain fees and charges in connection with water service at the Property. This
summary provides the history and reasoning underlying the Company's defense of
the residents' claims and explains the Company's decision to continue to defend
its position, which the Company believes is fair and accurate.

     DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates is a 198-site Community overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. It is subject to the City's rent control ordinance which limits
annual rent increases to 75% of CPI. The Company purchased this Property in
August 1994 from certain unaffiliated DeAnza entities ("DeAnza"). Prior to the
Company's purchase in 1994, DeAnza made the decision to submeter and separately
bill tenants at the Property for both water and sewer in 1993 in the face of the
City's rapidly rising utility costs.

                      MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 17 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

     Under California Civil Code Section 798.41, DeAnza was required to reduce
rent by an amount equal to the average cost of usage over the preceding 12
months. This was done. With respect to water charges, because DeAnza did not
want to be regulated by the California Public Utility Commission ("CPUC"),
DeAnza relied on California Public Utilities Code Section 2705.5 ("CPUC Section
2705.5") to determine what rates would be charged for water on an ongoing basis
without becoming a public utility. DeAnza and the Company interpreted the
statute as providing that in a submetered mobile home park, the property owner
is not subject to regulation and control of the CPUC so long as the users are
charged what they would be charged by the utility company if users received
their water directly from the utility company. In Santa Cruz, customers
receiving their water directly from the City's water utility were charged a
certain lifeline rate for the first 400 ccfs of water and a greater rate for
usage over 400 ccfs of water, a readiness to serve charge of $7.80 per month and
tax on the total. In reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5, DeAnza implemented its
billings on this schedule notwithstanding that it did not receive the discount
for the first 400 ccfs of water because it was a commercial and not a
residential customer.

     A dispute with the residents ensued over the readiness to serve charge and
tax thereon. The residents argued that California Civil Code Section 798.41
required that the Property owner could only pass through its actual costs of
water (and that the excess charges over the amount of the rent rollback were an
improper rent increase) and that CPUC Section 2705.5 was not applicable. DeAnza
unbundled the utility charges from rent consistent with California Civil Code
Section 798.41 and it has generally been undisputed that the rent rollback was
accurately calculated.

     In August 1994, when the Company acquired the Property, the Company
reviewed the respective legal positions of the Santa Cruz Homeowners Association
("HOA") and DeAnza and concurred with DeAnza. DeAnza's reliance on CPUC Section
2705.5 made both legal and practical sense in that residents paid only what they
would pay if they lived in a residential neighborhood within the City and
permitted DeAnza to recoup part of the expenses of operating a submetered system
through the readiness to serve charge.

     Over a period of 18 months from 1993 into May of 1995, a series of
complaints were filed by the HOA and Herbert Rossman, a resident, against
DeAnza, and later, the Company. DeAnza and the Company demurred to each of these
complaints on the grounds that the CPUC had exclusive jurisdiction over the
setting of water rates and that residents under rent control had to first
exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding in a civil action. At
one point, the case was dismissed (with leave to amend) on the basis that
jurisdiction was with the CPUC and, at another point, Mr. Rossman was dismissed
from the case because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies.

     On June 29, 1995, a hearing was held before a City rent control officer on
billing and submetering issues related to both water and sewer. The Company and
DeAnza prevailed on all issues related to sewer and the rent rollback related to
water, but the hearing officer determined that the Company could only pass
through its actual cost of water, i.e., a prorated readiness to serve charge and
tax thereon. The hearing officer did not deal with the subsidy being given to
residents through the quantity charge and ordered a rebate in a fixed amount per
resident. The Company and DeAnza requested reconsideration on this issue, among
others, which reconsideration was denied by the hearing officer.

     The Company then took a writ of mandate (an appeal from an administrative
order) to the Superior Court and, pending this appeal, the residents, the
Company and the City agreed to stay the effect of the hearing officer's decision
until the Court rendered judgment.

     In July 1996, the Superior Court affirmed the hearing officer's decision
without addressing concerns about the failure to take the subsidy on the
quantity charge into account.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 17 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

     The Company requested that the City and the HOA agree to a further stay
pending appeal to the court of appeal, but they refused and the appeal court
denied the Company's request for a stay in late November 1996. Therefore, on
January 1, 1997, the Company reduced its water charges at this Property to
reflect a pass-through of only the readiness to serve charge and tax at the
master meter (approximately $0.73) and to eliminate the subsidy on the water
charges. On their March 1, 1997 rent billings, residents were credited for
amounts previously "overcharged" for readiness to serve charge and tax. The
amount of the rebate given by the Company and DeAnza was $36,400. In calculating
the rebate, the Company and DeAnza took into account the previous subsidy on
water usage although this issue had not yet been decided by the court of appeal.
The Company and DeAnza felt legally safe in so doing based on language in the
hearing officer's decision that actual costs could be passed through.

     On March 12, 1997, the Company also filed an application with the CPUC to
dedicate the water system at this Property to public use and have the CPUC set
cost-based rates for water usage. The Company believed it was obligated to take
this action because of its consistent reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5 as a safe
harbor from CPUC jurisdiction. That is, when the Company could no longer charge
for water as the local serving utility would charge, it was no longer exempt
from the CPUC's jurisdiction and control under CPUC Section 2705.5.

     On March 20, 1998, the court of appeal issued the writ of mandate requested
by the Company on the grounds that the hearing officer had improperly calculated
the amount of the rebate (meaning the Company had correctly calculated the rent
credits), but also ruling that the hearing officer was correct when he found
that the readiness to serve charge and tax thereon as charged by DeAnza and the
Company were an inappropriate rent increase. The decision primarily reflected
the court of appeal's view that CPUC Section 2705.5 operated as a ceiling and
that California Civil Code Section 798.41 allowed for a charge based on actual
costs, including costs of administration, operation and maintenance of the
system, but that the Company had not to provide evidence of such costs. The
court of appeal further agreed with the Company that the City's hearing officer
did not have the authority under California Civil Code Section 798.41 to
establish rates that could be charged in the future.

     Following this decision, the CPUC granted the Company its certificate of
convenience and necessity on December 17, 1998 and approved cost-based rates and
charges for water that exceed what residents were paying under the Company's
reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5. Concurrently, the CPUC also issued an Order
Instituting Investigation ("OII") confirming its exclusive jurisdiction over the
issue of water rates in a submetered system and commencing an investigation into
the confusion and turmoil over billings in submetered properties. Specifically,
the OII states: "The Commission has exclusive and primary jurisdiction over the
establishment of rates for water and sewer services provided by private
entities."

     Specifically, the CPUC ruling regarding the Company's application stated:
"The ultimate question of what fees and charges may or may not be assessed,
beyond external supplier pass-through charges, for in-park facilities when a
mobile home park does not adhere to the provisions of CPUC Section 2705.5, must
be decided by the Commission."

     After the court of appeal decision, the HOA brought all of its members back
into the underlying civil action for the purpose of determining damages,
including punitive damages, against the Company. The trial was continued from
July 1998 to January 1999 to give the CPUC time to act on the Company's
application. Notwithstanding the action taken by the CPUC in issuing the OII in
December 1998, the trial court denied the Company's motion to dismiss on
jurisdictional grounds and trial commenced before a jury on January 11, 1999.

     Not only did the trial court not consider the Company's motion to dismiss,
the trial court refused to allow evidence of the OII or the Company's CPUC
approval to go before the jury. Notwithstanding the Company's strenuous
objections, the judge also allowed evidence of the Company's and DeAnza's
litigation tactics to be used as evidence of bad faith and oppressive actions
(including evidence of the application to the CPUC requesting a $22.00 readiness
to serve charge). The Company's motion for a mistrial based upon these
evidentiary rulings was denied. On January 22, 1999, the jury returned a verdict
awarding $6.0 million of punitive damages against the Company and DeAnza. The
Company had previously agreed to indemnify DeAnza on the matter.

NOTE 17 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

     The Company bonded the judgment pending appeal in accordance with
California procedural rules, which require a bond equal to 150% of the amount of
the judgment. Post-judgment interest will accrue at the statutory rate of 10.0%
per annum.

     On April 19, 1999, the trial court denied all of the Company's and DeAnza's
post-trial motions for judgement notwithstanding the verdict, new trial and
remittur. The trial court also awarded $700,000 of attorneys' fees to
plaintiffs. The Company appealed the jury verdict and attorneys' fees award
(which also accrues interest at the statutory rate of 10.0% per annum).

     On December 21, 2001 the California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District
reversed the $6.0 million punitive damage award and the related award of
attorneys' fees on the basis that punitive damages are not available as a remedy
for a statutory violation of the MRL. The decision of the appellate court left
the HOA with the right to seek a new trial in which it must prove its
entitlement to either the statutory penalty and attorneys' fees available under
the MRL or punitive damages based on causes of action for fraud,
misrepresentation or other tort. The Company expects the HOA to seek a new trial
during 2002. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself.

     In two related appeals, the Company had argued that the trial court's
ability to enter an award of attorneys' fees in favor of the HOA and to take
certain other actions was preempted by the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by
the CPUC over the issue of how to set rates for water in a submetered mobile
home park. During 2000, the California court of appeal rejected the Company's
preemption argument with respect to these prior rulings in favor of plaintiffs,
one of which had awarded plaintiffs approximately $100,000 of attorneys' fees.
The California Supreme Court declined to accept the case for review and the
Company paid the judgment, including post-judgment interest thereon, and
settled the matter for approximately $200,000 late in 2000.

     In a separate matter, in December 2000 the HOA and certain individual
residents of the Property filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California,
County of Santa Cruz (No. CV 139825) against the Company, certain affiliates of
the Company and certain employees of the Company. The new lawsuit seeks damages,
including punitive damages, for intentional infliction of emotional distress,
unfair business practices, and unlawful retaliation purportedly arising from
allegedly retaliatory rent increases which were noticed by the Company to
certain residents in September 2000. The Company believes that the residents who
received rent increase notices with respect to rent increases above those
permitted by the local rent control ordinance were not covered by the ordinance
either because they did not comply with the provisions of the ordinance or
because they are exempted by state law. On December 29, 2000, the Superior Court
of California, County of Santa Cruz enjoined such rent increases. The Company
intends to vigorously defend the matter, which may go to trial in the summer of
2002.

 ELLENBURG COMMUNITIES

     The Company and certain other parties entered into a settlement agreement
("the Settlement"), which was approved by the Los Angeles County Superior Court
in April 2000. The Settlement resolved substantially all of the litigation and
appeals involving the Ellenburg Properties, and transactions arising out of the
settlement closed on May 22, 2000 (see Note 5). Only the appeals of the two
entities remain, neither of which is expected to materially affect the Company.

     In connection with the Ellenburg Acquisition, on September 8, 1999,
Ellenburg Fund 20 ("Fund 20") filed a cross complaint in the Ellenburg
dissolution proceeding against the Company and certain of its affiliates
alleging causes of action for fraud and other claims in connection with the
Ellenburg acquisition. The Company subsequently successfully had the cross
complaint against the Company and its affiliates dismissed with prejudice by the
California Superior Court. However, Fund 20 has appealed. This appeal was one
not resolved by the Settlement. The Company believes Fund 20's allegations are
without merit and will vigorously defend itself.

     In October 2001, Fund 20 sued the Company and certain of its affiliates
again, this time in Almeda County, California making substantially the same
allegations. The Company obtained an injunction preventing the case from
proceeding until the Fund 20 appeal is decided and other related proceedings in
Arizona (from which the Company has already been dismissed with prejudice) are

 CANDLELIGHT PROPERTIES, L.L.C

     In 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Lending Partnership made loans to Candlelight
Properties, L.L.C. ("Borrower") in the aggregate principal amount of $8,050,000
(collectively, the "Loan". The Loan was secured by a mortgage on Candlelight
Village ("Candlelight"), a Property in Columbus, Indiana, and was guaranteed by
Ronald E. Farren, the 99% owner of Borrower. The Company accounted for the Loan
as an investment in real estate and, accordingly, Candlelight's rental revenues
and operating costs were included with the Company's rental revenues and
operating costs for financial reporting purposes. Concurrently with the funding
of the Loan, Borrower granted the Operating Partnership the option to acquire
Candlelight upon the maturity of the Loan. The Operating Partnership notified
Borrower that it was exercising its option to acquire Candlelight in March 1999,
and the Loan subsequently matured on May 3, 1999. However, Borrower failed to
repay the Loan and refused to convey Candlelight to the Operating Partnership.

     Borrower filed suit in the Circuit Court of Bartholomew County, Indiana
("Court") on May 5, 1999, seeking declaratory judgment on the validity of the
exercise of the option. The Lending Partnership filed suit in the Court the next
day, seeking to foreclose its mortgage, and the suits were consolidated by the
Court.

     On September 20, 2001, the parties entered into a settlement agreement
providing for a cash payment of $10.8 million to the Lending Partnership and
dismissal with prejudice of all litigation among the parties and their
affiliates, among other terms. The closing under the Settlement Agreement
occurred on October 5, 2001. The Company accounted for the Settlement as a
disposition of the property.

 WESTWINDS

     The Operating Partnership is the ground lessee ("Lessee") of certain
property in San Jose, California under ground leases ("Leases") from the
Nicholson Family Trust ("Lessor"). On February 13, 2001, Lessor filed a petition
for arbitration of disputes over whether certain items constitute "gross
revenue" under the Leases in which petition Lessor seeks damages and termination
of the Leases. Lessee responded on March 12, 2001 disputing Lessor's
contentions. Lessor claims that "gross revenue" for the purpose of calculating
percentage rent owing to Lessor under the ground leases includes certain amounts
Lessee has recouped from tenants of the Property (who are protected by rent
control) related to ground rent already paid to Lessor. Lessee has successfully
been able to pass-through to tenants at the property increases in ground rent
under the Leases. Lessee contends that this pass-through results in
reimbursement of lease expense, not "gross revenue." Lessor also contends that
the "net income" of RSI from the Property should be included in the gross
revenue calculation. Lessee disputes this for many reasons, including, but not
limited to, the fact that RSI is not a lessee under the Leases, the sales
activity is not conducted by Lessee, and RSI is a separate company from Lessee.

     Lessor's motion for summary judgment on the pass-through issue was denied
by an arbitration panel on November 2, 2001. Lessor and Lessee have agreed to
mediate the dispute prior to arbitration. The Company does not believe that the
amounts in question are material even if resolved against the Lessee and, based
upon advice of counsel, does not believe that the Lessor will be successful in
terminating the Leases.

 OTHER

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. Management believes that all proceedings herein
described or referred to, taken together, are not expected to have a material

                                      LOAN

                  2.01  Making of Loan and Repayment.

                  (a)  Loan Availability.

                           (i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
         this Agreement and in reliance on the representation and warranties of
         Borrower and the REIT set forth in this Agreement, each Lender hereby
         agrees to make its share of the Loan to Borrower on the Closing Date in
         an amount equal to such Lender's Commitment. The Loan will be evidenced
         by the Loan Notes.

                           (ii) The Loan may be voluntarily prepaid pursuant to
         Section 2.05(a), but Borrower may not reborrow any amounts so prepaid.
         The principal balance of the Loan shall be payable in full on the
         Termination Date.

                  (b) Notice of Borrowing; Continuation/Conversion. Borrower
shall give Agent, at Wells Fargo Disbursement Center, 2120 East Park Place,
Suite 100, El Segundo, California 90245, with a copy to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,
225 West Wacker Drive, Suite 2550, Chicago, Illinois 60606, Attn: Account
Officer, or such other address as Agent shall designate, an original or
facsimile Notice of Borrowing no later than 10:00 A.M. (California time), not
less than three (3) nor more than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date. The Notice of Borrowing shall specify whether the Loan will be a Base Rate

Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.01(b) shall be irrevocable.
Borrower may elect (A) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, to convert Base Rate Loans or any portion thereof into LIBOR Loans,

so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to continue any

however, that the amount of the Loan being continued as or converted to LIBOR
Loans shall, in the aggregate, equal One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or an
integral multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in excess thereof.
The


                                       22
<PAGE>

applicable Interest Period for the continuation of any LIBOR Loan shall commence
on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires. Each such
election shall be made by giving Agent, at 2120 E. Park Place, Suite 100, El
Segundo, California 90245 Attn: Jean Randall-Hall, a Notice of
Continuation/Conversion by 10:00 A.M. (California time) on the date of a
conversion to a Base Rate Loan, or by 10:00 A.M. (California time) not less than
three (3) nor more than five (5) Business Days prior to the date of a conversion
to or continuation of a LIBOR Loan, specifying, in each case (1) whether a
conversion or continuation is to occur, (2) the amount of the conversion or
continuation, (3) the Interest Period therefor, in the case of a conversion to
or continuation of a LIBOR Loan, and (4) the date of the conversion or
continuation (which date shall be a Business Day). Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender, but in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt of such
notice, of its receipt of each such notice and the contents thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and subject to the
default interest provisions contained in Section 2.03, if an Event of Default
occurs, all LIBOR Loans will convert to Base Rate Loans upon the expiration of
the applicable Interest Periods therefor or the date the Loan becomes due,
whichever occurs first. Except as provided above, the conversion of a LIBOR Loan
to a Base Rate Loan shall only occur on the last Business Day of the Interest
Period relating to such LIBOR Loan. In the absence of an effective election by
Borrower of a LIBOR Loan and Interest Period in accordance with the above
procedures prior to the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the expiration of the
then current Interest Period with respect to any LIBOR Loan, interest on such
LIBOR Loan shall accrue at the interest rate then applicable to a LIBOR Loan for
an Interest Period of thirty (30) days, effective immediately upon the
expiration of the then-current Interest Period, without prejudice, however, to
the right of Borrower to elect a Base Rate Loan or a different Interest Period
in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement; provided,
however, that if such continuation shall cause the number of LIBOR Loan tranches
to exceed three (3), such LIBOR Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan.

                  (c) Making of Loan. Subject to Section 10.03, Agent shall make
the proceeds of the Loan available to Borrower in El Segundo, California on the
Closing Date and shall disburse such funds in Dollars and in immediately
available funds not later than 1:00 P.M. Chicago time to Borrower's account, at
Bank of America, Account Number 73-66901095 in Chicago, Illinois, or such other
account specified in the Notice of Borrowing acceptable to Agent, with a
confirming telephone call to Quantaze Watts at (312) 279-1408 or Mark Howell at
(312) 279-1402.

                  (d) Term; Principal Payment. The outstanding balance of the
Loan shall be payable in full on the earlier to occur of (A) the Maturity Date,
and (B) the acceleration of the Loan pursuant to Section 9.02(a) (the
"Termination Date").

                  2.02 Borrowing and Interest Rate Election Authorization.
Borrower shall provide Agent with documentation reasonably satisfactory to Agent
indicating the names of those employees or agents of Borrower authorized by
Borrower to sign Notices of Borrowing and Continuation/Conversion, any extension
notice and to receive callback confirmations, and Agent and Lenders shall be
entitled to rely on such documentation until notified in writing by Borrower of
any change(s) of the persons so authorized. Agent shall be entitled to act in
good faith on the instructions of anyone identifying himself as one of the
Persons so authorized, and Borrower


                                       23
<PAGE>

shall be bound thereby in the same manner as if such Person were actually so
authorized. Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lenders and Agent
harmless from and against any and all Liabilities and Costs which may arise or
be created by the acceptance of instructions for making the Loan.

                  2.03  Interest on the Loan.

                  (a) Base Rate Loans. Subject to Section 2.03(d), all Base Rate
Loans shall bear interest on the average daily unpaid principal amount thereof
from the date made until paid in full at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to
the Base Rate.

                  (b) LIBOR Loans. Subject to Section 2.03(d), all LIBOR Loans
shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof during the Interest
Period applicable thereto at a rate per annum equal to the sum of LIBOR for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin. Upon receipt of a Notice of
Borrowing or Notice of Continuation/Conversion requesting the making of,
continuation of and/or conversion to LIBOR Loans, Agent shall determine LIBOR
applicable to the Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans, and shall give notice
thereof to Borrower and Lenders; provided, however, that failure to give such
notice shall not affect the validity of such rate. Each determination by Agent
of LIBOR shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto in the absence
of demonstrable error. LIBOR Loans shall be in tranches of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) or One Hundred Thousand Dollar ($100,000) increments in excess
thereof. No more than three (3) LIBOR Loan tranches shall be outstanding at any
one time.

                  (c) Interest Payments. Subject to Section 2.03(d), interest
accrued on the Loan shall be payable by Borrower in arrears on the first
Business Day of the first calendar month following the Closing Date, and the
first Business Day of each succeeding calendar month thereafter, and on the
Termination Date.

                  (d) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the rates of interest
specified in Sections 2.03(a) and 2.03(b) and the payment dates specified in
Section 2.03(c), effective immediately upon demand by Agent after the occurrence
of an Event of Default and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the
principal balance of the Loan then outstanding and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, any interest payments on the Loan not paid when due shall bear
interest payable upon demand at a rate which is five percent (5%) per annum in
excess of the rate or rates of interest otherwise payable under this Agreement.
All other amounts due Agent or Lenders (whether directly or for reimbursement)
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents if not paid when due, or
if no time period is expressed, if not paid within fifteen (15) days after
written demand to Borrower, shall bear interest from and after demand at the
rate which is five percent (5%) per annum in excess of the lowest rate or rates
of interest otherwise payable under this Agreement, or, if no portion of the
Loan is then outstanding, at the rate which is five percent (5%) per annum in
excess of the rate of interest applicable to Base Rate Loans.

                  (e) Late Fee. Borrower acknowledges that late payment to Agent
will cause Agent and Lenders to incur costs not contemplated by this Agreement.
Such costs include


                                       24
<PAGE>

without limitation processing and accounting charges. Therefore, if Borrower
fails timely to pay any sum due and payable hereunder through the Termination
Date (other than payments of principal), unless waived by Agent pursuant to
Section 11.05(e), a late charge of four cents ($.04) for each dollar of any
interest payment due hereon and which is not paid within ten (10) days after
such payment is due or of any other amount due hereon (other than payments of
principal) and which is not paid within thirty (30) days after such payment is
due, shall be charged by Agent (for the benefit of Lenders) and paid by Borrower
for the purpose of defraying the expense incident to handling such delinquent
payment; provided, however, that no late charges shall be assessed with respect
to any amount for which Borrower is obligated to pay interest at the rate
specified in Section 2.03(d), provided, further, that in no event shall Agent or
Lenders be required to refund any late fees paid by Borrower, notwithstanding
the preceding proviso. Borrower and Agent agree that this late charge represents
a reasonable sum considering all of the circumstances existing on the date
hereof and represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that Agent and
Lenders will incur by reason of late payment. Borrower and Agent further agree
that proof of actual damages would be costly and inconvenient. Acceptance of any
late charge shall not constitute a waiver of the default with respect to the
overdue installment, and shall not prevent Agent from exercising any of the
other rights available hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Such late
charge shall be paid without prejudice to any other rights of Agent.

                  (f) Computation of Interest. Interest and fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period during
which interest or fees accrue and a year of three hundred sixty (360) days. In
computing interest on the Loan, the date of the making of the Loan shall be
included and the date of payment shall be excluded. Notwithstanding subsections
(a), (b), (d) and (e) above, interest in respect of the Loan or any portion
thereof shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

                  (g) Changes; Legal Restrictions. In the event that after the
Closing Date (A) the adoption of or any change in any law, treaty, rule,
regulation, guideline or determination of a court or Governmental Authority or
any change in the interpretation or application thereof by a court or
Governmental Authority, or (B) compliance by Agent or any Lender with any
request or directive made or issued after the Closing Date (whether or not
having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply therewith would
be unlawful) from any central bank or other Governmental Authority or
quasi-governmental authority:

                           (i) subjects Agent or any Lender to any tax, duty or
         other charge of any kind with respect to the Facility, this Agreement
         or any of the other Loan Documents or changes the basis of taxation of
         payments to Agent or such Lender of principal, fees, interest or any
         other amount payable hereunder, except for net income, gross receipts,
         gross profits or franchise taxes imposed by any jurisdiction and not
         specifically based upon loan transactions (all such non-excepted taxes,
         duties and other charges being hereinafter referred to as "Lender
         Taxes");

                           (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable, in the
         determination of Agent or any Lender, any reserve, special deposit,
         compulsory loan, FDIC insurance, capital


                                       25
<PAGE>




          allocation or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits
          or other liabilities in or . for the account of, advances or loans by,
          or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by,
          Agent or such Lender or any applicable lending office (except to the
          extent that reserve and FDIC insurance requirements are reflected in
          the "Base Rate" or "LIBOR"; or

                           (iii) imposes on Agent or any Lender any other
         condition materially more burdensome in nature, extent or consequence
         than those in existence as of the Closing Date;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to (X) increase the cost to Agent or
any Lender of making, renewing, maintaining or participating in any portion of
the Loan or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or thereunder or (Y) to
require Agent or any Lender or any applicable lending office to make any payment
calculated by reference to the amount of the portion of the Loan held or
interest received by it under such portion of the Loan; then, in any such case,
Borrower shall promptly pay to Agent or such Lender, as applicable, upon demand,
such amount or amounts (based upon a reasonable allocation thereof by Agent or
such Lender to the financing transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
affected by this Section 2.03(g)) as may be necessary to compensate Agent or
such Lender for any such additional cost incurred, reduced amounts received or
additional payments made to the extent Agent or such Lender generally imposes
such additional costs, losses and payments on other borrowers of Agent or such
Lender in similar circumstances. Agent or such Lender shall deliver to Borrower
and in the case of a delivery by a Lender, such Lender shall also deliver to
Agent, a written statement in reasonable detail of the claimed additional costs
incurred, reduced amounts received or additional payments made and the basis
therefor as soon as reasonably practicable after Agent or such Lender, as
applicable, obtains knowledge thereof.

                  (h)  Certain Provisions Regarding LIBOR Loans.

                           (i) LIBOR Lending Unlawful. If any Lender shall
         determine in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in
         the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or any central bank or
         other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such
         Lender to convert any Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan or maintain any
         Loan as a LIBOR Loan, (A) the obligations of the Lenders to convert any
         Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan or maintain any LIBOR Loans shall,
         upon such determination, forthwith be suspended until such Lender shall
         notify Agent that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
         exist, and (B) if required by law or such assertion, all LIBOR Loans
         shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans.

                           (ii) Deposits Unavailable. If Agent shall have
         determined in good faith that adequate means do not exist for
         ascertaining the interest rate applicable hereunder to LIBOR Loans,
         then, upon notice from Agent to Borrower the obligations of all Lenders
         to convert any Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan or maintain any Loan as
         a LIBOR Loan shall forthwith be suspended until Agent shall notify
         Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
         exist. Agent will give such notice



                                       26

          when it determines, in good faith, that such circumstances no longer
          exist; provided, however, that Agent shall not have any liability to
          any Person with respect to any delay in giving such notice.

                           (iii) Funding Losses. In the event any Lender shall
         incur any loss or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by
         reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
         acquired by such Lender to make or maintain any portion of the Loan as
         a LIBOR Loan) as a result of:

                                    (A) any continuance, conversion, repayment
                  or prepayment of the principal amount of any LIBOR Loans for
                  any reason whatsoever on a date other than the scheduled last
                  day of the Interest Period applicable thereto; or

                                    (B) any Base Rate Loans not being converted
                  into LIBOR Loans or any LIBOR Loans not being continued as
                  LIBOR Loans in accordance with the Notice of
                  Continuation/Conversion therefor, other than as a result of
                  such Lender's breach of its obligation to continue or convert
                  such Loan in accordance with the terms hereof;

         then, within fifteen (15) Business Days after Borrower's receipt of the
         written notice of such Lender to Borrower with a copy to Agent,
         Borrower shall reimburse such Lender for such loss or expense;
         provided, however, that each Lender will use reasonable efforts to
         minimize such loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include
         calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
         demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

                  (i) Withholding Tax Exemption. Each Lender that is not created
or organized under the laws of the United States of America or a political
subdivision thereof shall deliver to Borrower and Agent no later than the
Closing Date (or, in the case of a Lender which becomes a Lender pursuant to
Section 10.11, the date upon which such Lender becomes a party hereto) a true
and accurate certificate executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of
such Lender, in a form satisfactory to Borrower and Agent, to the effect that
such Lender is capable, under the provisions of an applicable treaty concluded
by the United States of America (in which case the certificate shall be
accompanied by three (3) accurate and complete duly executed originals of Form
W-8BEN of the Internal Revenue Service) or under Section 1442 of the Internal
Revenue Code (in which case the certificate shall be accompanied by three (3)
accurate and complete duly executed originals of Form W-8ECI of the Internal
Revenue Service), of receiving payments of principal, interest and fees
hereunder without deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.
Further, if at any time a Lender changes its applicable lending office or
selects an additional applicable lending office, it shall, at the same time or
promptly thereafter, but only to the extent the certificate and forms previously
delivered by it hereunder are no longer applicable or effective, deliver to
Borrower and Agent in replacement for, or in addition to, the certificate and
forms previously delivered by it hereunder, a true and accurate certificate
executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of such Lender accompanied by
three (3) accurate and complete duly executed originals of either Form W-8BEN of
the Internal Revenue Service or


                                       27
<PAGE>

Form W-8ECI of the Internal Revenue Service, whichever is applicable, indicating
that such Lender is entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and fees
for the account of such changed or additional applicable lending office under
this Agreement without deduction or withholding of United States federal tax.
Each Lender further agrees to deliver to Borrower and Agent a true and accurate
certificate executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of such Lender
accompanied by three (3) accurate and complete duly executed originals of either
Form W-8BEN of the Internal Revenue Service or Form W-8ECI of the Internal
Revenue Service, whichever is appropriate, substantially in a form satisfactory
to Borrower and Agent, before or promptly upon the occurrence of any event
requiring a change in the most recent certificate or Internal Revenue Service
form previously delivered by it to Borrower and Agent pursuant to this Section
2.03(j). Further, each Lender which delivers a certificate accompanied by Form
W-8BEN of the Internal Revenue Service covenants and agrees to deliver to
Borrower and Agent within fifteen (15) days prior to January 1, 2003, and every
third (3rd) anniversary of such date thereafter, on which this Agreement is
still in effect, another such certificate and three (3) accurate and complete
original signed copies of Form W-8BEN (or any successor form or forms required
under the Internal Revenue Code or the applicable regulations promulgated
thereunder), and each Lender that delivers a certificate accompanied by Form
W-8ECI of the Internal Revenue Service covenants and agrees to deliver to
Borrower and Agent within fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of each
subsequent taxable year of such Lender during which this Agreement is still in
effect, another such certificate and three (3) accurate and complete original
signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor form or
forms required under the Internal Revenue Code or the applicable regulations
promulgated hereunder). If (i) any Lender is required under this Section 2.03(j)
to provide a certificate or other evidence described above and fails to deliver
to Borrower and Agent such certificate or other evidence or (ii) any Lender
delivers a certificate to the effect that, as a result of the adoption of or any
change in any law, treaty, rule, regulation, guideline or determination of a
Governmental Authority after the date such Lender became a party hereto, such
Lender is not capable of receiving payments of interest hereunder without
deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax as specified
therein and that it is not capable of recovering the full amount of the same
from a source other than Borrower, then, to the extent required by law, as the
sole consequence of such Lender's failure to deliver the certificate described
in (i) above or such Lender's delivery of the certificate described in (ii)
above, Borrower shall be entitled to deduct or withhold taxes from the payments
owed to such Lender.

                  2.04  Fees.

                  (a) Loan Fee. On the Closing Date, Borrower shall pay Agent,
for the benefit of the Lenders, the loan fee which is provided for in the
separate fee agreement between Agent and Borrower.

                  (b) Arrangement and Administrative Agency Fees. Borrower shall
pay Agent such fees as are provided for in the separate fee agreement between
Agent and Borrower, as in existence from time to time.



                                       28
<PAGE>

                  (c) Payment of Fees. The fees described in this Section 2.04
represent compensation for services rendered and to be rendered separate and
apart from the lending of money or the provision of credit and do not constitute
compensation for the use, detention or forbearance of money, and the obligation
of Borrower to pay the fees described herein shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu of, the obligation of Borrower to pay interest, other fees and expenses
otherwise described in this Agreement. All fees shall be payable when due in
California in immediately available funds and shall be non-refundable when paid.
If Borrower fails to make any payment of fees or expenses specified or referred
to in this Agreement due to Agent or Lenders, including without limitation those
referred to in this Section 2.04 or otherwise under this Agreement or any
separate fee agreement between Borrower and Agent relating to this Agreement,
when due, the amount due shall bear interest until paid at the Base Rate and,
after five (5) days at the rate specified in Section 2.03(d) (but not to exceed
the maximum rate permitted by applicable law) and shall constitute part of the
Obligations. All fees described in this Section 2.04 which are expressed as a
per annum charge shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a three hundred sixty (360) day year.

                  2.05  Payments.

                  (a) Voluntary Prepayments. Borrower may, upon not less than
three (3) Business Days prior written notice, at any time and from time to time,
prepay, without premium or penalty (other than as set forth in Section
2.03(h)(iii)), the Loan in whole or in part in amounts not less than One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or integral multiples of Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($25,000) in excess of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Any
notice of prepayment given to Agent under this Section 2.05(a) shall specify the
date of prepayment and the aggregate principal amount of the prepayment. All
prepayments of principal shall be accompanied by a payment of all accrued and
unpaid interest thereon.

                  (b) Manner and Time of Payment. All payments of principal,
interest and fees hereunder payable to Agent or the Lenders shall be made
without condition or reservation of right and free of set-off or counterclaim,
in Dollars and by (i) wire transfer (pursuant to Agent's written wire transfer
instructions) of immediately available funds, delivered to Agent not later than
11:00 A.M. (California time) on the date due; and funds received by Agent after
that time and date shall be deemed to have been paid on the next succeeding
Business Day or (ii) by check (pursuant to Agent's written check payment
instructions) delivered to Agent, such check and the payment intended to be
covered thereby to be deemed to have been paid on the date Agent receives
immediately available funds therefor. All payments of principal, interest and
fees hereunder shall be made by (i) wire transfer of immediately available funds
to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (ABA number 121000248) for credit to account number
2934507203 reference MHC Operating Limited Partnership, loan number 1561ZMC with
telephonic notice to Jean Randall-Hall at (310) 335-9492, or (ii) check payable
to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and delivered to Agent at 2120 E. Park Place, Suite
100, El Segundo, California 90245, Attn: Jean Randall-Hall, or to such other
bank, account or address as Agent may specify in a written notice to Borrower.


                                       29
<PAGE>

                  (c) Payments on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment to be
made by Borrower hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such
extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of
interest hereunder and of any of the fees specified in Section 2.04, as the case
may be.

                  2.06 Increased Capital. If either (i) the introduction of or
any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii)
compliance by Agent or any Lender with any guideline or request from any central
bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law and
whether or not the failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) made or issued
after the Closing Date affects or would affect the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by Agent or such Lender or any corporation controlling
Agent or such Lender, and Agent or such Lender determines that the amount of
such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of Agent's obligations
hereunder or such Lender's obligation to maintain, continue or convert to LIBOR
Loans hereunder, then, upon demand by Agent or such Lender, Borrower shall
immediately pay to Agent or such Lender, from time to time as specified by Agent
or such Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate Agent or such Lender
in the light of such circumstances, to the extent that Agent or such Lender
reasonably determines such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence
of Agent's obligations hereunder or such Lender's commitment and to the extent
Agent or such Lender generally imposes such amounts on other borrowers of Agent
or Lender in similar circumstances. A certificate as to such amounts in
reasonable detail submitted to Borrower by Agent or such Lender shall, in the
absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

                  2.07 Notice of Increased Costs. Each Lender agrees that, as
promptly as reasonably practicable after it becomes aware of the occurrence of
an event or the existence of a condition which would cause it to be affected by
any of the events or conditions described in Section 2.03(g) or (h), or Section
2.06, it will notify Borrower and provide in such notice a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount due from Borrower, and provide a copy of such notice
to Agent, of such event and the possible effects thereof. If Agent or the
affected Lender shall fail to notify Borrower of the occurrence of any such
event or the existence of any such condition within ninety (90) days following
the end of the month during which such event occurred or such condition arose,
then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in said Sections 2.03(g) and
(h) and 2.06 incurred by Agent or such affected Lender as a result of such event
or condition shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring
subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date upon which Agent or
such affected Lender actually notified Borrower of such event or condition.

                  2.08  Option to Replace Lenders.

                  (a) Lenders. If any Lender shall make any demand for payment
or reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.03(g), Section 2.03(h) or Section 2.06,
then, provided that (a) there does not then exist any Unmatured Event of Default
or Event of Default and (b) the circumstances resulting in such demand for
payment or reimbursement are not applicable to all Lenders, Borrower may
terminate the Commitment of such Lender, in whole but not in part, by


                                       30
<PAGE>

(i) giving such Lender and Agent not less than three (3) Business Days prior
written notice thereof, which notice shall be irrevocable and effective only
upon receipt thereof by such Lender and Agent and shall specify the effective
date of such termination, (ii) paying to such Lender (and there shall become due
and payable) on such date the outstanding principal amount of the portion of the
Loan made by such Lender, all interest thereon, and all other Obligations owed
to such Lender, including, without limitation, amounts owing under Sections
2.03(g), 2.03(h)(iii), 2.04 and 2.06, if any, and (iii) pursuant to the
provisions of Section 10.11, proposing the introduction of a replacement Lender
reasonably satisfactory to Agent, or obtaining the agreement of one or more
existing Lenders, to assume the entire amount of the Commitment of the Lender
whose Commitment is being terminated, on the effective date of such termination.
Upon the satisfaction of all of the foregoing conditions, such Lender which is
being terminated pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall cease to be a "Lender" for
purposes of this Agreement provided that Borrower shall continue to be obligated
to such Lender under Sections 11.01 and 11.02 (and any other indemnifications
contained herein or in any other Loan Document) with respect to or on account of
unpaid, unliquidated, unknown or similar claims or liabilities accruing prior to
such Lender ceasing to be a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (b) Agent. If Agent shall make any demand for payment or
reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.03(g), Section 2.03(h) or Section 2.06,
then, provided that (i) there does not then exist any Unmatured Event of Default
or Event of Default and (ii) the circumstances resulting in such demand for
payment or reimbursement are not applicable to all Lenders, Borrower may remove
Agent by (x) giving the Lenders and Agent not less than thirty (30) Business
Days prior written notice thereof, and (y) paying to Agent (and there shall
become due and payable) on such date all other Obligations owed to Agent,
including, without limitation, amounts owing under Sections 2.03(g), 2.03(h),
2.04 and 2.06, if any. Agent shall be replaced in accordance with the provisions
of Section 10.09 hereof.

                  2.09  Extension Options.

                  (a) First Extension Option. At the written request of Borrower

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  4.01 Representations and Warranties as to Borrower. In order
to induce Lenders to make the Loan, Borrower hereby represents and warrants to
Lenders as follows:

                  (a) Organization; Partnership Powers. Borrower (i) is a
limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, (ii) is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign limited partnership and in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business requires it to be so
qualified, except for those jurisdictions where failure to so qualify and be in
good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) has all
requisite partnership power and authority to own, operate and encumber its
property and assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and as
proposed to be conducted in connection with and following the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Authority. Borrower has the requisite partnership power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform each of the Loan Documents to
which it is or will be a party. The execution, delivery and performance thereof,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly
approved by the general partner of Borrower, and no other partnership
proceedings or authorizations on the part of Borrower or its general or limited
partners are necessary to consummate such transactions. Each of the Loan
Documents to which Borrower is a party has been duly executed and delivered by
Borrower and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable
principles.

                  (c) Ownership of Borrower. Schedule 4.01(c) sets forth the
general partners of Borrower and their respective ownership percentages as of
the date hereof. Except as set forth in the partnership agreement of Borrower,
no partnership interests (or any securities, instruments, warrants, option or
purchase rights, conversion or exchange rights, calls, commitments or claims of
any character convertible into or exercisable for partnership interests) of
Borrower are subject to issuance under any security, instrument, warrant, option
or purchase rights, conversion or exchange rights, call, commitment or claim of
any right, title or interest therein or thereto. To



                                       35
<PAGE>


Borrower's knowledge, all of the partnership interests in Borrower have been
issued in compliance with all applicable Requirements of Law.

                  (d) No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by
Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is or will be a party, and each of
the transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not (i) conflict with or
violate Borrower's limited partnership agreement or Certificate of Limited
Partnership or other organizational documents, as the case may be, or the
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Borrower or (ii) conflict with,
result in a breach of or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) a default under any Requirement of Law, Contractual Obligation or Court
Order of or binding upon Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or require
termination of any such Contractual Obligation, the consequences of which
conflict or breach or default or termination would have a Material Adverse
Effect, or result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
whatsoever upon any Property (except as contemplated herein).

                  (e) Consents and Authorizations. Borrower has obtained all
consents and authorizations required pursuant to its Contractual Obligations
with any other Person, the failure of which to obtain would have a Material
Adverse Effect, and has obtained all consents and authorizations of, and
effected all notices to and filings with, any Governmental Authority necessary
to allow Borrower to lawfully execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
the Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party.

                  (f) Governmental Regulation. Borrower is not subject to
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or
any other federal or state statute or regulation such that its ability to incur
indebtedness is limited or its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents is materially impaired.

                  (g) Prior Financials. The Consolidated and Combined Balance
Sheet as of September 30, 2001, the Consolidated and Combined Statement of
Operations for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2001, and the Consolidated and
Combined Statement of Cash Flows for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2001, of
the REIT contained in the Form 10-Q Quarterly Report of the REIT as of September
30, 2001 (the "Pre-Closing Financials") delivered to Agent prior to the date
hereof were prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect on the date such
Pre-Closing Financials were prepared and fairly present the assets, liabilities
and financial condition of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, at such date and
the results of its operations and its cash flows, on a consolidated basis, for
the period then ended.

                  (h) Financial Statements; Projections and Forecasts. Each of
the Financial Statements to be delivered to Agent pursuant to Sections 5.01(a)
and (b), (i) has been, or will be, as applicable, prepared in accordance with
the books and records of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, and (ii) either
fairly present, or will fairly present, as applicable, the financial condition
of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, at the dates thereof (and, if applicable,
subject to normal year-end adjustments) and the results of its operations and
cash flows, on a consolidated basis, for the period then ended. Each of the
projections delivered to Agent (A) has been, or will be, as


                                       36

estimates of such personnel.

                  (i)  Litigation; Adverse Effects.

                           (i) There is no action, suit, proceeding,
         governmental investigation or arbitration, at law or in equity, or
         before or by any Governmental Authority, pending, or to the best of
         Borrower's knowledge, threatened against Borrower or any of its
         Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties, in which there is a
         reasonable possibility of an adverse decision that could have a
         Material Adverse Effect; and

                           (ii) Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is
         (A) in violation of any Requirement of Law, which violation has a
         Material Adverse Effect, or (B) subject to or in default with respect
         to any Court Order which has a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (j) No Material Adverse Change. Since September 30, 2001,
there has occurred no event which has a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (k) Payment of Taxes. All tax returns and reports to be filed
by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely filed, and all taxes,
assessments, fees and other governmental charges shown on such returns have been
paid when due and payable, except such taxes, if any, as are reserved against in
accordance with GAAP, such taxes as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings or such taxes, the failure to make payment of which when
due and payable will not have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
Borrower has no knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries that will have a Material Adverse Effect, which is not being
actively contested in good faith by such Person.

                  (l) Material Adverse Agreements. Neither Borrower nor any of

is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation
applicable to it, and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice or
the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under such Contractual
Obligation in each case, except where the consequences, direct or indirect, of
such default or defaults, if any, will not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (n) Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds of
the Loan hereunder will be used to purchase or carry any "margin security" as
defined in Regulation U or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any
indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any margin
security or for any other purpose which might constitute this transaction a
"purpose credit" within the meaning of said Regulation U. Borrower is not
engaged primarily in



                                       37
<PAGE>

the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any
"margin stock" as defined in Regulation U. No part of the proceeds of the Loan
will be used for any purpose that violates, or which is inconsistent with, the
provisions of Regulation X or any other regulation of the Federal Reserve Board.

                  (o) Disclosure. Borrower has not intentionally or knowingly
withheld any material fact from Agent in regard to any matter raised in the Loan
Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any projections of
Borrower's future performance such representations and warranties are made in
good faith and to the best judgment of Borrower at the time such projections
were made.

                  (p) Requirements of Law. To Borrower's knowledge, Borrower and
each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Requirements of Law
(including without limitation the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, state securities law
and "Blue Sky" laws) applicable to them and their respective businesses, in each
case, where the failure to so comply will have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (q) Patents, Trademarks, Permits, Etc. Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries owns, is licensed or otherwise has the lawful right to use, or
has all permits and other governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade
names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes used in or necessary for
the conduct of Borrower's or such Subsidiary's business as currently conducted,
the absence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect. To Borrower's
knowledge, the use of such permits and other governmental approvals, patents,
trademarks, trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes by
Borrower or such Subsidiary does not infringe on the rights of any Person,
subject to such claims and infringements as do not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (r) Environmental Matters. To the knowledge of Borrower,
except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect and except as set forth on
Schedule 4.01(r), (i) the Property and operations of Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
Laws; (ii) none of the Property or operations of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries are subject to any Remedial Action or other Liabilities and Costs
arising from the Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant into the
environment or from the violation of any Environmental Laws, which Remedial
Action or other Liabilities and Costs would have a Material Adverse Effect;
(iii) neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed any notice under
applicable Environmental Laws reporting a Release of a Contaminant into the
environment in violation of any Environmental Laws, except as the same may have
been heretofore remedied; (iv) there is not now, nor to Borrower's knowledge has
there ever been, on or in the Property of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
(except in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
Laws): (A) any underground storage tanks, (B) any asbestos-containing material,
(C) any polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) used in hydraulic oils, electrical
transformers or other equipment, (D) any petroleum hydrocarbons or (E) any
chlorinated or halogenated solvents; and (v) neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim to the effect that it is or may be
liable to any Person as a result of the Release or threatened Release of a

                  (s) ERISA. None of the REIT, Borrower or any Agreement Party
is an "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, an
"employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Sections 4001(a)(3) or 3(37) of ERISA or a
"plan" as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. Except for
a prohibited transaction arising solely because of a Lender's breach of the
covenant set forth in Section 11.23, none of the Obligations, any of the Loan
Documents or the exercise of any of the Agent's or Lenders' rights in connection
therewith constitutes a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code (which is not exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA
and the taxes and penalties imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code
and Section 502(i) of ERISA) or otherwise results in a Lender, Agent or the
Lenders being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or will by itself result in a Lender, Agent or
the Lenders being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a
"disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code. No assets of the REIT, Borrower or any Agreement Party
constitute "assets" (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 or any
successor regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code.

                  Each Borrower Plan is in compliance with ERISA and the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code in all respects except where
the failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no
claims (other than claims for benefits in the normal course), actions or
lawsuits asserted or instituted against, and none of Borrower, the REIT, any of
the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has knowledge of any
threatened litigation or claims against the assets of any Borrower Plan or
against any fiduciary of such Borrower Plan with respect to the operation of
such Borrower Plan which could have a Material Adverse Effect. No liability to
the PBGC has been, or is likely to be, incurred by Borrower, the REIT, any of
the Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates other than such liabilities which, in
the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. None of Borrower, the
REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates is now
contributing to or has ever contributed to or been obligated to contribute to
any Multiemployer Plan, no employees or former employees of Borrower, the REIT,
any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates have been covered by
any Multiemployer Plan in respect of their employment by Borrower or such
Subsidiary or such ERISA Affiliate. None of Borrower, the REIT, any of the
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue
Code or in a transaction subject to the prohibitions of Section 406 of ERISA, in
connection with any Benefit Plan or Welfare Plan which would subject Borrower,
the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates (after giving
effect to any exemption) to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 502 of ERISA or
any other liability under ERISA which tax, penalty or other liability would have
a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Benefit Plans subject to Title IV of
ERISA has any material Unfunded Pension Liability as to which Borrower, the
REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates is or may be
liable, which liability would have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (u) Use of Proceeds. Borrower's use of the proceeds of the
Loan are, and will continue to be, legal and proper uses (and to the extent
necessary, duly authorized by Borrower's partners) and such uses are consistent
with all applicable laws and statutes.

                  (v) Subsidiaries and Investment Affiliates. Each Subsidiary

Affiliate and the material Property owned by such Person as of the date hereof.

                  Borrower and the REIT covenant and agree that, on and after
the date hereof, until payment in full of all of the Obligations and termination
of this Agreement:

                  6.01  With respect to Borrower:

                  (a) Existence. Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, at all times maintain its and their respective partnership,
limited liability company, trust or corporate existence, as applicable, and
preserve and keep in full force and effect its and their respective rights and
franchises unless the failure to maintain such rights and franchises does not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Borrower shall maintain its status as a limited
partnership.

                  (b) Qualification. Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, qualify and remain qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its and their businesses require them to be
so qualified except for those jurisdictions where failure to so qualify does not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Compliance with Laws, Etc. Borrower shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) comply with all Requirements of Law and
Contractual Obligations, and all restrictive covenants affecting Borrower and
its Subsidiaries or their respective properties, performance, assets or
operations, and (ii) obtain as needed all Permits necessary for its and their
respective operations and maintain such in good standing, except in each of the
foregoing cases where the failure to do so will not have a Material Adverse
Effect or expose Agent or Lenders to any material liability therefor.

                  (d) Payment of Taxes and Claims. (a) Borrower shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay (i) all taxes, assessments and other
governmental charges imposed upon it or them or on any of its or their
respective properties or assets or in respect of any of its or their respective
franchises, business, income or property before any penalty or interest accrues
thereon, the failure to make payment of which in such time periods would have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) all claims (including, without limitation,
claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) which have become due and
payable and which by law have or may become a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien)
upon any of its or their respective properties or assets, prior to the time when
any penalty or fine shall be incurred with respect thereto, the failure to make
payment of which would have a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that
no such taxes, assessments, and governmental charges referred to in clause (i)
above or claims referred to in clause (ii) above need be paid if being contested
in good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently
conducted and if adequate reserves shall have been set aside therefor in
accordance with GAAP.

shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in good repair, working order
and condition, excepting ordinary wear and tear, all of its and their respective
Property (personal and real) and will make or cause to be made all appropriate
repairs, renewals and replacements thereof, in each case where the failure to so
maintain, repair, renew or replace would have a Material Adverse Effect.
Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain with
insurance companies that have a Best Rating of "A- VII" or higher or other
insurance companies reasonably acceptable to Agent that have similar financial
resources and stability, which companies shall be qualified to do business in
the states where such Property is located, insurance policies and programs
reasonably acceptable to Agent insuring all property and assets material to the
operations of Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries against loss or damage by
fire, theft, burglary, pilferage and loss in transit and business interruption,
together with such other hazards as is reasonably consistent with prudent
industry practice, and maintain liability insurance consistent with prudent
industry practice with financially sound insurance companies qualified to do
business in the states where such Property is located. The insurance policies
shall provide that they cannot be terminated or materially modified unless Agent
receives thirty (30) days prior written notice of said termination or
modification. At Agent's reasonable request, Borrower shall furnish evidence of
replacement costs, without cost to Agent, such as are regularly and ordinarily
made by insurance companies to determine the then replacement cost of the
improvements on any Property of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. In the
event Borrower fails to cause insurance to be carried as aforesaid, Agent shall
have the right (but not the obligation), with the consent of Requisite Lenders,
to place and maintain insurance required to be maintained hereunder and treat
the amounts expended therefor as additional Obligations, payable on demand;
provided however, that Agent shall give Borrower five (5) days' prior notice of
Agent's intent to place or maintain such insurance during which time Borrower
shall have the opportunity to obtain such insurance. All of the insurance
policies required hereunder shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Agent. Agent hereby agrees that Borrower may use blanket
policies to satisfy the requirements of this Section 6.01(e), approves the
issuer, form and content of all insurance policies currently carried by Borrower
and agrees that such insurance satisfies the requirements of this Section
6.01(e). Furthermore, Agent agrees that it will not be unreasonable in
exercising any right hereunder to require Borrower to modify, alter or
supplement its insurance policies or coverage or in exercising any right it may
have hereunder to approve any changes Borrower may hereafter make with respect
to its insurance.

                  (f) Inspection of Property; Books and Records. Borrower shall
permit and shall cause each of the REIT, each Subsidiary, and each Agreement
Party to, upon reasonable prior notice by Agent to Borrower, permit any
authorized representative(s) designated by Agent to visit and inspect any of its
properties including inspection of financial and accounting records and leases,
and to make copies and take extracts therefrom, all at such times during normal
business hours and as often as Agent may reasonably request. In connection
therewith, Borrower shall pay all reasonable expenses of the types described in
Section 11.01. Borrower shall keep, and shall cause each of the REIT, each
Subsidiary and each Agreement Party to keep proper books of record and account
in conformity with GAAP, as modified and as otherwise required by this Agreement
and applicable Requirements of Law.

shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and effect all
licenses, permits, governmental approvals, franchises, patents, trademarks,
trade names, copyrights, authorizations or other rights necessary for the
operation of their respective businesses, except where the failure to obtain any
of the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and notify Agent in
writing, promptly after learning thereof, of the suspension, cancellation,
revocation or discontinuance of or of any pending or threatened action or
proceeding seeking to suspend, cancel, revoke or discontinue any such material
license, permit, patent, trademark, trade name, copyright, governmental
approval, franchise authorization or right, except where the suspension,
cancellation, revocation or discontinuance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (h) Conduct of Business. Except for Permitted Holdings and
other Investments permitted under Section 7.01(c), Borrower shall engage only in
the business of owning, operating, managing and developing manufactured home
communities, whether directly or through its Subsidiaries.

Loan only for the purpose of refinancing indebtedness outstanding under the
Prior Credit Agreement.

                  (j) Further Assurance. Borrower shall take and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and each Agreement Party to take all such further actions and

its Subsidiaries' own name.

         (using the actuarial assumptions utilized by the PBGC) for all Benefit
         Plans (other than Benefit Plans which have no Unfunded Pension

                  None of the REIT, Borrower nor any Agreement Party shall use
any "assets" (within the meaning of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal
Revenue Code, including but not limited to 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 or any
successor regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code to repay or secure the Obligations if the use of such
assets may result in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code (which is not exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code and the taxes and penalties
imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 502(i) of
ERISA) or in a Lender, Agent or the Lenders being deemed in violation of Section
404 or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise by
itself results in or will result in a Lender, Agent or the Lenders being a
fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined
in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to an "employee
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the
meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. Without limitation

dispose of their respective interests or rights (direct or indirect) in any Loan
Document, or attempt to do any of the foregoing or suffer any of the foregoing,
or permit any party with a direct or indirect interest or right in any Loan
Document to do any of the foregoing, nor shall the REIT or Borrower assign,
sell, pledge, encumber, transfer, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of any of
their respective rights or interests (direct or indirect) in any Agreement
Party, Borrower or the REIT, as applicable, or attempt to do any of the
foregoing or suffer any of the foregoing, if such action would cause the
Obligations, or the exercise of any of the Agent's or Lenders' rights in
connection therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the
Internal Revenue Code (unless Borrower furnishes to Agent a legal opinion
reasonably satisfactory to Agent that the transaction is exempt from the
prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (for
this purpose, Agent and the Lenders agree to supply Borrower all relevant
non-confidential factual information reasonably necessary to such legal opinion
and reasonably requested by Borrower)) or otherwise results in a Lender, Agent
or the Lenders being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise by itself would result in
a Lender, Agent or the Lenders being a fiduciary or party in interest under
ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section
4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code.

Costs which would have a Material Adverse Effect arising out of or related to
(i) the Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant into the environment,
or any Remedial Action in response thereto, or (ii) any violation of any
Environmental Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, Borrower and its
Subsidiaries shall have the right to contest in good faith any claim of
violation of an Environmental Law by appropriate legal proceedings and shall be
entitled to postpone compliance with the obligation being contested as long as
(i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) Borrower
shall have given Agent prior written notice of the commencement of such contest,
(iii) noncompliance with such Environmental Law shall not subject Borrower or
such Subsidiary to any criminal penalty or subject Agent to pay any civil
penalty or to prosecution for a crime, and (iv) no portion of any Property
material to Borrower or its condition or prospects shall be in imminent danger
of being sold, forfeited or lost, by reason of such contest or the continued
existence of the matter being contested.

                  (h) Amendment of Constituent Documents. Borrower shall not
permit any amendment of its limited partnership agreement, certificate of
limited partnership or by-laws, if any, which would materially and adversely
affect Agent or Lenders or their respective rights and remedies under the Loan
Documents.

                  (i) Disposal of Interests. Borrower will not directly or
indirectly convey, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber or
dispose of any material portion of its partnership interests, stock or other
ownership interests in any Subsidiary or other Person in which it has an
interest unless Borrower has delivered to Agent a Compliance Certificate showing
on a pro forma basis (calculated in a manner reasonably acceptable to Agent)
that there


                                       54

would be no breach of any of the financial covenants contained in Articles VII
and VIII after giving effect to such conveyance, sale, transfer, assignment,
pledge, or other encumbrance or disposition.

                  (j) Margin Regulations. No portion of the proceeds of any
credit extended under this Agreement shall be used in any manner which might
cause the extension of credit or the application of such proceeds to violate
Regulation U or Regulation X or any other regulation of the Federal Reserve
Board or to violate the Securities Exchange Act or the Securities Act, in each
case as in effect on the Closing Date and the date of such use of proceeds.

                  (k) Transactions with Affiliates. Borrower shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, enter into, any transaction or
series of related transactions with any Affiliate of Borrower, other than
transactions in the ordinary course of business which are on terms and
conditions substantially as favorable to Borrower or such Subsidiary as would be
obtainable by Borrower or such Subsidiary in an arms-length transaction with a
Person other than an Affiliate.

                  (a) Indebtedness. The REIT shall not, and shall not permit any

         may be incurred or may remain outstanding without giving rise to an
         Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default under any provision of
         Articles VII and VIII; provided, however, that (A) the REIT shall not,
         and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, guarantee or otherwise

         permit any Subsidiary to create, incur, assume or otherwise become or
         remain directly or indirectly liable with respect to, any Recourse

         Subsidiary at any time or Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) in the
         aggregate for all Subsidiaries at any time.

                  (b) Liens. The REIT shall not, and shall not permit any of its

         interests identified on Schedule 4.01(v) as being owned by the REIT and
         any other ownership interests in Subsidiaries and Investment Affiliates
         which are permitted under the terms of Borrower's partnership

interest in the project (as determined by Borrower in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to Agent).

requirements shall be calculated as of the last day of each Fiscal Quarter, but

which event the following notice shall not be required), Agent shall have given
Borrower written notice that Agent has not received such payment on or before
the date such payment was required to be made and Borrower shall have failed to
make such payment within five (5) days after receipt of such notice; or (iv) the

order of any court or administrative agency awarding material damages shall be
entered against the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, or any Agreement Party in
any action under the Federal securities laws seeking rescission of the purchase
or sale of, or for damages arising from the purchase or sale of, any Securities,
such judgment or order shall have become final after exhaustion of all available
appellate remedies and such judgment or order would have a Material Adverse

connection therewith shall constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA
and/or the Internal Revenue Code (which is not


                                       61
<PAGE>

exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the

Internal Revenue Code and Section 502(i) of ERISA).

                  (n) ERISA Liabilities. (i) Any Termination Event occurs which
will or is reasonably likely to subject Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any

to a liability which Agent reasonably determines will have a Material Adverse
Effect; (iii) any Benefit Plan shall incur an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(as defined in Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA)
for which a waiver shall not have been obtained in accordance with the

funding deficiency" will or would reasonably be anticipated to subject Borrower,
the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or
any of them to a liability which Agent reasonably determines will have a
Material Adverse Effect; (iv) Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement
Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them shall have engaged in a

or Section 406 of ERISA which will or would reasonably be anticipated to result
in the imposition of a liability on Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any
Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them which Agent
reasonably determines will have a Material Adverse Effect; (v) Borrower, the
REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or any
of them shall fail to pay when due an amount which it shall have become liable
to pay to the PBGC, a Plan or a trust established under Title IV of ERISA which

liability on Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any
ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them which Agent reasonably determines will
have a Material Adverse Effect; (vi) a condition shall exist by reason of which
the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a decree adjudicating that a Benefit Plan

ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them which Agent reasonably determines will
have a Material Adverse Effect; (vii) a Lien shall be imposed on any assets of
Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate

Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate


                                       62
<PAGE>

thereof or any of them shall suffer a partial or complete withdrawal from a

ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer Plan resulting from a
complete or partial withdrawal (as described in Section 4203 or 4205 of ERISA)

                  9.02  Rights and Remedies.

                  (a) Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
with respect to Borrower described in the foregoing Section 9.01(g) or 9.01(h),
the unpaid principal amount of and any and all accrued interest on the Loan and
all of the other Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and
payable, with all additional interest from time to time accrued thereon and
without presentment, demand or protest or other requirements of any kind
(including without limitation diligence, presentment, notice of intent to demand
or accelerate or notice of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly
waived by Borrower, and the obligations of Lenders to make, continue or convert
any Loan hereunder shall thereupon terminate; and upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of any other Event of Default, Agent shall, at the request of,
or may, with the consent of, Requisite Lenders, by written notice to Borrower,
declare the unpaid principal amount of and any and all accrued and unpaid
interest on the Loan and all of the other Obligations to be, and the same shall
thereupon be, immediately due and payable with all additional interest from time
to time accrued thereon and without presentment, demand, or protest or other
requirements of any kind (including without limitation diligence, presentment,
notice of intent to demand or accelerate and of acceleration), all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Borrower. Upon the occurrence of and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, no Agreement Party shall be permitted to
make any distributions or dividends without the prior written consent of Agent.
Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default or an acceleration of the
Obligations, Agent and Lenders may exercise all or any portion of the rights and
remedies set forth in the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Access to Information. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the Loan Documents, upon the occurrence of and during the
continuance of an Event of Default,


                                       63
<PAGE>

Agent shall be entitled to request and receive, by or through Borrower or
appropriate legal process, any and all information concerning the REIT,
Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower, any Investment Affiliate, any Agreement
Party, or any property of any of them, which is reasonably available to or
obtainable by Borrower.

                  (c) Waiver of Demand. Demand, presentment, protest and notice
of nonpayment are hereby waived by Borrower.

                  (d) Waivers, Amendments and Remedies. No delay or omission of
Agent or Lenders to exercise any right under any Loan Document shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein, and any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no
waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of
the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in a writing signed by Agent
after obtaining written approval thereof or the signature thereon of those
Lenders required to approve such waiver, amendment or other variation, and then
only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies
contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all
shall be available to Agent and Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in
full, the Commitments have expired or terminated and this Agreement has been
terminated.

                  9.03 Rescission. If at any time after acceleration of the
maturity of the Loan, Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all
payments on account of principal of the Loan which shall have become due
otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent
permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified in this Agreement)
and all Events of Default and Unmatured Events of Default (other than nonpayment
of principal of and accrued interest on the Loan due and payable solely by
virtue of acceleration) shall be remedied or waived pursuant to Section 11.05,
then by written notice to Borrower, Requisite Lenders may elect, in the sole
discretion of Requisite Lenders to rescind and annul the acceleration and its
consequences; but such action shall not affect any subsequent Event of Default
or Unmatured Event of Default or impair any right or remedy in connection
therewith. The provisions of the preceding sentence are intended merely to bind
Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election of Requisite Lenders;
they are not intended to benefit Borrower and do not give Borrower the right to
require Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder, even if the
conditions set forth herein are met.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

                  10.01  Appointment.

                  (a) Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Wells Fargo as
Agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the Loan Documents, and each
Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents and to exercise
such powers as are set forth herein or therein, together with


                                       64
<PAGE>

such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent agrees to act as
such on the express conditions contained in this Article X.

                  (b) The provisions of this Article X are solely for the
benefit of Agent and Lenders, and Borrower shall not have any rights to rely on
or enforce any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties
under this Agreement, Agent shall act solely as Agent of Lenders and does not
assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or
relationship of agency or trust with or for Borrower.

                  10.02 Nature of Duties. Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the
Loan Documents. The duties of Agent shall be administrative in nature. Subject
to the provisions of Sections 10.05 and 10.07, Agent shall administer the Loan
in the same manner as it administers its own loans. Agent shall not have by
reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender.
Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to impose upon Agent any obligation in respect of
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein
or therein. Each Lender shall make its own independent investigation of the
financial condition and affairs of the REIT, Borrower, the Subsidiaries, the
Investment Affiliates, and each Agreement Party in connection with the making
and the continuance of the Loan hereunder and shall make its own assessment of
the creditworthiness of the REIT, Borrower, the Subsidiaries, the Investment
Affiliates, and each Agreement Party, and, except as specifically provided
herein, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either initially or on
a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession before the Closing Date
or at any time or times thereafter.

                  10.03  Loan Continuation/Conversion.

                  (a) Promptly after receipt of a Notice of
Continuation/Conversion, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days prior
to the proposed Continuation/Conversion Date for the continuation of a LIBOR
Loan or the conversion of a Base Rate Loan into a LIBOR Loan, Agent shall
notify, by telecopy, each Lender of the proposed continuation or conversion and
the Continuation/Conversion Date set forth therein. Each Lender shall make
available to Agent (or the funding bank or entity designated by Agent), the
amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Loan in immediately available
funds not later than the time designated in Section 10.03(b). Unless Agent shall
have been notified by any Lender prior to such time for funding in respect of
the Loan that such Lender does not intend to make available to Agent such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Loan, Agent may assume that such Lender has made
such amount available to Agent and Agent, in its sole discretion, may, but shall
not be obligated to, make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. If such
corresponding amount is not in fact made available to Agent by such Lender on or
prior to the Closing Date, such Lender agrees to pay to Agent forthwith on
demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to Borrower until the date such
amount is paid or repaid to Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender
shall pay to Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall
constitute such Lender's Pro Rata Share of the


                                       65
<PAGE>

Loan. If such Lender shall not pay to Agent such corresponding amount after
reasonable attempts are made by Agent to collect such amounts from such Lender,
Borrower agrees to repay to Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made
available to Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to Agent, at the
interest rate applicable thereto.

                  (b) Each Lender shall make the amount of its Pro Rata Share of
the Loan available to Agent in Dollars and in immediately available funds, to
such bank and account, in El Segundo, California as Agent may designate, not
later than 9:00 A.M. (California time) on the Closing Date. Nothing in this
Section 10.03(b) shall be deemed to relieve any Lender of its obligation
hereunder to deliver its Pro Rata Share of the Loan on the Closing Date, nor
shall any Lender be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to perform
its obligations to deliver its Pro Rata Share of the Loan hereunder, and the
Commitment of any Lender shall not be increased or decreased as a result of the
failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to deliver its Pro Rata
Share of the Loan as required by this Section 10.03.

                  10.04 Distribution and Apportionment of Payments. Payments
actually received by Agent for the account of Lenders shall be paid to them
promptly after receipt thereof by Agent, but in any event prior to 3:00 P.M.
(California time) on the day of receipt (if received by 11:00 A.M. (California
time) on such day), or within one (1) Business Day thereafter (if received after
11:00 A.M. (California time) on the day of receipt), provided that Agent shall
pay to such Lenders interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate from the Business
Day on which such funds are required to be paid to Lenders by Agent until such
funds are actually paid in immediately available funds to such Lenders. All
payments of principal and interest in respect of the outstanding Loan, all
payments of the fees described in this Agreement (other than agency and
arrangement fees described in Section 2.04(b)), and all payments in respect of
any other Obligations shall be allocated among such of Lenders as are entitled
thereto, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares or otherwise as
provided herein. Agent shall promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business
Days (with interest thereon, if required pursuant to this Section 11.04(a)),
distribute to each Lender at its primary address set forth on the appropriate
counterpart signature page hereof or on the Assignment and Assumption, or at
such other address as a Lender may request in writing, such funds as it may be
entitled to receive, provided that Agent shall in any event not be bound to
inquire into or determine the validity, scope or priority of any interest or
entitlement of any Lender and may suspend all payments and seek appropriate
relief (including without limitation instructions from Requisite Lenders, or all
Lenders, as applicable, or an action in the nature of interpleader) in the event
of any doubt or dispute as to any apportionment or distribution contemplated
hereby. The order of priority herein is set forth solely to determine the rights
and priorities of Lenders as among themselves and may at any time or from time
to time be changed by Lenders as they may elect, in writing in accordance with
Section 11.05, without necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by
Borrower or any other Person.

                  10.05 Rights, Exculpation, Etc. Neither Agent, any Affiliate
of Agent, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys or consultants, shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or
omitted by them hereunder or under any of the Loan


                                       66
<PAGE>

Documents, or in connection herewith or therewith, except that Agent shall be
liable for its gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its
express obligations hereunder. In the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct, Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of
payments made by it in good faith pursuant to Section 10.04. Agent shall not be
responsible to any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or
warranties herein or for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity,
enforceability, collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the
other Loan Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby; or for the financial condition of the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary,
any Investment Affiliate, or any Agreement Party. Agent shall not be required to
make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents
or the financial condition of the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment
Affiliate, or any Agreement Party, or the existence or possible existence of any
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default. Agent may at any time request
instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which, by the
terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents, Agent is permitted or
required to take or to grant without instructions from any Lenders, and if such
instructions are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to
refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be
under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from taking any
action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it
shall have received such instructions from Requisite Lenders or Supermajority
Lenders, as the case may be. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall
have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or
refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders
or, where applicable, all Lenders. Agent shall promptly notify each Lender at
any time that the Requisite Lenders or Supermajority Lenders, as the case may
be, have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

                  10.06 Reliance. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents, telecopies
or any telephone message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to
all matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and its
duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of legal counsel (including counsel
for Borrower), independent public accountant and other experts selected by it.

                  10.07 Indemnification. To the extent that Agent is not
reimbursed and indemnified by Borrower, Lenders will reimburse, within ten (10)
days after notice from Agent, and indemnify Agent for and against any and all
Liabilities and Costs which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against
Agent (in its capacity as Agent) in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by
Agent (in its capacity as Agent) under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, in proportion to each Lender's Pro Rata Share, provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Liabilities and Costs resulting
from Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct, bad faith or fraud. The
obligations of Lenders under this Section 10.07 shall survive the payment in
full of all Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. In the event that
after payment and distribution of any amount by Agent to Lenders, any Lender or
third party,


                                       67
<PAGE>

including Borrower, any creditor of Borrower or a trustee in bankruptcy,
recovers from Agent any amount found to have been wrongfully paid to Agent or
disbursed by Agent to Lenders, then Lenders, in proportion to their respective
Pro Rata Shares, shall reimburse Agent for all such amounts. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Agent shall not be obligated to advance Liabilities and Costs and may
require the deposit by each Lender of its Pro Rata Share of any material
Liabilities and Costs anticipated by Agent before they are incurred or made
payable.

                  10.08 Agent Individually. With respect to its Pro Rata Share
of the Commitments hereunder and its Pro Rata share of the Loan, Agent shall
have and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the
same obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any
other Lender. The terms "Lenders", "Requisite Lenders", "Supermajority Lenders",
or any similar terms may include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender,
one of the Requisite Lenders or one of the Supermajority Lenders, but Requisite
Lenders and Supermajority Lenders shall not include Agent solely in its capacity
as Agent. Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as if it were not acting as Agent
pursuant hereto.

                    10.09 Successor Agent; Resignation of Agent; Removal of
               Agent.

                  (a) Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions
and duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30) Business Days
prior written notice to Lenders and Borrower. For good cause, by a determination
of all the Lenders (excluding for such determination Agent in its capacity as a
Lender), Agent may be removed at any time by giving at least thirty (30)
Business Days prior written notice to Agent and Borrower. Such resignation or
removal shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Agent of
appointment pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided
below.

                  (b) Upon any such notice of resignation by or removal of
Agent, Requisite Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent with the consent of
Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and which
approval from Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default). Any successor Agent must be a bank (i) the
senior debt obligations of which (or such Bank's parent's senior debt
obligations) are rated not less than Baa-1 by Moody's or a comparable rating by
a rating agency acceptable to Requisite Lenders, (ii) which has total assets in
excess of Ten Billion Dollars ($10,000,000,000) and (iii) which is a Lender as
of the date of such succession holding a Commitment without participants equal
to at least ten percent (10%) of the Facility. Agent hereby agrees to remit to
any successor Agent, a pro rata portion of any annual agent's fee received by
Agent, in advance, for the one-year period covered by such agent's fee based
upon the portion of such year then remaining.

                  (c) If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed
within said thirty (30) Business Day period, the retiring or removed Agent, with
the consent of Borrower, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and
which approval from Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default), shall then


                                       68
<PAGE>

appoint a successor Agent who shall meet the requirements described in
subsection (b) above and who shall serve as Agent until such time, if any, as
Requisite Lenders, with the consent of Borrower, which may not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed (and which approval from Borrower shall not be required upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), appoint a
successor Agent as provided above.

                  10.10  Consents and Approvals.

                  (a) Each Lender authorizes and directs Agent to enter into the
Loan Documents other than this Agreement for the benefit of Lenders. Each Lender
agrees that any action taken by Agent at the direction or with the consent of
Requisite Lenders or the Supermajority Lenders and any action taken by Agent not
requiring consent by Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders, or all Lenders in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Document, and the
exercise by Agent at the direction or with the consent of Requisite Lenders or
the Supermajority Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together
with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized
and binding upon all Lenders, except for actions specifically requiring the
approval of all Lenders. All communications from Agent to Lenders requesting
Lenders' determination, consent, approval or disapproval (i) shall be given in
the form of a written notice to each Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied by a
description of the matter or item as to which such determination, approval,
consent or disapproval is requested, or shall advise each Lender where such
matter or item may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue
to be resolved, (iii) shall include, if reasonably requested by a Lender and to
the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written materials and a
summary of all oral information provided to Agent by Borrower in respect of the
matter or issue to be resolved, and (iv) shall include Agent's recommended
course of action or determination in respect thereof. Each Lender shall reply
promptly, but in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of
the request therefor from Agent (the "Lender Reply Period"). Unless a Lender
shall give written notice to Agent that it objects to the recommendation or
determination of Agent (together with a written explanation of the reasons
behind such objection) within the Lender Reply Period, such Lender shall be
deemed to have approved of or consented to such recommendation or determination.
With respect to decisions requiring the approval of Requisite Lenders,
Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders, Agent shall submit its recommendation or
determination for approval of or consent to such recommendation or determination
to all Lenders and upon receiving the required approval or consent shall follow
the course of action or determination recommended to Lenders by Agent or such
other course of action recommended by Requisite Lenders or Supermajority
Lenders, as the case may be, and each non-responding Lender shall be deemed to
have concurred with such recommended course of action. The following amendments,
modifications or waivers shall require the consent of the Requisite Lenders:

                           (i)  Waiver of Sections 7.01(h) or 7.02(e);

                           (ii) Acceleration following an Event of Default
         pursuant to Section 9.02(a) (except for any Event of Default pursuant
         to Sections 9.01(g) or 9.01(h)) or rescission of such acceleration
         pursuant to Section 9.03;


                                       69
<PAGE>

                           (iii) Approval of the exercise of remedies requiring
         the consent of the Requisite Lenders under Section 9.02(a);

                           (iv) Appointment of a successor Agent in accordance
         with Sections 10.09(b) and (c); or

                           (v)  Disapproval of any Property as a Qualifying
         Unencumbered Property.

                  (b) Except for amendments, modifications and waivers requiring
the consent of all Lenders pursuant to Section 11.05(b) hereof, the consent of
the Supermajority Lenders shall be required to amend or modify Sections 8.01,
8.02, 8.03, 8.04, 8.05, 8.06, 8.07 or 9.01(a) or to waive any requirement
thereof or to amend or modify this Section 10.10(b).

                  (c) In addition to the required consents or approvals referred
to in Section 11.05, Agent may at any time request instructions from Requisite
Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which, by the terms of this
Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents, Agent is permitted or required to
take or to grant without instructions from any Lenders, and if such instructions
are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from
taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any
liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from taking any action or
withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have
received such instructions from Requisite Lenders. Without limiting the
foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as
a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement, any of
the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite
Lenders or, where applicable, Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders. Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender at any time that the Requisite Lenders or
Supermajority Lenders have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting
pursuant hereto.

                  10.11  Assignments and Participations.

                  (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 10.11(j), after first
obtaining the approval of Agent and Borrower, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld (and which approval from Borrower shall not be required
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), each
Lender may assign to one or more banks, finance companies, insurance or other
institutions all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement
in accordance with the provisions of this Section (including without limitation
all or a portion of its Commitment and the portion of the Loan owing to it);
provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not
a varying, percentage of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement and the assignment shall cover the same percentage of such
Lender's Commitment and the portion of the Loan owing to it, (ii) unless Agent
and Borrower otherwise consent (which consent of Borrower shall not be required
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), the
aggregate amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned to a
Person that is not already a Lender hereunder (provided such Lender was also a
Lender on the Closing Date) pursuant to each such assignment shall in no event
be less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) and shall be an integral multiple
of One Million


                                       70
<PAGE>

Dollars ($1,000,000), (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute
and deliver to Agent, for its approval and acceptance, an Assignment and
Assumption and (iv) Agent shall receive from the assignor or assignors for its
sole account a processing fee of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000). Upon such
execution, delivery, approval and acceptance, and upon the effective date
specified in the applicable Assignment and Assumption, (A) the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been validly and effectively assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (B) the Lender-assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been validly and effectively assigned by
it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement.

                  (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption,
the Lender-assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Assumption, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto;
(ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the REIT, Borrower,
any Subsidiary, any Investment Affiliate, or any Agreement Party or the
performance or observance by the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment
Affiliate, or any Agreement Party of any of their respective obligations under
any Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto;
(iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,
together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Article V or
delivered pursuant to Article V to the date of such assignment and such other
Loan Documents and other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate
to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Assumption; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
assignee appoints and authorizes Agent to take such action as Agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee
agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the
obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by
it as a Lender.

                  (c) Agent shall maintain at its address referred to on the
counterpart signature pages hereof a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
delivered to and accepted by it and shall record the names and addresses of each
Lender and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loan owing to, such
Lender from time to time. Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person
whose name is so recorded as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement.


                                       71
<PAGE>

                  (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee, Agent shall, if such Assignment and
Assumption has been properly completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit A, (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption, (ii) record the
information contained therein and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to Borrower.
Upon request, Borrower will execute and deliver to Agent an appropriate
replacement promissory note or replacement promissory notes in favor of each
assignee (and assignor, if such assignor is retaining a portion of its
Commitment and the Loan) reflecting such assignee's (and assignor's) Pro Rata
Share(s) of the Facility. Upon execution and delivery of such replacement
promissory notes, the original promissory note or notes evidencing all or a
portion of the Commitment and the Loan being assigned shall be canceled and
returned to Borrower.

                  (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks,
finance companies, insurance or other entities in or to all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation all or
a portion of its Commitment and the portion of the Loan owing to it); provided,
however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including
without limitation its Commitment to Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations, (iii) Borrower, Agent and the other Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and with regard to any
and all payments to be made under this Agreement and (iv) the holder of any such
participation shall not be entitled to voting rights under this Agreement except
that such Participant may have the contractual right in the applicable
participation agreement to prevent (A) increases in the Facility, (B) extensions
of the Maturity Date (except pursuant to Section 2.09 hereof), (C) decreases in
the interest rates described in this Agreement, and (D) a release of the REIT
Guaranty.

                  (f) Borrower will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Agent and Lenders in connection with the assignment of interests under this
Agreement or the sale of participations herein.

                  (g) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, and without the need to comply with any of the formal or
procedural requirements of this Agreement, including Section 10.11, any Lender
may at any time and from time to time pledge and assign all or any portion of
its rights under all or any of the Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from its
obligations thereunder. To facilitate any such pledge or assignment, Agent
shall, at the request of such Lender, enter into a letter agreement with the
Federal Reserve Bank in, or substantially in, the form of the exhibit to
Appendix C to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Operating Circular No 12.

                  (h) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Lender may assign all or any portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to a Lender Affiliate of such Lender without
first obtaining the approval of Agent and Borrower, provided that (i) such
Lender gives Agent and Borrower at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice
of any such assignment, (ii) the parties to each such assignment execute and
deliver to Agent an Assignment


                                       72
<PAGE>

and Assumption, and (iii) Agent receives from assignor for its sole account a
processing fee of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000).

                  (i) No Lender shall be permitted to assign, or sell a
participation interest in, all or any portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement to Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower.

                  (j) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, no Lender shall be permitted to enter into an assignment of its
rights and obligations hereunder which would result in such Lender holding a
Commitment of less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). In the event Agent
ceases to hold a Commitment of less than ten percent (10%) of the Facility,
Agent shall resign from the performance of all of its functions and duties
hereunder; provided, however, that no such resignation shall be required during
the continuance of an Event of Default.

                  10.12 Ratable Sharing. Subject to Sections 10.03 and 10.04,
Lenders agree among themselves that (i) with respect to all amounts received by
them which are applicable to the payment of the Obligations, equitable
adjustment will be made so that, in effect, all such amounts will be shared
among them ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, whether received by
voluntary payment, by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any or all of the
Obligations, (ii) if any of them shall by voluntary payment or by the exercise
of any right of counterclaim, set-off, banker's lien or otherwise, receive
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of the Obligations held by it
which is greater than its Pro Rata Share of the payments on account of the
Obligations, the one receiving such excess payment shall purchase, without
recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (which it shall be
deemed to have done simultaneously upon the receipt of such payment) in such
Obligations owed to the others so that all such recoveries with respect to such
Obligations shall be applied ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares;
provided, that if all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing
party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases shall be rescinded and
the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to that party
to the extent necessary to adjust for such recovery, but without interest except
to the extent the purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection
with such recovery. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 10.12 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including,
subject to Section 11.04, the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in
the amount of such participation.

                  10.13 Delivery of Documents. Agent shall as soon as reasonably
practicable distribute to each Lender at its primary address set forth on the
appropriate counterpart signature page hereof or at such other address as a
Lender may request in writing, (i) all documents to which such Lender is a party
or of which such Lender is a beneficiary set forth on the Closing Checklist
attached hereto as Exhibit B and (ii) all documents of which Agent receives
copies from Borrower for distribution to Lenders pursuant to Sections 5.01 and
11.07. In addition, within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a request in
writing from a Lender for written


                                       73
<PAGE>

information or documents provided by or prepared by Borrower, the REIT or any
Agreement Party, Agent shall deliver such written information or documents to
such requesting Lender if Agent has possession of such written information or
documents in its capacity as Agent or as a Lender.

                  10.14 Notice of Events of Default. Except as expressly
provided in this Section 10.14, Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default
(other than nonpayment of principal of or interest on the Loan) unless Agent has
received notice in writing from a Lender or Borrower referring to this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents, describing such event or condition and expressly
stating that such notice is a notice of an Unmatured Event of Default or Event
of Default. Should Agent receive such notice of the occurrence of an Unmatured
Event of Default or Event of Default, or should Agent send Borrower a notice of
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default, Agent shall promptly give notice
thereof to each Lender.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  11.01  Expenses.

                  (a) Generally. Borrower agrees, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written notice from the Agent, to pay or reimburse Agent for all of
Agent's reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Agent at any time (whether
prior to, on or after the date of this Agreement) in connection with: (A) the
negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and any amendments or waivers with respect hereto requested by
Borrower, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of Agent's outside counsel incurred in connection therewith; (B)
the making of the Loan and (C) the collection or enforcement by Agent of any of
the Obligations, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs incurred in connection therewith.

                  (b) After Event of Default. Borrower further agrees to pay, or
reimburse Agent and Lenders, for all reasonable costs and expenses, including
without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred by
Agent or Lenders after the occurrence of an Event of Default (i) in enforcing
any Obligation or exercising or enforcing any other right or remedy available by
reason of such Event of Default; (ii) in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or in any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding; (iii) in
commencing, defending or intervening in any litigation or in filing a petition,
complaint, answer, motion or other pleadings in any legal proceeding relating to
Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party and related to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) in taking any other action in or with
respect to any suit or proceeding (whether in bankruptcy or otherwise); or (v)
attempting to enforce or enforcing any rights under the Loan Documents;
provided, however, that the attorneys' fees and disbursements for which Borrower
is obligated under this subsection (b) shall be limited to the reasonable
non-duplicative fees and disbursements of counsel for Agent and


                                       74
<PAGE>

counsel for all Lenders as a group. For purposes of this Section 11.01(b), (i)
counsel for Agent shall mean a single outside law firm representing Agent plus
any additional law firms providing special local law representation in
connection with the enforcement of the Loan Documents, and (ii) counsel for all
Lenders as a group shall mean a single outside law firm representing such
Lenders as a group.

                  11.02  Indemnity.

                  (a) Generally. Borrower shall indemnify and defend Agent and
each Lender and their respective affiliates, participants, officers, directors,
employees and agents (each an "Indemnitee") against, and shall hold each such
Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, damages (whether general, punitive
or otherwise), liabilities, claims, causes of action (whether legal, equitable
or administrative), judgments, court costs and legal or other expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) which such Indemnitee may suffer or
incur: (i) in connection with claims made by third parties against such
Indemnitee for losses or damages suffered by such third party as a result of (A)
such Indemnitee's performance of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, including without limitation such Indemnitee's exercise or failure to
exercise any rights, remedies or powers in connection with this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents or (B) the failure by Borrower, the REIT or any
Agreement Party to perform any of their respective obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents as and when required hereby or
thereby, including without limitation any failure of any representation or
warranty of Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party to be true and correct;
(ii) in connection with any claim or cause of action of any kind by any Person
to the effect that such Indemnitee is in any way responsible or liable for any
act or omission by Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party, whether on account
of any theory of derivative liability or otherwise; (iii) in connection with the
past, present or future environmental condition of any Property owned by
Borrower, the REIT, Subsidiary or any Agreement Party, the presence of
asbestos-containing materials at any such Property, the presence of Contaminants
in groundwater at any such Property, or the Release or threatened Release of any
Contaminant into the environment from any such Property; or (iv) in connection
with any claim or cause of action of any kind by any Person which would have the
effect of denying such Indemnitee the full benefit or protection of any
provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

                  (b) ERISA. Without limitation of the provisions of subsection
(a) above, Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Indemnitee free and harmless
from and against all loss, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), expenses, taxes, and damages (including consequential damages) such
Indemnitee may suffer or incur by reason of the investigation, defense and
settlement of claims and in obtaining any prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code necessary in such Indemnitee's reasonable
judgment by reason of the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in the first paragraph of Section 4.01(s) or a breach of the provisions
set forth in the last paragraph of Section 7.01(f).

                  (c) Exceptions; Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Section 11.02, Borrower shall have no obligation to
any Indemnitee hereunder with


                                       75
<PAGE>

respect to (i) any intentional tort, fraud or act of gross negligence or bad
faith which any Indemnitee is personally determined by the judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction (sustained on appeal, if any) to have committed, (ii)
any liability of such Indemnitee to any third party based upon contractual
obligations of such Indemnitee owing to such third party which are not expressly
set forth in the Loan Documents or (iii) violations of Environmental Laws
relating to a Property which are caused by the act or omission of such
Indemnitee after such Indemnitee takes possession of such Property and which
would not have occurred if such Indemnitee had exercised reasonable care under
the circumstances. In addition, the indemnification set forth in this Section
11.02 in favor of any officer, director, partner, employee or agent of Agent or
any Lender shall be solely in their respective capacities as such officer,
director, partner, employee or agent. Such indemnification in favor of any
affiliate of Agent or any Lender shall be solely in its capacity as the provider
of services to Agent or such Lender in connection with this Agreement, and such
indemnification in favor of any participant of Agent or any Lender shall be
solely in its capacity as a participant in the Commitments and the Loan.

                  (d) Payment; Survival. Borrower shall pay any amount owing
under this Section 11.02 within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor
by the applicable Indemnitee together with reasonable supporting documentation
therefor. The indemnity set forth in this Section 11.02 shall survive the
payment of all amounts payable pursuant to, and secured by, this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Payment by any Indemnitee shall not be a condition
precedent to the obligations of Borrower under this Section 11.02. To the extent
that any indemnification obligation set forth in this Section 11.02 may be
unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, Borrower
shall contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay and satisfy
under applicable law, to the payment and satisfaction of the applicable
indemnified matter.

                  11.03 Change in Accounting Principles. Except as otherwise
provided herein, if any changes in accounting principles from those used in the
preparation of the most recent financial statements delivered to Agent pursuant
to the terms hereof are hereafter required or permitted by the rules,
regulations, pronouncements and opinions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (or successors
thereto or agencies with similar functions) and are adopted by the REIT,
Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment Affiliate, or any Agreement Party with
the agreement of its independent certified public accountants and such changes
result in a change in the method of calculation of any of the financial
covenants, standards or terms found herein, the parties hereto agree to enter
into negotiations in order to amend such provisions so as to equitably reflect
such changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the
financial condition of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, shall be the same
after such changes as if such changes had not been made; provided, however, that
no change in GAAP that would affect the method of calculation of any of the
financial covenants, standards or terms shall be given effect in such
calculations until such provisions are amended, in a manner satisfactory to
Agent and all Lenders, to so reflect such change in accounting principles.

                  11.04 Setoff. In addition to any Liens granted to Agent and
any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of
limitation of any such Lien or rights,


                                       76
<PAGE>

upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Agent
and each Lender are hereby authorized by Borrower at any time or from time to
time, with concurrent notice to Borrower, or to any other Person (any such
notice being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply
any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to,
indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured
but not including trust accounts) and any other indebtedness at any time held or
owing by Agent or such Lender solely to or for the credit or the account of
Borrower against and on account of the Obligations of Borrower to Agent or such
Lender including but not limited to the Loan and all claims of any nature or
description arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not (a) Agent or such Lender shall
have made any demand hereunder or (b) Agent shall have declared the principal of
and interest on the Loan and other amounts due hereunder to be due and payable
as permitted by Article X and although said obligations and liabilities, or any
of them, may be contingent or unmatured.

                  11.05 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or modification of
any provision of this Agreement shall be effective without the written agreement
of Requisite Lenders (after notice to all Lenders) as provided in Section
10.10(a) and Borrower (provided that the agreement of Requisite Lenders shall
not be required for amendments or modifications that are purely of a clerical
nature or that correct a manifest error), and no termination or waiver of any
such provision of this Agreement (including without limitation any waiver of an
Event of Default which does not specifically require the consent of all
Lenders), or consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event
be effective without the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders (after notice
to all Lenders) as provided in Section 10.10(a), which Requisite Lenders shall
have the right to grant or withhold at their sole discretion, except that the
amendments, modifications or waivers specified in Section 10.10(b) shall require
the consent of the Supermajority Lenders and the following amendments,
modifications or waivers shall require the consent of all Lenders (other than
Section 11.05(i) which shall require the consent of all Lenders other than
Agent):

                  (a)  Increasing the Facility;

                  (b) Changing the principal amount or final maturity of the
Loan;

                  (c) Reducing or increasing the interest rates applicable to
the Loan;

                  (d) Reducing the rates on which fees payable pursuant hereto
are determined;

                  (e) Forgiving or delaying any amount payable under Article II
(other than late fees);

                  (f) Changing the definition of "Requisite Lenders,"
"Supermajority Lenders," or "Pro Rata Shares";

                  (g)  Changing any provision contained in Section 11.05;


                                       77
<PAGE>

                  (h) Releasing any obligor under any Loan Document, unless such
release is otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document;

                  (i) Removal of Agent for good cause in accordance with Section
10.09(a); and

                  (j) Modifying or waiving any other provision herein which
specifically requires the consent of all Lenders.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Borrower
shall have no right to consent to any amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of Article X hereof; provided, however, that no
amendment, modification, termination or waiver of Section 10.09(b), 10.09(c),
10.10(a), or 10.11 (except subsection (i) thereof) which has an adverse effect
on Borrower or Borrower's rights hereunder shall be effective without the
written concurrence of Borrower. Agent and Lenders further acknowledge and agree
that the remaining provisions of Article X are intended to and shall continue to
address only the rights and obligations of Agent and Lenders amongst each other
and do not and shall not impose obligations or restrictions upon Borrower or
result in any way in the loss of any rights, claims or defenses of Borrower. No
amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of Article X
hereof or any other provision referring to any Agent shall be effective without
the written concurrence of the Agent. Any waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was
given. No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle Borrower to
any other further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances. Any
amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent effected in accordance
with this Section shall be binding on each assignee, transferee or recipient of
Agent's powers, functions or duties or any Lender's Commitment under this
Agreement or the Loan at the time outstanding.

                  11.06 Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall
be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not
permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall
not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default if
such action is taken or condition exists.

                  11.07 Notices and Delivery. Unless otherwise specifically
provided herein, any consent, notice or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served,
telecopied or sent by courier service or United States mail and shall be deemed
to have been given when delivered in person or by courier service, upon receipt
of a telecopy or if deposited in the United States mail (registered or
certified, with postage prepaid and properly addressed) upon receipt or refusal
to accept delivery. Notices to Agent shall not be effective until received by
Agent. For the purposes hereof, the addresses of the parties hereto (until
notice of a change thereof is delivered as provided in this Section 11.07) shall
be as set forth below each party's name on the signature pages hereof, or, as to
each party, at such other address as may be designated by such party in a
written notice to all of the other parties. All deliveries to be made to Agent
for distribution to the Lenders shall be made to Agent at the addresses
specified for notice on the signature page hereto and, in addition, a sufficient


                                       78
<PAGE>

number of copies of each such delivery shall be delivered to Agent for delivery
to each Lender at the address specified for deliveries on the signature page
hereto or such other address as may be designated by Agent or Lenders in a
written notice.

                  11.08 Survival of Warranties, Indemnities and Agreements. All
agreements, representations, warranties and indemnities made or given herein or
pursuant hereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and the making and repayment of the Loan hereunder and
such indemnities shall survive termination hereof.

                  11.09 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, no failure or delay on the part of Agent or any Lender in the exercise
of any power, right or privilege under any of the Loan Documents shall impair
such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or
acquiescence therein nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power,
right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other
right, power or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under the Loan
Documents are cumulative to and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

                  11.10 Marshaling; Recourse to Security; Payments Set Aside.
Neither any Lender nor Agent shall be under any obligation to marshal any assets
in favor of Borrower or any other party or against or in payment of any or all
of the Obligations. Recourse to security shall not be required at any time. To
the extent that Borrower makes a payment or payments to Agent or the Lenders or
Agent or the Lenders exercise their rights of set off, and such payment or
payments or the proceeds of such enforcement or set off or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
bankruptcy law, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the
extent of such recovery, the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to
be satisfied, and all rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and
continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such
enforcement or set off had not occurred.

                  11.11 Severability. In case any provision in or obligation
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in
any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  11.12 Headings. Section headings in this Agreement are
included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a
part of this Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

                  11.13 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
ILLINOIS.


                                       79
<PAGE>

                  11.14 Limitation of Liability. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, no claim may be made by Borrower, the REIT, any Lender or any
other Person against Agent or any Lender, or the affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, attorneys or agents of any of them, for any punitive
damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or any other theory of
liability arising out of or related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or any act, omission or event occurring in connection therewith; and
Borrower, the REIT and each Lender hereby waive, release and agree not to sue
upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not
known or suspected to exist in its favor.

                  11.15 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and the successors and permitted assigns of Agent and Lenders. The terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any permitted
assignee or transferee of the Loan and the Commitments of Lenders under this
Agreement, and in the event of such transfer or assignment, the rights and
privileges herein conferred upon Agent and Lenders shall automatically extend to
and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and
conditions hereof. Borrower's rights or any interest therein hereunder, and
Borrower's duties and obligations hereunder, shall not be assigned (whether
directly, indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) without the consent of
all Lenders.

                  11.16 Usury Limitation. Each Loan Document is expressly
limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of
error of fact or law, payment, prepayment or advancement of the proceeds of the
Loan, acceleration of maturity of the unpaid principal balance of the Loan, or
otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders for the use,
forbearance, or retention of money, including any fees or charges collected or
made in connection with the Loan which may be treated as interest under
applicable law, if any, exceed the maximum legal limit (if any such limit is
applicable) under United States federal laws or state laws (to the extent not
preempted by federal law, if any), now or hereafter governing the interest
payable under such Loan Documents. If, from any circumstances whatsoever,
fulfillment of any provision hereof or any of the other Loan Documents at the
time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the
limit of validity (if any) prescribed by law which a court of competent
jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then ipso facto, the obligation to be
fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any
circumstances Lenders shall ever receive as interest an amount which would
exceed the maximum legal limit (if any such limit is applicable), such amount
which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
unpaid principal balance due under the Loan Documents and not to the payment of
interest or, if necessary, to Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, this provision shall control
every other provision of all Loan Documents.

                  11.17 Confidentiality. Agent and Lenders shall use reasonable
efforts to assure that any information about Borrower, the REIT, Subsidiaries
and Investment Affiliates (and their respective Properties) not generally
disclosed to the public which is furnished to Agent or Lenders pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is


                                       80
<PAGE>

used only for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and
shall not be divulged to any other Person other than Agent, Lenders and their
respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents who are
actively and directly participating in the evaluation, administration or
enforcement of the Obligations; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
affect the disclosure of any such information (i) to the extent required by
statute, rule, regulation or judicial process, (ii) to counsel for Agent or
Lenders or to their accountants, (iii) to bank examiners and auditors, (iv) to
any transferee or participant or prospective transferee or participant hereunder
who agrees to be bound by this provision, (v) in connection with the enforcement
of the rights of Agent and Lenders under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents, or (vi) in connection with any litigation to which Agent or any
Lender is a party so long as Agent or such Lender provides Borrower with prior
written notice of the need for such disclosure and exercises reasonable efforts
to obtain a protective order with respect to such information from the court or
other tribunal before which such litigation is pending.

                  11.18 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS; WAIVER
OF JURY TRIAL; WAIVER OF PERMISSIVE COUNTERCLAIMS. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS
BROUGHT AGAINST BORROWER OR THE REIT WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE AND ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY BORROWER OR THE
REIT WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT SHALL BE BROUGHT
IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION HAVING SITUS WITHIN THE
BOUNDARIES OF THE FEDERAL COURT DISTRICT OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS,
AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, BORROWER AND THE REIT ACCEPT,
FOR ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY,
THE JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS, AND IRREVOCABLY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY
ANY FINAL JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY FROM WHICH NO APPEAL HAS BEEN TAKEN OR IS
AVAILABLE. BORROWER AND THE REIT HEREBY DESIGNATE AND APPOINT ELLEN KELLEHER,
ESQ., MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES, INC., TWO NORTH RIVERSIDE PLAZA, SUITE 800,
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60606, TO RECEIVE ON THEIR BEHALF SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN
ANY SUCH PROCEEDINGS IN ANY SUCH COURT, SUCH SERVICE BEING HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED
BY SUCH PERSON TO BE EFFECTIVE AND BINDING SERVICE IN EVERY RESPECT. SUCH
APPOINTMENT SHALL BE REVOCABLE ONLY WITH AGENT'S PRIOR WRITTEN APPROVAL.
BORROWER AND THE REIT IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY OF
THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF
COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL, POSTAGE PREPAID, TO ITS
RESPECTIVE NOTICE ADDRESS SPECIFIED ON THE SIGNATURE PAGES HEREOF, SUCH SERVICE
TO BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON RECEIPT. BORROWER, THE REIT, AGENT AND LENDERS
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE (A) TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, AND (B) ANY OBJECTION (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS
OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS) WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING


                                       81
<PAGE>

OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER
LOAN DOCUMENT IN ANY JURISDICTION SET FORTH ABOVE. NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT
THE RIGHT TO SERVE PROCESS IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY LAW OR SHALL LIMIT
THE RIGHT OF AGENT OR ANY LENDER TO BRING PROCEEDINGS AGAINST BORROWER IN THE
COURTS OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION. BORROWER AND THE REIT AGREE THAT THEY WILL NOT
ASSERT ANY PERMISSIVE COUNTERCLAIM IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT BY LENDER WITH
RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT.

                  11.19 Counterparts; Effectiveness; Inconsistencies. This
Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements may be executed
in counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when Borrower, the
initial Lenders and Agent have duly executed and delivered counterpart execution
pages of this Agreement to each other (delivery by Borrower and the REIT to
Lenders and by any Lender to Borrower, the REIT and any other Lender being
deemed to have been made by delivery to Agent). This Agreement and each of the
other Loan Documents shall be construed to the extent reasonable to be
consistent one with the other, but to the extent that the terms and conditions
of this Agreement are actually and directly inconsistent with the terms and
conditions of any other Loan Document, this Agreement shall govern.

                  11.20 Construction. The parties acknowledge that each party
and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal
rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this
Agreement or any amendments or exhibits hereto.

                  11.21 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, taken together with
all of the other Loan Documents and all certificates and other documents
delivered by Borrower to Agent in connection herewith, embodies the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements, written and oral, relating to the
subject matter hereof.

                  11.22 Agent's Action for Its Own Protection Only. The
authority herein conferred upon Agent, and any action taken by Agent, to inspect
any Property will be exercised and taken by Agent for its own protection only
and may not be relied upon by Borrower for any purposes whatsoever, and Agent
shall not be deemed to have assumed any responsibility to Borrower with respect
to any such action herein authorized or taken by Agent. Any review,
investigation or inspection conducted by Agent, any consultants retained by
Agent or any agent or representative of Agent in order to verify independently
Borrower's satisfaction of any conditions precedent to the Loan, Borrower's
performance of any of the covenants, agreements and obligations of Borrower
under this Agreement, or the validity of any representations and warranties made
by Borrower hereunder (regardless of whether or not the party conducting such
review, investigation or inspection should have discovered that any of such
conditions precedent were not satisfied or that any such covenants, agreements
or obligations were not performed or that any such representations or warranties
were not true), shall not affect (or constitute a waiver by Agent or Lenders of)
(i) any of Borrower's representations and warranties under this Agreement or
Agent's or Lenders' reliance thereon or (ii) Agent's or Lenders' reliance upon
any certifications of Borrower required under this


                                       82
<PAGE>

Agreement or any other facts, information or reports furnished to Agent and
Lenders by Borrower hereunder.

                  11.23 Lenders' ERISA Covenant. Each Lender, by its signature
hereto or on the applicable Assignment and Assumption, hereby agrees (a) that on
the date any Loan is disbursed hereunder no portion of such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of such Loan will constitute "assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss.
2510.3-101 of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and (b) that following such date such Lender shall not allocate
such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any Loan to an account of such Lender if such
allocation (i) by itself would cause such Pro Rata Share of such Loan to then
constitute "assets" (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 or any
successor regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) by itself would cause such Loan to constitute
a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code (which is not
exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Internal Revenue Code and the taxes and penalties imposed by Section 4975 of the
Internal Revenue Code and Section 502(i) of ERISA) or any Agent or Lender being
deemed in violation of Section 404 of ERISA.

                  11.24. Sole Lead Arranger, Documentation Agents and
Syndication Agent. Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees
that the obligations of Sole Lead Arranger, each Documentation Agent and
Syndication Agent hereunder shall be limited to those obligations that are
expressly set forth herein, if any, and Sole Lead Arranger, either Documentation
Agent and Syndication Agent shall not be required to take any action or assume
any liability except as may be required in their respective capacities as a
Lender hereunder. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that, for
purposes of the indemnifications set forth herein, the term "Agent" shall be
deemed to include Sole Lead Arranger, each Documentation Agent and Syndication
Agent.

may elect (A) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to
convert Base Rate Loans or any portion thereof into LIBOR Loans, (B) to convert
LIBOR Loans or any portion thereof into Base Rate Loans, or (C) so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to continue any LIBOR Loans or
any portion thereof for an additional Interest Period, provided, however, that
the aggregate amount of Loans being continued as or converted into LIBOR Loans
shall, in the aggregate, equal One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or an integral
multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in excess thereof. The
applicable Interest Period for the continuation of any LIBOR Loan shall commence
on the day on which the next preceding Interest Period expires. Each such
election shall be made by giving Agent, at 2120 E. Park Place, Suite 100, El
Segundo, California 90245, Attn: Jean Randall-Hall, a Notice of
Continuation/Conversion by 10:00 A.M. (California time) on the date of a
conversion to a Base Rate Loan, or by 10:00 A.M. (California time) not less than
three (3) nor more than five (5) Business Days prior to the date of a conversion
to or continuation of a LIBOR Loan, specifying, in each case (1) whether a
conversion or continuation is to occur, (2) the amount of the conversion or
continuation, (3) the Interest Period therefor, in the case of a conversion to
or continuation of a LIBOR Loan, and (4) the date of the conversion or
continuation (which date shall be a Business Day). Agent shall promptly notify
each Lender, but in any event within one (1) Business Day after receipt of such
notice, of its receipt of each such notice and the contents thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and subject to the
default interest provisions contained in Section 2.03, if an Event of Default
occurs and as a result thereof the Commitments are terminated, all LIBOR Loans
will convert to Base Rate Loans upon the expiration of the applicable Interest
Periods therefor or the date all Loans become due, whichever occurs first.
Except as provided above, the conversion of a LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate Loan
shall only occur on the last Business Day of the Interest Period relating to
such LIBOR Loan. In the absence of an effective election by Borrower of a LIBOR
Loan and Interest Period in accordance with the above procedures prior to the
third (3rd) Business Day prior to the expiration of the then current Interest
Period with respect to any LIBOR Loan, interest on such LIBOR Loan shall accrue
at the interest rate then applicable to a LIBOR Loan for an Interest Period of
thirty (30) days, effective immediately upon the expiration of the then-current
Interest Period, without prejudice, however, to the right of Borrower to elect a
Base Rate Loan or a different Interest Period in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that if such continuation shall
cause the number of LIBOR Loan tranches to exceed six (6), such LIBOR Loan shall
be converted to a Base Rate Loan.

                  (c) Making of Loans. Subject to Section 11.03, Agent shall
make the proceeds of Loans (other than Swingline Loans) available to Borrower in
El Segundo, California on such Funding Date and shall disburse such funds in
Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 P.M. Chicago time
to Borrower's account, at Bank of America, Account Number 73-66901095 in
Chicago, Illinois, or such other account specified in the Notice of Borrowing
acceptable to Agent, with a confirming telephone call to Quantaze Watts at (312)
279-1408 or Mark Howell at (312) 279-1402.

                  (d) Term; Principal Payment. The outstanding balance of the
Loans (other than Swingline Loans, which by their terms shall mature earlier)
shall be payable in full on the


                                       25
<PAGE>

earlier to occur of (A) the Maturity Date, and (B) the acceleration of the Loans
pursuant to Section 10.02(a) (the "Termination Date").

                  Authorization to Obtain Loans and Letters of Credit. Borrower
shall provide Agent with documentation reasonably satisfactory to Agent
indicating the names of those employees or agents of Borrower authorized by
Borrower to sign Notices of Borrowing, to request Letters of Credit and to
receive callback confirmations, and Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to rely
on such documentation until notified in writing by Borrower of any change(s) of
the persons so authorized. Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender shall be
entitled to act in good faith on the instructions of anyone identifying himself
as one of the Persons authorized to request Loans or Letters of Credit, and
Borrower shall be bound thereby in the same manner as if such Person were
actually so authorized. Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lenders,
Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities and Costs which may arise or be created by the acceptance of
instructions for making Loans, and issuing Letters of Credit.

                  2.03     Interest on the Loans

                  (a) Base Rate Loans. Subject to Section 2.03(d), all Base Rate
Loans shall bear interest on the average daily unpaid principal amount thereof
from the date made until paid in full at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to
the Base Rate. Base Rate Loans shall be made in minimum amounts of One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000) or an integral multiple of One Hundred Thousand Dollars
($100,000) in excess thereof.

                  (b) LIBOR Loans. Subject to Section 2.03(d), all LIBOR Loans
shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof during the Interest
Period applicable thereto at a rate per annum equal to the sum of LIBOR for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin. Upon receipt of a Notice of
Borrowing requesting LIBOR Loans, Agent shall determine LIBOR applicable to the
Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans, and shall give notice thereof to Borrower
and Lenders; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such rate. Each determination by Agent of LIBOR shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto in the absence of demonstrable
error. LIBOR Loans shall be in tranches of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) increments in excess thereof. No more
than six (6) LIBOR Loan tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.

                  (c) Interest Payments. Subject to Section 2.03(d), interest
accrued on all Loans shall be payable by Borrower in arrears on the first
Business Day of the first calendar month following the Closing Date, and the
first Business Day of each succeeding calendar month thereafter, and on the
Termination Date.

                  (d) Default Interest. Notwithstanding the rates of interest
specified in Sections 2.03(a) and 2.03(b) and the payment dates specified in
Section 2.03(c), effective immediately upon demand by Agent after the occurrence
of an Event of Default and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the
principal balance of all Loans then outstanding and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans not paid when due shall bear
interest payable upon demand at a rate which is five percent (5%) per annum in
excess of the rate or rates of interest otherwise payable under this Agreement.
All other amounts due


                                       26
<PAGE>

Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or Lenders (whether directly or for
reimbursement) under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents if not
paid when due, or if no time period is expressed, if not paid within fifteen
(15) days after written demand to Borrower, shall bear interest from and after
demand at the rate which is five percent (5%) per annum in excess of the lowest
rate or rates of interest otherwise payable under this Agreement, or, if no
Loans are then outstanding, at the rate which is five percent (5%) per annum in
excess of the rate of interest applicable to Base Rate Loans.

                  (e) Late Fee. Borrower acknowledges that late payment
hereunder will cause Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders to
incur costs not contemplated by this Agreement. Such costs include without
limitation processing and accounting charges. Therefore, if Borrower fails
timely to pay any sum due and payable hereunder through the Termination Date
(other than payments of principal), unless waived by Agent pursuant to Section
12.05(e), a late charge of four cents ($.04) for each dollar of any interest
payment due hereon and which is not paid within ten (10) days after such payment
is due or of any other amount due hereon (other than payments of principal) and
which is not paid within thirty (30) days after such payment is due, shall be
charged by Agent (for the benefit of Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and
Lenders, as applicable) and paid by Borrower for the purpose of defraying the
expense incident to handling such delinquent payment; provided, however, that no
late charges shall be assessed with respect to any amount for which Borrower is
obligated to pay interest at the rate specified in Section 2.03(d), provided,
further, that in no event shall Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or
Lenders be required to refund any late fees paid by Borrower, notwithstanding
the preceding proviso. Borrower, Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender, and
Lenders agree that this late charge represents a reasonable sum considering all
of the circumstances existing on the date hereof and represents a fair and
reasonable estimate of the costs that Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender
and Lenders will incur by reason of late payment. Borrower, Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders further agree that proof of actual damages
would be costly and inconvenient. Acceptance of any late charge shall not
constitute a waiver of the default with respect to the overdue installment, and
shall not prevent Agent from exercising any of the other rights available
hereunder or any other Loan Document. Such late charge shall be paid without
prejudice to any other rights of Agent.

                  (f) Computation of Interest. Interest and fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period during
which interest or fees accrue and a year of three hundred sixty (360) days. In
computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of the Loan shall be
included and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided, however, that if a
Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one (1) day's interest shall
be paid on that Loan. Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), (d) and (e) above,
interest in respect of any Loan shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law.

                  (g) Changes; Legal Restrictions. In the event that after the
Closing Date (A) the adoption of or any change in any law, treaty, rule,
regulation, guideline or determination of a court or Governmental Authority or
any change in the interpretation or application thereof by a court or
Governmental Authority, or (B) compliance by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing
Lender or any Lender with any request or directive made or issued after the
Closing Date (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not the
failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority or quasi-governmental authority:


                                       27
<PAGE>


                          (i) subjects Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender
                  or any Lender to any tax, duty or other charge of any kind
                  with respect to the Facility, this Agreement or any of the
                  other Loan Documents or the Loans or the Letters of Credit or
                  changes the basis of taxation of payments to Agent, Swingline
                  Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender of principal, fees,
                  interest or any other amount payable hereunder, except for net
                  income, gross receipts, gross profits or franchise taxes
                  imposed by any jurisdiction and not specifically based upon
                  loan transactions (all such non-excepted taxes, duties and
                  other charges being hereinafter referred to as "Lender
                  Taxes");

                          (ii) imposes, modifies or holds applicable, in the
                  determination of Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or
                  any Lender, any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan,
                  FDIC insurance, capital allocation or similar requirement
                  against assets held by, or deposits or other liabilities in or
                  for the account of, advances or loans by, or other credit
                  extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, Agent,
                  Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender or any
                  applicable lending office (except to the extent that the
                  reserve and FDIC insurance requirements are reflected in the
                  "Base Rate" or "LIBOR Rate"); or

                          (iii) imposes on Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing
                  Lender or any Lender any other condition materially more
                  burdensome in nature, extent or consequence than those in
                  existence as of the Closing Date;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to (X) increase the cost to Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender of making, renewing, maintaining
or participating in the Loans or issuing or participating in the Letters of
Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or thereunder or (Y) to
require Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender or any applicable
lending office to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of the
Loan held or interest received by it; then, in any such case, Borrower shall
promptly pay to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, as
applicable, upon demand, such amount or amounts (based upon a reasonable
allocation thereof by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender to
the financing transactions contemplated by this Agreement and affected by this
Section 2.03(g)) as may be necessary to compensate Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or such Lender for any such additional cost incurred, reduced
amounts received or additional payments made to the extent Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender generally imposes such additional costs,
losses and payments on other borrowers in similar circumstances. Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and in
the case of a delivery by a Lender, such Lender shall also deliver to Agent, a
written statement in reasonable detail of the claimed additional costs incurred,
reduced amounts received or additional payments made and the basis therefor as
soon as reasonably practicable after Agent or such Lender, as applicable,
obtains knowledge thereof.

                  (h)      Certain Provisions Regarding LIBOR Loans

                          (i) LIBOR Lending Unlawful. If any Lender shall
                  determine in good faith that the introduction of or any change
                  in or in the interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or
                  any central bank or other governmental authority asserts that
                  it is unlawful, for such Lender to make or maintain any Loan
                  as a LIBOR


                                       28
<PAGE>

                  Loan, (A) the obligations of the Lenders to make or maintain
                  any Loans as LIBOR Loans shall, upon such determination,
                  forthwith be suspended until such Lender shall notify Agent
                  that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer
                  exist, and (B) if required by law or such assertion, all LIBOR
                  Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate Loans.

                          (ii) Deposits Unavailable. If Agent shall have
                  determined in good faith that adequate means do not exist for
                  ascertaining the interest rate applicable hereunder to LIBOR
                  Loans, then, upon notice from Agent to Borrower the
                  obligations of all Lenders to make or maintain Loans as LIBOR
                  Loans shall forthwith be suspended until Agent shall notify
                  Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no
                  longer exist. Agent will give such notice when it determines,
                  in good faith, that such circumstances no longer exist;
                  provided, however, that Agent shall not have any liability to
                  any Person with respect to any delay in giving such notice.

                          (iii) Funding Losses. In the event any Lender shall
                  incur any loss or expense (including any loss or expense
                  incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
                  deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to make or
                  maintain any portion of any Loan as a LIBOR Loan) as a result
                  of:

                           (A) any continuance, conversion, repayment or
                  prepayment of the principal amount of any LIBOR Loans for any
                  reason whatsoever on a date other than the scheduled last day
                  of the Interest Period applicable thereto; or

                           (B) any Loans not being made as LIBOR Loans in
                  accordance with the Notice of Borrowing therefor, other than
                  as a result of such Lender's breach of its obligation to fund
                  such Loans in accordance with the terms hereof;

         then, within fifteen (15) Business Days after Borrower's receipt of the
         written notice of such Lender to Borrower with a copy to Agent,
         Borrower shall reimburse such Lender for such loss or expense;
         provided, however, that each Lender will use reasonable efforts to
         minimize such loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include
         calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
         demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

                  (i) Withholding Tax Exemption. Each Lender that is not created
or organized under the laws of the United States of America or a political
subdivision thereof shall deliver to Borrower and Agent no later than the
Closing Date (or, in the case of a Lender which becomes a Lender pursuant to
Section 11.13, the date upon which such Lender becomes a party hereto) a true
and accurate certificate executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of
such Lender, in a form satisfactory to Borrower and Agent, to the effect that
such Lender is capable, under the provisions of an applicable treaty concluded
by the United States of America (in which case the certificate shall be
accompanied by three (3) accurate and complete duly executed originals of Form
W-8BEN of the Internal Revenue Service) or under Section 1442 of the Internal
Revenue Code (in which case the certificate shall be accompanied by three (3)
accurate and complete duly executed originals of Form W-8ECI of the Internal
Revenue Service), of receiving payments of principal, interest and fees
hereunder without deduction or withholding of United States federal


                                       29
<PAGE>

income tax. Further, if at any time a Lender changes its applicable lending
office or selects an additional applicable lending office, it shall, at the same
time or promptly thereafter, but only to the extent the certificate and forms
previously delivered by it hereunder are no longer applicable or effective,
deliver to Borrower and Agent in replacement for, or in addition to, the
certificate and forms previously delivered by it hereunder, a true and accurate
certificate executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of such Lender
accompanied by three (3) accurate and complete duly executed originals of either
Form W-8BEN of the Internal Revenue Service or Form W-8ECI of the Internal
Revenue Service, whichever is applicable, indicating that such Lender is
entitled to receive payments of principal, interest and fees for the account of
such changed or additional applicable lending office under this Agreement
without deduction or withholding of United States federal tax. Each Lender
further agrees to deliver to Borrower and Agent a true and accurate certificate
executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of such Lender accompanied by
three (3) accurate and complete duly executed originals of either Form W-8BEN of
the Internal Revenue Service or Form W-8ECI of the Internal Revenue Service,
whichever is appropriate, substantially in a form satisfactory to Borrower and
Agent, before or promptly upon the occurrence of any event requiring a change in
the most recent certificate or Internal Revenue Service form previously
delivered by it to Borrower and Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(j). Further,
each Lender which delivers a certificate accompanied by Form W-8BEN of the
Internal Revenue Service covenants and agrees to deliver to Borrower and Agent
within fifteen (15) days prior to January 1, 2003, and every third (3rd)
anniversary of such date thereafter, on which this Agreement is still in effect,
another such certificate and three (3) accurate and complete original signed
copies of Form W-8BEN (or any successor form or forms required under the
Internal Revenue Code or the applicable regulations promulgated thereunder), and
each Lender that delivers a certificate accompanied by Form W-8ECI of the
Internal Revenue Service covenants and agrees to deliver to Borrower and Agent
within fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning of each subsequent taxable year
of such Lender during which this Agreement is still in effect, another such
certificate and three (3) accurate and complete original signed copies of
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor form or forms required
under the Internal Revenue Code or the applicable regulations promulgated
hereunder). If (i) any Lender is required under this Section 2.03(j) to provide
a certificate or other evidence described above and fails to deliver to Borrower
and Agent such certificate or other evidence or (ii) any Lender delivers a
certificate to the effect that, as a result of the adoption of or any change in
any law, treaty, rule, regulation, guideline or determination of a Governmental
Authority after the date such Lender became a party hereto, such Lender is not
capable of receiving payments of interest hereunder without deduction or
withholding of United States federal income tax as specified therein and that it
is not capable of recovering the full amount of the same from a source other
than Borrower, then, to the extent required by law, as the sole consequence of
such Lender's failure to deliver the certificate described in (i) above or such
Lender's delivery of the certificate described in (ii) above, Borrower shall be
entitled to deduct or withhold taxes from the payments owed to such Lender.

                  2.04     Fees.

                  (a)      Intentionally Deleted.

                  (b) Unused Facility Fee. Until the Obligations are paid in
full and this Agreement is terminated or, if sooner, the date the Commitments
terminate, and subject to Section 11.04(b), Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the
account of each Lender, an Unused


                                       30
<PAGE>

Facility Fee accruing from and after the Closing Date at the rate described
below upon the amount during each calendar quarter of (i) the Facility, minus
(ii) the sum of (A) the average daily aggregate principal balance of all Loans
then outstanding other than Swingline Loans and (B) the average daily aggregate
face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit (the "Unused Amount"). The
Unused Facility Fee will be calculated and will accrue at the rate per annum of
fifteen one-hundredths of one percent (.15%). Subject to Section 11.04(b), each
Lender shall be entitled to receive its Pro Rata Share of such Unused Facility
Fee. All such Unused Facility Fees payable under this paragraph shall be payable
in arrears on the fifth Business Day in each calendar quarter beginning with the
first calendar quarter after the Closing Date.

                  (c) Arrangement and Administrative Agency Fees. Borrower shall
pay Agent such fees as are provided for in the separate fee agreement between
Agent and Borrower, as in existence from time to time.

                  (d) Letter of Credit Fee. With respect to each Letter of
Credit, Borrower agrees to pay to Agent (i) a letter of credit fee equal to the
Applicable Margin on the face amount of such Letter of Credit for the term of
such Letter of Credit to be distributed by Agent to each Lender according to its
Pro Rata Share payable in arrears on the fifth Business Day in each calendar
quarter beginning with the first calendar quarter after the Closing Date and
ending on the date of the expiration, return or termination of such Letter of
Credit if such date is a date other than the first Business Day of a calendar
month and (ii) a non-refundable issuing fee of $500.00 solely for the account of
Issuing Lender, payable in full on the date of issuance thereof.

                  (e) Payment of Fees. The fees described in this Section 2.04
represent compensation for services rendered and to be rendered separate and
apart from the lending of money or the provision of credit and do not constitute
compensation for the use, detention or forbearance of money, and the obligation
of Borrower to pay the fees described herein shall be in addition to, and not in
lieu of, the obligation of Borrower to pay interest, other fees and expenses
otherwise described in this Agreement. All fees shall be payable when due in
California in immediately available funds and shall be non-refundable when paid.
If Borrower fails to make any payment of fees or expenses specified or referred
to in this Agreement due to Agent or Lenders, including without limitation those
referred to in this Section 2.04 or otherwise under this Agreement or any
separate fee agreement between Borrower and Agent relating to this Agreement,
when due, the amount due shall bear interest until paid at the Base Rate and,
after five (5) days at the rate specified in Section 2.03(d) (but not to exceed
the maximum rate permitted by applicable law) and shall constitute part of the
Obligations. All fees described in this Section 2.04 which are expressed as a
per annum charge shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days
elapsed in a three hundred sixty (360) day year.

                  2.05     Payments.

                  (a) Voluntary Prepayments. Borrower may, upon not less than
three (3) Business Days prior written notice (or with written notice not later
than 1:00 P.M. (California time) on the same Business Day in the case of a
Swingline Loan), at any time and from time to time, prepay any Loans, without
premium or penalty (other than as set forth in Section 2.03(h)(iii)), in whole
or in part in amounts not less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or
integral multiples of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) in excess of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Any notice of prepayment given to Agent
under this

                                       31
<PAGE>

Section 2.05(a) shall specify the date of prepayment and the aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment. All prepayments of principal shall be accompanied by a
payment of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

                  (b) Manner and Time of Payment. All payments of principal,
interest and fees hereunder payable to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender
or the Lenders shall be made without condition or reservation of right and free
of set-off or counterclaim, in Dollars and by (i) wire transfer (pursuant to
Agent's written wire transfer instructions) of immediately available funds,
delivered to Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (California time) (or 2:00 P.M.
(California time) in the case of a Swingline Loan) on the date due; and funds
received by Agent after that time and date shall be deemed to have been paid on
the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) by check (pursuant to Agent's written
check payment instructions) delivered to Agent, such check and the payment
intended to be covered thereby to be deemed to have been paid on the date Agent
receives immediately available funds therefor. All payments of principal,
interest and fees hereunder shall be made by (i) wire transfer of immediately
available funds to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (ABA number 121000248) for credit to
account number AC2963507207, reference MHC Operating Limited Partnership, loan
number 6023AMC with telephonic notice to Jean Randall-Hall at (310) 335-9492 or
(ii) check payable to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and delivered to Agent at 2120 E.
Park Place, Suite 100, El Segundo, California 90245, Attn: Jean Randall-Hall, or
to such other bank, account or address as Agent may specify in a written notice
to Borrower.

                  (c) Payments on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment to be
made by Borrower hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and such
extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of
interest hereunder and of any of the fees specified in Section 2.04, as the case
may be.

                  Increased Capital.(a) If either (i) the introduction of or any
change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii) compliance
by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender with any guideline or
request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not
having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply therewith would
be unlawful) made or issued after the Closing Date affects or would affect the
amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender or any corporation controlling Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, and Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or such Lender determines that the amount of such capital is
increased by or based upon the existence of the obligations of Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, then, upon demand by Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, Borrower shall immediately pay to Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, from time to time as specified
by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender
in light of such circumstances, to the extent that Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or such Lender reasonably determines such increase in capital to
be allocable to the existence of the obligations of Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or such Lender hereunder and to the extent Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender generally imposes such amounts on other
borrowers in similar circumstances. A certificate as to such amounts submitted
to Borrower by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender shall, in
the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes.

 2.07 Notice of Increased Costs. Each of Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender
and the Lenders agrees that, as promptly as reasonably practicable after it
becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the existence of a condition
which would cause it to be affected by any of the events or conditions described
in Section 2.03(g) or (h), or Section 2.06, it will notify Borrower and provide
in such notice a reasonably detailed calculation of the amount due from
Borrower, and provide a copy of such notice to Agent, of such event and the
possible effects thereof. If Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or the
affected Lender shall fail to notify Borrower of the occurrence of any such
event or the existence of any such condition within ninety (90) days following
the end of the month during which such event occurred or such condition arose,
then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in said Sections 2.03(g) and
(h) and 2.06 incurred by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such
affected Lender as a result of such event or condition shall be limited to those
attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the ninetieth (90th) day
prior to the date upon which Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such
affected Lender actually notified Borrower of such event or condition.

                  2.08     Option to Replace Lenders.

                  (a) Lenders. If any Lender shall make any demand for payment
or reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.03(g), Section 2.03(h) or Section 2.06,
then, provided that (a) there does not then exist any Unmatured Event of Default
or Event of Default and (b) the circumstances resulting in such demand for
payment or reimbursement are not applicable to all Lenders, Borrower may
terminate the Commitment of such Lender, in whole but not in part, by (i) giving
such Lender and Agent not less than three (3) Business Days prior written notice
thereof, which notice shall be irrevocable and effective only upon receipt
thereof by such Lender and Agent and shall specify the effective date of such
termination, (ii) paying to such Lender (and there shall become due and payable)
on such date the outstanding principal amount of all Loans made by such Lender,
all interest thereon, and all other Obligations owed to such Lender, including,
without limitation, amounts owing under Sections 2.03(g), 2.03(h)(iii), 2.04 and
2.06, if any, and (iii) pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.13, proposing
the introduction of a replacement Lender reasonably satisfactory to Agent, or
obtaining the agreement of one or more existing Lenders, to assume the entire
amount of the Commitment of the Lender whose Commitment is being terminated, on
the effective date of such termination. Upon the satisfaction of all of the
foregoing conditions, such Lender which is being terminated pursuant to this
Section 2.08 shall cease to be a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement
provided that Borrower shall continue to be obligated to such Lender under
Sections 12.01 and 12.02 (and any other indemnifications contained herein or in
any other Loan Document) with respect to or on account of unpaid, unliquidated,
unknown or similar claims or liabilities accruing prior to such Lender ceasing
to be a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (b) Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender. If Agent,
Swingline Lender or Issuing Lender shall make any demand for payment or
reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.03(g), Section 2.03(h) or Section 2.06,
then, provided that (a) there does not then exist any Unmatured Event of Default
or Event of Default and (b) the circumstances resulting in such demand for
payment or reimbursement are not applicable to all Lenders, Borrower may remove
Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender by (i) giving the Lenders and Agent
not less than thirty (30) Business Days prior written notice thereof, and (ii)
paying to Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender (and there shall become due
and payable) on such date all other Obligations owed to Agent, Swingline Lender
and Issuing Lender, including, without limitation, amounts


                                       33
<PAGE>

owing under Sections 2.03(g), 2.03(h), 2.04 and 2.06, if any. Agent, Swingline
Lender and Issuing Lender shall be replaced in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11.09 hereof.

                  2.09     Letters of Credit.

                  (a) Letter of Credit Availability. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at any time and from time to time
through the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date, Issuing
Lender shall issue such Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower as
Borrower may request in accordance with this Section 2.09; provided that (i)
upon issuance of such Letters of Credit, the sum of the aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Loans (including Swingline Loans) plus the aggregate
face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed Loan
Availability, provided, that if a Base Rate Loan is being made pursuant to
Section 2.09(e) hereof to reimburse Issuing Lender for a drawn Letter of Credit,
to avoid a duplicative reduction in the amount of Loan Availability, the drawn
Letter of Credit shall not be considered outstanding; (ii) the aggregate face
amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed Thirty Million
Dollars ($30,000,000); and (iii) unless all Lenders otherwise consent in
writing, the term of any Letter of Credit shall not extend or be extended beyond
the date which is ten (10) days prior to the Maturity Date and no Letter of
Credit shall contain an automatic extension or renewal clause. Use of funds
drawn under Letters of Credit shall be subject to the same conditions as those
for use of Loan proceeds set forth in Section 7.01(i) hereof.

                  (b) Request for Letter of Credit. Borrower shall deliver to
Agent and Issuing Lender a duly executed letter of credit application
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit H hereto (a "Letter of Credit
Application") not later than 10:00 A.M., (California time), at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date upon which a requested Letter of Credit is to be
issued. Borrower shall further deliver to Agent and Issuing Lender such
additional instruments and documents as Issuing Lender may reasonably require,
in conformity with customary and commercially reasonable practices or law, in
connection with the issuance of such Letter of Credit.

                  (c) Issuance of Letters of Credit. Subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Issuing Lender shall issue the Letter of Credit on
or before 5:00 P.M. (California time), on or before the day which is five (5)
Business Days following receipt of the documents last due pursuant to Section
2.09(b) hereof in respect thereof. Upon issuance of a Letter of Credit, Issuing
Lender shall promptly notify Lenders of the amount and terms thereof. Issuing
Lender shall provide copies of each Letter of Credit to Lenders promptly
following issuance thereof and shall notify Lenders promptly of all payments,
reimbursements, expirations, negotiations, transfers and other activity with
respect to outstanding Letters of Credit.

                  (d) Participations. Each Lender, upon issuance by Issuing
Lender of a Letter of Credit in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a risk
participation from Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and the obligations
arising thereunder, in each case in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the
obligations under such Letter of Credit, and shall absolutely, unconditionally
and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and be obligated
to pay to Issuing Lender therefor and discharge when due, its Pro Rata Share of
the obligations arising under such Letter of Credit.


                                       34
<PAGE>

                  (e) Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing or request for
drawing under any Letter of Credit, Issuing Lender will promptly notify Borrower
and Agent thereof. Unless Borrower shall notify Issuing Lender of its intent to
otherwise reimburse Issuing Lender immediately upon receipt of notice from
Issuing Lender of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall be deemed
to have requested Base Rate Loans in the amount of the drawing as provided in
subsection (f) hereof, the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy the
reimbursement obligations. Borrower shall reimburse Issuing Lender on the day of
drawing under any Letter of Credit (either with the proceeds of a Loan obtained
hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds as provided herein. If Borrower shall
fail to reimburse Issuing Lender as provided hereinabove, the unreimbursed
amount of such drawing shall bear interest at a per annum rate equal to the Base
Rate plus two percent (2%). Borrower's reimbursement obligations hereunder shall
be absolute and unconditional under all circumstances irrespective of any rights
of set-off, counterclaim or defense to payment Borrower may claim or have
against Issuing Lender, Agent, the Lenders, the beneficiary of the Letter of
Credit drawn upon or any other Person, including, without limitation, any
defense based on any failure of Borrower to receive consideration or the
legality, validity, regularity or unenforceability of the Letter of Credit;
provided, however, that (i) the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse
Issuing Lender and (ii) Lenders shall not be obligated to fund Loans or purchase
participations hereunder in reimbursement of Issuing Lender, for any wrongful
payment made by Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or
omissions constituting bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence on the
part of Issuing Lender. The Letter of Credit Obligations will be evidenced by
the Letter of Credit Note.

                  (f) Repayment with Loans. On any day on which Borrower shall
have requested, or been deemed to have requested, Base Rate Loans to reimburse a
drawing under a Letter of Credit, Agent shall give notice to the Lenders that
such Loans have been requested or deemed requested in connection with a drawing
under a Letter of Credit, in which case such Loans (collectively, a "Letter of
Credit Mandatory Borrowing") shall be immediately made by all Lenders (without
giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to Section 10.02
hereof) pro rata based on each Lender's Pro Rata Share and the proceeds thereof
shall be paid directly to Issuing Lender for application to the respective
Letter of Credit Obligations. Each Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make such
Loans promptly upon any such request or deemed request in the amount and in the
manner specified in the preceding sentence and on the same such date (or the
next Business Day if such notice is received after 10:00 A.M. (California time))
notwithstanding (i) the amount of the Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing may
not comply with the minimum amount for Borrowings otherwise required hereunder,
(ii) whether any conditions specified in Section 4.02 are then satisfied, (iii)
whether an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default then exists, (iv)
failure of any such request or deemed request for a Borrowing to be made by the
time otherwise required in Section 2.01 hereof, (v) the date of such Letter of
Credit Mandatory Borrowing (provided that such date must be a Business Day), or
(vi) any termination of the Commitments immediately prior to such Letter of
Credit Mandatory Borrowing or contemporaneously therewith. In the event that any
Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason occur in respect of a
Letter of Credit on the date otherwise required above (including, without
limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy
Code with respect to Borrower), then each Lender hereby agrees that it shall
forthwith fund (as of the date the Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing would
otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments received from Borrower on
or after such date and prior to such funding) its participation interest in the
outstanding obligations arising in


                                       35
<PAGE>

connection with such Letter of Credit, provided that (A) all interest payable on
Borrower's reimbursement obligation with respect to such Letter of Credit shall
be for the account of Issuing Lender until but excluding the day upon which the
Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and (B) in
the event of a delay between the day upon which the Letter of Credit Mandatory
Borrowing would otherwise have occurred and the time any funding of a
participation pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the funding Lender
shall be required to pay to the Issuing Lender interest on the principal amount
of such participation for each day from and including the day upon which the
Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but
excluding the date of funding of such participation, at the rate equal to the
Federal Funds Rate, for the two (2) Business Days after the date the Letter of
Credit Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and thereafter at a
rate equal to the Base Rate.

                  (g) Modification, Extension. The issuance of any supplement,
modification, amendment, renewal, or extension to any Letter of Credit shall,
for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as if it were the
issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

                  (h) Uniform Customs and Practices. Issuing Lender may have the
Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary
Credits, as published as of the date of issue by the International Chamber of
Commerce (the "UCP"), in which case the UCP may be incorporated therein and
deemed in all respects to be a part thereof.

                  (i) Collateralization at Termination Date. Upon the occurrence
of the Termination Date prior to the expiration of all Letters of Credit,
Borrower shall provide to Issuing Lender a standby letter of credit issued by a
bank with a rating of its senior unsecured debt obligations of not less than A
by Moody's, in form and substance satisfactory to Issuing Lender, in favor of
Issuing Lender in a face amount equal to the outstanding Letters of Credit on
that date, or shall make other provisions satisfactory to Issuing Lender and
Agent for the full collateralization, by cash or cash equivalent, of such
outstanding Letters of Credit. In the event of failure of Borrower to comply
with the requirement of this Section 2.09(i), such portion of the face amount of
all outstanding Letters of Credit as to which Borrower has failed to comply
shall be deemed to be immediately due and payable.

                  (j) Limitation of Liability. Borrower assumes all risks of the
acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of Credit with
respect to its use of such Letter of Credit absent the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Lender. Neither Issuing Lender,
Agent, any Lender nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees or
agents shall be liable or responsible for, nor shall Borrower's obligations
hereunder in respect of such Letters of Credit be impaired as a result of any of
the following absent the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Issuing Lender:

                          (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any
                  Letter of Credit or any other agreement or instrument relating
                  thereto (such Letter of Credit and any other agreement or
                  instrument relating thereto being, collectively, the "Letter
                  of Credit Documents");

                          (ii) the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit
                  or any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in
                  connection therewith;


                                       36
<PAGE>

                          (iii) any statement or any other document presented
                  under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent,
                  invalid or insufficient in any respect or any statement
                  therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect;

                          (iv) the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or
                  other right that Borrower may have at any time against any
                  beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any
                  Persons for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee
                  may be acting), Issuing Lender or any other Person, whether in
                  connection with the transactions contemplated by the Letter of
                  Credit Documents or any unrelated transaction;


                          (v) failure of any documents to bear any reference or
                  adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; or

                          (vi) any other circumstances whatsoever in making or
                  failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Issuing Lender may accept
documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary,
absent the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Lender.

                  (k) Lenders. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by
Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or
omitted in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct,
shall not put Issuing Lender under any resulting liability to any Lender or
relieve that Lender of its obligations hereunder to Issuing Lender. In
determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, Issuing Lender shall have
no obligations to Lenders other than to confirm that any documents required to
be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that
they appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of
Credit.

                  (l) Indemnification. Borrower shall indemnify and hold
harmless Issuing Lender, Agent and Lenders from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, reasonable costs and expenses of any kind
whatsoever, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys that such
indemnified Person may incur, together with all reasonable costs and expenses
resulting from the compromise or defense of any claims or liabilities
hereinafter described, by reason of or in connection with (i) the execution and
delivery or transfer of, or payment or failure to pay under, any Letter of
Credit, (ii) any suit, action or proceeding brought by any Person to require or
present payment under any Letter of Credit, or (iii) any breach by Borrower of
any warranty, covenant, term or condition in, or the occurrence of any default
under, any Letter of Credit or any related contract; provided, however, that
Borrower shall not be required to indemnify Issuing Lender, Agent or any Lender
for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent,
but only to the extent, caused by the willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad
faith or fraud of such indemnified Person; and provided, further, that Issuing
Lender will be liable to Borrower for any damages suffered by Borrower as a
result of Issuing Lender's grossly negligent or willful failure to pay under any
Letter of Credit after the presentment to it of documentation in strict
compliance with the terms and conditions of


                                       37
<PAGE>

the Letter of Credit and absent any challenge by any Person (other than Issuing
Lender or any of its affiliates) to the making of such payment.

                  2.10     Swingline Loans

                  (a) Swingline Availability. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Swingline Lender agrees to make certain
revolving loans to Borrower (each a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the
"Swingline Loans") from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to
the fifth day preceding the Maturity Date; provided, however, that the aggregate
amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of
(i) THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ($30,000,000), and (ii) the excess of Loan
Availability over the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
Loans (excluding Swingline Loans) plus the aggregate face amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit, provided, that if a Base Rate Loan is being made
pursuant to Section 2.09(e) hereof to reimburse Issuing Lender for a drawn
Letter of Credit, to avoid a duplicative reduction in the amount of Loan
availability, the drawn Letter of Credit shall not be considered outstanding.
Subject to the limitations set forth herein, any amounts repaid in respect of
Swingline Loans may be reborrowed.

                  (b)      Swingline Borrowings.

                          (i) Notice of Borrowing. Whenever Borrower desires to

                  has occurred and is continuing both before and after giving

                  thereof. Swingline Loans shall be available no more frequently
                  than six (6) times in any month.

                          (iii) Making of Swingline Loans. Swingline Lender
                  shall make the proceeds of each Swingline Loan available to

                          (iv) Repayment of Swingline Loans. Each Swingline Loan
                  shall be due and payable on the earliest of (A) five (5) days
                  from the date of the applicable


                                       38
<PAGE>

                  Funding Date for such Swingline Loan, (B) the date of the next

                  than a Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing), such Swingline
                  Loans shall first be repaid from the proceeds of such
                  Borrowing prior to the disbursement of the same to Borrower.
                  If, and to the extent, a Borrowing under Section 2.01 hereof
                  (other than a Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing) is not
                  requested prior to the Termination Date or the end of the five
                  (5) day period after a Swingline Loan is made, Borrower shall
                  be deemed to have requested Base Rate Loans in the amount of
                  the applicable Swingline Loan then outstanding, the proceeds
                  of which shall be used to repay such Swingline Loan to the
                  Swingline Lender. In addition, the Swingline Lender may, at
                  any time, in its sole discretion, by written notice to
                  Borrower and Agent, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans by
                  way of Base Rate Loans, in which case Borrower shall be deemed
                  to have requested Base Rate Loans in the amount of such
                  Swingline Loans then outstanding, the proceeds of which shall
                  be used to repay such Swingline Loans to the Swingline Lender.
                  Any Borrowing which is deemed requested by Borrower in
                  accordance with this Section 2.10(b)(iv) is hereinafter
                  referred to as a "Swingline Mandatory Borrowing". Each Lender
                  hereby irrevocably agrees to make Base Rate Loans in
                  accordance with its Pro Rata Share promptly upon receipt of
                  notice from the Swingline Lender of any such deemed request
                  for a Swingline Mandatory Borrowing in the amount and in the
                  manner specified in the preceding sentences and on the date
                  such notice is received by such Lender (or the next Business
                  Day if such notice is received after 10:00 A.M. (California
                  time)) notwithstanding (I) the amount of the Swingline
                  Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for
                  Borrowings otherwise required hereunder, (II) whether any
                  conditions specified in Section 4.02 hereof are then
                  satisfied, (III) whether an Event of Default or Unmatured
                  Event of Default then exists, (IV) failure of any such deemed
                  request for a Borrowing to be made by the time otherwise
                  required in Section 2.01 hereof, (V) the date of such
                  Swingline Mandatory Borrowing (provided that such date must be
                  a Business Day), or (VI) any termination of the Commitments
                  immediately prior to such Swingline Mandatory Borrowing or
                  contemporaneously therewith; provided, however, that no Lender
                  shall be obligated to make any Loans under this Section
                  2.10(b)(iv) if an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
                  Default then exists and the applicable Swingline Loan was made
                  by the Swingline Lender without receipt of a written Notice of
                  Borrowing in the form specified in subclause (i) above or
                  after Agent had delivered a notice of an Event of Default or
                  Unmatured Event of Default which had not been rescinded.

                          (v) Purchase of Participations. In the event that any
                  Swingline Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason occur on
                  the date otherwise required above (including, without
                  limitation, as a result of the commencement of a proceeding
                  under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to Borrower), then each
                  Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith purchase (as of
                  the date the Swingline Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise
                  have occurred, but adjusted for any payment received from
                  Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase)


                                       39
<PAGE>

                  from the Swingline Lender such participations in the
                  outstanding Swingline Loans as shall be necessary to cause
                  each such Lender to share in such Swingline Loans ratably
                  based upon its Pro Rata Share, provided that (A) all interest
                  payable on the Swingline Loans with respect to any
                  participation shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender
                  until but excluding the day upon which the Swingline Mandatory
                  Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and (B) in the event
                  of a delay between the day upon which the Swingline Mandatory
                  Borrowing would otherwise have occurred and the time any
                  purchase of a participation pursuant to this sentence is
                  actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required to pay
                  to the Swingline Lender interest on the principal amount of
                  such participation for each day from and including the day
                  upon which the Swingline Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise
                  have occurred to but excluding the date of payment for such
                  participation, at the rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate,
                  for the two (2) Business Days after the date the Swingline
                  Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and
                  thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate. Notwithstanding
                  the foregoing, no Bank shall be obligated to purchase a
                  participation in any Swingline Loan if an Event of Default or
                  Unmatured Event of Default then exists and such Swingline Loan
                  was made by the Swingline Lender without receipt of a written
                  Notice of Borrowing in the form specified in subclause (i)
                  above or after Agent had delivered a notice of an Event of
                  Default or Unmatured Event of Default which had not been
                  rescinded.


                  (c) Interest Rate. Each Swingline Loan shall bear interest at
a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate minus 1.5% per annum.

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  5.01 Representations and Warranties as to Borrower. Borrower
hereby represents and warrants to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and
Lenders as follows:

                  (a) Organization; Partnership Powers. Borrower (i) is a
limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, (ii) is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign limited partnership and in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business requires it to be so



                                       42
<PAGE>


qualified, except for those jurisdictions where failure to so qualify and be in
good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) has all
requisite partnership power and authority to own, operate and encumber its
property and assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and as
proposed to be conducted in connection with and following the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Authority. Borrower has the requisite partnership power
and authority to execute, deliver and perform each of the Loan Documents to
which it is or will be a party. The execution, delivery and performance thereof,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly
approved by the general partner of Borrower, and no other partnership
proceedings or authorizations on the part of Borrower or its general or limited
partners are necessary to consummate such transactions. Each of the Loan
Documents to which Borrower is a party has been duly executed and delivered by
Borrower and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable
principles.

                  (c) Ownership of Borrower. Schedule 5.01(c) sets forth the
general partners of Borrower and their respective ownership percentages as of
the date hereof. Except as set forth in the partnership agreement of Borrower,

any character convertible into or exercisable for partnership interests) of
Borrower are subject to issuance under any security, instrument, warrant, option
or purchase rights, conversion or exchange rights, call, commitment or claim of
any right, title or interest therein or thereto. To Borrower's knowledge, all of
the partnership interests in Borrower have been issued in compliance with all
applicable Requirements of Law.

                  (d) No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by
Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is or will be a party, and each of
the transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not (i) conflict with or
violate Borrower's limited partnership agreement or Certificate of Limited
Partnership or other organizational documents, as the case may be, or the
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Borrower or (ii) conflict with,
result in a breach of or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) a default under any Requirement of Law, Contractual Obligation or Court
Order of or binding upon Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or require
termination of any such Contractual Obligation, the consequences of which
conflict or breach or default or termination would have a Material Adverse
Effect, or result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
whatsoever upon any Property (except as contemplated herein).

                  (e) Consents and Authorizations. Borrower has obtained all
consents and authorizations required pursuant to its Contractual Obligations
with any other Person, the failure of which to obtain would have a Material
Adverse Effect, and has obtained all consents and authorizations of, and
effected all notices to and filings with, any Governmental Authority necessary
to allow Borrower to lawfully execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
the Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party.

REIT contained in the Form 10-Q Quarterly Report of the REIT as of September 30,

were prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect on the date such Pre-Closing
Financials were prepared and fairly present the assets, liabilities and
financial condition of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, at such date and the
results of its operations and its cash flows, on a consolidated basis, for the
period then ended.

                  (h) Financial Statements; Projections and Forecasts. Each of

                          (i) There is no action, suit, proceeding, governmental
                  investigation or arbitration, at law or in equity, or before
                  or by any Governmental Authority, pending, or to the best of
                  Borrower's knowledge, threatened against Borrower or any of
                  its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Properties, in
                  which there is a reasonable possibility of an adverse decision
                  that could have a Material Adverse Effect; and

                          (ii) Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is

                  has a Material Adverse Effect, or (B) subject to or in default
                  with respect to any Court Order which has a Material Adverse
                  Effect.

assessments, fees and other governmental charges shown on such returns have been
paid when due and payable, except such taxes, if any, as are reserved against in
accordance with GAAP, such taxes as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings or such taxes, the failure to make payment of which when
due and payable will not have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.
Borrower has


                                       44
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries that will have a Material Adverse Effect, which is not being
actively contested in good faith by such Person.

                  (l) Material Adverse Agreements. Neither Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or subject to any Contractual Obligation or other
restriction contained in its partnership agreement, certificate of partnership,
by-laws, or similar governing documents which has a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (m) Performance. Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation
applicable to it, and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice or
the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under such Contractual
Obligation in each case, except where the consequences, direct or indirect, of
such default or defaults, if any, will not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (n) Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds of
the Loan hereunder will be used to purchase or carry any "margin security" as
defined in Regulation U or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any
indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any margin

purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as defined in Regulation U. Borrower

is inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation X or any other regulation of
the Federal Reserve Board.

                  (o) Disclosure. Borrower has not intentionally or knowingly
withheld any material fact from Agent in regard to any matter raised in the Loan
Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any projections of
Borrower's future performance such representations and warranties are made in
good faith and to the best judgment of Borrower at the time such projections
were made.

each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Requirements of Law
(including without limitation the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, state securities law
and "Blue Sky" laws) applicable to them and their respective businesses, in each
case, where the failure to so comply will have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (q) Patents, Trademarks, Permits, Etc. Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries owns, is licensed or otherwise has the lawful right to use, or
has all permits and other governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade
names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes used in or necessary for
the conduct of Borrower's or such Subsidiary's business as currently conducted,
the absence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect. To Borrower's
knowledge, the use of such permits and other governmental approvals, patents,
trademarks, trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes by
Borrower or such


                                       45

Subsidiary does not infringe on the rights of any Person, subject to such claims
and infringements as do not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (r) Environmental Matters. To the knowledge of Borrower,
except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect and except as set forth on
Schedule 5.01(r), (i) the Property and operations of Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
Laws; (ii) none of the Property or operations of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries are subject to any Remedial Action or other Liabilities and Costs
arising from the Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant into the
environment or from the violation of any Environmental Laws, which Remedial
Action or other Liabilities and Costs would have a Material Adverse Effect;
(iii) neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed any notice under
applicable Environmental Laws reporting a Release of a Contaminant into the
environment in violation of any Environmental Laws, except as the same may have
been heretofore remedied; (iv) there is not now, nor to Borrower's knowledge has
there ever been, on or in the Property of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
(except in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
Laws): (A) any underground storage tanks, (B) any asbestos-containing material,
(C) any polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) used in hydraulic oils, electrical
transformers or other equipment, (D) any petroleum hydrocarbons or (E) any
chlorinated or halogenated solvents; and (v) neither Borrower nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim to the effect that it is or may be
liable to any Person as a result of the Release or threatened Release of a
Contaminant into the environment.

                  (s) ERISA. None of the REIT, Borrower or any Agreement Party
is an "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, an
"employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Sections 4001(a)(3) or 3(37) of ERISA or a
"plan" as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. Except for
a prohibited transaction arising solely because of a Lender's breach of the
covenant set forth in Section 11.23, none of the Obligations, any of the Loan
Documents or the exercise of any of the Agent's or Lenders' rights in connection
therewith constitutes a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code (which is not exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA
and the taxes and penalties imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code
and Section 502(i) of ERISA) or otherwise results in a Lender, the Agent or the
Lenders being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or will by itself result in a Lender, Agent or
the Lenders being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a
"disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code. No assets of the REIT, Borrower or any Agreement Party
constitute "assets" (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 or any
successor regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code.

                  Each Borrower Plan is in compliance with ERISA and the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code in all respects except where
the failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no
claims (other than claims for benefits in the normal course), actions or
lawsuits asserted or instituted against, and none of Borrower, the REIT, any of
the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has knowledge of any
threatened litigation or claims against the assets of any Borrower Plan or
against any fiduciary of such Borrower Plan


                                       46
<PAGE>

with respect to the operation of such Borrower Plan which could have a Material
Adverse Effect. No liability to the PBGC has been, or is likely to be, incurred
by Borrower, the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates other
than such liabilities which, in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse
Effect. None of Borrower, the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their
ERISA Affiliates is now contributing to or has ever contributed to or been
obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan, no employees or former
employees of Borrower, the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates have been covered by any Multiemployer Plan in respect of their
employment by Borrower or such Subsidiary or such ERISA Affiliate. None of
Borrower, the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975
of the Internal Revenue Code or in a transaction subject to the prohibitions of
Section 406 of ERISA, in connection with any Benefit Plan or Welfare Plan which
would subject Borrower, the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates (after giving effect to any exemption) to the tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code,
Section 502 of ERISA or any other liability under ERISA which tax, penalty or
other liability would have a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Benefit Plans
subject to Title IV of ERISA has any material Unfunded Pension Liability as to
which Borrower, the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA
Affiliates is or may be liable, which liability would have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (t) Solvency. Borrower is and will be Solvent after giving
effect to the disbursements of the Loans and the payment and accrual of all fees
then payable hereunder.

                  (u) Title to Assets; No Liens. Borrower has good, indefeasible
and merchantable title to the Property owned or leased by it, and all such
Property is free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens and Liens
permitted by Section 8.01(b).

                  (v) Use of Proceeds. Borrower's use of the proceeds of the
Loans are, and will continue to be, legal and proper uses (and to the extent
necessary, duly authorized by Borrower's partners) and such uses are consistent
with all applicable laws and statutes and Section 7.01(i).

                  (w) Subsidiaries and Investment Affiliates. Each Subsidiary
and Investment Affiliate as of the date hereof is set forth on Schedule 5.01(w).
Schedule 5.01(w) sets forth the ownership of each such Subsidiary and Investment
Affiliate and the material Property owned by such Person as of the date hereof.

                  5.02 Representations and Warranties as to the REIT. The REIT
hereby represents and warrants to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and
Lenders as follows:

                  (a) Organization; Corporate Powers. The REIT (i) is a
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Maryland, (ii) is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which
the nature of its business requires it to be so qualified, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to so qualify and be in good standing would not have
a Material Adverse Effect, and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and
authority to own, operate and encumber its property and assets and to conduct
its business as presently conducted and as


                                       47

proposed to be conducted in connection with and following the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Authority. The REIT has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute, deliver and perform each of the Loan Documents to which it
is or will be a party. The execution, delivery and performance thereof, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly approved
by the Board of Directors of the REIT, and no other corporate proceedings on the
part of the REIT are necessary to consummate such transactions. Each of the Loan
Documents to which the REIT is a party has been duly executed and delivered by
the REIT and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and
other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general equitable
principles.

                  (c) No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance by
the REIT of the Loan Documents to which it is a party, and each of the
transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not (i) conflict with or
violate its Articles or Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws, or other
organizational documents, as the case may be, or the organizational documents of
Borrower or any Subsidiary, (ii) conflict with, result in a breach of or
constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default under any
Requirement of Law, Contractual Obligation or Court Order of the REIT, Borrower
or any Subsidiary, or require termination of any such Contractual Obligation,
the consequences of which conflict or breach or default or termination will have
a Material Adverse Effect, or result in or require the creation or imposition of
any Lien whatsoever upon any of its Property, or (iii) require any approval of
the stockholders of the REIT.

                  (d) Consents and Authorizations. The REIT has obtained all
consents and authorizations required pursuant to its Contractual Obligations
with any other Person, the failure of which to obtain would have a Material
Adverse Effect, and has obtained all consents and authorizations of, and
effected all notices to and filings with, any Governmental Authority necessary
to allow the REIT to lawfully execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
the Loan Documents to which the REIT is a party.

                  (e) Governmental Regulation. The REIT is not subject to
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or
any other federal or state statute or regulation such that its ability to incur
indebtedness is limited or its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents is materially impaired.

                  (f) Capitalization. To the REIT's knowledge, all of the
capital stock of the REIT has been issued in compliance with all applicable
Requirements of Law.

                  (g)      Litigation; Adverse Effects.

                           (i) There is no action, suit, proceeding,
                  governmental investigation or arbitration, at law or in
                  equity, or before or by any Governmental Authority, pending,
                  or to best of the REIT's knowledge, threatened against the
                  REIT, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
                  Properties in which there is a reasonable possibility of an
                  adverse decision that could have a Material Adverse Effect;
                  and


                                       48
<PAGE>

                           (ii) Neither the REIT nor any of its Subsidiaries is
                  (A) in violation of any applicable Requirement of Law, which
                  violation has a Material Adverse Effect, or (B) subject to or
                  in default with respect to any Court Order which has a
                  Material Adverse Effect.

                  (h) Payment of Taxes. All tax returns and reports to be filed
by the REIT or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely filed, and all taxes,
assessments, fees and other governmental charges shown on such returns have been
paid when due and payable, except such taxes, if any, as are reserved against in
accordance with GAAP, such taxes as are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings or such taxes, the failure to make payment of which when
due and payable would not have, in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. The
REIT has no knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against the REIT or any of
its Subsidiaries that would have a Material Adverse Effect, which is not being
actively contested in good faith by the REIT or such Subsidiary.

                  (i) Material Adverse Agreements. The REIT is not a party to or

is in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the
obligations, covenants or conditions contained in any Contractual Obligation
applicable to it, and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice or
the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default under such Contractual
Obligation in each case, except where the consequences, direct or indirect, of
such default or defaults, if any, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (k) Securities Activities. The REIT is not engaged principally
in the business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
any "margin stock" (as defined in Regulation U).

                  (l) Disclosure. The REIT has not intentionally or knowingly
withheld any material fact from Agent in regard to any matter raised in the Loan
Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any projections of the
REIT's future performance such representations and warranties are made in good
faith and to the best judgment of the management of the REIT at the time such
projections were made.

                  (m) Requirements of Law. To the REIT's knowledge, the REIT and
each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Requirements of Law
(including without limitation the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, state securities law
and "Blue Sky" laws) applicable to them and their respective businesses, in each
case, where the failure to so comply would have a Material Adverse Effect. After
giving effect to all filings made simultaneously with the Closing Date, the REIT
has made all filings with and obtained all consents of the Commission required
under the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by the REIT of the Loan Documents to which
it is a party.

such permits and other governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade names,
copyrights, technology, know-how and processes by the REIT or such Subsidiary

                  6.04 Qualifying Unencumbered Properties. Borrower may from
time to time but no more frequently than quarterly deliver notice to the Agent
stating that Borrower intends to designate a Property to become a Qualifying
Unencumbered Property. Such notice shall (i) set forth the name of such Property
(or, if such Property has no name, such notice shall otherwise identify such
Property), and (ii) be accompanied by a statement of income, certified by the

recently completed Fiscal Quarter (or, if such statement of income is
unavailable, a pro forma financial statement setting forth the Net Operating
Income with respect to such Property for the then current Fiscal Quarter).

If any such Property meets the requirements set forth in the definition of
"Qualifying Unencumbered Properties" and the Agent fails to deliver written
notice to Borrower stating that the Requisite Lenders have disapproved the
designation of such Property as a Qualifying Unencumbered Property (it being
understood that such notice shall provide Borrower with information regarding
why such designation was disapproved by the Requisite Lenders and that the
Requisite Lenders will not unreasonably disapprove such designation) within
twenty (20) days after receipt of such information by Agent, such Property shall
become a Qualifying Unencumbered Property.

                              AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

hereof, until payment in full of all of the Obligations, the expiration of the
Commitments and termination of this Agreement:

                  7.01     With respect to Borrower:

                  (a) Existence. Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, at all times maintain its and their respective partnership
limited liability company, trust or corporate existence, as applicable, and
preserve and keep in full force and effect its and their respective rights and
franchises unless the failure to maintain such rights and franchises does not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Borrower shall maintain its status as a limited
partnership.

                  (b) Qualification. Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, qualify and remain qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its and their businesses require them to be
so qualified except for those jurisdictions where failure to so qualify does not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c) Compliance with Laws, Etc. Borrower shall, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) comply with all Requirements of Law and
Contractual Obligations, and all restrictive covenants affecting Borrower and
its Subsidiaries or their respective properties, performance, assets or
operations, and (ii) obtain as needed all Permits necessary for its and their
respective operations and maintain such in good standing, except in each of the
foregoing cases where the failure to do so will not have a Material Adverse
Effect or expose Agent or Lenders to any material liability therefor.

                  (d) Payment of Taxes and Claims. (a) Borrower shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay (i) all taxes, assessments and other
governmental charges imposed upon it or them or on any of its or their
respective properties or assets or in respect of any of its or their respective
franchises, business, income or property before any penalty or interest accrues
thereon, the failure to make payment of which in such time periods would have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) all claims (including, without limitation,
claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) which have become due and
payable and which by law have or may become a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien)
upon any of its or their respective properties or assets, prior to the time when
any penalty or fine shall be incurred with respect thereto, the failure to make
payment of which would have a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that
no such taxes, assessments, and governmental charges referred to in clause (i)
above or


                                       54
<PAGE>

claims referred to in clause (ii) above need be paid if being contested in good
faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted
and if adequate reserves shall have been set aside therefor in accordance with
GAAP.

                  (e) Maintenance of Properties; Insurance. Borrower shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in good repair, working order
and condition, excepting ordinary wear and tear, all of its and their respective
Property (personal and real) and will make or cause to be made all appropriate
repairs, renewals and replacements thereof, in each case where the failure to so
maintain, repair, renew or replace would have a Material Adverse Effect.
Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain with
insurance companies that have a Best Rating of "A- VII" or higher or other
insurance companies reasonably acceptable to Agent that have similar financial
resources and stability, which companies shall be qualified to do business in
the states where such Property is located, the insurance policies and programs
reasonably acceptable to Agent insuring all property and assets material to the
operations of Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries against loss or damage by
fire, theft, burglary, pilferage and loss in transit and business interruption,
together with such other hazards as is reasonably consistent with prudent
industry practice, and maintain liability insurance consistent with prudent
industry practice with financially sound insurance companies qualified to do
business in the states where such Property is located. The insurance policies
shall provide that they cannot be terminated or materially modified unless Agent
receives thirty (30) days prior written notice of said termination or
modification. At Agent's reasonable request, Borrower shall furnish evidence of
replacement costs, without cost to Agent, such as are regularly and ordinarily
made by insurance companies to determine the then replacement cost of the
improvements on any Property of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. In the
event Borrower fails to cause insurance to be carried as aforesaid, Agent shall
have the right (but not the obligation), with the consent of Requisite Lenders,
to place and maintain insurance required to be maintained hereunder and treat
the amounts expended therefor as additional Obligations, payable on demand;
provided however, that Agent shall give Borrower five (5) days' prior notice of
Agent's intent to place or maintain such insurance during which time Borrower
shall have the opportunity to obtain such insurance. All of the insurance
policies required hereunder shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Agent. Agent hereby agrees that Borrower may use blanket
policies to satisfy the requirements of this Section 7.01(e), approves the
issuer, form and content of all insurance policies currently carried by Borrower
and agrees that such insurance satisfies the requirements of this Section
7.01(e). Furthermore, Agent agrees that it will not be unreasonable in
exercising any right hereunder to require Borrower to modify, alter or
supplement its insurance policies or coverage or in exercising any right it may
have hereunder to approve any changes Borrower may hereafter make with respect
to its insurance.

                  (f) Inspection of Property; Books and Records. Borrower shall
permit and shall cause each of the REIT, each Subsidiary, and each Agreement
Party to, upon reasonable prior notice by Agent to Borrower, permit any
authorized representative(s) designated by Agent to visit and inspect any of its
properties including inspection of financial and accounting records and leases,
and to make copies and take extracts therefrom, all at such times during normal
business hours and as often as Agent may reasonably request. In connection
therewith, Borrower shall pay all reasonable expenses of the types described in
Section 12.01. Borrower shall keep, and shall cause each of, the REIT, each
Subsidiary and each Agreement Party to keep proper books of record and account
in conformity with GAAP, as modified and as otherwise required by this Agreement
and applicable Requirements of Law.

shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and effect all
licenses, permits, governmental approvals, franchises, patents, trademarks,
trade names, copyrights, authorizations or other rights necessary for the
operation of their respective businesses, except where the failure to obtain any
of the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and notify Agent in
writing, promptly after learning thereof, of the suspension, cancellation,
revocation or discontinuance of or of any pending or threatened action or
proceeding seeking to suspend, cancel, revoke or discontinue any such material
license, permit, patent, trademark, trade name, copyright, governmental
approval, franchise authorization or right, except where the suspension,
cancellation, revocation or discontinuance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (h) Conduct of Business. Except for Permitted Holdings and
other investments permitted under Section 8.01(c), Borrower shall engage only in
the business of owning, operating, managing and developing manufactured home
communities, whether directly or through its Subsidiaries.

                  (i) Use of Proceeds. Borrower shall use the proceeds of each
Loan only for general partnership purposes in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, no Swingline Loan shall be used more than once for the purpose of
refinancing another Swingline Loan, in whole or part.

                  (j) Further Assurance. Borrower shall take and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and each Agreement Party to take all such further actions and
execute all such further documents and instruments as Agent may at any time
reasonably determine to be necessary or advisable to (i) correct any technical
defect or technical error that may be discovered in any Loan Document or in the
execution, acknowledgment or recordation thereof, and (ii) cause the execution,
delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to be duly authorized.

the REIT shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay (i) all taxes,
assessments and other governmental charges imposed upon it or them or on any of

upon any of its or their respective properties or assets, prior to the time when

otherwise dispose of any of their respective rights or interests (direct or
indirect) in any Agreement Party, Borrower or the REIT, as applicable, or

Lenders' rights in connection therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction
under ERISA or the Internal Revenue


                                       60

Code (unless Borrower furnishes to Agent a legal opinion reasonably satisfactory
to Agent that the transaction is exempt from the prohibited transaction
provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code (for this purpose, Agent and
the Lenders agree to supply Borrower all relevant non-confidential factual
information reasonably necessary to such legal opinion and reasonably requested
by Borrower)) or otherwise results in a Lender, Agent or the Lenders being
deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Internal Revenue Code or otherwise by itself would result in a Lender, Agent or
the Lenders being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a
"disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the

Costs which would have a Material Adverse Effect arising out of or related to
(i) the Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant into the environment,
or any Remedial Action in response thereto, or (ii) any violation of any
Environmental Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, Borrower and its
Subsidiaries shall have the right to contest in good faith any claim of
violation of an Environmental Law by appropriate legal proceedings and shall be
entitled to postpone compliance with the obligation being contested as long as
(i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) Borrower

indirectly convey, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber or
dispose of any material portion of its partnership interests, stock or other
ownership interests in any Subsidiary or other Person in which it has an
interest unless Borrower has delivered to Agent a Compliance Certificate showing
on a pro forma basis (calculated in a manner reasonably acceptable to Agent)
that there would be no breach of any of the financial covenants contained in
Articles VIII and XI after giving effect to such conveyance, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, or other encumbrance or disposition.

                  (j) Margin Regulations. No portion of the proceeds of any

case as in effect on the date or dates of Borrowings and such use of proceeds.

property; the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, or any Agreement Party shall make
any assignment for the benefit of creditors or shall be unable or fail, or admit
in writing its inability, to pay its debts as such debts become due; or the
general partner(s) or Board of Directors (or any committee thereof), as
applicable, of the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, or any Agreement Party adopts
any resolution or otherwise authorizes any action to approve any of the
foregoing.

entered against the REIT, Borrower, or any Agreement Party decreeing its
involuntary dissolution or split up and such order shall remain undischarged and
unstayed for a period in excess of thirty (30) days; or the REIT, Borrower, or
any Agreement Party shall otherwise dissolve or cease to exist.

                  (k) Loan Documents; Failure of Security or Subordination. Any
Loan Document shall cease to be in full force and effect or any Obligation shall
be subordinated or shall not have the priority contemplated by this Agreement or

any portion of the Obligations shall at any time disavow or deny liability under
such guaranty in writing.

                  (l) ERISA Plan Assets. Any assets of Borrower, the REIT or any

administrator of any Benefit Plan applies for approval under Section 412(d) of

to a liability which Agent reasonably determines will have a Material Adverse
Effect; (iii) any Benefit Plan shall incur an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(as defined in Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA)
for which a waiver shall not have been obtained in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or ERISA which "accumulated

Agent reasonably determines will have a Material Adverse Effect; (vi) a
condition shall exist by reason of which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a

                                       69
<PAGE>

                  (a) Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default
with respect to Borrower described in the foregoing Section 10.01(g) or
10.01(h), the Commitments (including the obligations of Swingline Lender and
Issuing Lender) shall automatically and immediately terminate and the unpaid
principal amount of and any and all accrued interest on the Loans and all of the
other Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and payable, with
all additional interest from time to time accrued thereon and without
presentment, demand or protest or other requirements of any kind (including
without limitation valuation and appraisement, diligence, presentment, notice of
intent to demand or accelerate or notice of acceleration), all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Borrower, and the obligations of Lenders to make any
Loans hereunder shall thereupon terminate; and upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of any other Event of Default, Agent shall, at the request of,
or may, with the consent of, Requisite Lenders, by written notice to Borrower,
(i) declare that the Commitments (including the obligations of Swingline Lender
and Issuing Lender) are terminated, whereupon the Commitments and the obligation
of Lenders to make any Loans hereunder shall immediately terminate, and/or (ii)
declare the unpaid principal amount of and any and all accrued and unpaid
interest on the Loans and all of the other Obligations to be, and the same shall
thereupon be, immediately due and payable with all additional interest from time
to time accrued thereon and without presentment, demand, or protest or other
requirements of any kind (including without limitation, valuation and
appraisement, diligence, presentment, notice of intent to demand or accelerate
and of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower. Upon
the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no
Agreement Party shall be permitted to make any distributions or dividends
without the prior written consent of Agent. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, Agent and Lenders may exercise
all or any portion of the rights and remedies set forth in the Loan Documents.

                  (b) Access to Information. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in the Loan Documents, upon the occurrence of and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Agent shall be entitled to request and
receive, by or through Borrower or appropriate legal process, any and all
information concerning the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower, any
Investment Affiliate, any Agreement Party, or any property of any of them, which
is reasonably available to or obtainable by Borrower.

                  (c) Waiver of Demand. Demand, presentment, protest and notice
of nonpayment are hereby waived by Borrower.

                  (d) Waivers, Amendments and Remedies. No delay or omission of
Agent or Lenders to exercise any right under any Loan Document shall impair such
right or be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein, and any single or partial exercise of any such right shall not preclude
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, and no
waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or provisions of
the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in a writing signed by Agent
after obtaining written approval thereof or the signature thereon of those
Lenders required to approve such waiver, amendment or other variation, and then
only to the extent in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies
contained in the Loan Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all
shall be available to Agent and Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in
full, the Commitments have expired or terminated and this Agreement has been
terminated.


                                       70
<PAGE>



                  10.03 Rescission. If at any time after acceleration of the
maturity of the Loans, Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all
payments on account of principal of the Loans which shall have become due
otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent
permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified in this Agreement)
and all Events of Default and Unmatured Events of Default (other than nonpayment
of principal of and accrued interest on the Loans due and payable solely by
virtue of acceleration) shall be remedied or waived pursuant to Section 12.05,
then by written notice to Borrower, Requisite Lenders may elect, in the sole
discretion of Requisite Lenders to rescind and annul the acceleration and its
consequences; but such action shall not affect any subsequent Event of Default
or Unmatured Event of Default or impair any right or remedy in connection
therewith. The provisions of the preceding sentence are intended merely to bind
Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election of Requisite Lenders;
they are not intended to benefit Borrower and do not give Borrower the right to
require Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder, even if the
conditions set forth herein are met.

                  10.04 Suspension of Lending. At any time during which an
Unmatured Event of Default exists pursuant to Section 10.01(c) or Section
10.01(d) and is not cured (by improvement in the applicable financial measure by
compliance with the applicable financial covenant in such 40-day period or as
provided in Section 10.01(d)), Borrower shall have no right to receive any
additional Loans.

                                   ARTICLE XI.
                                AGENCY PROVISIONS

                  11.01    Appointment

                  (a) Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Wells Fargo as
Agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the Loan Documents, and each
Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action on its behalf
under the provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents and to exercise
such powers as are set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent agrees to act as such on the express
conditions contained in this Article XI.

                  (b) The provisions of this Article XI are solely for the
benefit of Agent and Lenders, and Borrower shall not have any rights to rely on
or enforce any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties
under this Agreement, Agent shall act solely as Agent of Lenders and does not
assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or
relationship of agency or trust with or for Borrower.

                  11.02 Nature of Duties. Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the
Loan Documents. The duties of Agent shall be administrative in nature. Subject
to the provisions of Sections 11.05 and 11.07, Agent shall administer the Loans
in the same manner as it administers its own loans. Agent shall not have by
reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender.
Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, expressed or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to impose upon Agent any obligation in respect of
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents except as expressly set forth herein
or therein. Each Lender shall make its own independent investigation of the
financial condition and affairs of the REIT, Borrower, the


                                       71
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries, the Investment Affiliates, and each Agreement Party in connection
with the making and the continuance of the Loans hereunder and shall make its
own assessment of the creditworthiness of the REIT, Borrower, the Subsidiaries,
the Investment Affiliates, and each Agreement Party, and, except as specifically
provided herein, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession
before the Closing Date or at any time or times thereafter.

                  11.03    Loan Disbursements

                  (a) Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing for a Loan
to be made pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, but in no event later than one (1)
Business Day prior to the proposed Funding Date for a Base Rate Loan or two (2)
Business Days prior to the proposed Funding Date for a LIBOR Loan, Agent shall
notify each Lender of the proposed Borrowing and the Funding Date set forth
therein. Each Lender shall make available to Agent (or the funding bank or
entity designated by Agent), the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
Borrowing in immediately available funds not later than the times designated in
Section 11.03(b). Unless Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to
such time for funding in respect of any Borrowing that such Lender does not
intend to make available to Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
Borrowing, Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to
Agent and Agent, in its sole discretion, may, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount
is not in fact made available to Agent by such Lender on or prior to a Funding
Date, such Lender agrees to pay to Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to Borrower until the date such amount is paid or repaid to
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Pro
Rata Share of such Borrowing. If such Lender shall not pay to Agent such
corresponding amount after reasonable attempts are made by Agent to collect such
amounts from such Lender, Borrower agrees to repay to Agent forthwith on demand
such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is made available to Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to Agent, at the interest rate applicable thereto.

                  (b) Requests by Agent for funding by Lenders of Loans will be
made by telecopy. Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to
Agent in Dollars and in immediately available funds, to such bank and account,
in El Segundo, California as Agent may designate, not later than 10:00 A.M.
(California time) on the Funding Date designated in the Notice of Borrowing with
respect to such Loan. Nothing in this Section 11.03(b) shall be deemed to
relieve any Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Pro Rata Share of
Loans on any Funding Date, nor shall any Lender be responsible for the failure
of any other Lender to perform its obligations to make any Loan hereunder, and
the Commitment of any Lender shall not be increased or decreased as a result of
the failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make a Loan.

                  11.04    Distribution and Apportionment of Payments

                  (a) Subject to Section 11.04(b), payments actually received by
Agent for the account of Lenders shall be paid to them promptly after receipt
thereof by Agent, but in any


                                       72
<PAGE>

event prior to 3:00 P.M. (California time) on the day of receipt (if received by
11:00 A.M. (California time) on such day), or within one (1) Business Day
thereafter (if received after 11:00 A.M. (California time) on the day of
receipt), provided that Agent shall pay to such Lenders interest thereon at the
Federal Funds Rate from the Business Day on which such funds are required to be
paid to Lenders by Agent until such funds are actually paid in immediately
available funds to such Lenders. All payments of principal and interest in
respect of outstanding Loans (other than Swingline Loans), all payments of the
fees described in this Agreement (other than agency and arrangement fees
described in Section 2.04(c)), and all payments in respect of any other
Obligations shall be allocated among such of Lenders as are entitled thereto, in
proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares or otherwise as provided herein.
Agent shall promptly, but in any event within two (2) Business Days (with
interest thereon, if required pursuant to this Section 11.04(a)), distribute to
each Lender at its primary address set forth on the appropriate counterpart
signature page hereof or on the Assignment and Assumption, or at such other
address as a Lender may request in writing, such funds as it may be entitled to
receive, provided that Agent shall in any event not be bound to inquire into or
determine the validity, scope or priority of any interest or entitlement of any
Lender and may suspend all payments and seek appropriate relief (including
without limitation instructions from Requisite Lenders, or all Lenders, as
applicable, or an action in the nature of interpleader) in the event of any
doubt or dispute as to any apportionment or distribution contemplated hereby.
The order of priority herein is set forth solely to determine the rights and
priorities of Lenders as among themselves and may at any time or from time to
time be changed by Lenders as they may elect, in writing in accordance with
Section 12.05, without necessity of notice to or consent of or approval by
Borrower or any other Person.

                  (b) Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary,
until such time as a Defaulting Lender has funded its Pro Rata Share of a Loan
(other than a Swingline Loan but including a Mandatory Borrowing) or draw on a
Letter of Credit which was previously a Non Pro Rata Loan, or all other Lenders
have received payment in full (whether by repayment or prepayment) of the
principal and interest due in respect of such Non Pro Rata Loan, all of the
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall be subordinated in
right of payment, as provided in the following sentence, to the prior payment in
full of all principal, interest and fees in respect of all Non Pro Rata Loans in
which the Defaulting Lender has not funded its Pro Rata Share (such principal,
interest and fees being referred to as "Senior Loans"). All amounts paid by
Borrower and otherwise due to be applied to the Obligations owing to the
Defaulting Lender pursuant to the terms hereof shall be distributed by Agent to
the other Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares
(recalculated for purposes hereof to exclude the Defaulting Lender's
Commitment), until all Senior Loans have been paid in full. This provision
governs only the relationship among Agent, each Defaulting Lender, and the other
Lenders; nothing hereunder shall limit the obligation of Borrower to repay all
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The provisions of this
section shall apply and be effective regardless of whether an Event of Default
occurs and is then continuing, and notwithstanding (i) any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, (ii) any instruction of Borrower as to its
desired application of payments or (iii) the suspension of such Defaulting
Lender's right to vote on matters which are subject to the consent or approval
of Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders, or all Lenders. No Unused Facility
Fee shall accrue in favor of, or be payable to, such Defaulting Lender from the
date of any failure to fund Loans (other than Swingline Loans but including
Loans made pursuant to Mandatory Borrowings) or draws on Letters of Credit or
reimburse Agent for any Liabilities and Costs as herein provided until such


                                       73
<PAGE>

failure has been cured and, without limitation of other provisions set forth in
this Agreement, Agent shall be entitled to (i) collect interest from such Lender
for the period from the date on which the payment was due until the date on
which the payment is made at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such
period, (ii) withhold or set off, and to apply to the payment of the defaulted
amount and any related interest, any amounts to be paid to such Defaulting
Lender under this Agreement, and (iii) bring an action or suit against such
Defaulting Lender in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted
amount and any related interest. In addition, the Defaulting Lender shall
indemnify, defend and hold Agent and each of the other Lenders harmless from and
against any and all Liabilities and Costs plus interest thereon at the default
rate set forth in the Loan Documents for funds advanced by Agent or any other
Lender on account of the Defaulting Lender which they may sustain or incur by
reason of or as a direct consequence of the Defaulting Lender's failure or
refusal to abide by its obligations under this Agreement.

                  11.05 Rights, Exculpation, Etc. Neither Agent, any Affiliate
of Agent, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
attorneys or consultants, shall be liable to any Lender for any action taken or
omitted by them hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents, or in connection
herewith or therewith, except that Agent shall be liable for its gross
negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its express obligations
hereunder. In the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, Agent shall
not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in
good faith pursuant to Section 11.04. Agent shall not be responsible to any
Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or for
the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the other Loan
Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; or for
the financial condition of the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment
Affiliate, or any Agreement Party. Agent shall not be required to make any
inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or the
financial condition of the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment
Affiliate, or any Agreement Party, or the existence or possible existence of any
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default. Agent may at any time request
instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which, by the
terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents, Agent is permitted or
required to take or to grant without instructions from any Lenders, and if such
instructions are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to
refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be
under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from taking any
action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it
shall have received such instructions from Requisite Lenders or Supermajority
Lenders, as the case may be. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall
have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or
refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders
or, where applicable, all Lenders. Agent shall promptly notify each Lender at
any time that the Requisite Lenders or Supermajority Lenders, as the case may
be, have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

                  11.06 Reliance. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents, telecopies
or any telephone message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to
all matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Loan


                                       74
<PAGE>

Documents and its duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of legal counsel
(including counsel for Borrower), independent public accountant and other
experts selected by it.

                  11.07 Indemnification. To the extent that Agent or Issuing
Lender is not reimbursed and indemnified by Borrower, Lenders will reimburse,
within ten (10) days after notice from Agent, and indemnify Agent and Issuing
Lender for and against any and all Liabilities and Costs which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against it (in its capacity as Agent or Issuing
Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by Agent or Issuing Lender
(in its capacity as Agent or Issuing Lender) under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, in proportion to each Lender's Pro Rata Share, provided
that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Liabilities and Costs
resulting from Agent's or Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct, bad faith or fraud. The obligations of Lenders under this Section
11.07 shall survive the payment in full of all Obligations and the termination
of this Agreement. In the event that after payment and distribution of any
amount by Agent to Lenders, any Lender or third party, including Borrower, any
creditor of Borrower or a trustee in bankruptcy, recovers from Agent any amount
found to have been wrongfully paid to Agent or disbursed by Agent to Lenders,
then Lenders, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares, shall reimburse
Agent for all such amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent shall not be
obligated to advance Liabilities and Costs and may require the deposit by each
Lender of its Pro Rata Share of any material Liabilities and Costs anticipated
by Agent before they are incurred or made payable.

                  11.08 Agent Individually. With respect to its Pro Rata Share
of the Commitments hereunder and the Loans made by it, Agent shall have and may
exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same
obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other
Lender. The terms "Lenders", "Requisite Lenders", "Supermajority Lenders", or
any similar terms may include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender, one
of the Requisite Lenders or one of the Supermajority Lenders, but Requisite
Lenders and Supermajority Lenders shall not include Agent solely in its capacity
as Agent. Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as if it were not acting as Agent
pursuant hereto.

                  11.09 Successor Agent; Resignation of Agent; Removal of Agent

                  (a) Agent may resign from the performance of all its functions
and duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30) Business Days
prior written notice to Lenders and Borrower. For good cause, by a determination
of all the Lenders (excluding for such determination the Agent in its capacity
as a Lender), the Agent may be removed at any time by giving at least thirty
(30) Business Days prior written notice to Agent and Borrower. Such resignation
or removal shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor Agent of
appointment pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided
below.

                  (b) Upon any such notice of resignation by or removal of
Agent, Requisite Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent with the consent of
Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and approval from
Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default). Any successor Agent must be a bank (i) the senior debt
obligations of which (or such Bank's parent's senior debt obligations) are


                                       75
<PAGE>

rated not less than Baa-1 by Moody's Inc. or a comparable rating by a rating
agency acceptable to Requisite Lenders, (ii) which has total assets in excess of
Ten Billion Dollars ($10,000,000,000) and (iii) which is a Lender as of the date
of such succession holding a Commitment without participants equal to at least
ten percent (10%) of the Facility. Agent hereby agrees to remit to any successor
Agent, a pro rata portion of any annual agent's fee received by Agent, in
advance, for the one-year period covered by such agent's fee based upon the
portion of such year then remaining.

                  (c) If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed
within said thirty (30) Business Day period, the retiring or removed Agent, with
the consent of Borrower, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and
which approval from Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default), shall then appoint a successor
Agent who shall meet the requirements described in subsection (b) above and who
shall serve as Agent until such time, if any, as Requisite Lenders, with the
consent of Borrower, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and
which approval from Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default), appoint a successor Agent as
provided above.

                  (d) Any Person succeeding Wells Fargo (or any successor to
Wells Fargo) as Agent hereunder shall also serve as Issuing Lender and Swingline
Lender; provided, however, that the issuer of any Letter of Credit outstanding
at the time of such succession shall retain all of the rights and protections of
Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to such Letter of Credit.

                  11.10    Consents and Approvals

                  (a) Each Lender authorizes and directs Agent to enter into the
Loan Documents other than this Agreement for the benefit of Lenders. Each Lender
agrees that any action taken by Agent at the direction or with the consent of
Requisite Lenders or the Supermajority Lenders and any action taken by Agent not
requiring consent by Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders, or all Lenders in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Document, and the
exercise by Agent at the direction or with the consent of Requisite Lenders or
the Supermajority Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together
with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized
and binding upon all Lenders, except for actions specifically requiring the
approval of all Lenders. All communications from Agent to Lenders requesting
Lenders' determination, consent, approval or disapproval (i) shall be given in
the form of a written notice to each Lender, (ii) shall be accompanied by a
description of the matter or item as to which such determination, approval,
consent or disapproval is requested, or shall advise each Lender where such
matter or item may be inspected, or shall otherwise describe the matter or issue
to be resolved, (iii) shall include, if reasonably requested by a Lender and to
the extent not previously provided to such Lender, written materials and a
summary of all oral information provided to Agent by Borrower in respect of the
matter or issue to be resolved, and (iv) shall include Agent's recommended
course of action or determination in respect thereof. Each Lender shall reply
promptly, but in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of
the request therefor from Agent (the "Lender Reply Period"). Unless a Lender
shall give written notice to Agent that it objects to the recommendation or
determination of Agent (together with a written explanation of the reasons
behind such objection) within the Lender Reply Period, such Lender shall be
deemed to have approved of or consented to such recommendation or determination.
With respect to decisions


                                       76
<PAGE>

requiring the approval of Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders or all
Lenders, Agent shall submit its recommendation or determination for approval of
or consent to such recommendation or determination to all Lenders and upon
receiving the required approval or consent shall follow the course of action or
determination recommended to Lenders by Agent or such other course of action
recommended by Requisite Lenders or Supermajority Lenders, as the case may be,
and each non-responding Lender shall be deemed to have concurred with such
recommended course of action. The following amendments, modifications or waivers
shall require the consent of the Requisite Lenders:

                          (i) Waiver of Sections 8.01(h) or 8.02(f);

                          (ii) Acceleration following an Event of Default
                  pursuant to Section 10.02(a) (except for any Event of Default
                  pursuant to Sections 10.01(g) or 10.01(h)) or rescission of
                  such acceleration pursuant to Section 10.03;

                          (iii) Approval of the exercise of remedies requiring
                  the consent of the Requisite Lenders under Section 10.02(a);

                          (iv) Appointment of a successor Agent in accordance
                  with Sections 11.09(b) and (c);

                          (v) Disapproval of any Property as a Qualifying
                  Unencumbered Property.

                  (b) Except for amendments, modifications and waivers requiring
the consent of all Lenders pursuant to Section 12.05(b) hereof, the consent of
the Supermajority Lenders shall be required to amend or modify Sections 9.01,
9.02, 9.03, 9.04, 9.05, 9.06, 9.07 or 10.01(a) or to waive any requirement
thereof or to amend or modify this Section 11.10(b).

                  (c) In addition to the required consents or approvals referred
to in Section 12.05, Agent may at any time request instructions from Requisite
Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which, by the terms of this
Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents, Agent is permitted or required to
take or to grant without instructions from any Lenders, and if such instructions
are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to refrain from
taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be under any
liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from taking any action or
withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it shall have
received such instructions from Requisite Lenders. Without limiting the
foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as
a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement, any of
the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite
Lenders or, where applicable, Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders. Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender at any time that the Requisite Lenders or
Supermajority Lenders have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting
pursuant hereto.

                  11.11    [Intentionally Omitted]

                  11.12    [Intentionally Omitted]

                  11.13    Assignments and Participations


                                       77
<PAGE>

                  (a) Subject to the provisions of Section 11.13(j), after first
obtaining the approval of Agent and Borrower, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld (and which approval from Borrower shall not be required
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), each
Lender may assign to one or more banks, finance companies, insurance or other
financial institutions all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this Section (including without
limitation all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not
a varying, percentage of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement and the assignment shall cover the same percentage of such
Lender's Commitment and Loans, (ii) unless Agent and Borrower otherwise consent
(which consent of Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of an Event of Default), the aggregate amount of the Commitment
of the assigning Lender being assigned to a Person that is not already a Lender
hereunder (provided such Lender was also a Lender on the Closing Date) pursuant
to each such assignment shall in no event be less than Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) and shall be an integral multiple of One Million Dollars
($1,000,000), (iii) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and
deliver to Agent, for its approval and acceptance, an Assignment and Assumption
and (iv) Agent shall receive from the assignor or assignors for its sole account
a processing fee of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000). Upon such execution,
delivery, approval and acceptance, and upon the effective date specified in the
applicable Assignment and Assumption, (A) the assignee thereunder shall be a
party hereto and, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been
validly and effectively assigned to it pursuant to such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender hereunder and (B) the
Lender-assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that rights and obligations
hereunder have been validly and effectively assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Assumption, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement.

                  (b) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Assumption,
the Lender-assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Assumption, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto;
(ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the REIT, Borrower,
any Subsidiary, any Investment Affiliate, or any Agreement Party or the
performance or observance by the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment
Affiliate, or any Agreement Party of any of their respective obligations under
any Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto;
(iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,
together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Article VI or
delivered pursuant to Article VI to the date of such assignment and such other
Loan Documents and other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate
to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Assumption; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon
Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own
credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such
assignee appoints and authorizes Agent to take such action


                                       78
<PAGE>

as Agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents as are delegated to Agent by the terms hereof and thereof,
together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such
assignee agrees that it will perform in accordance with their terms all of the
obligations which by the terms of this Agreement are required to be performed by
it as a Lender.

                  (c) Agent shall maintain at its address referred to on the
counterpart signature pages hereof a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
delivered to and accepted by it and shall record the names and addresses of each
Lender and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, such
Lender from time to time. Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person
whose name is so recorded as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement.

                  (d) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee, Agent shall, if such Assignment and
Assumption has been properly completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit A, (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption, (ii) record the
information contained therein and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to Borrower.
Upon request, Borrower will execute and deliver to Agent an appropriate
replacement promissory note or replacement promissory notes in favor of each
assignee (and assignor, if such assignor is retaining a portion of its
Commitment and Loans) reflecting such assignee's (and assignor's) Pro Rata
Share(s) of the Facility. Upon execution and delivery of such replacement
promissory notes, the original promissory note or notes evidencing all or a
portion of the Commitments and Loans being assigned shall be canceled and
returned to Borrower.

                  (e) Each Lender may sell participations to one or more banks,
finance companies, insurance or other entities in or to all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation all or
a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided, however, that
(i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation
its Commitment to Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance
of such obligations, (iii) Borrower, Agent and the other Lenders shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement and with regard to any and all
payments to be made under this Agreement and (iv) the holder of any such
participation shall not be entitled to voting rights under this Agreement except
that such Participant may have the contractual right in the applicable
participation agreement to prevent (A) increases in the Facility, (B) extensions
of the Maturity Date (except pursuant to Article III hereof), (C) decreases in
the interest rates described in this Agreement, and (D) a release of the REIT
Guaranty.

                  (f) Borrower will use reasonable efforts to cooperate with
Agent and Lenders in connection with the assignment of interests under this
Agreement or the sale of participations herein.

                  (g) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, and without the need to comply with any of the formal or
procedural requirements of this Agreement, including Section 11.13, any Lender
may at any time and from time to time pledge and assign all or any portion of
its rights under all or any of the Loan Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank;
provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Lender from its
obligations


                                       79
<PAGE>

thereunder. To facilitate any such pledge or assignment, Agent shall, at the
request of such Lender, enter into a letter agreement with the Federal Reserve
Bank in, or substantially in, the form of the exhibit to Appendix C to the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York Operating Circular No 12.

                  (h) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Lender may assign all or any portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to a Lender Affiliate of such Lender without
first obtaining the approval of Agent and Borrower, provided that (i) at the
time of such assignment such Lender is not a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Lender
gives Agent and Borrower at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice of any
such assignment; (iii) the parties to each such assignment execute and deliver
to Agent an Assignment and Assumption, and (iv) Agent receives from assignor for
its sole account a processing fee of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000).

                  (i) No Lender shall be permitted to assign, or sell a
participation interest in, all or any portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement to Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower.

                  (j) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, no Lender shall be permitted to enter into an assignment of its
rights and obligations hereunder which would result in such Lender holding a
Commitment of less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). In the event Agent
ceases to hold a Commitment of less than ten percent (10%) of the Facility,
Agent shall resign from the performance of all of its functions and duties
hereunder; provided, however, that no such resignation shall be required during
the continuance of an Event of Default.

                  11.14 Ratable Sharing. Subject to Sections 11.03 and 11.04,
Lenders agree among themselves that (i) with respect to all amounts received by
them which are applicable to the payment of the Obligations, equitable
adjustment will be made so that, in effect, all such amounts will be shared
among them ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, whether received by
voluntary payment, by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any or all of the
Obligations, (ii) if any of them shall by voluntary payment or by the exercise
of any right of counterclaim, set-off, banker's lien or otherwise, receive
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of the Obligations held by it
which is greater than its Pro Rata Share of the payments on account of the
Obligations, the one receiving such excess payment shall purchase, without
recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (which it shall be
deemed to have done simultaneously upon the receipt of such payment) in such
Obligations owed to the others so that all such recoveries with respect to such
Obligations shall be applied ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares;
provided, that if all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing
party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases shall be rescinded and
the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to that party
to the extent necessary to adjust for such recovery, but without interest except
to the extent the purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection
with such recovery. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 11.14 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including,
subject to Section 12.04, the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Lender were the direct creditor of Borrower in
the amount of such participation.

<PAGE>

                  11.15 Delivery of Documents. Agent shall as soon as reasonably
practicable distribute to each Lender at its primary address set forth on the
appropriate counterpart signature page hereof or at such other address as a
Lender may request in writing, (i) all documents to which such Lender is a party
or of which such Lender is a beneficiary and (ii) all documents of which Agent
receives copies from Borrower for distribution to Lenders pursuant to Sections
6.01 and 12.07. In addition, within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of a
request in writing from a Lender for written information or documents provided
by or prepared by Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party, Agent shall deliver
such written information or documents to such requesting Lender if Agent has
possession of such written information or documents in its capacity as Agent or
as a Lender.

                  11.16 Notice of Events of Default. Except as expressly
provided in this Section 11.16, Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default
(other than nonpayment of principal of or interest on the Loans) unless Agent
has received notice in writing from a Lender or Borrower referring to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, describing such event or condition and
expressly stating that such notice is a notice of an Unmatured Event of Default
or Event of Default. Should Agent receive such notice of the occurrence of an
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default, or should Agent send Borrower a
notice of Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default, Agent shall promptly
give notice thereof to each Lender.

                                  ARTICLE XII.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  12.01    Expenses

                  (a) Generally. Borrower agrees, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of a written notice from the Agent, to pay or reimburse Agent for all of
Agent's reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Agent at any time (whether
prior to, on or after the date of this Agreement) in connection with: (A) the
negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and any amendments or waivers with respect hereto requested by
Borrower, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of Agent's outside counsel incurred in connection therewith; (B)
the making of the Loans and (C) the collection or enforcement by Agent of any of
the Obligations, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs incurred in connection therewith.

                  (b) After Event of Default. Borrower further agrees to pay, or
reimburse Agent and Lenders, for all reasonable costs and expenses, including
without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements incurred by
Agent or Lenders after the occurrence of an Event of Default (i) in enforcing
any Obligation or exercising or enforcing any other right or remedy available by
reason of such Event of Default; (ii) in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or in any insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding; (iii) in
commencing, defending or intervening in any litigation or in filing a petition,
complaint, answer, motion or other pleadings in any legal proceeding relating to
Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party and related to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) in taking any other action in or with
respect to any suit or proceeding (whether in bankruptcy or otherwise); (v) in
protecting, preserving, collecting, leasing, selling, taking possession of, or
liquidating any such collateral; or


                                       81
<PAGE>

(vi) attempting to enforce or enforcing any rights under the Loan Documents;
provided, however, that the attorneys' fees and disbursements for which Borrower
is obligated under this subsection (b) shall be limited to the reasonable
non-duplicative fees and disbursements of counsel for Agent and counsel for all
Lenders as a group. For purposes of this Section 12.01(b), (i) counsel for Agent
shall mean a single outside law firm representing Agent plus any additional law
firms providing special local law representation in connection with the
enforcement of the Loan Documents, and (ii) counsel for all Lenders as a group
shall mean a single outside law firm representing such Lenders as a group.

                  12.02    Indemnity

                  (a) Generally. Borrower shall indemnify and defend Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and each Lender and their respective
affiliates, participants, officers, directors, employees and agents (each an
"Indemnitee") against, and shall hold each such Indemnitee harmless from, any
and all losses, damages (whether general, punitive or otherwise), liabilities,
claims, causes of action (whether legal, equitable or administrative),
judgments, court costs and legal or other expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) which such Indemnitee may suffer or incur: (i) in connection
with claims made by third parties against such Indemnitee for losses or damages
suffered by such third party as a result of (A) such Indemnitee's performance of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, including without limitation
such Indemnitee's exercise or failure to exercise any rights, remedies or powers
in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or (B) the
failure by Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party to perform any of their
respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
as and when required hereby or thereby, including without limitation any failure
of any representation or warranty of Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party
to be true and correct; (ii) in connection with any claim or cause of action of
any kind by any Person to the effect that such Indemnitee is in any way
responsible or liable for any act or omission by Borrower, the REIT or any
Agreement Party, whether on account of any theory of derivative liability or
otherwise, (iii) in connection with the past, present or future environmental
condition of any Property owned by Borrower, the REIT, Subsidiary or any
Agreement Party, the presence of asbestos-containing materials at any such
Property, the presence of Contaminants in groundwater at any such Property, or
the Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant into the environment from
any such Property; or (iv) in connection with any claim or cause of action of
any kind by any Person which would have the effect of denying such Indemnitee
the full benefit or protection of any provision of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents.

                  (b) ERISA. Without limitation of the provisions of subsection
(a) above, Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Indemnitee free and harmless
from and against all loss, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), expenses, taxes, and damages (including consequential damages) such
Indemnitee may suffer or incur by reason of the investigation, defense and
settlement of claims and in obtaining any prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code necessary in such Indemnitee's reasonable
judgment by reason of the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth in the first paragraph of Section 5.01(s) or a breach of the provisions
set forth in the last paragraph of Section 8.01(f).



                                       82
<PAGE>

                  (c) Exceptions; Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Section 12.02, Borrower shall have no obligation to
any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to (i) any intentional tort, fraud or act
of gross negligence or bad faith which any Indemnitee is personally determined
by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (sustained on appeal, if
any) to have committed, (ii) any liability of such Indemnitee to any third party
based upon contractual obligations of such Indemnitee owing to such third party
which are not expressly set forth in the Loan Documents or (iii) violations of
Environmental Laws relating to a Property which are caused by the act or
omission of such Indemnitee after such Indemnitee takes possession of such
Property and which would not have occurred if such Indemnitee had exercised
reasonable care under the circumstances. In addition, the indemnification set
forth in this Section 12.02 in favor of any officer, director, partner, employee
or agent of Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing or any Lender shall be solely in
their respective capacities as such officer, director, partner, employee or
agent. Such indemnification in favor of any affiliate of Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender shall be solely in its capacity as the
provider of services to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender
in connection with this Agreement, and such indemnification in favor of any
participant of Agent or any Lender shall be solely in its capacity as a
participant in the Commitments and the Loans.

                  (d) Payment; Survival. Borrower shall pay any amount owing
under this Section 12.02 within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor
by the applicable Indemnitee together with reasonable supporting documentation
therefor. The indemnity set forth in this Section 12.02 shall survive the
payment of all amounts payable pursuant to, and secured by, this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents. Payment by any Indemnitee shall not be a condition
precedent to the obligations of Borrower under this Section 12.02. To the extent
that any indemnification obligation set forth in this Section 12.02 may be
unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy, Borrower
shall contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay and satisfy
under applicable law, to the payment and satisfaction of the applicable
indemnified matter.

                  12.03 Change in Accounting Principles. Except as otherwise
provided herein, if any changes in accounting principles from those used in the
preparation of the most recent financial statements delivered to Agent pursuant
to the terms hereof are hereafter required or permitted by the rules,
regulations, pronouncements and opinions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (or successors
thereto or agencies with similar functions) and are adopted by the REIT,
Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment Affiliate, or any Agreement Party with
the agreement of its independent certified public accountants and such changes
result in a change in the method of calculation of any of the financial
covenants, standards or terms found herein, the parties hereto agree to enter
into negotiations in order to amend such provisions so as to equitably reflect
such changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the
financial condition of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, shall be the same
after such changes as if such changes had not been made; provided, however, that
no change in GAAP that would affect the method of calculation of any of the
financial covenants, standards or terms shall be given effect in such
calculations until such provisions are amended, in a manner satisfactory to
Agent and all Lenders, to so reflect such change in accounting principles.

                  12.04 Setoff. In addition to any Liens granted to Agent and
any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of
limitation of any such Lien or rights,

                                       83

upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, Agent
and each Lender are hereby authorized by Borrower at any time or from time to
time, with concurrent notice to Borrower, or to any other Person (any such
notice being hereby expressly waived) to set off and to appropriate and to apply
any and all deposits (general or special, including, but not limited to,
indebtedness evidenced by certificates of deposit, whether matured or unmatured
but not including trust accounts) and any other indebtedness at any time held or
owing by Agent or such Lender solely to or for the credit or the account of
Borrower against and on account of the Obligations of Borrower to Agent or such
Lender including but not limited to all Loans and all claims of any nature or
description arising out of or connected with this Agreement or any of the other
Loan Documents, irrespective of whether or not (a) Agent or such Lender shall
have made any demand hereunder or (b) Agent shall have declared the principal of
and interest on the Loans and other amounts due hereunder to be due and payable
as permitted by Article XI and although said obligations and liabilities, or any
of them, may be contingent or unmatured.

                  12.05 Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or modification of
any provision of this Agreement shall be effective without the written agreement
of Requisite Lenders (after notice to all Lenders) as provided in Section
11.10(a) and Borrower provided that the agreement of Requisite Lenders shall not
be required for amendments or modifications that are purely of a clerical nature
or that correct a manifest error and no termination or waiver of any such
provision of this Agreement (including without limitation any waiver of an Event
of Default which does not specifically require the consent of all Lenders), or
consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective
without the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders (after notice to all
Lenders) as provided in Section 11.10(a), which Requisite Lenders shall have the
right to grant or withhold at their sole discretion, except that the amendments,
modifications or waivers specified in Section 11.10(b) shall require the consent
of the Supermajority Lenders and the following amendments, modifications or
waivers shall require the consent of all Lenders (other than Section 12.05(j)
which shall require the consent of all Lenders other than Agent):

                  (a) Increasing the Commitments or any Lender's Commitments;

                  (b) Changing the principal amount or final maturity of the
Loans;

                  (c) Reducing or increasing the interest rates applicable to
the Loans (other than Swingline Loans);

                  (d) Reducing the rates on which fees payable pursuant hereto
are determined;

                  (e) Forgiving or delaying any amount payable under Article II
(other than late fees);

                  (f) Changing the definition of "Requisite Lenders," "Loan
Availability," "Supermajority Lenders," or "Pro Rata Shares";

                  (g) Changing any provision contained in Section 12.05;

                  (h) Releasing any obligor under any Loan Document, unless such
release is otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement or any other Loan
Document;



                                       84
<PAGE>

                  (a) Issuing a Letter of Credit for a term extending beyond the
Maturity Date;

                  (i) Removal of Agent for good cause in accordance with Section
11.09(a); and

                  (j) Modifying or waiving any other provision herein which
specifically requires the consent of all Lenders.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Borrower
shall have no right to consent to any amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of Article XI hereof; provided, however, that no
amendment, modification, termination or waiver of Section 11.09(b), 11.09(c),
11.10(a), or 11.13 (except subsection (i) thereof) which has an adverse effect
on Borrower or Borrower's rights hereunder shall be effective without the
written concurrence of Borrower. Agent and Lenders further acknowledge and agree
that the remaining provisions of Article XI are intended to and shall continue
to address only the rights and obligations of Agent and Lenders amongst each
other and do not and shall not impose obligations or restrictions upon Borrower
or result in any way in the loss of any rights, claims or defenses of Borrower.
No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of Article XI
hereof or any other provision referring to any Agent, Swingline Lender or
Issuing Lender shall be effective without the written concurrence of the Agent,
Swingline Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable. Any waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which it was given. No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle
Borrower to any other further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with this Section shall be binding on each assignee,
transferee or recipient of Agent's powers, functions or duties or any Lender's
Commitment under this Agreement or the Loans at the time outstanding.

                  12.06 Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall
be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not
permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall
not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default if
such action is taken or condition exists.

                  12.07 Notices and Delivery. Unless otherwise specifically
provided herein, any consent, notice or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served,
telecopied or sent by courier service or United States mail and shall be deemed
to have been given when delivered in person or by courier service, upon receipt
of a telecopy or if deposited in the United States mail (registered or
certified, with postage prepaid and properly addressed) upon receipt or refusal
to accept delivery. Notices to Agent, Swingline Lender or Issuing Lender
pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until received by Agent, Swingline
Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable. For the purposes hereof, the addresses
of the parties hereto (until notice of a change thereof is delivered as provided
in this Section 12.07) shall be as set forth below each party's name on the
signature pages hereof, or, as to each party, at such other address as may be
designated by such party in a written notice to all of the other parties. All
deliveries to be made to Agent for


                                       85
<PAGE>

distribution to the Lenders shall be made to Agent at the addresses specified
for notice on the signature page hereto and, in addition, a sufficient number of
copies of each such delivery shall be delivered to Agent for delivery to each
Lender at the address specified for deliveries on the signature page hereto or
such other address as may be designated by Agent or Lenders in a written notice.

                  12.08 Survival of Warranties, Indemnities and Agreements. All
agreements, representations, warranties and indemnities made or given herein or
pursuant hereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents and the making and repayment of the Loans hereunder and
such indemnities shall survive termination hereof.

                  12.09 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies Cumulative.
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any other Loan
Document, no failure or delay on the part of Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing
Lender or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege under any
of the Loan Documents shall impair such power, right or privilege or be
construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other
or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. All
rights and remedies existing under the Loan Documents are cumulative to and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies otherwise available.

                  12.10 Marshalling; Recourse to Security; Payments Set Aside.
Neither any Lender, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender nor Agent shall be under
any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Borrower or any other party or
against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. Recourse to security
shall not be required at any time. To the extent that Borrower makes a payment
or payments to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or the Lenders or Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or the Lenders enforce their Liens or exercise
their rights of set off, and such payment or payments or the proceeds of such
enforcement or set off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state
or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such
recovery, the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied,
and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement
or set off had not occurred.

                  12.11 Severability. In case any provision in or obligation
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in
any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  12.12 Headings. Section headings in this Agreement are
included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a
part of this Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

                  12.13 Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
ILLINOIS.

                  12.14 Limitation of Liability. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, no claim may be made by Borrower, the REIT, any Lender or any
other Person against Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender, or
the affiliates, directors, officers, employees,


                                       86
<PAGE>

attorneys or agents of any of them, for any punitive damages in respect of any
claim for breach of contract or any other theory of liability arising out of or
related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or any act, omission
or event occurring in connection therewith; and Borrower, the REIT, and each
Lender hereby waive, release and agree not to sue upon any claim for any such
damages, whether or not accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist
in its favor.

                  12.15 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and the successors and permitted assigns of Agent and Lenders. The terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any permitted
assignee or transferee of the Loans and the Commitments of Lenders under this
Agreement, and in the event of such transfer or assignment, the rights and
privileges herein conferred upon Agent and Lenders shall automatically extend to
and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and
conditions hereof. Borrower's rights or any interest therein hereunder, and
Borrower's duties and obligations hereunder, shall not be assigned (whether
directly, indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) without the consent of
all Lenders.

                  12.16 Usury Limitation. Each Loan Document is expressly
limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of
error of fact or law, payment, prepayment or advancement of the proceeds of the
Loans, acceleration of maturity of the unpaid principal balance of the Loans, or
otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders for the use,
forbearance, or retention of money, including any fees or charges collected or
made in connection with the Loans which may be treated as interest under
applicable law, if any, exceed the maximum legal limit (if any such limit is
applicable) under United States federal laws or state laws (to the extent not
preempted by federal law, if any), now or hereafter governing the interest
payable under such Loan Documents. If, from any circumstances whatsoever,
fulfillment of any provision hereof or any of the other Loan Documents at the
time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the
limit of validity (if any) prescribed by law which a court of competent
jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then ipso facto, the obligation to be
fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any
circumstances Lenders shall ever receive as interest an amount which would
exceed the maximum legal limit (if any such limit is applicable), such amount
which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
unpaid principal balance due under the Loan Documents and not to the payment of
interest or, if necessary, to Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, this provision shall control
every other provision of all Loan Documents.

                  12.17 Confidentiality. Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender
and Lenders shall use reasonable efforts to assure that any information about
Borrower, the REIT, Subsidiaries and Investment Affiliates (and their respective
Properties) not generally disclosed to the public which is furnished to Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or Lenders pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is used only for the purposes of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall not be divulged to any
other Person other than Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders and
their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents who are
actively and directly participating in the evaluation, administration or
enforcement of the Obligations; provided, however, that


                                       87
<PAGE>

nothing herein shall affect the disclosure of any such information (i) to the
extent required by statute, rule, regulation or judicial process, (ii) to
counsel for Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or Lenders or to their
accountants, (iii) to bank examiners and auditors, (iv) to any transferee or
participant or prospective transferee or participant hereunder who agrees to be
bound by this provision, (v) in connection with the enforcement of the rights of
Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, or (vi) in connection with any litigation to which Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender is a party so long as Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender provides Borrower with prior
written notice of the need for such disclosure and exercises reasonable efforts
to obtain a protective order with respect to such information from the court or
other tribunal before which such litigation is pending.

12.18 Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process; Waiver of Jury Trial;
Waiver Of Permissive Counterclaims. ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT AGAINST
BORROWER OR THE REIT WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT
MAY BE AND ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY BORROWER OR THE REIT WITH RESPECT

ITSELF AND IN CONNECTION WITH ITS PROPERTIES, GENERALLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, THE
JURISDICTION OF THE AFORESAID COURTS, AND IRREVOCABLY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ANY
FINAL JUDGMENT RENDERED THEREBY FROM WHICH NO APPEAL HAS BEEN TAKEN OR IS
AVAILABLE. BORROWER AND THE REIT HEREBY DESIGNATE AND APPOINT ELLEN KELLEHER,
ESQ., MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES, INC., TWO NORTH RIVERSIDE PLAZA, SUITE 800,
CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60606, TO RECEIVE ON THEIR BEHALF SERVICE OF ALL PROCESS IN

BORROWER AND THE REIT IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO THE SERVICE OF PROCESS OF ANY OF
THE AFOREMENTIONED COURTS IN ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF

TO BECOME EFFECTIVE UPON RECEIPT. BORROWER, THE REIT, AGENT AND LENDERS
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE (A) TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO

WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS

                  12.19 Counterparts; Effectiveness; Inconsistencies. This
Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements may be executed
in counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when Borrower, the
initial Lenders, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Agent have duly executed
and delivered counterpart execution pages of this Agreement to each other
(delivery by Borrower and the REIT to Lenders and by any Lender to Borrower, the
REIT and any other Lender being deemed to have been made by delivery to Agent).
This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be construed to the
extent reasonable to be consistent one with the other, but to the extent that
the terms and conditions of this Agreement are actually and directly
inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any other Loan Document, this
Agreement shall govern.

                  12.20 Construction. The parties acknowledge that each party
and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal
rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this
Agreement or any amendments or exhibits hereto.

                  12.21 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, taken together with
all of the other Loan Documents and all certificates and other documents
delivered by Borrower to Agent in connection herewith, embodies the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements, written and oral, relating to the
subject matter hereof.

                  12.22 Agent's Action for Its Own Protection Only. The
authority herein conferred upon Agent, and any action taken by Agent, to inspect
any Property will be exercised and taken by Agent for its own protection only
and may not be relied upon by Borrower for any purposes whatsoever, and Agent
shall not be deemed to have assumed any responsibility to Borrower with respect
to any such action herein authorized or taken by Agent. Any review,
investigation or inspection conducted by Agent, any consultants retained by
Agent or any agent or representative of Agent in order to verify independently
Borrower's satisfaction of any conditions precedent to the Loans, Borrower's
performance of any of the covenants, agreements and obligations of Borrower
under this Agreement, or the validity of any representations and warranties made
by Borrower hereunder (regardless of whether or not the party conducting such
review, investigation or inspection should have discovered that any of such
conditions precedent were not satisfied or that any such covenants, agreements
or obligations were not performed or that any such representations or warranties
were not true), shall not affect (or constitute a waiver by Agent or Lenders of)
(i) any of Borrower's representations and warranties under this Agreement or
Agent's or Lenders' reliance thereon or (ii) Agent's or Lenders' reliance upon
any certifications of Borrower required under this Agreement or any other facts,
information or reports furnished to Agent and Lenders by Borrower hereunder.

                  12.23 Lenders' ERISA Covenant. Each Lender, by its signature
hereto or on the applicable Assignment and Assumption, hereby agrees (a) that on
the date any Loan is disbursed hereunder no portion of such Lender's Pro Rata
Share of such Loan will constitute "assets" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss.
2510.3-101 of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of
ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and (b) that following such date such Lender shall not allocate
such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any Loan to an account of such Lender if such
allocation (i) by itself would cause such Pro Rata Share of such Loan to then
constitute "assets" (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 or any
successor regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) by itself would cause such Loan to constitute
a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code (which is not
exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the
Internal Revenue Code and the taxes and penalties imposed by Section 4975 of the
Internal Revenue Code and Section 502(i) of ERISA) or any Agent or Lender being
deemed in violation of Section 404 of ERISA.

                  12.24 Sole Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent and Syndication
Agent. Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the
obligations of Sole Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent and Syndication Agent
hereunder shall be limited to those obligations that are expressly set forth
herein, if any, and Sole Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent and Syndication
Agent shall not be required to take any action or assume any liability except as
may be required in their respective capacities as a Lender hereunder. Each of
the parties to this Agreement agrees that, for purposes of the indemnifications
set forth herein, the term "Agent" shall be deemed to include Sole Lead
Arranger, Documentation Agent and Syndication Agent.

            "3.6  BORROWER LETTER OF CREDIT.

                  a.    Delivery to Lender. Lender has agreed that in lieu of
                        the Capital Expenditure Impounds required by Subsection
                        3.1(c) above, Lender will accept and Borrower may
                        deliver by November 14, 2001 an irrevocable standby
                        letter of credit (such letter of credit, together with
                        any replacement or renewal thereof, is referred to
                        herein as the "Borrower Letter of Credit") in the
                        aggregate principal amount of $306,991 issued by an
                        issuer reasonably acceptable to Lender in favor of
                        Lender, in form and content reasonably satisfactory to
                        Lender. Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.6,
                        Lender shall retain custody of any Borrower Letter of
                        Credit until such time as the Loan is repaid in full
                        (other than through judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure
                        of the Mortgages or deeds in lieu thereof).

                  b.    Right to Draw. Lender shall have the right to draw upon
                        the Borrower Letter of Credit in the full amount thereof
                        upon the occurrence of any Default. In the event that
                        the Borrower Letter of Credit will not be renewed for
                        any reason, Borrower shall either (a) deliver a
                        substitute or replacement letter of credit in form and
                        content reasonably satisfactory to Lender (a
                        "Replacement Letter of Credit") prior to the date (the
                        "Replacement Date") that is thirty (30) days prior to
                        the expiration of the Borrower Letter of Credit or (b)
                        elect to reinstate the Capital Expenditure Impounds by
                        delivering to Lender the sum of $61,308 (the
                        "Reinstatement Deposit") prior to the Replacement Date
                        and $10,218 on each payment date thereafter for payment
                        or reimbursement of Capital Expenditures. The failure of
                        Borrower to either deliver a Replacement Letter of
                        Credit or the Reinstatement Deposit prior to the
                        Replacement Date shall be considered a Default under the
                        Loan Documents, and Lender shall, in addition to any
                        other remedy available to Lender under the Loan
                        Documents, be entitled to draw upon the Borrower Letter
                        of Credit in the full amount thereof.

                  c.    Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any draw under
                        the Borrower Letter of Credit shall be retained by
                        Lender as Impounds and shall be governed by the terms
                        and conditions of this Note and the other Loan
                        Documents.

                  d.    Release of the Borrower Letter of Credit. Lender shall
                        surrender the Borrower Letter of Credit to Borrower and
                        refund to Borrower all sums drawn that Lender is holding
                        (and that have not otherwise been applied or spent) at
                        such time as the Loan is repaid in full (other than
                        through judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of the
                        Mortgages or deeds in lieu thereof)."

      2.2   All references to the term "Note" in the Loan Documents shall mean
            the Note, as amended hereby and as the same may hereafter be
            amended, restated, supplemented or modified from time to time.

      2.3   The Mortgages and other Loan Documents which recite they are
            security instruments shall secure, in addition to any other
            obligations secured thereby, the payment and performance by Borrower
            of all obligations under (a) the Note, as amended hereby; and (b)
            this Agreement, as amended, modified, extended or renewed in writing
            by Borrower and Lender.

3.    FORMATION AND ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS. Borrower has previously delivered
      to Lender all of the relevant formation and organizational documents of
      Borrower, of the partners or joint venturers of Borrower (if any), and of
      all guarantors of the Loan (if any), and all such formation documents
      remain in full force and effect and have not been amended or modified
      since they were delivered to Lender. Borrower hereby certifies that: (i)
      the above documents previously delivered to Lender are all of the relevant
      formation and organizational documents of Borrower; (ii) they remain in
      full force and effect; and (iii) they have not been amended or modified
      since they were previously delivered to Lender.

4.    NON-IMPAIRMENT. Except as expressly provided herein, nothing in this
      Agreement shall alter or affect any provision, condition, or covenant
      contained in the Note or any other Loan Document or affect or impair any
      rights, powers, or remedies of Lender, it being the intent of the parties
      hereto that the provisions of the Note and other Loan Documents shall
      continue in full force and effect except as expressly modified hereby.

5.    MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be
      governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of
      California, except to the extent the same are preempted by Federal law. In

                                       2
<PAGE>
      action brought or arising out of this Agreement or the Loan Documents,
      Borrower, and the general partners and joint venturers of Borrower (if
      any), hereby consent to the jurisdiction of any Federal or State Court
      having proper venue within the State of California and also consent to the
      service of process by any means authorized by California or federal law.
      The headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and shall be
      disregarded in interpreting the substantive provisions of this Agreement.
      Except as expressly provided otherwise herein, all terms used herein shall
      have the meaning given to them in the other Loan Documents. Time is of the
      essence of each term of the Loan Documents, including this Agreement. If
      any provision of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents shall
      be determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal
      or unenforceable, that portion shall be deemed severed from this Agreement
      and the remaining parts shall remain in full force as though the invalid,
      illegal, or unenforceable portion had never been a part thereof.

6.    INTEGRATION; INTERPRETATION. The Loan Documents, including this Agreement,
      contain or expressly incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the
      parties with respect to the matters contemplated therein and supersede all
      prior negotiations. The Loan Documents shall not be modified except by
      written instrument executed by all parties.

7.    EXECUTION IN COUNTERPART. This Agreement, and other Loan Documents which
      expressly so provide, may be executed in any number of counterparts, each
      of which when executed and delivered will be deemed to be an original and
      all of which, taken together, will be deemed to be one and the same
      instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Borrower and Lender have caused this Agreement to be duly
executed as of the date first above written.

4.    INTEREST; PAYMENTS.

      4.1   DEFINITIONS. The following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

            "Actual/360 Basis" shall mean on the basis of a 360-day year and
            charged on the basis of actual days elapsed for any whole or partial
            month in which interest is being calculated.

            "30/360 Basis" shall mean on the basis of a 360-day year consisting
            of 12 months of 30 days each.

            "Interest Rate" shall mean a fixed interest rate equal to 6.98%.

      4.2   INTEREST ACCRUAL. Interest on the outstanding principal balance of
            this Note shall accrue from the Disbursement Date at an annual rate
            equal to the Interest Rate calculated on an Actual/360 Basis.

      4.3   PAYMENTS. Monthly payments hereunder shall commence on the first day
            of the calendar month following the Disbursement Date and continue
            on the first day of each calendar month thereafter through the
            Maturity Date. If the Disbursement Date is a date other than the
            first day of a calendar month, the first monthly payment shall be
            interest only. Subsequent monthly payments shall be calculated on
            the basis of an equal-payment thirty (30) year amortization of
            principal and interest. Notwithstanding that interest on this Note
            accrues on an Actual/360 Basis, the total amount of each such
            amortized monthly payment of principal and interest shall be
            determined using a 30/360 Basis. On the Maturity Date, all unpaid
            principal and accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and owing in
            full. All interest shall be paid in arrears.

      4.4   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS. Borrower acknowledges that interest calculated on
            an Actual/360 Basis exceeds interest calculated on a 30/360 Basis
            and, therefore: (a) a greater portion of each monthly installment of
            principal and interest will be applied to interest using the
            Actual/360 Basis than would be the case if interest accrued on a
            30/360 Basis; and (b) the unpaid principal balance of this Note on
            the Maturity Date will be greater using the Actual/360 Basis than
            would be the case if interest accrued on a 30/360 Basis.

      4.5   APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. In the absence of a specific determination
            by Lender to the contrary, all payments paid by Borrower to Lender
            in connection with the obligations of Borrower under this Note and
            under the other Loan Documents shall be applied in the following
            order of priority: (a) to amounts, other than principal and
            interest, due to Lender pursuant to this Note or the other Loan
            Documents; (b) to accrued but unpaid interest on this Note; and (c)
            to the unpaid principal balance of this Note. Upon the occurrence of
            a Default: (i) Borrower irrevocably waives the right to direct the
            application of any and all payments at any time thereafter received
            by Lender from or on behalf of Borrower, and (ii) Borrower
            irrevocably agrees that Lender shall have the continuing exclusive
            right to apply any and all such payments against the then due and
            owing obligations of Borrower in such order of priority as Lender
            may deem advisable.

5.    LATE CHARGE; DEFAULT RATE.

      5.1   LATE CHARGE. If any payment required hereunder is not paid on or
            before the fifth calendar day of the month in which it is due,
            Borrower shall pay a late or collection charge, as liquidated
            damages, equal to 4% of the amount of such unpaid payment. Borrower
            acknowledges that Lender will incur additional expenses as a result
            of any late payments hereunder, which expenses would be
            impracticable to quantify, and that Borrower's payments under this
            paragraph are a reasonable estimate of such expenses. The foregoing
            to the contrary notwithstanding, no late or collection charge shall
            be payable by Borrower as a result of any delay in the payment of
            any sum due and payable on the Maturity Date.

      5.2   DEFAULT RATE. Commencing upon a Default and continuing until such
            Default shall have been cured by Borrower, all sums owing on this
            Note shall bear interest until paid in full at a rate per annum
            equal to 5% plus the Interest Rate ("Default Rate").

6.    MAXIMUM RATE PERMITTED BY LAW. Neither this Note nor any of the other Loan
      Documents shall require the payment or permit the collection of any
      interest or any late payment charge in excess of the maximum rate
      permitted by law. If any such excess interest or late payment charge is
      provided for under this Note or any of the other Loan Documents or if this
      Note or any of the other Loan Documents shall be adjudicated to provide
      for such excess, neither


                                       3
<PAGE>
      Borrower nor Borrower's successors or assigns shall be obligated to pay
      such excess, and the right to demand the payment of any such excess shall
      be and hereby is waived, and this provision shall control any other
      provision of this Note or any of the other Loan Documents. If Lender shall
      collect amounts which are deemed to constitute interest and which would
      increase the effective interest rate to a rate in excess of the maximum
      rate permitted by law, all such amounts deemed to constitute interest in
      excess of the maximum legal rate shall, upon such determination, at the
      option of Lender, be returned to Borrower or credited against the
      outstanding principal balance of this Note.

7.    ACCELERATION. If (a) Borrower shall fail to pay when due, subject to any
      applicable grace or cure period, any sums payable under this Note; (b) any
      other Default shall occur; or (c) any other event or condition shall occur
      which, under the terms of any of the Mortgages or any other Loan Document,
      gives rise to a right of acceleration of sums owing under this Note, then
      Lender, at its sole option, shall have the right to declare all sums owing
      under this Note immediately due and payable; provided, however, that if
      any of the Mortgages or any other Loan Document provides for the automatic
      acceleration of payment of sums owing under this Note, all sums owing
      under this Note shall be automatically due and payable in accordance with
      the terms of such of the Mortgages or such other Loan Document.

8.    BORROWER'S LIABILITY.

      8.1   LIMITATION. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 8, Lender's
            recovery against Borrower under this Note and the other Loan
            Documents shall be limited solely to the Properties and the
            "Collateral" (as defined in the Mortgages).

      8.2   EXCEPTIONS. Nothing contained in Section 8.1 or elsewhere in this
            Note or the other Loan Documents, however, shall limit in any way
            the personal liability of Borrower owed to Lender for any losses or
            damages incurred by Lender (including, without limitation, any
            impairment of Lender's security for the Loan) with respect to any of
            the following matters: (a) fraud or willful misrepresentation; (b)
            material physical waste of the Properties (or any portions thereof)
            or the Collateral; (c) failure to pay property or other taxes,
            assessments or charges (other than amounts paid to Lender for taxes,
            assessments or charges pursuant to Impounds as defined in Exhibit A
            and where Lender elects not to apply such funds toward payment of
            the taxes, assessments or charges owed) which may create liens
            senior to the lien of any of the Mortgages on all or any portion of
            the Properties; (d) failure to deliver any insurance or condemnation
            proceeds or awards or any security deposits received by Borrower to
            Lender as required under the terms of the Loan Documents or any
            other instrument now or hereafter securing this Note or to otherwise
            apply such sums as required under the terms of the Loan Documents or
            any other instrument now or hereafter securing this Note; (e)
            failure to apply any rents, royalties, accounts, revenues, income,
            issues, profits and other benefits from the Properties (or any
            portion thereof) which are collected or received by Borrower during
            the period of any Default or after acceleration of the indebtedness
            and other sums owing under the Loan Documents to the payment of
            either (i) such indebtedness or other sums or (ii) the normal and
            necessary operating expenses of the Properties; or (f) any breach by
            Borrower of any covenant in this Note or in any of the Mortgages
            regarding Hazardous Materials (as defined in the Mortgages) or any
            representation or warranty of Borrower regarding Hazardous Materials
            proving to have been untrue when made.

      8.3   NO RELEASE OR IMPAIRMENT. Nothing contained in Section 8.1 shall be
            deemed to release, affect or impair the indebtedness evidenced by
            this Note or the obligations of Borrower under, or the liens and
            security interests created by the Loan Documents, or Lender's rights
            to enforce its remedies under this Note and the other Loan
            Documents, including, without limitation, the right to pursue any
            remedy for injunctive or other equitable relief, or any suit or
            action in connection with the preservation, enforcement or
            foreclosure of the liens, mortgages, deeds of trust, assignments and
            security interests which are now or at any time hereafter security
            for the payment and performance of all obligations under this Note
            or the other Loan Documents.

      8.4   PREVAIL AND CONTROL. The provisions of this Section 8 shall prevail
            and control over any contrary provisions elsewhere in this Note or
            the other Loan Documents.

9.    NON-MORTGAGOR BORROWER. If Borrower is not also a "Mortgagor" under the
      Mortgages, Borrower hereby makes all representations and warranties in
      favor of Lender contained in Article 5 of the Mortgages, all covenants
      contained in Section 6.15 of the Mortgages, and all indemnities of Lender
      contained in Section 6.19 of the Mortgages, jointly and severally with the
      "Mortgagor" under each of the Mortgages.


                                       4
<PAGE>
10.   MISCELLANEOUS.

      10.1  JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. If this Note is executed by more than
            one person or entity as Borrower, the obligations of each such
            person or entity shall be joint and several. No person or entity
            shall be a mere accommodation maker, but each shall be primarily and
            directly liable hereunder.

      10.2  WAIVER OF PRESENTMENT. Except as otherwise provided herein or in any
            other Loan Document, Borrower hereby waives presentment, demand,
            notice of dishonor, notice of default or delinquency, notice of
            acceleration, notice of nonpayment, notice of costs, expenses or
            losses and interest thereon, and notice of interest on interest and
            late charges.

      10.3  DELAY IN ENFORCEMENT. No previous waiver or failure or delay by
            Lender in acting with respect to the terms of this Note or the
            Mortgages shall constitute a waiver of any breach, default or
            failure of condition under this Note, the Mortgages or the
            obligations secured thereby. A waiver of any term of this Note, the
            Mortgages or of any of the obligations secured thereby must be made
            in writing signed by Lender, shall be limited to the express terms
            of such waiver, and shall not constitute a waiver of any subsequent
            obligation of Borrower. The acceptance at any time by Lender of any
            past-due amount shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to
            require prompt payment when due of any other amounts then or
            thereafter due and payable.

      10.4  TIME OF THE ESSENCE. Time is of the essence with respect to every
            provision hereof.

      10.5  GOVERNING LAW. This Note was accepted by Lender in the state of
            California and the proceeds of this Note were disbursed from the
            state of California, which state the parties agree has a substantial
            relationship to the parties and to the underlying transaction
            embodied hereby. Accordingly, in all respects, including, without
            limiting the generality of the foregoing, matters of construction,
            validity, enforceability and performance, this Note, the Mortgages
            and the other Loan Documents and the obligations arising hereunder
            and thereunder shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
            with, the laws of the state of California applicable to contracts
            made and performed in such state and any applicable law of the
            United States of America, except that at all times the provisions
            for the foreclosure of the liens granted under the Mortgages
            securing this Note and the creation, perfection and enforcement of
            the security interests created pursuant thereto and pursuant to the
            other Loan Documents shall be governed by and construed according to
            the law of the states where the Properties are located. Except as
            provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Borrower hereby
            unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
            permitted by law, any claim to assert that the law of any
            jurisdiction other than California governs the Mortgages, this Note
            and the other Loan Documents.

      10.6  CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Borrower irrevocably submits to the
            jurisdiction of: (a) any state or federal court sitting in the state
            of California over any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by
            Borrower against Lender, arising out of or relating to this Note or
            the Loan evidenced hereby; (b) any state or federal court sitting in
            any of the states where the Properties are located or the state in
            which Borrower's principal place of business is located over any
            suit, action or proceeding, brought by Lender against Borrower,
            arising out of or relating to this Note or the Loan evidenced
            hereby; and (c) any state court sitting in any of the counties of
            the states where the Properties are located over any suit, action,
            or proceeding, brought by Lender to exercise its rights of
            foreclosure under the applicable Mortgage or any action brought by
            Lender to enforce its rights with respect to the Collateral.
            Borrower irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
            any objection that Borrower may now or hereafter have to the laying
            of venue of any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such
            court and any claim that any such suit, action, or proceeding
            brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

      10.7  COUNTERPARTS. This Note may be executed in any number of
            counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall be
            deemed an original and all of which taken together shall be deemed
            to be one and the same Note.

      10.8  HEIRS, SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All of the terms, covenants,
            conditions and indemnities contained in this Note and the other Loan
            Documents shall be binding upon the heirs, successors and assigns of
            Borrower and shall inure to the benefit of the successors and
            assigns of Lender. The foregoing sentence shall not be construed to
            permit Borrower to assign the Loan except as otherwise permitted in
            this Note or the other Loan Documents.

      10.9  SEVERABILITY. If any term of this Note, or the application thereof
            to any person or circumstances, shall, to any extent, be invalid or
            unenforceable, the remainder of this Note, or the application of
            such term to persons or


                                       5
<PAGE>
            circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or
            unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term of this
            Note shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted
            by law.

      10.10 CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND EXPENSES. Wherever Lender's consent,
            approval, acceptance or satisfaction is required under any provision
            of this Note (including, without limitation, Exhibits A and B
            hereto) or any of the other Loan Documents, such consent, approval,
            acceptance or satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld,
            conditioned or delayed by Lender unless such provision expressly so
            provides. Wherever costs or expenses are required to be paid under
            any provision of this Note or any of the other Loan Documents, such
            costs or expenses shall be reasonable.

11.   NOTICES. All requests, demands, notices and other communications that are
      required or permitted to be given to a party under this Note shall be in

12.   ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS. The additional terms and conditions set
      forth in Exhibit A and Exhibit B attached hereto are incorporated herein
      by this reference.

13.   PREPAYMENT. Borrower acknowledges that any prepayment of this Note will
      cause Lender to lose its interest rate yield on this Note and will
      possibly require that Lender reinvest any such prepayment amount in loans
      of a lesser interest rate yield (including, without limitation, in debt
      obligations other than first mortgage loans on commercial properties). As
      a consequence, Borrower agrees as follows, as an integral part of the
      consideration for Lender's making the Loan:

      13.1  RESTRICTIONS. Any voluntary prepayment of this Note: (a) is
            prohibited except during the last 3 months of the term, (b) is
            permitted in full only, and not in part, and (c) may only be made on
            the first day of a month.

      13.2  PREPAYMENT CHARGE. Except as provided below, if this Note is prepaid
            prior to the last three (3) months of the term, whether such
            prepayment is involuntary or upon acceleration of the principal
            amount of this Note by Lender following a Default, Borrower shall
            pay to Lender on the prepayment date (in addition to all other sums
            then due and owing to Lender under the Loan Documents) a prepayment
            charge equal to the greater of the following two amounts: (a) an
            amount equal to 1% of the then outstanding principal balance of the
            Loan; or (b) an amount equal to (i) the amount, if any, by which the
            sum of the present values as of the prepayment date of all unpaid
            principal and interest payments required under this Note, calculated
            by discounting such payments from their respective scheduled payment
            dates back to the prepayment date at a discount rate equal to the
            Periodic Treasury Yield (defined below) exceeds the outstanding
            principal balance of the Loan as of the prepayment date, multiplied
            by (ii) a fraction whose numerator is the amount of the prepayment
            and whose denominator is the outstanding principal balance of the
            Loan as of the prepayment date. Notwithstanding the


                                       6
<PAGE>
            foregoing, no prepayment charge shall apply in respect to any
            insurance or condemnation proceeds received by Lender and applied by
            Lender to the outstanding principal balance of the Loan. For
            purposes of the foregoing, "Periodic Treasury Yield" means (c) the
            annual yield to maturity of the actively traded non-callable United
            States Treasury fixed interest rate security (other than any such
            security which can be surrendered at the option of the holder at
            face value in payment of federal estate tax or which was issued at a
            substantial discount) that has a maturity closest to (whether
            before, on or after) the Maturity Date (or if two or more such
            securities have maturity dates equally close to the Maturity Date,
            the average annual yield to maturity of all such securities), as
            reported in The Wall Street Journal or other authoritative
            publication or news retrieval service on the fifth Business Day
            preceding the prepayment date, divided by (d) 12, if scheduled
            payment dates are monthly, or 4, if scheduled payment dates are
            quarterly.

      13.3  WAIVER. Borrower waives any right to prepay this Note except under
            the terms and conditions set forth in this Section and agrees that
            if this Note is prepaid, Borrower will pay the prepayment charge set
            forth above. Borrower hereby acknowledges that: (a) the inclusion of
            this waiver of prepayment rights and agreement to pay the prepayment
            charge for the right to prepay this Note was separately negotiated
            with Lender; (b) the economic value of the various elements of this
            waiver and agreement was discussed; (c) the consideration given by
            Borrower for the Loan was adjusted to reflect the specific waiver
            and agreement negotiated between Borrower and Lender and contained
            herein; and (d) this waiver is intended to comply with California
            Civil Code Section 2954.10.

                                               Borrower's Initials: ________

      13.4  INSURANCE PROCEEDS; CONDEMNATION AWARDS. Notwithstanding anything
            herein to the contrary, no prepayment charge shall be due and owing
            with respect to any involuntary prepayment resulting from Lender's
            application of any insurance proceeds or condemnation awards to the
            Loan.

14.   DEFEASANCE. At any time after the Lockout Expiration Date (defined below),
      Borrower may elect to cause Lender to release one or more of the
      Properties from the lien of any of the Mortgages and the other Loan
      Documents and to accept other collateral in substitution therefor, in
      accordance with the provisions of this Section ("Defeasance"), at
      Borrower's sole cost and expense. "Lockout Expiration Date" means the
      earlier of (a) the second anniversary of the "startup day" (as defined in
      Internal Revenue Code Section 860(G)(a)(9)) of any "real estate mortgage
      investment conduit" (as defined in Internal Revenue Code Section 860D)
      that holds this Note and (b) the third anniversary of the date of this
      Note. For purposes of this Section 14 only, (a) the values of the Casa del
      Sol III Property, the Apollo Village Property, the Woodland Hills
      Property, the Cabana Property, the Pickwick Village Property, the Indian
      Oaks Property and the Windmill Manor Property, expressed as a percentage
      of the total principal amount of the Loan ("Allocated Loan Percentage"),
      shall be deemed to be 13.3%, 10.6%, 23.6%, 16.9%, 16.8%, 6.2%, and 12.6%,
      respectively; and (b) the portion of the principal amount of the Loan
      allocable to each of the Properties ("Allocated Loan Amount") shall be
      deemed initially to be the Allocated Loan Percentage for such Property
      multiplied by the initial total principal amount of the Loan and,
      thereafter, the same such amount as the same shall be reduced by ratable
      application of payments of principal made under this Note from time to
      time.

      14.1  CONDITIONS. Borrower shall only have the right to cause a Defeasance
            if no Default has occurred and is continuing and all of the
            following conditions have been satisfied:

            a.    Notice. Borrower shall give at least 60 days but not more than
                  90 days' written notice to Lender specifying the date of
                  Borrower's intended Defeasance ("Release Date"), which date
                  shall be a scheduled payment date and such notice shall
                  indicate the principal amount of the Note to be defeased;

            b.    Payments. Borrower shall pay in full, on or before the Release
                  Date, all accrued and unpaid interest and all other sums due
                  under this Note and the other Loan Documents on or before the
                  Release Date, including, without limitation, (i) all costs and
                  expenses paid or incurred by Lender or its agents in
                  connection with the Defeasance, the purchase of the Defeasance
                  Collateral (defined below), the release of the applicable
                  Properties, the review of the proposed Defeasance Collateral
                  and the preparation of the Defeasance Security Agreement
                  (defined below) and related documentation, and (ii) any
                  revenue, documentary stamp, intangible or other taxes, charges
                  or fees due in connection with the transfer or assumption of
                  this Note or the Defeasance;

            c.    Deliveries. Borrower shall deliver the following items to
                  Lender on or before the Release Date:


                                       7
<PAGE>
                  (i)     immediately available funds ("Defeasance Deposit") in
                          an amount sufficient to enable Lender to purchase,
                          through means and sources customarily employed and
                          available to Lender, for the account of Borrower,
                          direct, non-callable obligations of the United States
                          of America that provide for payments prior, but as
                          close as possible, to all successive scheduled payment
                          dates occurring after the Release Date, with each such
                          payment being equal to or greater than one hundred
                          twenty five percent (125%) of the product of the
                          Allocated Loan Percentage for the Properties that are
                          the subject of the applicable Defeasance multiplied by
                          the installments of principal and interest required to
                          be paid under this Note (including, without
                          limitation, all amounts due on the Maturity Date) for
                          the balance of the term hereof ("Defeasance
                          Collateral"), each of which shall be duly endorsed by
                          the holder as directed by Lender or accompanied by a
                          written instrument of transfer in form and substance
                          satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion
                          (including, without limitation, such instruments as
                          may be required by the depository institution holding
                          such securities or the issuer of such securities, as
                          the case may be, to effectuate book-entry transfers
                          and pledges through the book-entry facilities of such
                          institution) in order to perfect upon the delivery of
                          the Defeasance Security Agreement (as defined below)
                          the first priority security interest in the Defeasance
                          Collateral in favor of Lender;

                  (ii)    a pledge and security agreement, in form and substance
                          satisfactory to Lender in its reasonable discretion,
                          creating a first priority security interest in favor
                          of Lender in the Defeasance Collateral ("Defeasance
                          Security Agreement"), which shall provide, among other
                          things, that any payments generated by the applicable
                          Defeasance Collateral shall be paid directly to Lender
                          and applied by Lender to amounts then due and payable
                          under this Note allocable to the Allocated Loan Amount
                          for the Properties that are the subject of the
                          applicable Defeasance and that any excess received by
                          Lender from the applicable Defeasance Collateral over
                          the amounts payable by Borrower under this Note
                          allocable to the Allocated Loan Amount for the
                          Properties that are the subject of the applicable
                          Defeasance shall be first, paid to Lender and applied
                          by Lender to any other amounts then due and payable
                          under this Note, and second, refunded to Borrower
                          promptly after each scheduled payment date;

                  (iii)   a certificate of Borrower certifying that all of the
                          requirements of this Section 14.1 have been satisfied;

                  (iv)    an opinion of counsel for Borrower in form and
                          substance and delivered by counsel satisfactory to
                          Lender in its sole discretion, subject, however, to
                          standard enforceability opinion qualifications and
                          limitations, stating, among other things, that (aa)
                          Lender has a perfected first priority security
                          interest in the Defeasance Collateral, (bb) the
                          Defeasance Security Agreement is enforceable against
                          Borrower in accordance with its terms and (cc) any
                          REMIC Trust formed pursuant to a securitization will
                          not fail to maintain its status as a "real estate
                          mortgage investment conduit" within the meaning of
                          Internal Revenue Code Section 860D, as amended from
                          time to time, or any successor statute, as a result of
                          the Defeasance;

                  (v)     a certificate from a firm of independent certified
                          public accountants acceptable to Lender certifying
                          that the Defeasance Collateral satisfies the
                          requirements of Section 14.1c(i);

                  (vi)    written evidence from the applicable Rating Agencies
                          that the Defeasance will not result in a downgrading,
                          withdrawal or qualification of the respective ratings
                          in effect immediately prior to the Defeasance for any
                          securities issued in connection with the
                          securitization which are then outstanding;

                  (vii)   a conveyance of title to the Property to be released
                          to a Person other than Borrower; and

                  (viii)  such other certificates, documents or instruments as
                          Lender may reasonably require, including, without
                          limitation, such amendments to this Note and the other
                          Loan Documents as Lender reasonably deems appropriate
                          to reflect the Defeasance.

      14.2  RELEASE OF LIEN. Upon satisfaction of all conditions specified above
            with respect to any Defeasance, the Property subject to such
            Defeasance shall be released from the lien of the applicable
            Mortgage and the other Loan Documents to which it is subject, and
            the applicable Defeasance Collateral, any Defeasance Collateral
            previously delivered to Lender under this Note, the Remaining
            Properties and the proceeds thereof shall constitute the only
            collateral which shall secure the obligations of Borrower under this
            Note and the other Loan Documents. Simultaneously with the release
            of a Property pursuant to this Section, Lender shall release that
            portion of all cash or other accounts maintained pursuant to the
            Loan Documents relating to such Property. Lender shall, at
            Borrower's expense, execute and deliver any agreements reasonably
            requested by Borrower to release the lien of the applicable Mortgage
            from the applicable Property. Upon any Defeasance, this Note shall
            be automatically amended such that the Allocated Loan Percentage for
            each of the Remaining Properties after such Defeasance shall be
            equal to (A) one hundred (100) times (B) the Allocated Loan
            Percentage for such Remaining Property immediately prior to such
            Defeasance divided by (C) the sum of the Allocated Loan Percentages
            for all of the Remaining Properties immediately prior to such
            Defeasance (such that at all times the sum of the Allocated Loan
            Percentages for all Remaining Properties shall be equal to one
            hundred percent (100%)).

      14.3  DEFEASANCE DEPOSIT. Borrower hereby authorizes and directs Lender,
            using the means and sources customarily employed and available to
            Lender, to use the Defeasance Deposit to purchase the Defeasance
            Collateral as agent and for the account of Borrower. Payments from
            the Defeasance Collateral shall be made directly to Lender for
            application to the Loan as provided hereinabove. Any part of the
            Defeasance Deposit exceeding the amount necessary to purchase the
            Defeasance Collateral and to pay the other costs which Borrower is
            obligated to pay under this Section 14 shall be refunded to
            Borrower. Borrower agrees to pay all sums referred to in Section
            14.1b above on or before the Release Date.

      14.4  ASSIGNMENT AND ASSUMPTION. Upon the release of any of the Properties
            in accordance with this Section 14, Borrower shall, at the request
            of Lender, assign all of its right, title and interest in and to the
            pledged Defeasance Collateral, any Defeasance Collateral previously
            delivered to Lender under this Note and all its obligations and
            rights under this Note, the Defeasance Security Agreement, any
            Defeasance Security Agreement previously delivered to Lender under
            this Note and the other Loan Documents, to a successor entity
            designated by Borrower and approved by Lender in its sole
            discretion. Such successor entity shall execute an assumption
            agreement in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in its sole
            discretion pursuant to which it shall assume Borrower's obligations
            under this Note, the Defeasance Security Agreement, any Defeasance
            Security Agreement previously delivered to Lender under this Note
            and the other Loan Documents. As conditions to such assignment and
            assumption, Borrower shall: (a) deliver to Lender a new limited
            guaranty in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in its sole
            discretion executed by the principals of such successor entity; (b)
            deliver to Lender an opinion of counsel in form and substance and
            delivered by counsel satisfactory to Lender in its sole discretion
            subject, however, to standard enforceability opinion qualifications
            and limitations, stating, among other things, that such assumption
            agreement is enforceable against Borrower and such successor entity
            in accordance with its terms and that this Note, the Defeasance
            Security Agreement, any Defeasance Security Agreement previously
            delivered to Lender under this Note and the other Loan Documents, as
            so assumed, are enforceable against such successor entity in
            accordance with their respective terms; and (c) pay all costs and
            expenses incurred by Lender or its agents in connection with such
            assignment and assumption (including, without limitation, the review
            of the proposed transferee and the preparation of the assumption
            agreement and related documentation). Upon such assumption, Borrower
            shall be relieved of its obligations under this Note, the Defeasance
            Security Agreement, any Defeasance Security Agreement previously
            delivered to Lender under this Note and the other Loan Documents
            other than those obligations which are specifically intended to
            survive the payment of the Loan or other termination, satisfaction
            or assignment of this Note, the Defeasance Security Agreement, any
            Defeasance Security Agreement previously delivered to Lender under
            this Note or the other Loan Documents or Lender's exercise of its
            rights and remedies under any of such documents and instruments.

15.   WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. LENDER AND BORROWER HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY
      AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
      RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION BASED HEREON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN
      CONNECTION WITH, THIS NOTE OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF
      CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN), OR
      ACTIONS OF LENDER OR BORROWER. THIS PROVISION IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR

                          EXHIBIT A TO PROMISSORY NOTE
                         ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This Exhibit A is attached to and forms a part of that Promissory Note Secured
by Mortgages ("Note") executed by MHC STAGECOACH, L.L.C., a Delaware limited
liability company ("Borrower") in favor of WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION ("Lender").

1.    DISBURSEMENT OF LOAN PROCEEDS; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. Borrower hereby
      authorizes Lender to disburse the proceeds of the Loan, after deducting
      any and all fees owed by Borrower to Lender in connection with the Loan,
      to Commonwealth Land Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company"). With
      respect to such disbursement, Borrower understands and agrees that Lender
      does not accept responsibility for errors, acts or omissions of others,
      including, without limitation, the escrow company, other banks,
      communications carriers or clearinghouses through which the transfer of
      Loan proceeds may be made or through which Lender receives or transmits
      information, and no such entity shall be deemed Lender's agent. As a
      consequence, Lender shall not be liable to Borrower for any actual
      (whether direct or indirect), consequential or punitive damages which may
      arise with respect to the disbursement of Loan proceeds, whether or not
      (a) any claim for such damages is based on tort or contract, or (b) either
      Lender or Borrower knew or should have known of the likelihood of such
      damages in any situation.

2.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

      2.1   STATEMENTS REQUIRED. During the term of the Loan and while any
            liabilities of Borrower to Lender under any of the Loan Documents
            remain outstanding and unless Lender otherwise consents in writing,
            Borrower shall provide to Lender the following:

            a.    OPERATING STATEMENT. Not later than 10 days after and as of
                  each calendar month during the first 6 months of the term of
                  the Loan, and thereafter not later than 30 days after and as
                  of the end of each calendar quarter, an operating statement,
                  signed and dated by Borrower and in a form acceptable to
                  Lender, showing all revenues and expenses during such month or
                  quarter and year-to-date, relating to each of the Properties,
                  including, without limitation, all information requested under
                  any of the Loan Documents;

            b.    RENT ROLL. Not later than 10 days after and as of each
                  calendar month during the first 6 months of the term of the
                  Loan, and thereafter not later than 30 days after and as of
                  the end of each calendar quarter, a rent roll signed and dated
                  by Borrower and in a form acceptable to Lender, showing the
                  following lease information with regard to each tenant: the
                  name of the tenant, monthly or other periodic rental amount,
                  date of commencement of the lease, and payment status;

            c.    BALANCE SHEET. If requested by Lender, not later than 90 days
                  after and as of the end of each fiscal year, a balance sheet,
                  signed and dated by Borrower and in a form acceptable to
                  Lender (or audited financial statements if Borrower obtains
                  them), showing all assets and liabilities of Borrower; and

            d.    OTHER INFORMATION. From time to time, upon Lender's delivery
                  to Borrower of at least 10 days' prior written notice, such
                  other information with regard to Borrower, principals of
                  Borrower, guarantors or the Properties as Lender may
                  reasonably request in writing.

      2.2   FORM; WARRANTY. Borrower agrees that all financial statements to be
            delivered to Lender pursuant to Section 2.1 shall: (a) be complete
            and correct in all material respects; (b) present fairly the
            financial condition of the party; (c) disclose all liabilities that
            are required to be reflected or reserved against; and (d) be
            prepared in accordance with the same accounting standard used by
            Borrower to prepare the financial statements delivered to and
            approved by Lender in connection with the making of the Loan or
            other accounting standards acceptable to Lender. Borrower shall be
            deemed to warrant and represent that, as of the date of delivery of
            any such financial statement, there has been no material adverse
            change in financial condition, nor have any assets or properties
            been sold, transferred, assigned, mortgaged, pledged or encumbered
            since the date of such


                                    EXHIBIT A
                                        1
<PAGE>
            financial statement except as disclosed by Borrower in a writing
            delivered to Lender. Borrower agrees that all rent rolls and other
            information to be delivered to Lender pursuant to Section 2.1 shall
            not contain any misrepresentation or omission of a material fact.

      2.3   LATE CHARGE. If any financial statement, leasing schedule or other
            item required to be delivered to Lender pursuant to Section 2.1 is
            not timely delivered, Borrower shall promptly pay to Lender, as a
            late charge, the sum of $500 per item. In addition, Borrower shall
            promptly pay to Lender an additional late charge of $500 per item
            for each full month during which such item remains undelivered
            following written notice from Lender. Borrower acknowledges that
            Lender will incur additional expenses as a result of any such late
            deliveries, which expenses would be impracticable to quantify, and
            that Borrower's payments under this Section 2.3 are a reasonable
            estimate of such expenses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
            contained herein, once during each year of the term of the Loan
            Lender will give notice to Borrower of its failure to provide any
            item required to be delivered to Lender pursuant to Section 2.1 and
            if any such items are not delivered within three (3) Business Days
            following such notice, then at such time the late charge specified
            herein shall take effect.

3.    IMPOUNDS.

      3.1   AMOUNTS. Borrower shall deposit with Lender the amounts ("Impounds")
            stated below on the dates stated below, for the purpose of paying
            the costs stated below:

            a.    TAXES. (i) $364,529.00 on the Disbursement Date, and (ii) on
                  the first payment date on which both principal and interest
                  under the Loan are payable and on each payment date
                  thereafter, an amount estimated from time to time by Lender in
                  its reasonable discretion to be sufficient to pay for taxes
                  and other liabilities payable by Borrower under Section 6.9 of
                  each of the Mortgages. The initial estimated monthly amount to

            b.    INSURANCE. (i) $35,144.00 on the Disbursement Date, and (ii)

                  under the Loan are payable and on each payment date
                  thereafter, an amount estimated from time to time by Lender in
                  its reasonable discretion to be sufficient to pay for premiums
                  for insurance payable by Borrower under Section 6.10 of each
                  of the Mortgages. The initial estimated monthly amount to be
                  deposited by Borrower on each payment date is $4,393.00.

            c.    CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. $10,218 on the first payment date on
                  which both principal and interest under the Loan are payable
                  and on each payment date thereafter for payment or
                  reimbursement of Capital Expenditures (defined below).

      3.2   APPLICATION.

            a.    TAXES. If no Default exists, Lender shall apply the Impounds
                  in a timely fashion to the payment of the taxes and other
                  liabilities stated above.

            b.    INSURANCE. If no Default exists, Lender shall apply the
                  Impounds to the payment of the insurance premiums stated

                  Capital Expenditures (defined below); provided, however, that
                  Lender shall have received and approved each of the following:

                  (i)   Borrower's written request for such release, describing
                        the Capital Expenditures and certifying that all Capital
                        Expenditures have been paid or incurred by Borrower for
                        work completed lien-free and in a workmanlike manner;

                  (ii)  copies of invoices supporting the request for such
                        release; and


                                    EXHIBIT A
                                        2
<PAGE>
                  (iii) if deemed necessary by Lender, an inspection report
                        signed by an inspector selected by Lender, whose fees
                        and expenses shall be paid by Borrower, and such other
                        evidence as Lender shall reasonably require, confirming
                        borrower's certification.

      3.3   GENERAL. Any portion of the Impounds that exceeds the amount
            required for payment of the foregoing costs shall be repaid to
            Borrower upon Borrower's compliance with the foregoing. Reference is
            made to Section 6.12(b) of each of the Mortgages for a description
            of the account into which the Impounds shall be deposited and for a
            description of certain rights and remedies of Lender with respect to
            amounts in such account.

      3.4   MAINTENANCE AND CONSTRUCTION.

            a.    CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. Borrower shall complete the lien-free
                  performance or installation of the Capital Expenditures (as
                  defined below) from time to time as necessary, in a
                  workmanlike manner and in accordance with all applicable laws,
                  ordinances, rules and regulations. "Capital Expenditures"
                  shall mean major repairs and replacements to maintain or
                  improve the Properties, including, without limitation,
                  structural repairs, roof replacements, HVAC repairs and
                  replacements, mechanical and plumbing repairs and replacements
                  and boiler repair and replacements.

            b.    RIGHT OF INSPECTION. Lender shall have the right to enter upon
                  the Properties at all reasonable times, subject to reasonable
                  notice except in the event of an emergency, in which case no
                  notice shall be required, to inspect all work for the purpose
                  of verifying information disclosed or required pursuant to
                  this Note, in a manner which does not unreasonably interfere
                  with the operations on the Properties. Notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, Lender shall not be obligated to supervise or
                  inspect any work or to inform Borrower or any third party
                  regarding any aspect of any work.

      3.5   RELEASE. Lender shall release any Impounds to Borrower through a
            funds transfer of such Impounds initiated by Lender to the following
            account or such other account as Borrower specifies in a notice to
            Lender:

                     Bank Name:  Bank of America
                                 -------------------------------------

                  Account Name:  7366-9-01095
                                 -------------------------------------
                     Reference:  MHC Operating Limited Partnership

                        Advise:  Megan McBride (312) 828-6274
                                 -------------------------------------

            Lender will determine the funds transfer system and other means to
            be used in making each such release. Borrower agrees that each such
            funds transfer initiated by Lender will be deemed to be a funds
            transfer properly authorized by Borrower, even if the transfer is
            not actually properly authorized by Borrower. Borrower acknowledges
            that Lender will rely on the account number and ABA routing number
            set forth above or specified in a notice from Borrower to Lender,
            even if such account number identifies an account with a name
            different from the name so specified, or the routing number
            identifies a bank different from the bank so specified. If Borrower
            learns of any error in the transfer of any Impounds or of any
            transfer which was not properly authorized, Borrower shall notify
            Lender as soon as possible in writing but in no case more than 14
            days after Lender's first confirmation to Borrower of such transfer.

      3.6   LETTER OF CREDIT.

            a.    Delivery to Lender. Lender has agreed that in lieu of the
                  Capital Expenditure Impounds required by Subsection 3.1(d)
                  above, Lender will accept and Borrower may deliver within ten
                  (10) Business Days after the Disbursement Date an irrevocable
                  standby letter of credit (such letter of credit, together with
                  any replacement or renewal thereof, is referred to herein as
                  the "Borrower Letter of Credit") in the aggregate principal
                  amount of $306,991 issued by an issuer reasonably acceptable
                  to Lender in favor of Lender, in form and content reasonably
                  satisfactory to Lender. Subject to the provisions of this
                  Section 3.6, Lender shall retain custody of any Borrower
                  Letter of Credit until such time as the Loan is repaid in full
                  (other than through judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure of the
                  Mortgages or deeds in lieu thereof).


                                    EXHIBIT A
                                        3
<PAGE>
            b.    Right to Draw. Lender shall have the right to draw upon the
                  Borrower Letter of Credit in the full amount thereof upon the
                  occurrence of (i) any Default or (ii) the receipt by Lender of
                  notice stating that the Borrower Letter of Credit will not be
                  renewed (as provided for in such Borrower Letter of Credit)
                  and, in the event of such nonrenewal (whether by notice by the
                  issuing bank or otherwise), the failure of Borrower to deliver
                  a substitute or replacement letter of credit in form and
                  content satisfactory to Lender prior to the date that is
                  thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the Borrower
                  Letter of Credit.

            c.    Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any draw under the
                  Borrower Letter of Credit shall be retained by Lender as
                  Impounds and shall be governed by the terms and conditions of
                  this Note and the other Loan Documents.

            d.    Release of the Borrower Letter of Credit. Lender shall
                  surrender the Borrower Letter of Credit to Borrower and refund
                  to Borrower all sums drawn that Lender is holding (and have
                  not otherwise been applied or spent) at such time as the Loan
                  is repaid in full (other than through judicial or nonjudicial
                  foreclosure of the Mortgages or deeds in lieu thereof).

4.    ONE-TIME RIGHT OF TRANSFER OF PROPERTIES TO THIRD PARTY. Notwithstanding
      anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.15 of the Mortgages,
      Lender shall, one time only, consent to the voluntary sale or exchange of
      all (but not less than all) of the Properties to a bona-fide third party
      purchaser ("Transfer"), if no Default has occurred and is continuing, no
      event has occurred which, with the giving of notice or the passage of
      time, or both, would constitute a Default and all of the following
      conditions have been satisfied:

      4.1   Lender receives at least sixty-five (65) days prior written notice
            of the proposed Transfer;

      4.2   Lender's reasonable determination that the proposed purchaser, the
            proposed guarantor, if any, and the Properties all satisfy Lender's
            then applicable credit review and underwriting standards, taking
            into consideration, among other things, (a) any decrease in the
            Properties' cash flow which would result from any increase in real
            property taxes due to any anticipated reassessment of the Properties
            for tax purposes and (b) any then applicable requirement of Lender
            that such proposed borrowing entity constitute a single purpose
            asset and bankruptcy remote entity which, at the time of the
            Transfer, shall be in full compliance with the representations and
            covenants set forth in Section 5.2 of the Mortgages (as such
            representations may be reasonably modified by Lender after reviewing
            the ownership structure of the proposed borrowing entity);

      4.3   if required by Lender, delivery to Lender of a non-consolidation
            opinion from a law firm reasonably acceptable to Lender and in form
            and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lender;

      4.4   Lender's reasonable determination that the proposed purchaser
            possesses satisfactory recent experience in the ownership and
            operation of properties comparable to the Properties;

      4.5   the execution and delivery to Lender of such documents and
            instruments as Lender shall reasonably require, in form and content
            reasonably satisfactory to Lender, including, without limitation,
            (i) an assumption agreement under which the purchaser assumes all
            obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Note and the
            other Loan Documents and agrees to periodically pay such new or
            additional Impounds to Lender as Lender may reasonably require, and
            (ii) a consent to the Transfer by any existing guarantor and a
            reaffirmation of such guarantor's obligations and liabilities under
            any guaranty made in connection with the Loan or a new guaranty
            executed by a new guarantor reasonably satisfactory to Lender;

      4.6   if required by Lender, delivery to Lender of evidence of title
            insurance reasonably satisfactory to Lender insuring Lender that the
            liens of the Mortgages and the priority thereof will not be impaired
            or affected by reason of such Transfer of the Properties;

            transfer, shall be in full compliance with the representations and

            Property;

      5.6   reimbursement to Lender of any and all costs and expenses paid or
            incurred by Lender in connection with such Affiliate Transfer,

      assumption by the Affiliate of all such obligations and liabilities and
      the satisfaction of all other conditions precedent to an Affiliate
      Transfer in accordance with the provisions of this Section. In addition to
      the Affiliate Transfers permitted above, Lender's consent shall not be
      required for the normal day to day trading of shares of MHC in the public
      securities market and such transactions shall not constitute an Affiliate
      Transfer hereunder.

      written notice to Lender specifying the date of Borrower's intended
      substitution ("Substitution Date"), which date shall be a scheduled
      payment date, Borrower may elect to cause Lender to release one or more of
      the Properties from the lien of the Mortgage encumbering such Property,
      provided that simultaneously with such release, Borrower shall execute and
      deliver to Lender, as security for the Loan, a mortgage, deed of trust or
      deed to secure debt, as applicable ("Replacement Mortgage"), encumbering a
      manufactured housing community property ("Replacement Property"), in
      substantially the same form as the Mortgage to be released, such other
      documents as Lender may reasonably require for the purpose of granting
      Lender a first priority, perfected lien on and security interest in such
      Replacement Property and all related rents, personal property, reserves
      and escrows on the same terms and conditions as the liens and security
      interests granted to Lender in such Property on the Effective Date, and
      such other modifications and amendments to the Loan Documents as may be
      necessitated due to the substitution of the Replacement Property for the
      Property that will be released (all of the foregoing, together with the
      Replacement Mortgage, the "Replacement Documents").

            a.    no Default shall have occurred and be continuing and no event
                  has occurred which, with the giving of notice or the passage
                  of time, or both, would constitute a Default;

            b.    Borrower shall not, over the life of the Loan, be entitled to
                  replace Properties having, in the aggregate, an Allocated Loan

                  Wakefield, or such other third-party real estate professional
                  that is approved by the Rating Agencies, indicating that the
                  Loan-to-Value Ratio as of the date of such release, obtained
                  by using the "as-is" value of the proposed Replacement
                  Property set forth in such appraisal together with the "as-is"
                  value of the Remaining Properties as of the date of such
                  proposed release if new appraisals are required by Lender for
                  the Remaining Properties, or as of the Disbursement Date if
                  new appraisals are not required by Lender, is at least equal
                  to the Loan-to-Value Ratio existing on the Disbursement Date
                  which is sixty-four percent (64%);

                  SI Group, or such other consulting engineer as is approved by
                  the Rating Agencies, stating that the Replacement Property
                  complies with all applicable building laws and does not
                  require performance of deferred maintenance, or if remedial
                  steps are required to effect such compliance or such deferred
                  maintenance, identifying such steps and projecting the cost
                  thereof, which may not exceed $10,000, and in which case
                  Borrower shall be required to deposit with Lender an amount
                  equal to one hundred fifty percent (150%) of such projected
                  costs, which shall be deemed Impounds to be released
                  substantially in accordance with the provisions contained in
                  Section 3 of Exhibit A to this Note;

                  with the Net Operating Income of the Remaining Properties, as
                  of the time of such release shall be at least equal to the
                  Debt Service Coverage Ratio existing on the Disbursement Date

                  Person shall deliver certifications and evidence to such
                  effect and such other certifications as Lender shall
                  reasonably require to assure itself that the substitution does
                  not constitute a fraudulent conveyance on the part of any
                  Person (assuming such Person was not solvent at the time of
                  substitution);

            i.    Borrower shall comply with such other terms and conditions as

                  proposed release of such Property and substitution of the

                  withdrawal or qualification of the respective ratings in
                  effect immediately prior to such release and substitution for
                  any securities issued in connection with the securitization
                  which are then outstanding;

                  (f) All additions and accretions to the property described
above;

                  (g) All licenses, authorizations, certificates, variances,
consents, approvals and other permits now or hereafter pertaining to the Land
and all estate, right, title and interest of Mortgagor in, to, under or derived
from all tradenames or business names relating to the Land or the present or
future development, construction, operation or use of the Land; and


                                     Page 2
<PAGE>
            (h) All proceeds of any of the foregoing.

All of the property described above is hereinafter collectively defined as the
"Property". The listing of specific rights or property shall not be interpreted
as a limitation of general terms.

                        ARTICLE II. OBLIGATIONS SECURED

            2.1 OBLIGATIONS SECURED. Mortgagor makes the foregoing grant and
assignment for the purpose of securing the following obligations ("Secured
Obligations"):

            (a) Full and punctual payment to Mortgagee of all sums at any time
owing under the Note;

            (b) Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations of
Mortgagor under this Mortgage, including, without limitation, indemnification
obligations and advances made to protect the Property;

            (c) Payment and performance of all additional covenants and
obligations of Borrower and Mortgagor under the Loan Documents;

            (d) Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations, if
any, which any rider attached as an exhibit to this Mortgage recites are secured
hereby;

            (e) Payment and performance of all future advances and other
obligations that the then record owner of all or part of the Property may agree
to pay and/or perform (whether as principal, surety or guarantor) for the
benefit of Mortgagee, when the obligation is evidenced by a writing which
recites that it is secured by this Mortgage;

            (f) All interest and charges on all obligations secured hereby
including, without limitation, prepayment charges, late charges and loan fees;
and

            (g) All modifications, extensions and renewals of any of the
obligations secured hereby, however evidenced, including, without limitation:
(i) modifications of the required principal payment dates or interest payment
dates or both, as the case may be, deferring or accelerating payment dates
wholly or partly; and (ii) modifications, extensions or renewals at a different
rate of interest whether or not any such modification, extension or renewal is
evidenced by a new or additional promissory note or notes.

            2.2 FUTURE ADVANCES. This Mortgage is given to secure not only the
Secured Obligations, but also such future advances, whether such advances are
obligatory or are to be made at the option of Mortgagee or the holder hereof, or
otherwise as are made within twenty years from the date hereof, to the same
extent as if such future advances were made on the date of the execution of this
Mortgage. The total amount of Secured Obligations that may be so secured by this
Mortgage may be increased or decreased from time to time, but the total unpaid
balance so secured at any one time shall not exceed twice the face amount of the
Note, plus interest thereon, and any disbursements made under this Mortgage for
the payment of impositions, taxes, assessments, levies, insurance, or otherwise
with interest on such disbursements as provided for


                                     Page 3
<PAGE>
herein, plus any increases in the principal balance as the result of negative
amortization or deferred interest, if any. It is agreed that any additional sum
or sums advanced by Mortgagee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be equally
secured with and have the same priority as the original Secured Obligations and
shall be subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions of this
Mortgage, whether or not such additional loans or advances are evidenced by
other promissory notes or other guaranties of Mortgagor and whether or not
identified by a recital that it or they are secured by this Mortgage. It is
further agreed that any additional promissory note or guaranty or promissory
notes or guaranties executed and delivered pursuant to this paragraph shall
automatically be deemed to be included in the term "Note" wherever it appears in
the context of this Mortgage. Without the prior written consent of Mortgagee,
which Mortgagee may grant or withhold in its sole discretion, Mortgagor shall
not file for record any notice limiting the maximum principal amount that may be
secured by this Mortgage to a sum less than the maximum principal amount set
forth in this paragraph.

            2.3 OBLIGATIONS. The term "obligations" is used herein in its
broadest and most comprehensive sense and shall be deemed to include, without
limitation, all interest and charges, prepayment charges, late charges and loan
fees at any time accruing or assessed on any of the Secured Obligations.

            2.4 MATURITY DATE. The maturity date of the Note is September 1,
2011.

            2.5 INCORPORATION. All terms and conditions of the documents which
evidence any of the Secured Obligations are incorporated herein by this
reference. All persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Property shall
be deemed to have notice of the terms of the Secured Obligations and to have
notice that the rate of interest on one or more Secured Obligations may vary
from time to time.

              ARTICLE III. ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

            3.1 ASSIGNMENT. Mortgagor irrevocably assigns to Mortgagee all of
Mortgagor's right, title and interest in, to and under: (a) all present and
future leases of the Property or any portion thereof, all licenses and
agreements relating to the management, leasing or operation of the Property or
any portion thereof, and all other agreements of any kind relating to the use or
occupancy of the Property or any portion thereof, whether such leases, licenses
and agreements are now existing or entered into after the date hereof
("Leases"); and (b) the rents, issues, deposits and profits of the Property,
including, without limitation, all amounts payable and all rights and benefits
accruing to Mortgagor under the Leases ("Payments"). The term "Leases" shall
also include all guarantees of and security for the tenants' performance
thereunder, and all amendments, extensions, renewals or modifications thereto
which are permitted hereunder. This is a present and absolute assignment, not an
assignment for security purposes only, and Mortgagee's right to the Leases and
Payments is not contingent upon, and may be exercised without possession of, the
Property.

            3.2 GRANT OF LICENSE. Notwithstanding the terms contained in Section
3.1, Mortgagee confers upon Mortgagor a revocable license ("License") to collect
and retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the occurrence of
a Default (as hereinafter defined). Upon a Default, the License shall be
automatically revoked and Mortgagee may collect


                                     Page 4
<PAGE>
and apply the Payments pursuant to the terms hereof without notice and without
taking possession of the Property. Upon Mortgagor's cure of the Default,
Mortgagee shall re-confer upon Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and
retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the occurrence of a
Default. All Payments thereafter collected by Mortgagor shall be held by
Mortgagor as trustee under a constructive trust for the benefit of Mortgagee.
Mortgagor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the tenants under the
Leases, upon notice of a Default from Mortgagee, to rely upon and comply with
any notice or demand by Mortgagee for the payment to Mortgagee of any rental or
other sums which may at any time become due under the Leases, or for the
performance of any of the tenants' undertakings under the Leases, and the
tenants shall have no right or duty to inquire as to whether any Default has
actually occurred or is then existing. Mortgagor hereby relieves the tenants
from any liability to Mortgagor by reason of relying upon and complying with any
such notice or demand by Mortgagee. Mortgagee may apply, in its sole discretion,
any Payments so collected by Mortgagee against any Secured Obligation or any
other obligation of Borrower, Mortgagor or any other person or entity, under any
document or instrument related to or executed in connection with the Loan
Documents, whether existing on the date hereof or hereafter arising. Collection
of any Payments by Mortgagee shall not cure or waive any Default or notice of
Default or invalidate any acts done pursuant to such notice.

            3.3 EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT. The foregoing irrevocable assignment shall
not cause Mortgagee to be: (a) a mortgagee in possession; (b) responsible or
liable for the control, care, management or repair of the Property or for
performing any of the terms, agreements, undertakings, obligations,
representations, warranties, covenants and conditions of the Leases; (c)
responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property by the tenants
under any of the Leases or by any other parties; for any dangerous or defective
condition of the Property; or for any negligence in the management, upkeep,
repair or control of the Property resulting in loss or injury or death to any
tenant, licensee, employee, invitee or other person; or (d) responsible for or
impose upon Mortgagee any duty to produce rents or profits. Mortgagee shall not
directly or indirectly be liable to Mortgagor or any other person as a
consequence of: (e) the exercise of or failure to exercise any of the rights,
remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee hereunder; or (f) the failure or refusal
of Mortgagee to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of
Mortgagor arising under the Leases.

            3.4 COVENANTS.

            (a) ALL LEASES. Mortgagor shall, at Mortgagor's sole cost and
expense:

            (i) perform all obligations of the landlord under the Leases and use
reasonable efforts to enforce performance by the tenants of all obligations of
the tenants under the Leases;

            (ii) use reasonable efforts to keep the Property leased at all times
to tenants whom Mortgagor reasonably and in good faith believes are creditworthy
at rents not less than the fair market rental value (including, but not limited
to, free or discounted rents to the extent the market so requires);

            (iii) promptly upon Mortgagee's request, deliver to Mortgagee a copy
of each requested Lease and all amendments thereto and waivers thereof; and


                                     Page 5
<PAGE>
            (iv) promptly upon Mortgagee's request, execute and record any
additional assignments of landlord's interest under any Lease to Mortgagee and
specific subordinations of any Lease to this Mortgage, in form and substance
satisfactory to Mortgagee.

Unless consented to in writing by Mortgagee or otherwise permitted under any
other provision of the Loan Documents, Mortgagor shall not:

            (v) grant any tenant under any Lease any option, right of first
refusal or other right to purchase all or any portion of the Property under any
circumstances;

            (vi) grant any tenant under any Lease any right to prepay rent more
than 1 month in advance;

            (vii) except upon Mortgagee's request, execute any assignment of
landlord's interest in any Lease; or

            (viii) collect rent or other sums due under any Lease in advance,
other than to collect rent 1 month in advance of the time when it becomes due.

Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this Section shall
be null and void.

Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee any sums received by Mortgagor in
consideration of any termination, modification or amendment of any Lease or any
release or discharge of any tenant under any Lease from any obligation
thereunder and any such sums received by Mortgagor shall be held in trust by
Mortgagor for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Default
exists, the portion of any such sum received by Mortgagor with respect to any
Lease which is less than $50,000 shall be payable to Mortgagor. All such sums
received by Mortgagee with respect to any Lease shall be deemed "Impounds" (as
defined in Section 6.12) and shall be deposited by Mortgagee into a pledged
account in accordance with Section 6.12. If no Default exists, Mortgagee shall
release such Impounds to Mortgagor from time to time as necessary to pay or
reimburse Mortgagor for such tenant improvements, brokerage commissions and
other leasing costs as may be required to re-tenant the affected space;
provided, however, Mortgagee shall have received and approved each of the
following for each tenant for which such costs were incurred; (1) Mortgagor's
written request for such release, including the name of the tenant, the location
and net rentable area of the space and a description and cost breakdown of the
tenant improvements or other leasing costs covered by the request; (2)
Mortgagor's certification that any tenant improvements have been completed
lien-free and in a workmanlike manner; (3) a fully executed Lease, or extension
or renewal of the current Lease; (4) an estoppel certificate executed by the
tenant including its acknowledgement that all tenant improvements have been
satisfactorily completed; and (5) such other information with respect to such
costs as Mortgagee may require. Following the re-tenanting of all affected space
(including, without limitation, the completion of all tenant improvements), and
provided no Default exists, Mortgagee shall release any remaining such Impounds
relating to the affected space to Mortgagor. Mortgagor shall construct all
tenant improvements in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

            (b) MAJOR LEASES. Mortgagor shall, at Mortgagor's sole cost and
expense, give Mortgagee prompt written notice of any material default by
landlord or tenant under any


                                     Page 6
<PAGE>
Major Lease (as defined below). Unless consented to in writing by Mortgagee or
otherwise permitted under any other provision of the Loan Documents, Mortgagor
shall not:

            (i) enter into any Major Lease which (aa) is not on fair market
terms (which terms may include free or discounted rent to the extent the market
so requires); (bb) does not contain a provision requiring the tenant to execute
and deliver to the landlord an estoppel certificate in form and substance
satisfactory to the landlord promptly upon the landlord's request; or (cc)
allows the tenant to assign or sublet the premises without the landlord's
consent;

            (ii) materially reduce any rent or other sums due from the tenant
under any Major Lease;

            (iii) terminate or materially modify or amend any Major Lease; or

            (iv) release or discharge the tenant or any guarantor under any
Major Lease from any material obligation thereunder.

Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this Section shall
be null and void.

"Major Lease", as used herein, shall mean any Lease, which is, at any time: (1)
a Lease of more than 20% of the total rentable area of the Property, as
reasonably determined by Mortgagee; or (2) a Lease which generates a gross base
monthly rent exceeding 20% of the total gross base monthly rent generated by all
Leases (excluding all Leases under which the tenant is then in default), as
reasonably determined by Mortgagee. Mortgagor's obligations with respect to
Major Leases shall be governed by the provisions of Section 3.4(a) as well as by
the provisions of this Section.

            (c) FAILURE TO DENY REQUEST Mortgagee's failure to deny any written
request by Mortgagor for Mortgagee's consent under the provisions of Sections
3.4(a) or 3.4(b) within 10 Business Days after Mortgagee's receipt of such
request (and all documents and information reasonably related thereto) shall be
deemed to constitute Mortgagee's consent to such request.

            3.5 RIGHT OF SUBORDINATION. Mortgagee may at any time and from time
to time by specific written instrument intended for the purpose unilaterally
subordinate the lien of this Mortgage to any Lease, without joinder or consent
of, or notice to, Mortgagor, any tenant or any other person. Notice is hereby
given to each tenant under a Lease of such right to subordinate. No
subordination referred to in this Section shall constitute a subordination to
any lien or other encumbrance, whenever arising, or improve the right of any
junior lienholder. Nothing herein shall be construed as subordinating this
Mortgage to any Lease.

               ARTICLE IV. SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

            4.1 SECURITY INTEREST. Mortgagor grants and assigns to Mortgagee a
security interest to secure payment and performance of all of the Secured
Obligations, in all of Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to the
following described personal property in which Mortgagor now or at any time
hereafter has any interest ("Collateral"):


                                     Page 7
<PAGE>
      All goods, building and other materials, supplies, work in process,
      equipment, machinery, fixtures, furniture, furnishings, signs and other
      personal property, wherever situated, which are or are to be incorporated
      into, used in connection with or appropriated for use on the Property; all
      rents, issues, deposits and profits of the Property (to the extent, if
      any, they are not subject to the Absolute Assignment of Rents and Leases);
      all inventory, accounts, cash receipts, deposit accounts, impounds,
      accounts receivable, contract rights, general intangibles, software,
      chattel paper, instruments, documents, promissory notes, drafts, letters
      of credit, letter of credit rights, supporting obligations, insurance
      policies, insurance and condemnation awards and proceeds, any other rights
      to the payment of money, trade names, trademarks and service marks arising
      from or related to the Property or any business now or hereafter conducted
      thereon by Mortgagor; all permits, consents, approvals, licenses,
      authorizations and other rights granted by, given by or obtained from, any
      governmental entity with respect to the Property; all deposits or other
      security now or hereafter made with or given to utility companies by
      Mortgagor with respect to the Property; all advance payments of insurance
      premiums made by Mortgagor with respect to the Property; all plans,
      drawings and specifications relating to the Property; all loan funds held
      by Mortgagee, whether or not disbursed; all funds deposited with Mortgagee
      pursuant to any Loan Document, all reserves, deferred payments, deposits,
      accounts, refunds, cost savings and payments of any kind related to the
      Property or any portion thereof, including, without limitation, all
      "Impounds" as defined herein; together with all replacements and proceeds
      of, and additions and accessions to, any of the foregoing, and all books,
      records and files relating to any of the foregoing.

            As to all of the above described personal property which is or which
hereafter becomes a "fixture" under the Florida Uniform Commercial Code (the
"UCC"), this Mortgage constitutes a fixture filing under Florida Statutes
Section 679.313 and 679.402, as amended and recodified from time to time, this
Mortgage shall constitute a fixture filing recorded in the real estate records.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be deemed to create any lien
or interest in favor of Mortgagee under this Mortgage in any such Collateral
which is not a fixture, and the purpose of this Article IV is to create a
fixture filing under Florida Statutes Section 679.313 and 679.402, as amended or
recodified from time to time.

            4.2 COVENANTS. Mortgagor agrees: (a) to execute and deliver such
documents as Mortgagee reasonably deems necessary to create, perfect and
continue the security interests contemplated hereby; (b) not to change its name,
and, as applicable, its chief executive offices, its principal residence or the
jurisdiction in which it is organized without giving Mortgagee at least 30 days'
prior written notice thereof; and (c) to cooperate with Mortgagee in perfecting
all security interests granted herein and in obtaining such agreements from
third parties as Mortgagee deems necessary, proper or convenient in connection
with the preservation, perfection or enforcement of any of Mortgagee's rights
hereunder.

            4.3 RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE. In addition to Mortgagee's rights as a
"Secured Party" under the UCC, Mortgagee may, but shall not be obligated to, at
any time without notice and at the expense of Mortgagor: (a) give notice to any
person of Mortgagee's rights hereunder and enforce such rights at law or in
equity; (b) insure, protect, defend and


                                     Page 8
<PAGE>
preserve the Collateral or any rights or interests of Mortgagee therein; and (c)
inspect the Collateral during normal business hours upon reasonable prior
written notice, provided, however, that such notice shall not be required in the
event of an emergency. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall Mortgagee be
deemed to have accepted any property other than cash in satisfaction of any
obligation of Mortgagor to Mortgagee unless Mortgagee shall make an express
written election of said remedy under the UCC or other applicable law.

            4.4 ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE UPON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence
of a Default, then in addition to all of Mortgagee's rights as a "Secured Party"
under the UCC or otherwise at law:

            (a) DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL. Mortgagee may: (i) upon written
notice, require Mortgagor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to
Mortgagee at a place reasonably designated by Mortgagee; (ii) without prior
notice (to the extent permitted by law), enter upon the Property or other place
where the Collateral may be located and take possession of, collect, sell,
lease, license and otherwise dispose of the Collateral, and store the same at
locations acceptable to Mortgagee at Mortgagor's expense; or (iii) sell, assign
and deliver the Collateral at any place or in any lawful manner and bid and
become purchaser at any such sales; and

            (b) OTHER RIGHTS. Mortgagee may, for the account of Mortgagor and at
Mortgagor's expense: (i) operate, use, consume, sell, lease, license or
otherwise dispose of the Collateral as Mortgagee reasonably deems appropriate
for the purpose of performing any or all of the Secured Obligations; (ii) enter
into any agreement, compromise or settlement including insurance claims, which
Mortgagee may reasonably deem desirable or proper with respect to the
Collateral; and (iii) endorse and deliver evidences of title for, and receive,
enforce and collect by legal action or otherwise, all indebtedness and
obligations now or hereafter owing to Mortgagor in connection with or on account
of the Collateral.

            Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the
Collateral in accordance with Mortgagee's rights and remedies as heretofore
provided is a disposition thereof in a commercially reasonable manner and that 5
Business Days prior notice of such disposition is commercially reasonable
notice. Mortgagee shall have no obligation to process or prepare the Collateral
for sale or other disposition. In disposing of the Collateral, Mortgagee may
disclaim all warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment and the like. Any
proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral may be applied by
Mortgagee first to the reasonable expenses incurred by Mortgagee in connection
therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, and then to the payment of the Secured Obligations, in such order
of application as Mortgagee may from time to time elect.

            4.5 POWER OF ATTORNEY. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints
Mortgagee as Mortgagor's attorney-in-fact (such agency being coupled with an
interest), and as such attorney-in-fact, Mortgagee may, without the obligation
to do so, in Mortgagee's name or in the name of Mortgagor, prepare, execute,
file and record financing statements, continuation statements, applications for
registration and like papers necessary to create, perfect or preserve any of
Mortgagee's security interests and rights in or to the Collateral, and upon a
Default, take


                                     Page 9
<PAGE>
any other action required of Mortgagor; provided, however, that Mortgagee as
such attorney-in-fact shall be accountable only for such funds as are actually
received by Mortgagee.

                   ARTICLE V. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            5.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Mortgagor represents and
warrants to Mortgagee that, to Mortgagor's current actual knowledge after
reasonable investigation and inquiry, the following statements are true and
correct as of the Effective Date:

            (a) LEGAL STATUS. Mortgagor and Borrower are duly organized and
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state(s) in which Mortgagor
and Borrower are organized. Mortgagor and Borrower are qualified or licensed to
do business in all jurisdictions in which such qualification or licensing is
required.

            (b) PERMITS. Mortgagor and Borrower possess all permits, franchises
and licenses and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and
fictitious names, if any, necessary to enable Mortgagor and Borrower to conduct
the business(es) in which Mortgagor and Borrower are now engaged in compliance
with applicable law.

            (c) AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The execution and delivery of the
Loan Documents have been duly authorized and the Loan Documents constitute valid
and binding obligations of Mortgagor, Borrower or the party which executed the
same, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights, or by the application of rules
of equity.

            (d) VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance by Mortgagor
and Borrower of each of the Loan Documents do not violate any provision of any
law or regulation, or result in any breach or default under any contract,
obligation, indenture or other instrument to which Mortgagor or Borrower is a
party or by which Mortgagor or Borrower is bound.

            (e) LITIGATION. There are no pending or threatened actions, claims,
investigations, suits or proceedings before any governmental authority, court or
administrative agency which may adversely affect the financial condition or
operations of Mortgagor or Borrower other than those previously disclosed in
writing by Mortgagor or Borrower to Mortgagee.

            (f) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements of Mortgagor and
Borrower, of each general partner (if Mortgagor or Borrower is a partnership),
of each member (if Mortgagor or Borrower is a limited liability company) and of
each guarantor, if any, previously delivered by Mortgagor or Borrower to
Mortgagee: (i) are materially complete and correct; (ii) present fairly the
financial condition of such party; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance
with the same accounting standard used by Mortgagor or Borrower to prepare the
financial statements delivered to and approved by Mortgagee in connection with
the making of the Loan, or other accounting standards approved by Mortgagee.
Since the date of such financial statements, there has been no material adverse
change in such financial condition, nor have any assets or properties reflected
on such financial statements been sold, transferred, assigned, mortgaged,


                                    Page 10
<PAGE>
pledged or encumbered except as previously disclosed in writing by Mortgagor or
Borrower to Mortgagee and approved in writing by Mortgagee.

            (g) REPORTS. All reports, documents, instruments and information
delivered to Mortgagee in connection with the Loan: (i) are correct in all
material respects and sufficiently complete to give Mortgagee accurate knowledge
of their subject matter; and (ii) do not contain any misrepresentation of a
material fact or omission of a material fact which omission makes the provided
information misleading.

            (h) INCOME TAXES. There are no material pending assessments or
adjustments of Mortgagor's or Borrower's income tax payable with respect to any
year.

            (i) SUBORDINATION. There is no agreement or instrument to which
Borrower is a party or by which Borrower is bound that would require the
subordination in right of payment of any of Borrower's obligations under the
Note to an obligation owed to another party.

            (J) TITLE. Mortgagor lawfully holds and possesses fee simple title
to the Property, without limitation on the right to encumber same. This Mortgage
is a first lien on the Property prior and superior to all other liens and
encumbrances on the Property except: (i) liens for real estate taxes and
assessments not yet due and payable; (ii) senior exceptions previously approved
by Mortgagee and shown in the title insurance policy insuring the lien of this
Mortgage; and (iii) other matters, if any, previously disclosed to Mortgagee by
Mortgagor in a writing specifically referring to this representation and
warranty.

            (k) MECHANICS' LIENS. There are no mechanics' or similar liens or
claims which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are
outstanding that under law could give rise to any such liens) affecting the
Property which are or may be prior to or equal to the lien of this Mortgage,
other than those (if any) previously approved by Mortgagee and shown in the
title insurance policy insuring the lien of this Mortgage.

            (l) ENCROACHMENTS. Except as shown in the survey, if any, previously
delivered to Mortgagee, none of the buildings or other improvements which were
included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the Property lies
outside of the boundaries or building restriction lines of the Property and no
buildings or other improvements located on adjoining properties encroach upon
the Property.

            (m) LEASES. All existing Leases are in full force and effect and are
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. Except as disclosed on a

holder at termination or cancellation. Mortgagor shall maintain all required
insurance throughout the term of the Loan and while any liabilities of Borrower
or Mortgagor to Mortgagee under any of the Loan Documents remain outstanding at
Mortgagor's expense, with companies, and in substance and form satisfactory to
Mortgagee. Mortgagee, by reason of accepting, rejecting, approving or obtaining
insurance shall not incur any liability for: (c) the existence, nonexistence,
form or legal sufficiency of any insurance; (d) the solvency of any insurer; or
(e) the payment of claims.

            6.11 INSURANCE AND CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS.

            (a) ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. Mortgagor absolutely and irrevocably

affecting all or any part of, or any interest in, the Property; (ii) all other
claims and awards for damages to or decrease in value of all or any part of, or
any interest in, the Property; (iii) all proceeds of any insurance policies
payable by reason of loss sustained to all or any part of the Property; and (iv)
all interest which may accrue on any of the foregoing. Mortgagor shall give
Mortgagee prompt written notice of the occurrence of any casualty affecting, or
the institution of any proceedings for eminent domain or for the condemnation
of, the Property or any portion thereof. So long as no Default has occurred and
is continuing at the time, Mortgagor shall have the right to adjust, compromise
and settle any Claim of $100,000 or less without the consent of Mortgagee,
provided, however, all awards, proceeds and other sums described herein shall
continue to be payable to Mortgagee. Mortgagee may commence, appear in, defend
or prosecute any Claim exceeding $100,000, and may adjust, compromise and settle
all Claims (except for Claims which Mortgagor may settle as provided herein),
but shall not be responsible


                                    Page 20
<PAGE>
for any failure to commence, appear in, defend, prosecute or collect any such
Claim regardless of the cause of the failure. All awards, proceeds and other
sums described herein shall be payable to Mortgagee.

            (b) APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; NO DEFAULT. So long as no Default has
occurred and is continuing at the time of Mortgagee's receipt of the proceeds of
the Claims ("Proceeds") and no Default occurs thereafter, Mortgagee shall apply
the Proceeds in the following order of priority: First, to Mortgagee's expenses
in settling, prosecuting or defending the Claims; Second, to the repair or
restoration of the Property; and Third, to Mortgagor if the repair or
restoration of the Property has been completed, but to the Secured Obligations
in any order without suspending, extending or reducing any obligation of
Mortgagor to make installment payments if the repair or restoration of the
Property has not been completed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagee shall
have no obligation to make any Proceeds available for the repair or restoration
of the Property unless and until all the following conditions have been
satisfied: (i) delivery to Mortgagee of the Proceeds plus any additional amount
which is needed to pay all costs of the repair or restoration (including,
without limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent during the
repair period); (ii) establishment of an arrangement for lien releases and
disbursement of funds acceptable to Mortgagee; (iii) delivery to Mortgagee in
form and content acceptable to Mortgagee of all of the following: (aa) plans and
specifications for the work; (bb) a contract for the work, signed by a
contractor acceptable to Mortgagee; (cc) a cost breakdown for the work; (dd) if
reasonably required by Mortgagee, a payment and performance bond for the work;
(ee) evidence of the continuation of substantially all Leases unless consented
to in writing by Mortgagee; (ff) evidence that, upon completion of the work, the
size, capacity, value, and income coverage ratios for the Property will be at
least as great as those which existed immediately before the damage or
condemnation occurred; and (gg) evidence of the satisfaction of any additional
conditions that Mortgagee may reasonably establish to protect Mortgagee's
security. Mortgagor acknowledges that the specific conditions described above
are reasonable.

            (c) APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; DEFAULT. If a Default has occurred and
is continuing at the time of Mortgagee's receipt of the Proceeds or if a Default
occurs at any time thereafter, Mortgagee may, at Mortgagee's absolute discretion
and regardless of any impairment of security or lack of impairment of security,
but subject to applicable law governing use of the Proceeds, if any, apply all
or any of the Proceeds to Mortgagee's expenses in settling, prosecuting or
defending the Claims and then apply the balance to the Secured Obligations in
any order without suspending, extending or reducing any obligation of Mortgagor
to make installment payments, and may release all or any part of the Proceeds to
Mortgagor upon any conditions Mortgagee chooses.

            6.12 IMPOUNDS.

            (a) POST-DEFAULT IMPOUNDS. If required by Mortgagee at any time
after a Default occurs (and regardless of whether such Default is thereafter
cured), Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee such amounts ("Post-Default
Impounds") on such dates (determined by Mortgagee as provided below) as will be
sufficient to pay any or all "Costs" (as defined below) specified by Mortgagee.
Mortgagee in its reasonable discretion shall estimate the amount of such Costs
that will be payable or required during any period selected by Mortgagee not
exceeding 1 year and shall determine the fractional portion thereof that
Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee


                                    Page 21
<PAGE>
on each date specified by Mortgagee during such period. If the Post-Default
Impounds paid by Mortgagor are not sufficient to pay the related Costs,
Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee upon demand an amount equal to the
deficiency. All Post-Default Impounds shall be payable by Mortgagor in addition
to (but without duplication of) any other Impounds (as defined below).

            (b) ALL IMPOUNDS. Post-Default Impounds and any other impounds that
may be payable by Borrower under the Note are collectively called "Impounds".
All Impounds shall be deposited into one or more segregated or commingled
accounts maintained by Mortgagee or its servicing agent. Except as otherwise
provided in the Note, such account(s) shall not bear interest. Mortgagee shall
not be a trustee, special depository or other fiduciary for Mortgagor with
respect to such account, and the existence of such account shall not limit
Mortgagee's rights under this Mortgage, any other agreement or any provision of
law. If no Default exists, Mortgagee shall apply all Impounds to the payment of
the related Costs, or in Mortgagee's sole discretion may release any or all
Impounds to Mortgagor for application to and payment of such Costs. If a Default
exists, Mortgagee may apply any or all Impounds to any Secured Obligation and/or
to cure such Default, whereupon Mortgagor shall restore all Impounds so applied
and cure all Defaults not cured by such application. The obligations of
Mortgagor hereunder shall not be diminished by deposits of Impounds made by
Mortgagor, except to the extent that such obligations have actually been met by
application of such Impounds. Upon any assignment of this Mortgage, Mortgagee
may assign all Impounds in its possession to Mortgagee's assignee, whereupon
Mortgagee shall be released from all liability with respect to such Impounds.
Within 60 days following full repayment of the Secured Obligations (other than
as a consequence of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure) or at such
earlier time as Mortgagee may elect, Mortgagee shall pay to Mortgagor all
Impounds in its possession, and no other party shall have any right or claim
thereto. "Costs" means (i) all taxes and other liabilities payable by Mortgagor
under Section 6.9, (ii) all insurance premiums payable by Mortgagor under
Section 6.10, (iii) all other costs and expenses for which Impounds are required
under the Note, and/or (iv) all other amounts that will be required to preserve
the value of the Property. Mortgagor shall deliver to Mortgagee, promptly upon
receipt, all bills for Costs for which Mortgagee has required Post-Default
Impounds.

            6.13 DEFENSE AND NOTICE OF LOSSES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS. Mortgagor
shall protect, preserve and defend the Property and title to and right of
possession of the Property, the security of this Mortgage and the rights and
powers of Mortgagee hereunder at Mortgagor's sole expense against all adverse
claims, whether the claim: (a) is against a possessory or non-possessory
interest; (b) arose prior or subsequent to the Effective Date; or (c) is senior
or junior to Mortgagor's or Mortgagee's rights. Mortgagor shall give Mortgagee
prompt notice in writing of the assertion of any claim, of the filing of any
action or proceeding, of the occurrence of any damage to the Property and of any
condemnation offer or action.

            6.14 RIGHT OF INSPECTION. Mortgagee and its independent contractors,
agents and employees may enter the Property from time to time at any reasonable
time upon reasonable prior notice to Mortgagor (except that such notice shall
not be required in the event of an emergency) for the purpose of inspecting the
Property and ascertaining Mortgagor's compliance with the terms of this
Mortgage. Mortgagee shall use reasonable efforts to assure that Mortgagee's
entry upon and inspection of the Property shall not materially and unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of Mortgagor or Mortgagor's tenants on
the Property.

            6.15 PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN MORTGAGOR.
Mortgagor acknowledges that Mortgagee has relied upon the principals of
Mortgagor and Borrower and their experience in owning and operating properties
similar to the Property in connection with the closing of the Loan. Accordingly,
except with the prior written consent of Mortgagee or as otherwise expressly
permitted in the Note, Mortgagor shall not cause or permit any sale, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment, encumbrance or other transfer,
conveyance or disposition, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of
law ("Transfer") of all or any part of, or all or any direct or indirect
interest in, the Property or the Collateral (except for equipment and inventory
in the ordinary course of its business), or cause or permit a Transfer of any
direct or indirect interest (whether general partnership interest, stock,
non-managing member limited liability company interest, trust, or otherwise) in
Mortgagor or Borrower. In the event of any Transfer that is not expressly
permitted in the Note and is without the prior written consent of Mortgagee,
Mortgagee shall have the absolute right at its option, without prior demand or
notice, to declare all of the Secured Obligations immediately due and payable,
except to the extent prohibited by law, and pursue its rights and remedies under
Section 7.3 herein. Mortgagor agrees to pay any prepayment fee as set forth in
the Note in the event the Secured Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the
terms of this Section. Consent to one such Transfer shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of the right to require the consent to future or successive Transfers.
Except for Transfers expressly permitted under the Note, Mortgagee's consent to
any Transfer may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in Mortgagee's sole and
absolute discretion.

            6.16 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.17 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.18 EXCULPATION. Mortgagee shall not directly or indirectly be
liable to Mortgagor or any other person as a consequence of: (a) the exercise of
the rights, remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee in this Mortgage; (b) the
failure or refusal of Mortgagee to perform or discharge any obligation or
liability of Mortgagor under any agreement related to the Property or under this
Mortgage; or (c) any loss sustained by Mortgagor or any third party resulting
from Mortgagee's failure to lease the Property after a Default or from any other
act or omission of Mortgagee in managing the Property after a Default unless the
loss is caused by the willful misconduct and bad faith of Mortgagee and no such
liability shall be asserted or enforced against Mortgagee, all such liability
being expressly waived and released by Mortgagor.

            6.19 INDEMNITY. Without in any way limiting any other indemnity
contained in this Mortgage, Mortgagor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Mortgagee Group (as hereinafter defined) from and against any
claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising
out of: (a) the making of the Loan, except for violations of banking laws or
regulations by the Mortgagee Group; (b) this Mortgage; (c) the execution of this
Mortgage or the performance of any act required or permitted hereunder or by
law; (d) any failure of Mortgagor to perform Mortgagor's obligations under this
Mortgage or the other Loan Documents; (e) any alleged obligation or undertaking
on the Mortgagee Group's part to perform or discharge any of the
representations, warranties, conditions, covenants or other obligations
contained in any other document related to the Property; (f) any act or omission
by Mortgagor or any contractor, agent, employee or representative of Mortgagor
with respect to the Property; or (g) any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
liability directly or indirectly arising out of: (i) the use, generation,
manufacture, storage, treatment, release, threatened release, discharge,
disposal, transportation or presence of any Hazardous Materials which are found
in, on, under or about the Property (including, without limitation, underground
contamination); or (ii) the breach of any covenant, representation or warranty
of Mortgagor under Section 6.2 above. The foregoing to the contrary
notwithstanding, this indemnity shall not include any claim, loss, damage, cost,
expense or liability directly or indirectly arising out of the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of any member of the Mortgagee Group, or any claim, loss,
damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the Mortgagee Group arising from
any act or incident on the Property occurring after the full reconveyance and
release of the lien of this Mortgage on the Property, or with respect to the
matters set forth in clause (g) above, any claim, loss,


                                    Page 23
<PAGE>
damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the Mortgagee Group resulting
from the introduction and initial release of Hazardous Materials on the Property
occurring after the transfer of title to the Property at a foreclosure sale
under this Mortgage, either pursuant to judicial decree or the power of sale, or
by deed in lieu of such foreclosure. This indemnity shall include, without
limitation: (aa) all consequential damages (including, without limitation, any
third party tort claims or governmental claims, fines or penalties against the
Mortgagee Group); (bb) all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees
(including, without limitation, expert witness fees) paid or incurred by the
Mortgagee Group; and (cc) the costs, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, of
any investigation, repair, cleanup or detoxification of the Property which is
required by any governmental entity or is otherwise necessary to render the
Property in compliance with all laws and regulations pertaining to Hazardous
Materials. "Mortgagee Group", as used herein, shall mean (1) Mortgagee
(including, without limitation, any participant in the Loan), (2) any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with Mortgagee, (3) the
directors, officers, employees and agents of Mortgagee and such other entities,
and (4) the successors, heirs and assigns of the entities and persons described
in foregoing clauses (1) through (3). Mortgagor shall pay immediately upon
Mortgagee's demand any amounts owing under this indemnity together with interest
from the date the indebtedness arises until paid at the rate of interest
applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified therein. Mortgagor
agrees to use legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Mortgagee Group in any
action or proceeding arising under this indemnity. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE SATISFACTION AND RELEASE OF THIS MORTGAGE, BUT
MORTGAGOR'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS INDEMNITY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
THE SECTION IN THE NOTE ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

            6.20 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.21 RELEASES, EXTENSIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY.
Without notice to or the consent, approval or agreement of any persons or
entities having any interest at any time in the Property or in any manner
obligated under the Secured Obligations ("Interested Parties"), Mortgagee may,
from time to time: (a) fully or partially release any person or entity from
liability for the payment or performance of any Secured Obligation; (b) extend
the maturity of any Secured Obligation; (c) make any agreement with Borrower
increasing the amount or otherwise altering the terms of any Secured Obligation;
(d) accept additional security for any Secured Obligation; or (e) release all or
any portion of the Property, Collateral and other security for any Secured
Obligation. None of the foregoing actions shall release or reduce the personal
liability of any of said Interested Parties, or release or impair the priority
of the lien of this Mortgage upon the Property.

            6.22 SALE OR PARTICIPATION OF LOAN. Mortgagor agrees that Mortgagee
may at any time sell, assign, participate or securitize all or any portion of
Mortgagee's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, and that any such
sale, assignment, participation or securitization may be to one or more
financial institutions or other entities, to private investors, and/or into the
public securities market, in Mortgagee's sole discretion. Mortgagor further
agrees that Mortgagee may disseminate to any such actual or potential
purchaser(s), assignee(s) or participant(s) all documents and financial and
other information heretofore or hereafter provided to or known to Mortgagee with
respect to: (a) the Property and its operation; and/or (b) any party connected
with the Loan (including, without limitation, Mortgagor, any partner or member
of Mortgagor, any constituent partner or member of Mortgagor, any guarantor and
any nonborrower mortgagor). In the event of any such sale, assignment,
participation or securitization, Mortgagee and the other parties to the same
shall share in the rights and obligations of Mortgagee set forth in the Loan
Documents as and to the extent they shall agree among themselves. In connection
with any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization, Mortgagor
further agrees that the Loan Documents shall be sufficient evidence of the
obligations of Mortgagor to each purchaser, assignee or participant, and
Mortgagor shall, within 15 days after request by Mortgagee, (x) deliver an
estoppel certificate verifying for the benefit of Mortgagee and any other party
designated by Mortgagee the status and the terms and provisions of the Loan in
form and substance acceptable to Mortgagee, (y) provide any information, legal
opinions or documents regarding Mortgagor, Guarantor (as defined in the Loan
Documents), the Property and any tenants of the Property as Mortgagee or
Mortgagee's rating agencies may reasonably request, and (z) enter into such
amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents or the organizational
documents of Mortgagor as may be reasonably required in order to facilitate any
such sale, assignment, participation or securitization without impairing
Mortgagor's rights or increasing Mortgagor's obligations. The indemnity
obligations of Mortgagor under the Loan Documents shall also apply with respect
to any purchaser, assignee or participant.

            6.23 RELEASE. Upon payment in full of the Secured Obligations, and
satisfaction of all of the covenants, warranties, undertakings and agreements
made in this Mortgage and in the other Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, repayment in full of all principal, interest and other amounts owing
under the Note) are kept and performed, and all obligations, if any, of
Mortgagee for further advances have been terminated, then, and in that event
only, Mortgagee shall release, without warranty, the Property or that portion
thereof then held hereunder. The recitals of any matters or facts in any release
executed hereunder shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. To the
extent permitted by law, the release may describe the grantee as "the person or
persons legally entitled thereto". Mortgagee shall have no duty to determine the
rights of persons claiming to be rightful grantees of any release. When the
Property has been fully released, the last such release shall operate as a
reassignment of all future rents, issues and profits of the Property to the
person or persons legally entitled thereto.

            6.24 SUBROGATION. Mortgagee shall be subrogated to the lien of all
encumbrances, whether released of record or not, paid in whole or in part by
Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage or by the proceeds of any loan secured by
this Mortgage.

            6.25 MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. Without the prior written consent of
Mortgagee, Mortgagor shall not terminate, modify, amend or enter into any
agreement providing for the management, leasing or operation of the Property.
Mortgagor represents,


                                    Page 25
<PAGE>
warrants and covenants that any existing management agreement includes, and any
future management agreement entered into by Mortgagor shall include, a provision
which provides that the management agreement is automatically terminated upon
the transfer of the Property by Mortgagor, either by sale, foreclosure, deed in
lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise, to Mortgagee or any other purchaser of the
Property. Upon a Default under the Loan Documents or a default under any
management agreement then in effect, which default is not cured within any
applicable grace or cure period, Mortgagee shall have the right to terminate, or
to direct Mortgagor to terminate, such management agreement upon thirty (30)
days' written notice and to retain, or to direct Mortgagor to retain, a new
management agent approved by Mortgagee.

                              ARTICLE VII. DEFAULT

            7.1 DEFAULT. For all purposes hereof, "Default" shall mean either an
"Optional Default" (as defined below) or an "Automatic Default" (as defined
below).

            (a) OPTIONAL DEFAULT. An "Optional Default" shall occur, at
Mortgagee's option, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

            (i) MONETARY. Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to (aa) pay when due
any sums payable under the Loan Documents which by their express terms require
immediate payment without any grace period or sums which are payable on the
Maturity Date, or (bb) pay within 5 days when due any other sums payable under
the Note, this Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, any monthly payment due under the Note.

            (ii) FAILURE TO PERFORM. Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to
observe, perform or discharge any of Borrower's or Mortgagor's obligations,
covenants, conditions or agreements, other than Borrower's or Mortgagor's
payment obligations, under the Note, this Mortgage or any of the other Loan
Documents, and (aa) such failure shall remain uncured for 30 days after written
notice thereof shall have been given to Borrower or Mortgagor, as the case may
be, by Mortgagee or (bb) if such failure is of such a nature that it cannot be
cured within such 30 day period, Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to commence to
cure such failure within such 30 day period or shall fail to diligently
prosecute such curative action thereafter.

            (iii) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Any representation, warranty,
certificate or other statement (financial or otherwise) made or furnished by or
on behalf of Borrower, Mortgagor, or a guarantor, if any, to Mortgagee or in
connection with any of the Loan Documents, or as an inducement to Mortgagee to
make the Loan, shall be false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading in any
material respect when made or furnished.

            (iv) CONDEMNATION; ATTACHMENT. The condemnation, seizure or
appropriation of any material portion (as reasonably determined by Mortgagee) of
the Property; or the sequestration or attachment of, or levy or execution upon
any of the Property, the Collateral or any other collateral provided by Borrower
or Mortgagor under any of the Loan Documents, or any material portion of the
other assets of Borrower or Mortgagor, which sequestration, attachment, levy or
execution is not released or dismissed within 45 days after its occurrence; or
the sale of any assets affected by any of the foregoing.


                                    Page 26
<PAGE>
            (v) UNINSURED CASUALTY. The occurrence of an uninsured casualty with
respect to any material portion (as reasonably determined by Mortgagee) of the
Property unless: (aa) no other Default has occurred and is continuing at the
time of such casualty or occurs thereafter; (bb) Mortgagor promptly notifies
Mortgagee of the occurrence of such casualty; and (cc) not more than 45 days
after the occurrence of such casualty, Mortgagor delivers to Mortgagee
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient, in Mortgagee's reasonable
opinion, to pay all costs of the repair or restoration (including, without
limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent during the repair
period). So long as no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of
Mortgagee's receipt of such funds and no Default occurs thereafter, Mortgagee
shall make such funds available for the repair or restoration of the Property.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagee shall have no obligation to make any
funds available for repair or restoration of the Property unless and until all
the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the second sentence of
Section 6.11(b) of this Mortgage have been satisfied. Mortgagor acknowledges
that the specific conditions described above are reasonable.

            (vi) ADVERSE FINANCIAL CHANGE. Any material adverse change in the
financial condition of Borrower or any general partner or managing member of
Borrower, any guarantor, or any other person or entity from the condition shown
on the financial statement(s) submitted to Mortgagee and relied upon by
Mortgagee in making the Loan, and which change Mortgagee reasonably determines
will have a material adverse effect on (aa) the business, operations or
condition of the Property; or (bb) the ability of Borrower or Mortgagor to pay
or perform Borrower's or Mortgagor's obligations in accordance with the terms of
the Note, this Mortgage, and the other Loan Documents.

            (b) AUTOMATIC DEFAULT. An "Automatic Default" shall occur
automatically upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

            (i) VOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY, DISSOLUTION. (aa) Borrower's
filing a petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended
or recodified ("Bankruptcy Code"), or under any other present or future state or
federal law regarding bankruptcy, reorganization or other relief to debtors
(collectively, "Debtor Relief Law"); or (bb) Borrower's filing any pleading in
any involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law
which admits the jurisdiction of a court to regulate Borrower or the Property or
the petition's material allegations regarding Borrower's insolvency; or (cc)
Borrower's making a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (dd)
Borrower's applying for, or the appointment of, a receiver, trustee, custodian
or liquidator of Borrower or any of its property; or (ee) the filing by Borrower
of a petition seeking the liquidation or dissolution of Borrower or the
commencement of any other procedure to liquidate or dissolve Borrower.

            (ii) INVOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY. Borrower's failure to effect a full
dismissal of any involuntary petition under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor
Relief Law that is filed against Borrower or in any way restrains or limits
Borrower or Mortgagee regarding the Loan or the Property, prior to the earlier
of the entry of any order granting relief sought in the involuntary petition or
45 days after the date of filing of the petition.

            (iii) PARTNERS, GUARANTORS. The occurrence of an event specified in
clauses (i) or (ii) as to Mortgagor, any general partner or managing member of
Borrower or Mortgagor,


                                    Page 27
<PAGE>
or any guarantor or other person or entity in any manner obligated to Mortgagee
under the Loan Documents.

            7.2 ACCELERATION. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Default,
Mortgagee may, at its option, declare all sums owing to Mortgagee under the Note
and the other Loan Documents immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence of
an Automatic Default, all sums owing to Mortgagee under the Note and the other
Loan Documents shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

            7.3 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. In addition to the rights and remedies in
Section 7.2 above, at any time after a Default, Mortgagee shall have all of the
following rights and remedies:

            (a) ENTRY ON PROPERTY. With or without notice, and without releasing
Mortgagor from any Secured Obligation, and without becoming a mortgagee in
possession, to enter upon the Property from time to time and to do such acts and
things as Mortgagee deems necessary or desirable in order to inspect,
investigate, assess and protect the security hereof or to cure any Default,
including, without limitation: (i) to take and possess all documents, books,
records, papers and accounts of Mortgagor, Borrower or the then owner of the
Property which relate to the Property; (ii) to make, terminate, enforce or
modify leases of the Property upon such terms and conditions as Mortgagee deems
proper; (iii) to make repairs, alterations and improvements to the Property
necessary, in Mortgagee's reasonable judgment, to protect or enhance the
security hereof; (iv) to appear in and defend any action or proceeding
purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of Mortgagee
hereunder; (v) to pay, purchase, contest or compromise any encumbrance, charge,
lien or claim of lien which, in the sole judgment of Mortgagee, is or may be
senior in priority hereto, the judgment of Mortgagee being conclusive as between
the parties hereto; (vi) to obtain insurance; (vii) to pay any premiums or
charges with respect to insurance required to be carried hereunder; (viii) to
obtain a court order to enforce Mortgagee's right to enter and inspect the
Property for Hazardous Materials, in which regard the decision of Mortgagee as
to whether there exists a release or threatened release of Hazardous Materials
onto the Property shall be deemed reasonable and conclusive as between the
parties hereto; (ix) to have a receiver appointed pursuant to applicable law to
enforce Mortgagee's rights to enter and inspect the Property for Hazardous
Materials; and/or (x) to employ legal counsel, accountants, engineers,
consultants, contractors and other appropriate persons to assist them;

            (b) APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER. With or without notice or hearing, to
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for and obtain appointment of a
receiver, trustee, liquidator or conservator of the Property, for any purpose,
including, without limitation, to enforce Mortgagee's rights to collect Payments
and to enter on and inspect the Property for Hazardous Materials, as a matter of
strict right and without regard to: (i) the adequacy of the security for the
repayment of the Secured Obligations; (ii) the existence of a declaration that
the Secured Obligations are immediately due and payable; (iii) the filing of a
notice of default; or (iv) the solvency of Mortgagor, Borrower or any guarantor
or other person or entity in any manner obligated to Mortgagee under the Loan
Documents;

<PAGE>
            (c) INJUNCTION. To commence and maintain an action or actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to obtain specific enforcement of the covenants
of Mortgagor hereunder, and Mortgagor agrees that such covenants shall be
specifically enforceable by injunction or any other appropriate equitable remedy
and that for the purposes of any suit brought under this subparagraph, Mortgagor
waives the defense of laches and any applicable statute of limitations;

            (d) FORECLOSURE. Immediately commence an action to foreclose this
Mortgage or to specifically enforce its provisions or any of the indebtedness
secured hereby pursuant to the statutes in such case made and provided and sell
the Property or cause the Property to be sold in accordance with the
requirements and procedures provided by said statutes in a single parcel or in
several parcels at the option of Mortgagee.

            (i) In the event foreclosure proceedings are filed by Mortgagee, all
expenses incident to such proceeding, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs, shall be paid by Mortgagor and secured by this
Mortgage and by all of the other Loan Documents securing all or any part of the
indebtedness evidenced by the Note. The secured indebtedness and all other
obligations secured by this Mortgage, including, without limitation, interest at
the Default Rate (as defined in the Note), any prepayment charge, fee or premium
required to be paid under the Note in order to prepay principal (to the extent
permitted by applicable law), reasonable attorneys' fees and any other amounts
due and unpaid to Mortgagee under the Loan Documents, may be bid by Mortgagee in
the event of a foreclosure sale hereunder. In the event of a judicial sale
pursuant to a foreclosure decree, it is understood and agreed that Mortgagee or
its assigns may become the purchaser of the Property or any part thereof.

            (ii) Mortgagee may, by following the procedures and satisfying the
requirements prescribed by applicable law, foreclose on only a portion of the
Property and, in such event, said foreclosure shall not affect the lien of this
Mortgage on the remaining portion of the Property foreclosed.

            Upon sale of the Property at any foreclosure, Mortgagee may credit
bid (as determined by Mortgagee in its sole and absolute discretion) all or any
portion of the Secured Obligations. In determining such credit bid, Mortgagee
may, but is not obligated to, take into account all or any of the following: (i)
appraisals of the Property as such appraisals may be discounted or adjusted by
Mortgagee in its sole and absolute underwriting discretion; (ii) expenses and
costs incurred by Mortgagee with respect to the Property prior to foreclosure;
(iii) expenses and costs which Mortgagee anticipates will be incurred with
respect to the Property after foreclosure, but prior to resale, including,
without limitation, costs of structural reports and other due diligence, costs
to carry the Property prior to resale, costs of resale (e.g. commissions,
attorneys' fees, and taxes), costs of any Hazardous Materials clean-up and
monitoring, costs of deferred maintenance, repair, refurbishment and retrofit,
costs of defending or settling litigation affecting the Property, and lost
opportunity costs (if any), including the time value of money during any
anticipated holding period by Mortgagee; (iv) declining trends in real property
values generally and with respect to properties similar to the Property; (v)
anticipated discounts upon resale of the Property as a distressed or foreclosed
property; (vi) the fact of additional collateral (if any), for the Secured
Obligations; and (vii) such other factors or matters that Mortgagee (in its sole
and absolute discretion) deems appropriate. In regard to the above, Mortgagor
acknowledges and


                                    Page 29
<PAGE>
agrees that: (viii) Mortgagee is not required to use any or all of the foregoing
factors to determine the amount of its credit bid; (ix) this paragraph does not
impose upon Mortgagee any additional obligations that are not imposed by law at
the time the credit bid is made; (x) the amount of Mortgagee's credit bid need
not have any relation to any loan-to-value ratios specified in the Loan
Documents or previously discussed between Mortgagor and Mortgagee; and (xi)
Mortgagee's credit bid may be (at Mortgagee's sole and absolute discretion)
higher or lower than any appraised value of the Property;

            (e) MULTIPLE FORECLOSURES. To resort to and realize upon the
security hereunder and any other security now or later held by Mortgagee
concurrently or successively and in one or several consolidated or independent
judicial actions and to apply the proceeds received upon the Secured Obligations
all in such order and manner as Mortgagee determines in its sole discretion;

            (f) RIGHTS TO COLLATERAL. To exercise all rights Mortgagee may have
with respect to the Collateral under this Mortgage, the UCC or otherwise at law;
and

            (g) OTHER RIGHTS. To exercise such other rights as Mortgagee may
have at law or in equity or pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents.

            In connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Mortgagee may elect
to treat any of the Property which consists of a right in action or which is
property that can be severed from the Property (including, without limitation,
any improvements forming a part thereof) without causing structural damage
thereto as if the same were personal property or a fixture, as the case may be,
and dispose of the same in accordance with applicable law, separate and apart
from the sale of the Property. Any sale of Collateral hereunder shall be
conducted in any manner permitted by the UCC.

            7.4 APPLICATION OF FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, proceeds of any sale under this Mortgage shall be applied to
the extent funds are so available to the following items in such order as
Mortgagee in its discretion may determine:

            (a) To payment of the costs, expenses and fees of taking possession
of the Property, and of holding, operating, maintaining, using, leasing,
repairing, improving, marketing and selling the same and of otherwise enforcing
Mortgagee's right and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
including, but not limited to, receivers' fees, court costs, reasonable
attorneys', accountants', appraisers', managers', and other professional fees,
title charges and transfer taxes.

            (b) To payment of all sums expended by Mortgagee under the terms of
any of the Loan Documents and not yet repaid, together with interest on such
sums at the Default Rate.

            (c) To payment of the secured indebtedness and all other obligations
secured by this Mortgage, including, without limitation, interest at the Default
Rate and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any prepayment fee, charge
or premium required to be paid under the Note in order to prepay principal, in
any order that Mortgagee chooses in its sole discretion.

            7.5 WAIVER OF MARSHALING RIGHTS. Mortgagor, for itself and for all
parties claiming through or under Mortgagor, and for all parties who may acquire
a lien on or interest in the Property, hereby waives all rights to have the
Property and/or any other property, including, without limitation, the
Collateral, which is now or later may be security for any Secured Obligation,
marshaled upon any foreclosure of this Mortgage or on a foreclosure of any other
security for any of the Secured Obligations.

            7.6 NO CURE OR WAIVER. Neither Mortgagee's nor any receiver's entry
upon and taking possession of all or any part of the Property, nor any
collection of rents, issues, profits, insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds
or damages, other security or proceeds of other security, or other sums, nor the
application of any collected sum to any Secured Obligation, nor the exercise of
any other right or remedy by Mortgagee or any receiver shall cure or waive any
Default or notice of default under this Mortgage, or nullify the effect of any
notice of default or sale (unless all Secured Obligations then due have been
paid or performed and Mortgagor has cured all other Defaults hereunder), or
impair the status of the security, or prejudice Mortgagee in the exercise of any
right or remedy, or be construed as an affirmation by Mortgagee of any tenancy,
lease or option or a subordination of the lien of this Mortgage.

            7.7 PAYMENT OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Mortgagor agrees
to pay to Mortgagee immediately and upon demand all costs and expenses incurred
by Mortgagee in the enforcement of the terms and conditions of this Mortgage
(including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees, whether
incurred in litigation or not) with interest from the date of expenditure until
said sums have been paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal
balance of the Note as specified therein.

            7.8 POWER TO FILE NOTICES AND CURE DEFAULTS. Mortgagor hereby
irrevocably appoints Mortgagee and its successors and assigns, as its
attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, to perform any
obligation of Mortgagor hereunder upon the occurrence of an event, act or
omission which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a
Default, provided, however, that: (a) Mortgagee as such attorney-in-fact shall
only be accountable for such funds as are actually received by Mortgagee; and
(b) Mortgagee shall not be liable to Mortgagor or any other person or entity for
any failure to act under this Section.

            7.9 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights and remedies of Mortgagee
provided hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to all rights and remedies
provided by applicable law (including specifically that of foreclosure of this
instrument as though it were a mortgage) or in any other agreements between
Mortgagor and Mortgagee. Mortgagee may enforce any one or more remedies or
rights hereunder successively or concurrently.

                     ARTICLE VIII. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

            8.1 ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. The Loan Documents contain or incorporate
by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters
contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations. The Loan Documents
grant further rights to Mortgagee and contain further agreements and affirmative
and negative covenants by Mortgagor which apply to this Mortgage and to the
Property and such further rights and agreements are incorporated herein by this
reference. THE OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF MORTGAGOR UNDER THIS


                                    Page 31
<PAGE>
MORTGAGE AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE
SECTION IN THE NOTE ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

            8.2 NON-WAIVER. By accepting payment of any amount secured hereby
after its due date or late performance of any other Secured Obligation,
Mortgagee shall not waive its right against any person obligated directly or
indirectly hereunder or on any Secured Obligation, either to require prompt
payment or performance when due of all other sums and obligations so secured or
to declare default for failure to make such prompt payment or performance. No
exercise of any right or remedy by Mortgagee hereunder shall constitute a waiver
of any other right or remedy herein contained or provided by law. No failure by
Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy hereunder arising upon any Default
shall be construed to prejudice Mortgagee's rights or remedies upon the
occurrence of any other or subsequent Default. No delay by Mortgagee in
exercising any such right or remedy shall be construed to preclude Mortgagee
from the exercise thereof at any time while that Default is continuing. No
notice to nor demand on Mortgagor shall of itself entitle Mortgagor to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

            8.3 CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND EXPENSES. Wherever Mortgagee's consent,
approval, acceptance or satisfaction is required under any provision of this
Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, such consent, approval, acceptance
or satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by
Mortgagee unless such provision expressly so provides. Wherever costs or
expenses are required to be paid under any provision of this Mortgage or any of
the other Loan Documents, such costs or expenses shall be reasonable.

            8.4 PERMITTED CONTESTS. After prior written notice to Mortgagee,
Mortgagor may contest, by appropriate legal or other proceedings conducted in
good faith and with due diligence, the amount, validity or application, in whole
or in part, of any lien, levy, tax or assessment, or any lien of any laborer,
mechanic, materialman, supplier or vendor, or the application to Mortgagor or
the Property of any law or the validity thereof, the assertion or imposition of
which, or the failure to pay when due, would constitute a Default; provided that
(a) Mortgagor pursues the contest diligently, in a manner which Mortgagee
determines is not prejudicial to Mortgagee, and does not impair the lien of this
Mortgage; (b) the Property, or any part hereof or estate or interest therein,
shall not be in any danger of being sold, forfeited or lost by reason of such
proceedings; (c) in the case of the contest of any law or other legal
requirement, Mortgagee shall not be in any danger of any civil or criminal
liability; and (d) if required by Mortgagee, Mortgagor deposits with Mortgagee
any funds or other forms of assurance (including a bond or letter of credit)
satisfactory to Mortgagee to protect Mortgagee from the consequences of the
contest being unsuccessful. Mortgagor's right to contest pursuant to the terms
of this provision shall in no way relieve Mortgagor or Borrower of its
obligations under the Loan or to make payments to Mortgagee as and when due.

            8.5 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Mortgagor shall, upon demand by Mortgagee,
execute, acknowledge (if appropriate) and deliver any and all documents and
instruments and do or cause to be done all further acts reasonably necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the provisions hereof.



                                    Page 32
<PAGE>
            8.6 ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action, suit or proceeding is
commenced between Mortgagor and Mortgagee regarding their respective rights and
obligations under this Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to damages or other
relief, costs and expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs
(including, without limitation, expert witness fees). As used herein the term
"prevailing party" shall mean the party which obtains the principal relief it
has sought, whether by compromise settlement or judgment. If the party which
commenced or instituted the action, suit or proceeding shall dismiss or
discontinue it without the concurrence of the other party, such other party
shall be deemed the prevailing party.

            8.7 MORTGAGOR AND MORTGAGEE DEFINED. The term "Mortgagor" includes
both the original Mortgagor and any subsequent owner or owners of any of the
Property, and the term "Mortgagee" includes the original Mortgagee and any
future owner or holder, including assignees, pledgees and participants, of the
Note or any interest therein.

            8.8 DISCLAIMERS.

            (a) RELATIONSHIP. The relationship of Mortgagor and Mortgagee under
this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents is, and shall at all times remain,
solely that of borrower and lender; and Mortgagee neither undertakes nor assumes
any responsibility or duty to Mortgagor or to any third party with respect to
the Property. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents: (i) Mortgagee is not, and shall not be construed to be, a
partner, joint venturer, member, alter ego, manager, controlling person or other
business associate or participant of any kind of Mortgagor, and Mortgagee does
not intend to ever assume such status; (ii) Mortgagee's activities in connection
with this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents shall not be "outside the scope
of activities of a lender of money" within the meaning of California Civil Code
Section 3434, as amended or recodified from time to time, and Mortgagee does not
intend to ever assume any responsibility to any person for the quality,
suitability, safety or condition of the Property; and (iii) Mortgagee shall not
be deemed responsible for or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions
of Mortgagor.

            (b) NO LIABILITY. Mortgagee shall not be directly or indirectly
liable or responsible for any loss, claim, cause of action, liability,
indebtedness, damage or injury of any kind or character to any person or
property arising from any construction on, or occupancy or use of, the Property,
whether caused by or arising from: (i) any defect in any building, structure,
grading, fill, landscaping or other improvements thereon or in any on-site or
off-site improvement or other facility therein or thereon; (ii) any act or
omission of Mortgagor or any of Mortgagor's agents, employees, independent
contractors, licensees or invitees; (iii) any accident in or on the Property or
any fire, flood or other casualty or hazard thereon; (iv) the failure of
Mortgagor or any of Mortgagor's licensees, employees, invitees, agents,
independent contractors or other representatives to maintain the Property in a
safe condition; or (v) any nuisance made or suffered on any part of the
Property.

            8.9 SEVERABILITY. If any term of this Mortgage, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances, shall, to any extent, be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Mortgage, or the application of such term
to persons or circumstances other than those as to


                                    Page 33
<PAGE>
which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each
term of this Mortgage shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

            8.10 RELATIONSHIP OF ARTICLES. The rights, remedies and interests of
Mortgagee under the Mortgage established by Article 1 and the security agreement
established by Article 4 are independent and cumulative, and there shall be no
merger of any lien created by the Mortgage with any security interest created by
the security agreement. Mortgagee may elect to exercise or enforce any of its
rights, remedies or interests under either or both the Mortgage or the security
agreement as Mortgagee may from time to time deem appropriate. The absolute
assignment of rents and leases established by Article 3 is similarly independent
of and separate from the Mortgage and the security agreement.

            8.11 MERGER. No merger shall occur as a result of Mortgagee's
acquiring any other estate in, or any other lien on, the Property unless
Mortgagee consents to a merger in writing.

            8.12 OBLIGATIONS OF MORTGAGOR, JOINT AND SEVERAL. If more than one
person has executed this Mortgage as "Mortgagor", the obligations of all such
persons hereunder shall be joint and several.

            8.13 SEPARATE AND COMMUNITY PROPERTY. Any married person who
executes this Mortgage as a Mortgagor agrees that any money judgment which
Mortgagee obtains pursuant to the terms of this Mortgage or any other obligation
of that married person secured by this Mortgage may be collected by execution
upon any separate property or community property of that person.

            8.14 INTEGRATION; INTERPRETATION. The Loan Documents contain or
expressly incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with
respect to the matters contemplated therein and supersede all prior negotiations
or agreements, written or oral. The Loan Documents shall not be modified except
by written instrument executed by all parties. Any reference in any of the Loan
Documents to the Property or Collateral shall include all or any part of the
Property or Collateral. Any reference to the Loan Documents includes any
amendments, renewals or extensions now or hereafter approved by Mortgagee in
writing. When the identity of the parties or other circumstances make it
appropriate, the masculine gender includes the feminine and/or neuter, and the
singular number includes the plural.

            8.15 CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Note.

            8.16 SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST. The terms, covenants, and conditions
herein contained shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The foregoing sentence shall not
be construed to permit Mortgagor to assign the Loan except as otherwise
permitted under the Note or the other Loan Documents.

            8.17 GOVERNING LAW. This Mortgage was accepted by Mortgagee in the
state of California and the proceeds of the Note secured hereby were disbursed
from the state of California, which state the parties agree has a substantial
relationship to the parties and to the underlying transaction embodied hereby.
Accordingly, in all respects, including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, matters of construction, validity, enforceability and


                                    Page 34
<PAGE>
performance, this Mortgage, the Note and the other Loan Documents and the
obligations arising hereunder and thereunder shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the state of California applicable to contracts
made and performed in such state and any applicable law of the United States of
America, except that at all times the provisions for the creation, perfection
and enforcement of the liens and security interests created pursuant thereto and
pursuant to the other Loan Documents shall be governed by and construed
according to the law of the state where the Property is located. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Mortgagor hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim to
assert that the law of any jurisdiction other than California governs this
Mortgage, the Note and other Loan Documents.

            8.18 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Mortgagor irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of: (a) any state or federal court sitting in the state of
California over any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by Mortgagor against
Mortgagee, arising out of or relating to this Mortgage, the Note or the Loan;
(b) any state or federal court sitting in the state where the Property is
located or the state in which Mortgagor's principal place of business is located
over any suit, action or proceeding, brought by Mortgagee against Mortgagor,
arising out of or relating to this Mortgage, the Note or the Loan; and (c) any
state court sitting in the county of the state where the Property is located
over any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by Mortgagee to foreclose this
Mortgage or any action brought by Mortgagee to enforce its rights with respect
to the Collateral. Mortgagor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that Mortgagor may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such court and any
claim that any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

            8.19 EXHIBITS. Exhibit A is incorporated into this Mortgage by this
reference.

      CALCULATION OF DOCUMENTARY STAMP AND INTANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX

Exhibit B to MORTGAGE AND ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES AND SECURITY
AGREEMENT (AND FIXTURE FILING) ("Mortgage") between MHC STAGECOACH, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company, as "Mortgagor," and WELLS FARGO BANK,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as "Mortgagee."

      This Mortgage is part of an out-of-state loan transaction which only
partially secures the loan. This Mortgage encumbers the property described on
Exhibit A, and separate mortgages are being executed and delivered by Mortgagor
encumbering certain other property located in Florida and in other states (such
other property being further described on Exhibit C and being referred to as the
"Other Property"). The Florida collateral is located in Brevard, Volusia and
Manatee Counties, and three (3) separate mortgages (the Florida Mortgages")
encumbering three (3) properties are being executed and delivered by Mortgagor
for simultaneous recording in the various Florida counties described above. The
total indebtedness secured by this Mortgage equals $50,000,000.00, as evidenced
by one (1) promissory note in the aggregate original principal amount of
$50,000,000.00 (the "Note"). The Note was made, executed and delivered outside
the State of Florida. The value of the Florida property encumbered by the
Florida Mortgages equals $27,200,000.00. The aggregate value of all other
property securing the loan and located outside the State of Florida equals
$50,400,000.00. Thus, the total aggregate value of all property securing the
loan equals $77,600,000.00. The property encumbered by the Florida Mortgages and
located in Florida represents thirty-five (35%) percent [$27,200,000.00 /
$77,600,000.00] of the total value of all property securing the loan. In
accordance with Florida Statutes, Section 201.08, and Florida Administrative
Code, Rule 12B-4.053(32)(b), documentary stamp tax is computed based upon the
percentage of indebtedness which the value of the mortgaged property located in
Florida bears to the total value of all mortgaged property (which, in this case,
equals $17,500,000.00). Accordingly, documentary stamp tax in the amount of
$61,250.00 is due upon the recording of the Florida Mortgages in the Florida
counties listed above. Pursuant to Chapter 199, Florida Statutes, non-recurring
intangible personal property tax is computed and payable based upon that portion
of the indebtedness which bears the same relation as the value of the mortgaged
property located in Florida bears to the total value of all mortgaged property,
which, in this case, equals [$50,000,000.00 x ($27,200,000.00 /
$77,600,000.00)]. Thus, non-recurring intangible personal property tax in the
amount of $35,000.00 is due and payable upon recording of the Florida Mortgages
in the Florida counties listed above.

               ARTICLE 3. ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

3.1   ASSIGNMENT. Trustor irrevocably assigns to Beneficiary all of Trustor's
      right, title and interest in, to and under: (a) all present and future
      leases of the Property or any portion thereof, all licenses and agreements
      relating to the management, leasing or operation of the Property or any
      portion thereof, and all other agreements of any kind relating to the use
      or occupancy of the Property or any portion thereof, whether such leases,
      licenses and agreements are now existing or entered into after the date
      hereof ("Leases"); and (b) the rents, issues, deposits and profits of the
      Property, including, without limitation, all amounts payable and all
      rights and benefits accruing to Trustor under the Leases ("Payments"). The
      term "Leases" shall also include all guarantees of and security for the
      tenants' performance thereunder, and all amendments, extensions, renewals
      or modifications thereto which are permitted hereunder. This is a present
      and absolute assignment, not an assignment for security purposes only, and
      Beneficiary's right to the Leases and Payments is not contingent upon, and
      may be exercised without possession of, the Property.

3.2   GRANT OF LICENSE. Notwithstanding the terms contained in Section 3.1,
      Beneficiary confers upon Trustor a revocable license ("License") to
      collect and retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the
      occurrence of a Default (as hereinafter defined). Upon a Default, the
      License shall be automatically revoked and Beneficiary may collect and
      apply the Payments pursuant to the terms hereof without notice and without
      taking possession of the Property. All Payments thereafter collected by
      Trustor shall be held by Trustor as trustee under a constructive trust for
      the benefit of Beneficiary. Trustor hereby irrevocably authorizes and
      directs the tenants under the Leases, upon notice of a Default from
      Beneficiary, to rely upon and comply with any notice or demand by
      Beneficiary for the payment to Beneficiary of any rental or other sums
      which may at any time become due under the Leases, or for the performance
      of any of the tenants' undertakings under the Leases, and the tenants
      shall have no right or duty to inquire as to whether any Default has
      actually occurred or is then existing. Trustor hereby relieves the tenants
      from any liability to Trustor by reason of relying upon and complying with
      any such notice or demand by Beneficiary. Beneficiary may apply, in its
      sole discretion, any Payments so collected by Beneficiary against any
      Secured Obligation or any other obligation of Borrower, Trustor or any
      other person or entity, under any document or instrument related to or
      executed in connection with the Loan Documents, whether existing on the
      date hereof or hereafter arising. Collection of any Payments by
      Beneficiary shall not cure or waive any Default or notice of Default or
      invalidate any acts done pursuant to


                                       3
<PAGE>
      such notice. If and when no Default exists, Beneficiary shall re-confer
      the License upon Trustor until the occurrence of another Default.

3.3   EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT. The foregoing irrevocable assignment shall not cause
      Beneficiary to be: (a) a mortgagee in possession; (b) responsible or
      liable for the control, care, management or repair of the Property or for
      performing any of the terms, agreements, undertakings, obligations,
      representations, warranties, covenants and conditions of the Leases; (c)
      responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property by the
      tenants under any of the Leases or by any other parties; for any dangerous
      or defective condition of the Property; or for any negligence in the
      management, upkeep, repair or control of the Property resulting in loss or
      injury or death to any tenant, licensee, employee, invitee or other
      person; or (d) responsible for or impose upon Beneficiary any duty to
      produce rents or profits. Beneficiary shall not directly or indirectly be
      liable to Trustor or any other person as a consequence of: (e) the
      exercise or failure to exercise any of the rights, remedies or powers
      granted to Beneficiary hereunder; or (f) the failure or refusal of
      Beneficiary to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of
      Trustor arising under the Leases.

3.4   COVENANTS.

      a.    ALL LEASES. Trustor shall, at Trustor's sole cost and expense:

            (i)   perform all obligations of the landlord under the Leases and
                  use reasonable efforts to enforce performance by the tenants
                  of all obligations of the tenants under the Leases;

            (ii)  use reasonable efforts to keep the Property leased at all
                  times to tenants which Trustor reasonably and in good faith
                  believes are creditworthy at rents not less than the fair
                  market rental value (including, but not limited to, free or
                  discounted rents to the extent the market so requires);

            (iii) promptly upon Beneficiary's request, deliver to Beneficiary a
                  copy of each requested Lease and all amendments thereto and
                  waivers thereof; and

            (iv)  promptly upon Beneficiary's request, execute and record any
                  additional assignments of landlord's interest under any Lease
                  to Beneficiary and specific subordinations of any Lease to
                  this Deed of Trust, in form and substance satisfactory to
                  Beneficiary.

            Unless consented to in writing by Beneficiary or otherwise permitted
            under any other provision of the Loan Documents, Trustor shall not:

            (v)   grant any tenant under any Lease any option, right of first
                  refusal or other right to purchase all or any portion of the
                  Property under any circumstances;

            (vi)  grant any tenant under any Lease any right to prepay rent more
                  than 1 month in advance;

            (vii) except upon Beneficiary's request, execute any assignment of
                  landlord's interest in any Lease; or

            (viii) collect rent or other sums due under any Lease in advance,
                  other than to collect rent 1 month in advance of the time when
                  it becomes due.

            Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this
            Section shall be null and void.

            Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary any sums received by Trustor
            in consideration of any termination, modification or amendment of
            any Lease or any release or discharge of any tenant under any Lease
            from any obligation thereunder and any such sums received by Trustor
            shall be held in trust by Trustor for such purpose. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, so long as no Default exists, the portion of any such
            sum received by Trustor with respect to any Lease which is less than
            $50,000 shall be payable to Trustor. All


                                       4
<PAGE>
            such sums received by Beneficiary with respect to any Lease shall be
            deemed "Impounds" (as defined in Section 6.12b) and shall be
            deposited by Beneficiary into a pledged account in accordance with
            Section 6.12b. If no Default exists, Beneficiary shall release such
            Impounds to Trustor from time to time as necessary to pay or
            reimburse Trustor for such tenant improvements, brokerage
            commissions and other leasing costs as may be required to re-tenant
            the affected space; provided, however, Beneficiary shall have
            received and approved each of the following for each tenant for
            which such costs were incurred; (1) Trustor's written request for
            such release, including the name of the tenant, the location and net
            rentable area of the space and a description and cost breakdown of
            the tenant improvements or other leasing costs covered by the
            request; (2) Trustor's certification that any tenant improvements
            have been completed lien-free and in a workmanlike manner; (3) a
            fully executed Lease, or extension or renewal of the current Lease;
            (4) an estoppel certificate executed by the tenant including its
            acknowledgement that all tenant improvements have been
            satisfactorily completed; and (5) such other information with
            respect to such costs as Beneficiary may require. Following the
            re-tenanting of all affected space (including, without limitation,
            the completion of all tenant improvements), and provided no Default
            exists, Beneficiary shall release any remaining such Impounds
            relating to the affected space to Trustor. Trustor shall construct
            all tenant improvements in a workmanlike manner and in accordance
            with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

      b.    MAJOR LEASES. Trustor shall, at Trustor's sole cost and expense,
            give Beneficiary prompt written notice of any material default by
            landlord or tenant under any Major Lease (as defined below). Unless
            consented to in writing by Beneficiary or otherwise permitted under
            any other provision of the Loan Documents, Trustor shall not:

            (i)   enter into any Major Lease which (aa) is not on fair market
                  terms (which terms may include free or discounted rent to the
                  extent the market so requires); (bb) does not contain a
                  provision requiring the tenant to execute and deliver to the
                  landlord an estoppel certificate in form and substance
                  satisfactory to the landlord promptly upon the landlord's
                  request; or (cc) allows the tenant to assign or sublet the
                  premises without the landlord's consent;

            (ii)  reduce any rent or other sums due from the tenant under any
                  Major Lease;

            (iii) terminate or materially modify or amend any Major Lease; or

            (iv)  release or discharge the tenant or any guarantor under any
                  Major Lease from any material obligation thereunder.

            Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this
            Section shall be null and void.

            "Major Lease", as used herein, shall mean any Lease, which is, at
            any time: (1) a Lease of more than 20% of the total rentable area of
            the Property, as reasonably determined by Beneficiary; or (2) a
            Lease which generates a gross base monthly rent exceeding 20% of the
            total gross base monthly rent generated by all Leases (excluding all
            Leases under which the tenant is then in default), as reasonably
            determined by Beneficiary. Trustor's obligations with respect to
            Major Leases shall be governed by the provisions of Section 3.4a as
            well as by the provisions of this Section.

      c.    FAILURE TO DENY REQUEST. Beneficiary's failure to deny any written
            request by Trustor for Beneficiary's consent under the provisions of
            Sections 3.4a or 3.4b within 10 Business Days after Beneficiary's
            receipt of such request (and all documents and information
            reasonably related thereto) shall be deemed to constitute
            Beneficiary's consent to such request.

3.5   RIGHT OF SUBORDINATION. Beneficiary may at any time and from time to time
      by specific written instrument intended for the purpose unilaterally
      subordinate the lien of this Deed of Trust to any Lease, without joinder
      or consent of, or notice to, Trustor, any tenant or any other person.
      Notice is hereby given to each tenant


                                       5
<PAGE>
      under a Lease of such right to subordinate. No subordination referred to
      in this Section shall constitute a subordination to any lien or other
      encumbrance, whenever arising, or improve the right of any junior
      lienholder. Nothing herein shall be construed as subordinating this Deed
      of Trust to any Lease.

                ARTICLE 4. SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

4.1   SECURITY INTEREST. Trustor grants and assigns to Beneficiary a security
      interest to secure payment and performance of all of the Secured
      Obligations, in all of Trustor's right, title and interest in and to the

      hereafter has any interest ("Collateral"):

            All goods, building and other materials, supplies, work in process,

            the payment of money, trade names, trademarks and service marks
            arising from or related to the Property or any business now or
            hereafter conducted thereon by Trustor; all permits, consents,
            approvals, licenses, authorizations and other rights granted by,
            given by or obtained from, any governmental entity with respect to
            the Property; all deposits or other security now or hereafter made
            with or given to utility companies by Trustor with respect to the
            Property; all advance payments of insurance premiums made by Trustor
            with respect to the Property; all plans, drawings and specifications
            relating to the Property; all loan funds held by Beneficiary,
            whether or not disbursed; all funds deposited with Beneficiary
            pursuant to any Loan Document, all reserves, deferred payments,
            deposits, accounts, refunds, cost savings and payments of any kind
            related to the Property or any portion thereof, including, without
            limitation, all "Impounds" as defined herein; together with all
            replacements and proceeds of, and additions and accessions to, any
            of the foregoing, and all books, records and files relating to any
            of the foregoing.

      As to all of the above described personal property which is or which
      hereafter becomes a "fixture" under applicable law, this Deed of Trust
      constitutes a fixture filing under the Colorado Uniform Commercial Code,
      as amended or recodified from time to time ("UCC").

4.2   COVENANTS. Trustor agrees: (a) to execute and deliver such documents as
      Beneficiary reasonably deems necessary to create, perfect and continue the
      security interests contemplated hereby; (b) not to change its name, and,
      as applicable, its chief executive offices, its principal residence or the
      jurisdiction in which it is organized without giving Beneficiary at least
      30 days' prior written notice thereof; and (c) to cooperate with
      Beneficiary in perfecting all security interests granted herein and in
      obtaining such agreements from third parties as Beneficiary deems
      necessary, proper or convenient in connection with the preservation,
      perfection or enforcement of any of Beneficiary's rights hereunder.

4.3   RIGHTS OF BENEFICIARY. In addition to Beneficiary's rights as a "Secured
      Party" under the UCC, Beneficiary may, but shall not be obligated to, at
      any time without notice and at the expense of Trustor: (a) give notice to
      any person of Beneficiary's rights hereunder and enforce such rights at
      law or in equity; (b) insure, protect, defend and preserve the Collateral
      or any rights or interests of Beneficiary therein; and (c) inspect the
      Collateral during normal business hours upon reasonable prior written
      notice, provided, however, that such notice shall not be required in the
      event of an emergency. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall
      Beneficiary be deemed to have accepted any property other than cash in
      satisfaction of any


                                       6
<PAGE>
      obligation of Trustor to Beneficiary unless Beneficiary shall make an
      express written election of said remedy under the UCC or other applicable
      law.

4.4   ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF BENEFICIARY UPON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of a
      Default, then in addition to all of Beneficiary's rights as a "Secured
      Party" under the UCC or otherwise at law:

      a.    DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL. Beneficiary may: (i) upon written notice,
            require Trustor to assemble any or all of the Collateral and make it
            available to Beneficiary at a place reasonably designated by
            Beneficiary; (ii) without prior notice (to the extent permitted by
            law), enter upon the Property or other place where any of the
            Collateral may be located and take possession of, collect, sell,
            lease, license and otherwise dispose of the Collateral, and store
            the same at locations acceptable to Beneficiary at Trustor's
            expense; (iii) sell, assign and deliver the Collateral at any place
            or in any lawful manner and bid and become purchaser at any such
            sales. In the event of a foreclosure sale, whether made by the
            Trustee under the terms hereof or under judgment of a court; (iv)
            the Collateral may, at the option of the Beneficiary, be sold as a
            whole; (v) it shall not be necessary that Beneficiary take
            possession of the Collateral prior to the time any sale is conducted
            nor shall it be necessary that said Collateral be present at the
            location of such sale; and (vi) Beneficiary may designate any one or
            more persons as agent to perform any act necessary to any sale held
            by Beneficiary, including the sending of notices and the conduct of
            the sale, but in the name and on behalf of Beneficiary; and

      b.    OTHER RIGHTS. Beneficiary may, for the account of Trustor and at
            Trustor's expense: (i) operate, use, consume, sell, lease, license
            or otherwise dispose of the Collateral as Beneficiary reasonably
            deems appropriate for the purpose of performing any or all of the
            Secured Obligations; (ii) enter into any agreement, compromise or
            settlement including insurance claims, which Beneficiary may
            reasonably deem desirable or proper with respect to the Collateral;
            and (iii) endorse and deliver evidences of title for, and receive,
            enforce and collect by legal action or otherwise, all indebtedness
            and obligations now or hereafter owing to Trustor in connection with
            or on account of the Collateral.

      It is hereby agreed that to the extent permitted by law, all of the
      Collateral is to be deemed and held to be a part of and affixed to the
      Property. The foregoing security interest shall also cover Trustor's
      leasehold interest in any of the foregoing Collateral which is leased by
      Trustor. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all of the foregoing Collateral
      shall be owned by Trustor and no leasing or installment sales or other
      financing in connection therewith shall be permitted without the prior
      written approval of Beneficiary. All of the Collateral shall be kept at
      the location of the Land.

      Beneficiary shall give Trustor at least 10 Business Days' prior written
      notice of the time and place of any public sale of such Collateral or of
      the time of or after which any private sale or any other intended
      disposition thereof is to be made, and if such notice is sent to Trustor,
      as the same is provided for the mailing of notices herein, it is hereby
      deemed that such notice shall be and is reasonable notice to Trustor. No
      such notice is necessary for any such Collateral which is perishable,
      threatens to decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily sold on
      a recognized market.

      Trustor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the Collateral in
      accordance with Beneficiary's rights and remedies as heretofore provided
      shall be deemed to have been a public sale thereof in a commercially
      reasonable manner if held contemporaneously with the sale under power of
      sale (nonjudicial foreclosure) as provided in Section 7.3(c)(ii) hereof
      upon giving the same notice with respect to the sale of the Collateral
      hereunder as is required under said Section 7.3(c)(ii). Beneficiary shall
      have no obligation to process or prepare the Collateral for sale or other
      disposition. In disposing of the Collateral, Beneficiary may disclaim all
      warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment and the like. Any
      proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral may be applied
      by Beneficiary first to the reasonable expenses incurred by Beneficiary in
      connection therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
      fees and disbursements, and then to the payment of the Secured
      Obligations, in such order of application as Beneficiary may from time to
      time elect.


                                       7

4.5   POWER OF ATTORNEY. Trustor hereby irrevocably appoints Beneficiary as
      Trustor's attorney-in-fact (such agency being coupled with an interest),
      and as such attorney-in-fact, Beneficiary may, without the obligation to
      do so, in Beneficiary's name or in the name of Trustor, prepare, execute,
      file and record financing statements, continuation statements,
      applications for registration and like papers necessary to create, perfect
      or preserve any of Beneficiary's security interests and rights in or to
      the Collateral, and upon a Default, take any other action required of
      Trustor; provided, however, that Beneficiary as such attorney-in-fact
      shall be accountable only for such funds as are actually received by
      Beneficiary.

                    ARTICLE 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

5.1   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Trustor represents and warrants to
      Beneficiary that, to Trustor's current actual knowledge after reasonable
      investigation and inquiry, the following statements are true and correct
      as of the Effective Date:

      a.    LEGAL STATUS. Trustor and Borrower are duly organized and existing
            and in good standing under the laws of the state(s) in which Trustor
            and Borrower are organized. Trustor and Borrower are qualified or
            licensed to do business in all jurisdictions in which such
            qualification or licensing is required.

      b.    PERMITS. Trustor and Borrower possess all permits, franchises and
            licenses and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and
            fictitious names, if any, necessary to enable Trustor and Borrower
            to conduct the business(es) in which Trustor and Borrower are now
            engaged in compliance with applicable law.

      c.    AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The execution and delivery of the Loan
            Documents have been duly authorized and the Loan Documents
            constitute valid and binding obligations of Trustor, Borrower or the
            party which executed the same, enforceable in accordance with their
            respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
            bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting the
            enforcement of creditors' rights, or by the application of rules of
            equity.

      d.    VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance by Trustor and
            Borrower of each of the Loan Documents do not violate any provision
            of any law or regulation, or result in any breach or default under
            any contract, obligation, indenture or other instrument to which
            Trustor or Borrower is a party or by which Trustor or Borrower is
            bound.

      e.    LITIGATION. There are no pending or threatened actions, claims,
            investigations, suits or proceedings before any governmental
            authority, court or administrative agency which may adversely affect
            the financial condition or operations of Trustor or Borrower other
            than those previously disclosed in writing by Trustor or Borrower to
            Beneficiary.

      f.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements of Trustor and
            Borrower, of each general partner (if Trustor or Borrower is a
            partnership), of each member (if Trustor or Borrower is a limited
            liability company) and of each guarantor, if any, previously
            delivered by Trustor or Borrower to Beneficiary: (i) are materially
            complete and correct; (ii) present fairly the financial condition of
            such party; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with the same
            accounting standard used by Trustor or Borrower to prepare the
            financial statements delivered to and approved by Beneficiary in
            connection with the making of the Loan, or other accounting
            standards approved by Beneficiary. Since the date of such financial
            statements, there has been no material adverse change in such
            financial condition, nor have any assets or properties reflected on
            such financial statements been sold, transferred, assigned,
            mortgaged, pledged or encumbered except as previously disclosed in
            writing by Trustor or Borrower to Beneficiary and approved in
            writing by Beneficiary.


                                       8
<PAGE>
      g.    REPORTS. All reports, documents, instruments and information
            delivered to Beneficiary in connection with the Loan: (i) are
            correct in all material respects and sufficiently complete to give
            Beneficiary accurate knowledge of their subject matter; and (ii) do
            not contain any misrepresentation of a material fact or omission of
            a material fact which omission makes the provided information
            misleading.

      h.    INCOME TAXES. There are no material pending assessments or
            adjustments of Trustor's or Borrower's income tax payable with
            respect to any year.

      i.    SUBORDINATION. There is no agreement or instrument to which Borrower
            is a party or by which Borrower is bound that would require the
            subordination in right of payment of any of Borrower's obligations
            under the Note to an obligation owed to another party.

      j.    TITLE. Trustor lawfully holds and possesses fee simple title to the
            Property, without limitation on the right to encumber same. This
            Deed of Trust is a first lien on the Property prior and superior to
            all other liens and encumbrances on the Property except: (i) liens
            for real estate taxes and assessments not yet due and payable; (ii)
            senior exceptions previously approved by Beneficiary and shown in
            the title insurance policy insuring the lien of this Deed of Trust;
            and (iii) other matters, if any, previously disclosed to Beneficiary
            by Trustor in a writing specifically referring to this
            representation and warranty.

      k.    MECHANICS' LIENS. There are no mechanics' or similar liens or claims
            which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are
            outstanding that under law could give rise to any such liens)
            affecting the Property which are or may be prior to or equal to the
            lien of this Deed of Trust, other than those (if any) previously
            approved by Beneficiary and shown on the title insurance policy
            insuring the lien of this Deed of Trust.

      l.    ENCROACHMENTS. Except as shown in the survey, if any, previously
            delivered to Beneficiary, none of the buildings or other
            improvements which were included for the purpose of determining the
            appraised value of the Property lies outside of the boundaries or
            building restriction lines of the Property and no buildings or other

            (whether before or after the commencement of a nonjudicial or
            judicial foreclosure proceeding), enter and inspect the Property for
            the purpose of determining the existence, location, nature and
            magnitude of any past or present release or threatened release of
            any Hazardous Materials into, onto, beneath or from the Property.

      f.    LEGAL EFFECT OF SECTION. Trustor and Beneficiary agree that: (i)
            this Hazardous Materials Section is intended as Beneficiary's
            written request for information (and Trustor's response) concerning
            the environmental condition of the real property security as
            required by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 726.5; and
            (ii) each representation and warranty and covenant in this Section
            (together with any indemnity applicable to a breach of any such
            representation and warranty) with respect to the environmental
            condition of the Property is intended by Beneficiary and Trustor to
            be an "environmental provision" for purposes of California Code of
            Civil Procedure Section 736.

6.3   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Trustor shall comply with all federal, state and
      local laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Property, including,
      without limitation, all zoning and building requirements and all
      requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.
      Section 12101 et seq.), as amended from time to time. Trustor shall
      possess and maintain or cause Borrower to possess and maintain in full
      force and effect at all times (a) all certificates of occupancy and other
      licenses, permits and authorizations required by applicable law for the
      existing use of the Property and (b) all permits, franchises and licenses
      and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and fictitious
      names, if any, required by applicable law for Trustor and Borrower to
      conduct the business(es) in which Trustor and Borrower are now engaged.

6.4   LITIGATION. Trustor shall promptly notify Beneficiary in writing of any
      litigation pending or threatened in writing against Trustor or Borrower
      claiming damages in excess of $100,000 and of all pending or threatened
      (in writing) litigation against Trustor or Borrower if the aggregate
      damage claims against Trustor or Borrower exceed $500,000.

6.5   MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, TRANSFER OF ASSETS. Trustor shall not: (a) merge or
      consolidate with any other entity or permit Borrower to merge or
      consolidate with any other entity; (b) make any substantial change in the
      nature of Trustor's business or structure or permit Borrower to make any
      substantial change in the nature of Borrower's business or structure; (c)
      acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other entity or
      permit Borrower to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any
      other entity; or (d) sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of
      a material part of Trustor's assets except in the ordinary course of
      Trustor's business or permit Borrower to sell, lease, assign, transfer or
      otherwise dispose of a material part of Borrower's assets except in the
      ordinary course of Borrower's business.

6.6   ACCOUNTING RECORDS. Trustor shall maintain and cause Borrower to maintain
      adequate books and records in accordance with the same accounting standard
      used by Trustor or Borrower to prepare the financial statements delivered
      to and approved by Beneficiary in connection with the making of the Loan
      or other accounting standards approved by Beneficiary. Trustor shall
      permit and shall cause Borrower to permit any representative of
      Beneficiary, at any reasonable time and from time to time, upon reasonable
      prior notice to Trustor, to inspect, audit and examine such books and
      records and make copies of same.

6.7   COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Trustor shall pay to Beneficiary the
      full amount of all costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
      reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of Beneficiary's in-house or
      outside counsel, incurred by Beneficiary in connection with: (a)
      appraisals and inspections of the Property or Collateral required by
      Beneficiary as a result of (i) a Transfer or proposed Transfer (as defined
      below), or (ii) a Default; (b) appraisals and inspections of the Property
      or Collateral required by applicable law, including, without limitation,
      federal or state regulatory reporting requirements; and (c) any acts
      performed by Beneficiary at Trustor's request or wholly or partially for
      the benefit of Trustor (including, without limitation,


                                       15
<PAGE>
      the preparation or review of amendments, assumptions, waivers, releases,
      reconveyances, estoppel certificates or statements of amounts owing under
      any Secured Obligation). In connection with appraisals and inspections,
      Trustor specifically (but not by way of limitation) acknowledges that:
      (aa) a formal written appraisal of the Property by a state certified or
      licensed appraiser may be required by federal regulatory reporting
      requirements on an annual or more frequent basis; and (bb) Beneficiary may
      require inspection of the Property by an independent supervising
      architect, a cost engineering specialist, or both. Trustor shall pay all
      indebtedness arising under this Section immediately upon demand by
      Beneficiary together with interest thereon following notice of such
      indebtedness at the rate of interest then applicable to the principal
      balance of the Note as specified therein.

6.8   LIENS, ENCUMBRANCES AND CHARGES. Subject to the terms of Section 8.4,
      Trustor shall immediately discharge by bonding or otherwise any lien,
      charge or other encumbrance which attaches to the Property in violation of
      Section 6.15. Subject to Trustor's right to contest such matters under
      this Deed of Trust or as expressly permitted in the Loan Documents,
      Trustor shall pay when due all obligations secured by or reducible to
      liens and encumbrances which shall now or hereafter encumber or appear to
      encumber all or any part of the Property or any interest therein, whether
      senior or subordinate hereto, including, without limitation, all claims
      for work or labor performed, or materials or supplies furnished, in
      connection with any work of demolition, alteration, repair, improvement or
      construction of or upon the Property, except such as Trustor may in good
      faith contest or as to which a bona fide dispute may arise (provided
      provision is made to the satisfaction of Beneficiary for eventual payment
      thereof in the event that Trustor is obligated to make such payment and
      that any recorded claim of lien, charge or other encumbrance against the
      Property is immediately discharged by bonding or otherwise).

6.9   TAXES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. Trustor shall pay and discharge when due any
      and all indebtedness, obligations, assessments and taxes, both real and
      personal and including federal and state income taxes and state and local
      property taxes and assessments. Trustor shall promptly provide to
      Beneficiary copies of all tax and assessment notices pertaining to the
      Property. Trustor hereby authorizes Beneficiary to obtain, at Trustor's
      expense, a tax service contract which shall provide tax information on the
      Property to Beneficiary for the term of the Loan and any extensions or
      renewals of the Loan.

6.10  INSURANCE COVERAGE. Trustor shall insure the Property against loss or
      damage by fire and such other hazards as Beneficiary shall from time to
      time require; provided, however, (a) Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's
      election, may only require flood insurance if all or any portion of the
      improvements located on the Property is or becomes located in a special
      flood hazard area, and (b) Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's election, may
      only require earthquake insurance if all or any portion of the Property is
      or becomes located in an earthquake fault zone. Trustor shall also carry
      public liability insurance and such other insurance as Beneficiary may
      reasonably require, including, without limitation, business interruption
      insurance or loss of rents insurance. Such policies shall contain a
      standard mortgage clause naming Beneficiary and its successors in interest
      as a loss payee and requiring at least 30 days prior notice to the holder
      at termination or cancellation. Trustor shall maintain all required
      insurance throughout the term of the Loan and while any liabilities of
      Borrower or Trustor to Beneficiary under any of the Loan Documents remain
      outstanding at Trustor's expense, with companies, and in substance and
      form satisfactory to Beneficiary. Neither Beneficiary nor Trustee, by
      reason of accepting, rejecting, approving or obtaining insurance shall
      incur any liability for: (c) the existence, nonexistence, form or legal
      sufficiency of any insurance; (d) the solvency of any insurer; or (e) the
      payment of claims.

6.11  CONDEMNATION AND INSURANCE PROCEEDS.

      a.    ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. Trustor absolutely and irrevocably assigns to
            Beneficiary all of the following rights, claims and amounts
            (collectively, "Claims"), all of which shall be paid to Beneficiary:
            (i) all awards of damages and all other compensation payable
            directly or indirectly by reason of a condemnation or proposed
            condemnation for public or private use affecting all or any part of,
            or any interest in, the Property; (ii) all other claims and awards
            for damages to or decrease in value of all or any part of, or any
            interest in, the Property; (iii) all proceeds of any insurance
            policies payable by


                                       16
<PAGE>
            reason of loss sustained to all or any part of the Property; and
            (iv) all interest which may accrue on any of the foregoing. Trustor
            shall give Beneficiary prompt written notice of the occurrence of
            any casualty affecting, or the institution of any proceedings for
            eminent domain or for the condemnation of, the Property or any
            portion thereof. So long as no Default has occurred and is
            continuing at the time, Trustor shall have the right to adjust,
            compromise and settle any Claim of $100,000 or less without the
            consent of Beneficiary, provided, however, all awards, proceeds and
            other sums described herein shall continue to be payable to
            Beneficiary. Beneficiary may commence, appear in, defend or
            prosecute any Claim exceeding $100,000, and may adjust, compromise
            and settle all Claims (except for Claims which Trustor may settle as
            provided herein), but shall not be responsible for any failure to
            commence, appear in, defend, prosecute or collect any such Claim
            regardless of the cause of the failure. All awards, proceeds and
            other sums described herein shall be payable to Beneficiary.

      b.    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; NO DEFAULT. So long as no Default has
            occurred and is continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of
            the proceeds of the Claims ("Proceeds") and no Default occurs
            thereafter, Beneficiary shall apply the Proceeds in the following
            order of priority: First, to Beneficiary's expenses in settling,
            prosecuting or defending the Claims; Second, to the repair or
            restoration of the Property; and Third, to Trustor if the repair or
            restoration of the Property has been completed, but to the Secured
            Obligations in any order without suspending, extending or reducing
            any obligation of Trustor to make installment payments if the repair
            or restoration of the Property has not been completed.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary shall have no obligation
            to make any Proceeds available for the repair or restoration of the
            Property unless and until all the following conditions have been
            satisfied: (i) delivery to Beneficiary of the Proceeds plus any
            additional amount which is needed to pay all costs of the repair or
            restoration (including, without limitation, taxes, financing
            charges, insurance and rent during the repair period); (ii)
            establishment of an arrangement for lien releases and disbursement
            of funds acceptable to Beneficiary; (iii) delivery to Beneficiary in
            form and content acceptable to Beneficiary of all of the following:
            (aa) plans and specifications for the work; (bb) a contract for the
            work, signed by a contractor acceptable to Beneficiary; (cc) a cost
            breakdown for the work; (dd) if reasonably required by Beneficiary,
            a payment and performance bond for the work; (ee) evidence of the
            continuation of substantially all Leases unless consented to in
            writing by Beneficiary; (ff) evidence that, upon completion of the
            work, the size, capacity, value, and income coverage ratios for the
            Property will be at least as great as those which existed
            immediately before the damage or condemnation occurred; and (gg)
            evidence of the satisfaction of any additional conditions that
            Beneficiary may reasonably establish to protect Beneficiary's
            security. Trustor acknowledges that the specific conditions
            described above are reasonable.

      c.    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; DEFAULT. If a Default has occurred and is
            continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of the Proceeds or
            if a Default occurs at any time thereafter, Beneficiary may, at
            Beneficiary's absolute discretion and regardless of any impairment
            of security or lack of impairment of security, but subject to
            applicable law governing use of the Proceeds, if any, apply all or
            any of the Proceeds to Beneficiary's expenses in settling,
            prosecuting or defending the Claims and then apply the balance to
            the Secured Obligations in any order without suspending, extending
            or reducing any obligation of Trustor to make installment payments,
            and may release all or any part of the Proceeds to Trustor upon any
            conditions Beneficiary chooses.

6.12  IMPOUNDS.

      a.    POST-DEFAULT IMPOUNDS. If required by Beneficiary at any time after
            a Default occurs (and regardless of whether such Default is
            thereafter cured), Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary such
            amounts ("Post-Default Impounds") on such dates (determined by
            Beneficiary as provided below) as will be sufficient to pay any or
            all "Costs" (as defined below) specified by Beneficiary. Beneficiary
            in its reasonable discretion shall estimate the amount of such Costs
            that will be payable or required during any period selected by
            Beneficiary not exceeding 1 year and shall determine the fractional
            portion thereof that Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary on each
            date specified by Beneficiary during such period. If the


                                       17
<PAGE>
            Post-Default Impounds paid by Trustor are not sufficient to pay the
            related Costs, Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary upon demand an
            amount equal to the deficiency. All Post-Default Impounds shall be
            payable by Trustor in addition to (but without duplication of) any
            other Impounds (as defined below).

      b.    ALL IMPOUNDS. Post-Default Impounds and any other impounds that may
            be payable by Borrower under the Note are collectively called
            "Impounds". All Impounds shall be deposited into one or more
            segregated or commingled accounts maintained by Beneficiary or its
            servicing agent. Except as otherwise provided in the Note, such
            account(s) shall not bear interest. Beneficiary shall not be a
            trustee, special depository or other fiduciary for Trustor with
            respect to such account, and the existence of such account shall not
            limit Beneficiary's rights under this Deed of Trust, any other
            agreement or any provision of law. If no Default exists, Beneficiary
            shall apply all Impounds to the payment of the related Costs, or in
            Beneficiary's sole discretion may release any or all Impounds to
            Trustor for application to and payment of such Costs. If a Default
            exists, Beneficiary may apply any or all Impounds to any Secured
            Obligation and/or to cure such Default, whereupon Trustor shall
            restore all Impounds so applied and cure all Defaults not cured by
            such application. The obligations of Trustor hereunder shall not be
            diminished by deposits of Impounds made by Trustor, except to the
            extent that such obligations have actually been met by application
            of such Impounds. Upon any assignment of this Deed of Trust,
            Beneficiary may assign all Impounds in its possession to
            Beneficiary's assignee, whereupon Beneficiary and Trustee shall be
            released from all liability with respect to such Impounds. Within 60
            days following full repayment of the Secured Obligations (other than
            as a consequence of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of
            foreclosure) or at such earlier time as Beneficiary may elect,
            Beneficiary shall pay to Trustor all Impounds in its possession, and
            no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. "Costs" means
            (i) all taxes and other liabilities payable by Trustor under Section
            6.9, (ii) all insurance premiums payable by Trustor under Section
            6.10, (iii) all other costs and expenses for which Impounds are
            required under the Note, and/or (iv) all other amounts that will be
            required to preserve the value of the Property. Trustor shall
            deliver to Beneficiary, promptly upon receipt, all bills for Costs
            for which Beneficiary has required Post-Default Impounds.

6.13  DEFENSE AND NOTICE OF LOSSES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS. Trustor shall protect,
      preserve and defend the Property and title to and right of possession of
      the Property, the security of this Deed of Trust and the rights and powers
      of Beneficiary and Trustee hereunder at Trustor's sole expense against all
      adverse claims, whether the claim: (a) is against a possessory or
      non-possessory interest; (b) arose prior or subsequent to the Effective
      Date; or (c) is senior or junior to Trustor's or Beneficiary's rights.
      Trustor shall give Beneficiary and Trustee prompt notice in writing of the
      assertion of any claim, of the filing of any action or proceeding, of the
      occurrence of any damage to the Property and of any condemnation offer or
      action.

6.14  RIGHT OF INSPECTION. Beneficiary and its independent contractors, agents
      and employees may enter the Property from time to time at any reasonable
      time upon reasonable prior notice to Trustor (except that such notice
      shall not be required in the event of an emergency) for the purpose of
      inspecting the Property and ascertaining Trustor's compliance with the
      terms of this Deed of Trust. Beneficiary shall use reasonable efforts to
      assure that Beneficiary's entry upon and inspection of the Property shall
      not materially and unreasonably interfere with the business or operations
      of Trustor or Trustor's tenants on the Property.

6.15  PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN TRUSTOR. Trustor
      acknowledges that Beneficiary has relied upon the principals of Trustor
      and Borrower and their experience in owning and operating properties
      similar to the Property in connection with the closing of the Loan.
      Accordingly, except with the prior written consent of Beneficiary or as
      otherwise expressly permitted in the Note, Trustor shall not: (a) cause or
      permit any sale, exchange, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment,
      encumbrance or other transfer, conveyance or disposition, whether
      voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law ("Transfer") of all or
      any part of, or all or any direct or indirect interest in, the Property or
      the Collateral (except for equipment and inventory in the ordinary course
      of its business); or (b) cause or permit a Transfer of any direct or
      indirect interest in any partnership, limited liability company,
      corporation, trust, or other entity comprising all or any portion of or
      holding any direct or indirect interest in Trustor or Borrower


                                       18
<PAGE>
      (other than the sale or exchange of a limited partnership interest or a
      non-managing membership interest). If any Transfer not expressly permitted
      in the Note or this Deed of Trust is made without the prior written
      consent of Beneficiary, Beneficiary shall have the absolute right at its
      option, without prior demand or notice, to declare all of the Secured
      Obligations immediately due and payable, except to the extent prohibited
      by law, and pursue its rights and remedies under Section 7.3 herein.
      Trustor agrees to pay any prepayment fee as set forth in the Note in the
      event the Secured Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the terms of
      this Section. Consent to one such Transfer shall not be deemed to be a
      waiver of the right to require the consent to future or successive
      Transfers. Except for Transfers expressly permitted under the Note,
      Beneficiary's consent to any Transfer may be withheld, conditioned or
      delayed in Beneficiary's sole and absolute discretion.

6.16  INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

6.17  COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEE. Trustor shall pay to Trustee compensation and
      reimbursement for services and expenses in the administration of this
      trust pursuant to C.R.S. Sections 38-37-102 et seq., including, without
      limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees. Trustor shall pay all indebtedness
      arising under this Section immediately upon demand by Trustee or
      Beneficiary together with interest thereon from the date the indebtedness
      arises at the rate of interest then applicable to the principal balance of
      the Note as specified therein.

6.18  EXCULPATION. Beneficiary shall not directly or indirectly be liable to
      Trustor or any other person as a consequence of: (a) the exercise of the
      rights, remedies or powers granted to Beneficiary in this Deed of Trust;
      (b) the failure or refusal of Beneficiary to perform or discharge any
      obligation or liability of Trustor under any agreement related to the
      Property or under this Deed of Trust; or (c) any loss sustained by Trustor
      or any third party resulting from Beneficiary's failure to lease the
      Property after a Default or from any other act or omission of Beneficiary
      in managing the Property after a Default unless the loss is caused by the
      willful misconduct and bad faith of Beneficiary and no such liability
      shall be asserted or enforced against Beneficiary, all such liability
      being expressly waived and released by Trustor.

6.19  INDEMNITY. Without in any way limiting any other indemnity contained in
      this Deed of Trust, Trustor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
      the Beneficiary Group (as defined below) from and against any claim, loss,
      damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising out of:
      (a) the making of the Loan, except for violations of banking laws or
      regulations by the Beneficiary Group; (b) this Deed of Trust; (c) the
      execution of this Deed of Trust or the performance of any act required or
      permitted hereunder or by law; (d) any failure of Trustor to perform
      Trustor's obligations under this Deed of Trust or the other Loan
      Documents; (e) any alleged obligation or undertaking on the Beneficiary
      Group's part to perform or discharge any of the representations,
      warranties, conditions, covenants or other obligations contained in any
      other document related to the Property; (f) any act or omission by Trustor
      or any contractor, agent, employee or representative of Trustor with
      respect to the Property; or (g) any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
      liability directly or indirectly arising out of: (i) the use, generation,
      manufacture, storage, treatment, release, threatened release, discharge,
      disposal, transportation or presence of any Hazardous Materials which are
      found in, on, under or about the Property (including, without limitation,
      underground contamination); or (ii) the breach of any covenant,
      representation or warranty of Trustor under Sections 5.1.p, 5.1.q, 5.1.r,
      or 6.2 above. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, this
      indemnity shall not include any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
      liability directly or indirectly arising out of the gross negligence or
      willful misconduct of any member of the Beneficiary Group, or any claim,
      loss, damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the Beneficiary Group
      arising from any act or incident on the Property occurring after the full
      reconveyance and release of the lien of this Deed of Trust on the
      Property, or with respect to the matters set forth in clause (g) above,
      any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the
      Beneficiary Group resulting from the introduction and initial release of
      Hazardous Materials on the Property occurring after the transfer of title
      to the Property at a foreclosure sale under this Deed of Trust, either
      pursuant to judicial decree or the power of sale, or by deed in lieu of
      such foreclosure. This indemnity shall include, without limitation: (aa)
      all consequential damages (including, without limitation, any third party
      tort claims or governmental claims, fines or penalties against the
      Beneficiary Group); (bb) all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees
      (including, without limitation, expert witness fees) paid or incurred by
      the Beneficiary Group; and (cc) the costs, whether foreseeable or

      unforeseeable, of any investigation, repair, cleanup or detoxification of
      the Property which is required by any governmental entity or is otherwise
      necessary to render the Property in compliance with all laws and
      regulations pertaining to Hazardous Materials. "Beneficiary Group", as
      used herein, shall mean (1) Beneficiary (including, without limitation,
      any participant in the Loan), (2) any entity controlling, controlled by or
      under common control with Beneficiary, (3) the directors, officers,
      employees and agents of Beneficiary and such other entities, and (4) the
      successors, heirs and assigns of the entities and persons described in
      foregoing clauses (1) through (3). Trustor shall pay immediately upon
      Beneficiary's demand any amounts owing under this indemnity together with
      interest from the date the indebtedness arises until paid at the rate of
      interest applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified
      therein. Trustor agrees to use legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the
      Beneficiary Group in any action or proceeding arising under this
      indemnity. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION OF
      THIS DEED OF TRUST, BUT TRUSTOR'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS INDEMNITY SHALL BE
      SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECTION IN THE NOTE ENTITLED "BORROWER'S
      LIABILITY."

6.21  RELEASES, EXTENSIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY. Without
      notice to or the consent, approval or agreement of any persons or entities
      having any interest at any time in the Property or in any manner obligated
      under the Secured Obligations ("Interested Parties"), Beneficiary may,
      from time to time: (a) fully or partially release any person or entity
      from liability for the payment or performance of any Secured Obligation;
      (b) extend the maturity of any Secured Obligation; (c) make any agreement
      with Borrower increasing the amount or otherwise altering the terms of any
      Secured Obligation; (d) accept additional security for any Secured
      Obligation; or (e) release all or any portion of the Property, Collateral
      and other security for any Secured Obligation. None of the foregoing
      actions shall release or reduce the personal liability of any of said
      Interested Parties, or release or impair the priority of the lien of this
      Deed of Trust upon the Property.

6.22  SALE OR PARTICIPATION OF LOAN. Trustor agrees that Beneficiary may at any
      time sell, assign, participate or securitize all or any portion of
      Beneficiary's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, and that
      any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization may be to one
      or more financial institutions or other entities, to private investors,
      and/or into the public securities market, in Beneficiary's sole
      discretion. Trustor further agrees that Beneficiary may disseminate to any
      such actual or potential purchaser(s), assignee(s) or participant(s) all
      documents and financial and other information heretofore or hereafter
      provided to or known to Beneficiary with respect to: (a) the Property and
      its operation; and/or (b) any party connected with the Loan (including,
      without limitation, Trustor, any partner or member of Trustor, any
      constituent partner or member of Trustor, any guarantor and any
      nonborrower trustor). In the event of any such sale, assignment,
      participation or securitization, Beneficiary and the other parties to the
      same shall share in the rights and obligations of Beneficiary set forth in
      the Loan Documents as and to the extent they shall agree among themselves.
      In connection with any such sale, assignment, participation or
      securitization, Trustor further agrees that the Loan Documents shall be
      sufficient evidence of the obligations of Trustor to each purchaser,
      assignee or participant, and Trustor shall, within 15 days after request
      by Beneficiary, (x) deliver an estoppel certificate verifying for the
      benefit of Beneficiary and any other party designated by Beneficiary the
      status and the terms and provisions of the Loan in form and substance
      acceptable to Beneficiary, (y) provide any information, legal opinions or
      documents regarding Trustor, Guarantor (as defined in the Loan Documents),
      the Property and any tenants of the Property as Beneficiary or
      Beneficiary's rating agencies may reasonably request, and (z) enter into
      such amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents or the
      organizational documents of Trustor as may be reasonably required in order
      to facilitate any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization
      without impairing Trustor's rights or increasing Trustor's obligations.
      The indemnity obligations of Trustor under the Loan Documents shall also
      apply with respect to any purchaser, assignee or participant.

6.23  RELEASE OF DEED OF TRUST. If the principal and interest and all other sums
      due or to become due under the Note shall have been paid, then and in that
      event only, the estate, right, title and interest of Trustee and
      Beneficiary in the Property shall cease, and upon (a) written notice from
      Beneficiary that all of the Secured Obligations have been paid, (b)
      presentment of the original Note marked "cancelled," (c) surrender

      and all recording costs, Trustee shall release this Deed of Trust and the
      Property shall become wholly free of the liens, security interests,
      conveyances and assignments created and evidenced hereby. No release of
      this Deed of Trust or the lien hereof shall be valid unless executed by
      Beneficiary and Trustee.

6.24  SUBROGATION. Beneficiary shall be subrogated to the lien of all
      encumbrances, whether released of record or not, paid in whole or in part
      by Beneficiary pursuant to this Deed of Trust or by the proceeds of any
      loan secured by this Deed of Trust.

6.25  MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. Without the prior written consent of Beneficiary,
      Trustor shall not terminate, modify, amend or enter into any agreement
      providing for the management, leasing or operation of the Property.
      Trustor represents, warrants and covenants that any existing management
      agreement includes, and any future management agreement entered into by
      Trustor shall include, a provision which provides that the management
      agreement is automatically terminated upon the transfer of the Property by
      Trustor, either by sale, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or
      otherwise, to Beneficiary or any other purchaser of the Property. Upon a
      Default under the Loan Documents or a default under any management
      agreement then in effect, which default is not cured within any applicable
      grace or cure period, Beneficiary shall have the right to terminate, or to
      direct Trustor to terminate, such management agreement upon thirty (30)
      days' written notice and to retain, or to direct Trustor to retain, a new
      management agent approved by Beneficiary.

            (i)   MONETARY. Borrower or Trustor shall fail to (aa) pay when due
                  any sums payable under the Loan Documents which by their
                  express terms require immediate payment without any grace
                  period or sums which are payable on the Maturity Date, or (bb)
                  pay within 5 days when due any other sums payable under the
                  Note, this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents,
                  including without limitation, any monthly payment due under
                  the Note.

            (ii)  FAILURE TO PERFORM. Borrower or Trustor shall fail to observe,
                  perform or discharge any of Borrower's or Trustor's
                  obligations, covenants, conditions or agreements, other than
                  Borrower's or Trustor's payment obligations, under the Note,
                  this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, and

                  written notice thereof shall have been given to Borrower or
                  Trustor, as the case may be, by Beneficiary or (bb) if such
                  failure is of such a nature that it cannot be cured within
                  such 30 day period, Borrower or Trustor shall fail to commence
                  to cure such failure within such 30 day period or shall fail
                  to diligently prosecute such curative action thereafter.

            (iii) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Any representation, warranty,
                  certificate or other statement (financial or otherwise) made
                  or furnished by or on behalf of Borrower, Trustor, or a
                  guarantor, if any, to Beneficiary or in connection with any of
                  the Loan Documents, or as an inducement to Beneficiary to make
                  the Loan, shall be false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading
                  in any material respect when made or furnished.

            (iv)  CONDEMNATION; ATTACHMENT. The condemnation, seizure or
                  appropriation of any material portion (as reasonably
                  determined by Beneficiary) of the Property; or the
                  sequestration or


                                       21
<PAGE>
                  attachment of, or levy or execution upon any of the Property,
                  the Collateral or any other collateral provided by Borrower or
                  Trustor under any of the Loan Documents, or any material
                  portion of the other assets of Borrower or Trustor, which
                  sequestration, attachment, levy or execution is not released
                  or dismissed within 45 days after its occurrence; or the sale
                  of any assets affected by any of the foregoing.

            (v)   UNINSURED CASUALTY. The occurrence of an uninsured casualty
                  with respect to any material portion (as reasonably determined
                  by Beneficiary) of the Property unless: (aa) no other Default
                  has occurred and is continuing at the time of such casualty or
                  occurs thereafter; (bb) Trustor promptly notifies Beneficiary
                  of the occurrence of such casualty; and (cc) not more than 45
                  days after the occurrence of such casualty, Trustor delivers
                  to Beneficiary immediately available funds in an amount
                  sufficient, in Beneficiary's reasonable opinion, to pay all
                  costs of the repair or restoration (including, without
                  limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent
                  during the repair period). So long as no Default has occurred
                  and is continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of such
                  funds and no Default occurs thereafter, Beneficiary shall make
                  such funds available for the repair or restoration of the
                  Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary shall
                  have no obligation to make any funds available for repair or
                  restoration of the Property unless and until all the
                  conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the second
                  sentence of Section 6.11(b) of this Deed of Trust have been
                  satisfied. Trustor acknowledges that the specific conditions
                  described above are reasonable.

            (vi)  ADVERSE FINANCIAL CHANGE. Any material adverse change in the
                  financial condition of Borrower or any general partner or
                  managing member of Borrower, any guarantor, or any other
                  person or entity from the condition shown on the financial
                  statement(s) submitted to Beneficiary and relied upon by
                  Beneficiary in making the Loan, and which change Beneficiary
                  reasonably determines will have a material adverse effect on
                  (aa) the business, operations or condition of the Property; or
                  (bb) the ability of Borrower or Trustor to pay or perform
                  Borrower's or Trustor's obligations in accordance with the
                  terms of the Note, this Deed of Trust, and the other Loan
                  Documents.

                  under any other present or future state or federal law
                  regarding bankruptcy, reorganization or other relief to
                  debtors (collectively, "Debtor Relief Law"); or (bb)
                  Borrower's filing any pleading in any involuntary proceeding
                  under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law which
                  admits the jurisdiction of a court to regulate Borrower or the
                  Property or the petition's material allegations regarding
                  Borrower's insolvency; or (cc) Borrower's making a general
                  assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (dd) Borrower's
                  applying for, or the appointment of, a receiver, trustee,

                  or in any way restrains or limits Borrower or Beneficiary
                  regarding the Loan or the Property, prior to the earlier of
                  the entry of any order granting relief sought in the
                  involuntary petition or 45 days after the date of filing of
                  the petition.

            (iii) PARTNERS, GUARANTORS. The occurrence of an event specified in
                  clauses (i) or (ii) as to Trustor, any general partner or

7.2   ACCELERATION. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Default, Beneficiary may,
      at its option, declare all sums owing to Beneficiary under the Note and
      the other Loan Documents immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence

      following rights and remedies:

      a.    ENTRY ON PROPERTY. With or without notice, and without releasing
            Trustor from any Secured Obligation, either in person or by agent,
            with or without bringing any action or proceeding, or by a receiver
            appointed by a court and without regard to the adequacy of its
            security, and without becoming a mortgagee in possession, to enter
            upon the Property from time to time and to do such acts and things
            as Beneficiary or Trustee deem necessary or desirable in order to
            inspect, investigate, assess and protect the security hereof or to
            cure any Default, including, without limitation: (i) to take and
            possess all documents, books, records, papers and accounts of
            Trustor, Borrower or the then owner of the Property which relate to
            the Property; (ii) to make, terminate, enforce or modify leases of
            the Property upon such terms and conditions as Beneficiary deems
            proper; (iii) to make repairs, alterations and improvements to the
            Property necessary, in Trustee's or Beneficiary's reasonable
            judgment, to protect or enhance the security hereof; (iv) to appear
            in and defend any action or proceeding purporting to affect the
            security hereof or the rights or powers of Beneficiary or Trustee
            hereunder; (v) to pay, purchase, contest or compromise any
            encumbrance, charge, lien or claim of lien which, in the sole
            judgment of either Beneficiary or Trustee, is or may be senior in
            priority hereto, the judgment of Beneficiary or Trustee being
            conclusive as between the parties hereto; (vi) to obtain insurance;
            (vii) to pay any premiums or charges with respect to insurance
            required to be carried hereunder; (viii) to obtain a court order to
            enforce Beneficiary's right to enter and inspect the Property for
            Hazardous Materials in which regard the decision of Beneficiary as
            to whether there exists a release or threatened release of Hazardous
            Materials onto the Property shall be deemed reasonable and
            conclusive as between the parties hereto; (ix) to have a receiver
            appointed pursuant to applicable law to enforce Beneficiary's rights
            to enter and inspect the Property for Hazardous Materials; and/or
            (x) to employ legal counsel, accountants, engineers, consultants,
            contractors and other appropriate persons to assist them. All sums
            expended by Beneficiary in connection with such entry and
            possession, together with interest thereon at the Default Interest
            Rate, shall be immediately due and payable to Beneficiary by Trustor
            on demand and shall be secured hereby and by all of the other Loan
            Documents securing all or any part of the indebtedness evidenced by
            the Note;

      b.    APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER. With or without notice to Trustor or
            Borrower and without a hearing, which are hereby waived by Trustor
            and Borrower, to ex parte to apply to a court of competent
            jurisdiction for and obtain appointment of a receiver of the
            Property as a matter of strict right and Beneficiary's right to
            collect Payments, and without regard to: (i) the adequacy of the
            security for the repayment of the Secured Obligations; or (ii) the
            existence of a declaration that the Secured Obligations are
            immediately due and payable; and Trustor hereby irrevocably consents
            to such appointment and waives any and all notices of and defenses
            to such appointment and agrees not to oppose any application
            therefor by Beneficiary, but nothing herein is to be construed to
            deprive Beneficiary of any other right, remedy or privilege
            Beneficiary may now have under the law to have a receiver appointed,
            provided, however, that, the appointment of such receiver, trustee
            or other appointee by virtue of any court order, statute or
            regulation shall not impair or in any manner prejudice the rights of
            Beneficiary to receive Payments under the Leases pursuant to other
            terms and provisions hereof. Any such receiver shall have all of the
            usual powers and duties of receivers in similar cases, including,
            without limitation, the full power to hold, develop, rent, lease,
            manage,


                                       23
<PAGE>
            maintain, operate and otherwise use or permit the use of the
            Property upon such terms and conditions as said receiver may deem to
            be prudent and reasonable. Such receivership shall, at the option of
            Beneficiary, continue until full payment of the Secured Obligations
            or until title to the Property shall be passed by foreclosure sale
            under this Deed of Trust or deed in lieu of foreclosure;

      c.    FORECLOSURE.

            (i)   JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE; INJUNCTION. To commence and maintain or
                  cause Trustee to commence and maintain an action or actions in
                  any court of competent jurisdiction to foreclose this
                  instrument as a mortgage or to obtain specific enforcement of
                  the covenants of Trustor hereunder, and Trustor agrees that
                  such covenants shall be specifically enforceable by injunction
                  or any other appropriate equitable remedy and that for the
                  purposes of any suit brought under this subparagraph, Trustor
                  waives the defense of laches and any applicable statute of
                  limitations;

            (ii)  NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE. To commence foreclosure proceedings
                  against the Property by exercise of the power of sale herein
                  contained and cause the Property to be sold in accordance with
                  the requirements and procedures provided by applicable law in
                  a single parcel or in several parcels at the option of
                  Beneficiary. Should Beneficiary elect to foreclose by exercise
                  of the power of sale herein contained, Beneficiary shall file
                  with Trustee a written notice of election and demand for sale
                  and all other documents, certificates and affidavits as are
                  required by applicable law. Thereupon, Trustee shall cause a
                  copy of the notice of election and demand for sale to be
                  recorded in the Clerk and Recorder's Office of the county in
                  which the Property is located. Trustee shall then give such
                  notices as are required by law and shall conduct the
                  foreclosure sale of the Property in accordance with applicable
                  law. Trustee shall sell and dispose of the Property (en masse
                  or in separate parcels, as Trustee may think best) and all the
                  right, title and interest of Trustor and its successors and
                  assigns therein, at public auction at any place permitted by
                  applicable law for the highest and best price the same will
                  bring in cash. Subject to compliance with applicable law,
                  Trustee may postpone the sale of all or any portion of the
                  Property by public announcement at the time and place of sale,
                  and from time to time thereafter may postpone such sale by
                  public announcement at the time fixed by the preceding
                  postponement. When the sale is held, Trustee shall execute and
                  deliver to the purchaser of the Property or portions thereof
                  at such sale a certificate of purchase as required by
                  applicable law. Thereafter, following the expiration of all
                  applicable redemption periods and satisfaction of any other
                  requirements prescribed by law, Trustee shall execute and
                  deliver a deed for the Property to the person entitled
                  thereto, which deed shall be in such form as is required by
                  law. Such sale and said deed shall be a perpetual bar, both in
                  law and equity, against Trustor and its successors and
                  assigns, and all other persons claiming the Property or any
                  part thereof by, through, from or under Trustor. Beneficiary
                  may purchase the Property, or any part thereof, and may bid in
                  any part or all of the Secured Obligations and it shall not be
                  obligatory upon the purchaser at any such sale to see to the
                  application of the purchase money;

            (iii) GENERAL. (aa) Beneficiary may, by following the procedures and
                  satisfying the requirements prescribed by applicable law,
                  judicially or nonjudicially foreclose on only a portion of the
                  Property and, in such event, said foreclosure shall not affect
                  the lien of this Deed of Trust on the remaining portion of the
                  Property not foreclosed. (bb) If a nonjudicial foreclosure
                  hereunder shall be commenced by Trustee, Beneficiary may at
                  any time before the sale of the Property direct Trustee to
                  abandon the sale, and may then institute suit for the
                  collection of the Note and the other Secured Obligations and
                  for the judicial foreclosure of this Deed of Trust. If
                  Beneficiary should institute a suit for the collection of the
                  Note or any other Secured Obligation and for the judicial
                  foreclosure of this Deed of Trust, Beneficiary may at any time
                  before the entry of a final judgment in said suit dismiss the
                  same, and require Trustee to sell


                                       24
<PAGE>
                  the Property in accordance with the provisions of this Deed of
                  Trust. (cc) Upon sale of the Property at any judicial or
                  nonjudicial foreclosure, Beneficiary may credit bid (as
                  determined by Beneficiary in its sole and absolute discretion)
                  all or any portion of the Secured Obligations. In determining
                  such credit bid, Beneficiary may, but is not obligated to,
                  take into account all or any of the following: (i) appraisals
                  of the Property as such appraisals may be discounted or
                  adjusted by Beneficiary in its sole and absolute underwriting
                  discretion; (ii) expenses and costs incurred by Beneficiary
                  with respect to the Property prior to foreclosure, provided
                  such amounts comprise a part of the Secured Obligations; (iii)
                  estimated reasonable expenses and costs, net of income of
                  holding, marketing and selling the Property, which Beneficiary
                  anticipates will be incurred with respect to the Property
                  after foreclosure, but prior to resale, including, without
                  limitation, costs of structural reports and other due
                  diligence, costs to carry the Property prior to resale, costs
                  of resale (e.g. commissions, attorneys' fees, and taxes),
                  costs of any Hazardous Materials clean-up and monitoring,
                  costs of deferred maintenance, repair, refurbishment and
                  retrofit, costs of defending or settling litigation affecting
                  the Property, (iv) the fact of additional collateral (if any),
                  for the Secured Obligations; and (v) such other factors or
                  matters that Beneficiary (in its sole and absolute discretion)
                  deems appropriate. In regard to the above, Trustor
                  acknowledges and agrees that: (vi) Beneficiary is not required
                  to use any or all of the foregoing factors to determine the
                  amount of its credit bid; (vii) this paragraph does not impose
                  upon Beneficiary any additional obligations that are not
                  imposed by law at the time the credit bid is made; (viii) the
                  amount of Beneficiary's credit bid need not have any relation
                  to any loan-to-value ratios specified in the Loan Documents or
                  previously discussed between Trustor and Beneficiary; and (ix)
                  Beneficiary's credit bid may be (at Beneficiary's sole and
                  absolute discretion) higher or lower than any appraised value
                  of the Property;

      d.    MULTIPLE FORECLOSURES. To resort to and realize upon the security
            hereunder and any other security now or later held by Beneficiary
            concurrently or successively and in one or several consolidated or
            independent judicial actions or lawfully taken nonjudicial
            proceedings, or both, and to apply the proceeds received upon the
            Secured Obligations all in such order and manner as Trustee and
            Beneficiary or either of them determine in their sole discretion;

      e.    COLLECTION OF PAYMENTS. With or without taking possession of the
            Property, sue for or otherwise collect Payments under the Leases,
            including those past due and unpaid, and apply the same, less costs
            and expenses of operation and collection, including, without
            limitation, attorneys' fees, against the Secured Obligations in such
            order as Beneficiary may determine in its discretion, without in any
            way curing or waiving any default.

      f.    RIGHTS TO COLLATERAL. To exercise all rights Trustee or Beneficiary
            may have with respect to the Collateral under this Deed of Trust,
            the UCC or otherwise at law; and

      g.    OTHER RIGHTS. To exercise such other rights as Trustee or
            Beneficiary may have at law or in equity or pursuant to the terms
            and conditions of this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan
            Documents.

      In connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Beneficiary may elect to
      treat any of the Property which consists of a right in action or which is
      property that can be severed from the Property (including, without
      limitation, any improvements forming a part thereof) without causing
      structural damage thereto as if the same were personal property or a
      fixture, as the case may be, and dispose of the same in accordance with
      applicable law, separate and apart from the sale of the Property. Any sale
      of Collateral hereunder shall be conducted in any manner permitted by the
      UCC.

7.4   APPLICATION OF FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS. If any foreclosure sale is
      effected, Trustee shall apply the proceeds of such sale in the following
      order of priority: First, to the costs, fees and expenses of exercising
      the power of sale and of sale, including, without limitation, the payment
      of the Trustee's fees


                                       25
<PAGE>
      and attorneys' fees; Second, to the payment of the Secured Obligations
      which are secured by this Deed of Trust, in such order as Beneficiary
      shall determine in its sole discretion; Third, to satisfy the outstanding
      balance of obligations secured by any junior liens or encumbrances in the
      order of their priority; and Fourth, to the Trustor or the Trustor's
      successor in interest, or in the event the Property has been sold or
      transferred to another, to the vested owner of record at the time of the
      Trustee's sale.

7.5   WAIVER OF MARSHALING RIGHTS. Trustor, for itself and for all parties
      claiming through or under Trustor, and for all parties who may acquire a
      lien on or interest in the Property, hereby waives all rights to have the
      Property and/or any other property, including, without limitation, the
      Collateral, which is now or later may be security for any Secured
      Obligation, marshaled upon any foreclosure of this Deed of Trust or on a
      foreclosure of any other security for any of the Secured Obligations.

7.6   NO CURE OR WAIVER. Neither Beneficiary's nor Trustee's nor any receiver's
      entry upon and taking possession of all or any part of the Property, nor
      any collection of rents, issues, profits, insurance proceeds, condemnation
      proceeds or damages, other security or proceeds of other security, or
      other sums, nor the application of any collected sum to any Secured
      Obligation, nor the exercise of any other right or remedy by Beneficiary
      or Trustee or any receiver shall cure or waive any Default or notice of
      default under this Deed of Trust, or nullify the effect of any notice of
      sale (unless all Secured Obligations then due have been paid or performed
      and Trustor has cured all other Defaults hereunder), or impair the status
      of the security, or prejudice Beneficiary in the exercise of any right or
      remedy, or be construed as an affirmation by Beneficiary of any tenancy,
      lease or option or a subordination of the lien of this Deed of Trust.

7.7   PAYMENT OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Trustor agrees to pay to
      Beneficiary immediately and upon demand all costs and expenses incurred by
      Trustee and Beneficiary in the enforcement of the terms and conditions of
      this Deed of Trust (including, without limitation, statutory trustee's
      fees, court costs and attorneys' fees, whether incurred in litigation or
      not) with interest from the date of expenditure until said sums have been
      paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of the
      Note as specified therein.

7.8   POWER TO FILE NOTICES AND CURE DEFAULTS. Trustor hereby irrevocably
      appoints Beneficiary and its successors and assigns, as its
      attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, to perform any
      obligation of Trustor hereunder upon the occurrence of an event, act or
      omission which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a
      Default, provided, however, that: (a) Beneficiary as such attorney-in-fact
      shall only be accountable for such funds as are actually received by
      Beneficiary; and (b) Beneficiary shall not be liable to Trustor or any
      other person or entity for any failure to act under this Section.

7.9   REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights and remedies of Beneficiary and Trustee
      under this Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and
      are in addition to all rights and remedies provided by applicable law
      (including specifically that of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust as
      though it were a mortgage). Beneficiary may enforce any one or more
      remedies or rights under the Loan Documents either successively or
      concurrently.

7.10  DISCONTINUANCE OF PROCEEDINGS. If Beneficiary shall invoke any right,
      remedy or recourse permitted hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
      and shall thereafter elect to discontinue or abandon the same for any
      reason, Beneficiary shall have the unqualified right to do so and, in such
      an event, Trustor and Beneficiary shall be restored to their former
      positions with respect to the Secured Obligations, the Loan Documents, the
      Property and otherwise, and the rights, remedies, recourses and powers of
      Beneficiary shall continue as if the same had never been invoked.

                       ARTICLE 8. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

8.1   ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. The Loan Documents contain or incorporate by
      reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters
      contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations. The


                                       26
<PAGE>
      Loan Documents grant further rights to Beneficiary and contain further
      agreements and affirmative and negative covenants by Trustor which apply
      to this Deed of Trust and to the Property and such further rights and
      agreements are incorporated herein by this reference. THE OBLIGATIONS AND
      LIABILITIES OF TRUSTOR UNDER THIS DEED OF TRUST AND THE OTHER LOAN
      DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECTION IN THE NOTE
      ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

8.2   NON-WAIVER. By accepting payment of any amount secured hereby after its
      due date or late performance of any other Secured Obligation, Beneficiary
      shall not waive its right against any person obligated directly or
      indirectly hereunder or on any Secured Obligation, either to require
      prompt payment or performance when due of all other sums and obligations
      so secured or to declare default for failure to make such prompt payment
      or performance. No exercise of any right or remedy by Beneficiary or
      Trustee hereunder shall constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy
      herein contained or provided by law. No failure by Beneficiary or Trustee
      to exercise any right or remedy hereunder arising upon any Default shall
      be construed to prejudice Beneficiary's or Trustee's rights or remedies
      upon the occurrence of any other or subsequent Default. No delay by
      Beneficiary or Trustee in exercising any such right or remedy shall be
      construed to preclude Beneficiary or Trustee from the exercise thereof at
      any time while that Default is continuing. No notice to nor demand on
      Trustor shall of itself entitle Trustor to any other or further notice or
      demand in similar or other circumstances.

8.3   CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND EXPENSES. Wherever Beneficiary's consent,
      approval, acceptance or satisfaction is required under any provision of
      this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, such consent,
      approval, acceptance or satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld,
      conditioned or delayed by Beneficiary unless such provision expressly so
      provides. Wherever costs or expenses are required to be paid under any
      provision of this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, such
      costs or expenses shall be reasonable.

8.4   PERMITTED CONTESTS. After prior written notice to Beneficiary, Trustor may
      contest, by appropriate legal or other proceedings conducted in good faith
      and with due diligence, the amount, validity or application, in whole or
      in part, of any lien, levy, tax or assessment, or any lien of any laborer,
      mechanic, materialman, supplier or vendor, or the application to Trustor
      or the Property of any law or the validity thereof, the assertion or
      imposition of which, or the failure to pay when due, would constitute a
      Default; provided that (a) Trustor pursues the contest diligently, in a
      manner which Beneficiary determines is not prejudicial to Beneficiary, and
      does not impair the lien of this Deed of Trust; (b) the Property, or any
      part hereof or estate or interest therein, shall not be in any danger of
      being sold, forfeited or lost by reason of such proceedings; (c) in the
      case of the contest of any law or other legal requirement, Beneficiary
      shall not be in any danger of any civil or criminal liability; and (d) if
      required by Beneficiary, Trustor deposits with Beneficiary any funds or
      other forms of assurance (including a bond or letter of credit)
      satisfactory to Beneficiary to protect Beneficiary from the consequences
      of the contest being unsuccessful. Trustor's right to contest pursuant to
      the terms of this provision shall in no way relieve Trustor or Borrower of
      its obligations under the Loan or to make payments to Beneficiary as and
      when due.

8.5   FURTHER ASSURANCES. Trustor shall, upon demand by Beneficiary or Trustee,
      execute, acknowledge (if appropriate) and deliver any and all documents
      and instruments and do or cause to be done all further acts reasonably
      necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the Loan Documents
      and to perfect any assignments contained therein.

8.6   ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action, suit or proceeding is commenced
      between Trustor and Beneficiary regarding their respective rights and
      obligations under this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents,
      the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to damages
      or other relief, costs and expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees and court
      costs (including, without limitation, expert witness fees). As used herein
      the term "prevailing party" shall mean the party which obtains the
      principal relief it has sought, whether by compromise settlement or
      judgment. If the party which commenced or instituted the action, suit or
      proceeding shall dismiss or discontinue it without the concurrence of the
      other party, such other party shall be deemed the prevailing party.


                                       27
<PAGE>
8.7   TRUSTOR AND BENEFICIARY DEFINED. The term "Trustor" includes both the
      original Trustor and any subsequent owner or owners of any of the
      Property, and the term "Beneficiary" includes the original Beneficiary and
      any future owner or holder, including assignees, pledges and participants,
      of the Note or any interest therein.

8.8   DISCLAIMERS.

      a.    RELATIONSHIP. The relationship of Trustor and Beneficiary under this
            Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents is, and shall at all
            times remain, solely that of borrower and lender; and Beneficiary
            neither undertakes nor assumes any responsibility or duty to Trustor
            or to any third party with respect to the Property. Notwithstanding
            any other provisions of this Deed of Trust and the other Loan
            Documents: (i) Beneficiary is not, and shall not be construed to be,
            a partner, joint venturer, member, alter ego, manager, controlling
            person or other business associate or participant of any kind of
            Trustor, and Beneficiary does not intend to ever assume such status;
            (ii) Beneficiary's activities in connection with this Deed of Trust
            and the other Loan Documents shall not be "outside the scope of
            activities of a lender of money" within the meaning of California
            Civil Code Section 3434, as amended or recodified from time to time,
            and Beneficiary does not intend to ever assume any responsibility to
            any person for the quality, suitability, safety or condition of the
            Property; and (iii) Beneficiary shall not be deemed responsible for
            or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions of Trustor.

      b.    NO LIABILITY. Beneficiary shall not be directly or indirectly liable
            or responsible for any loss, claim, cause of action, liability,
            indebtedness, damage or injury of any kind or character to any
            person or property arising from any construction on, or occupancy or
            use of, the Property, whether caused by or arising from: (i) any
            defect in any building, structure, grading, fill, landscaping or
            other improvements thereon or in any on-site or off-site improvement
            or other facility therein or thereon; (ii) any act or omission of
            Trustor or any of Trustor's agents, employees, independent
            contractors, licensees or invitees; (iii) any accident in or on the
            Property or any fire, flood or other casualty or hazard thereon;
            (iv) the failure of Trustor or any of Trustor's licensees,
            employees, invitees, agents, independent contractors or other
            representatives to maintain the Property in a safe condition; or (v)
            any nuisance made or suffered on any part of the Property.

8.9   SEVERABILITY. If any term of this Deed of Trust or any other Loan
      Document, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances,
      shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
      Deed of Trust or such other Loan Document, or the application of such term
      to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or
      unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term of this Deed
      of Trust or such other Loan Document shall be valid and enforceable to the
      fullest extent permitted by law.

8.10  RELATIONSHIP OF ARTICLES. The rights, remedies and interests of
      Beneficiary under the deed of trust established by Article 1 and the
      security agreement established by Article 4 are independent and
      cumulative, and there shall be no merger of any lien created by the deed
      of trust with any security interest created by the security agreement.
      Beneficiary may elect to exercise or enforce any of its rights, remedies
      or interests under either or both the deed of trust or the security
      agreement as Beneficiary may from time to time deem appropriate. The
      absolute assignment of rents and leases established by Article 3 is
      similarly independent of and separate from the deed of trust and the
      security agreement.

8.11  MERGER. No merger shall occur as a result of Beneficiary's acquiring any
      other estate in, or any other lien on, the Property unless Beneficiary
      consents to a merger in writing.

8.12  OBLIGATIONS OF TRUSTOR, JOINT AND SEVERAL. If more than one person has
      executed this Deed of Trust as "Trustor", the obligations of all such

            (i) modifications of the required principal payment dates or
            interest payment dates or both, as the case may be, deferring or
            accelerating payment dates wholly or partly; and (ii) modifications,
            extensions or renewals at a different rate of interest whether or
            not any such modification, extension or renewal is evidenced by a
            new or additional promissory note or notes.

2.2   OBLIGATIONS. The term "obligations" is used herein in its broadest and
      most comprehensive sense and shall be deemed to include, without

      loan fees at any time accruing or assessed on any of the Secured
      Obligations.

2.3   INCORPORATION. All terms and conditions of the documents which evidence

      All persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Property shall be

      notice that the rate of interest on one or more Secured Obligations may
      vary from time to time.

               ARTICLE 3. ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

3.1   ASSIGNMENT. Trustor irrevocably assigns to Beneficiary all of Trustor's
      right, title and interest in, to and under: (a) all present and future
      leases of the Property or any portion thereof, all licenses and agreements
      relating to the management, leasing or operation of the Property or any
      portion thereof, and all other agreements of any kind relating to the use
      or occupancy of the Property or any portion thereof, whether such leases,
      licenses and agreements are now existing or entered into after the date
      hereof ("Leases"); and (b) the rents, issues, deposits and profits of the
      Property, including, without limitation, all amounts payable and all
      rights and benefits accruing to Trustor under the Leases ("Payments"). The
      term "Leases" shall also include all guarantees of and security for the
      tenants' performance thereunder, and all amendments, extensions, renewals
      or modifications thereto which are permitted hereunder. This is a present
      and absolute assignment, not an assignment for security purposes only, and
      Beneficiary's right to the Leases and Payments is not contingent upon, and
      may be exercised without possession of, the Property.

3.2   GRANT OF LICENSE. Notwithstanding the terms contained in Section 3.1,
      Beneficiary confers upon Trustor a revocable license ("License") to
      collect and retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the
      occurrence of a Default (as hereinafter defined). Upon a Default, the
      License shall be automatically revoked and Beneficiary may collect and
      apply the Payments pursuant to the terms hereof without notice and without
      taking possession of the Property. All Payments thereafter collected by
      Trustor shall be held by Trustor as trustee under a constructive trust for
      the benefit of Beneficiary. Trustor hereby irrevocably authorizes and
      directs the tenants under the Leases, upon notice of a Default from
      Beneficiary, to rely upon and comply with any notice or demand by
      Beneficiary for the payment to Beneficiary of any rental or other sums
      which may at any time become due under the Leases, or for the performance
      of any of the tenants' undertakings under the Leases, and the tenants
      shall have no right or duty to inquire as to whether any Default has
      actually occurred or is then existing. Trustor hereby relieves the tenants
      from any liability to Trustor by reason of relying upon and complying with
      any such notice or demand by Beneficiary. Beneficiary may apply, in its
      sole discretion, any Payments so collected by Beneficiary against any
      Secured Obligation or any other obligation of Borrower, Trustor or any
      other person or entity, under any document or instrument related to or
      executed in connection with the Loan Documents, whether existing on the
      date hereof or hereafter arising. Collection of any Payments by
      Beneficiary shall not cure or waive any Default or notice of Default or
      invalidate any acts done pursuant to such notice. If and when no Default
      exists, Beneficiary shall re-confer the License upon Trustor until the
      occurrence of another Default.


                                       3
<PAGE>
3.3   EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT. The foregoing irrevocable assignment shall not cause
      Beneficiary to be: (a) a mortgagee in possession; (b) responsible or
      liable for the control, care, management or repair of the Property or for
      performing any of the terms, agreements, undertakings, obligations,
      representations, warranties, covenants and conditions of the Leases; (c)
      responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property by the
      tenants under any of the Leases or by any other parties; for any dangerous
      or defective condition of the Property; or for any negligence in the
      management, upkeep, repair or control of the Property resulting in loss or
      injury or death to any tenant, licensee, employee, invitee or other
      person; or (d) responsible for or impose upon Beneficiary any duty to
      produce rents or profits. Beneficiary shall not directly or indirectly be
      liable to Trustor or any other person as a consequence of: (e) the
      exercise of or failure to exercise any of the rights, remedies or powers
      granted to Beneficiary hereunder; or (f) the failure or refusal of
      Beneficiary to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of
      Trustor arising under the Leases.

3.4   COVENANTS.

      A.    ALL LEASES. Trustor shall, at Trustor's sole cost and expense:

            (i)   perform all obligations of the landlord under the Leases and
                  use reasonable efforts to enforce performance by the tenants
                  of all obligations of the tenants under the Leases;

            (ii)  use reasonable efforts to keep the Property leased at all
                  times to tenants whom Trustor reasonably and in good faith
                  believes are creditworthy at rents not less than the fair
                  market rental value (including, but not limited to, free or
                  discounted rents to the extent the market so requires);

            (iii) promptly upon Beneficiary's request, deliver to Beneficiary a
                  copy of each requested Lease and all amendments thereto and
                  waivers thereof; and

            (iv)  promptly upon Beneficiary's request, execute and record any
                  additional assignments of landlord's interest under any Lease
                  to Beneficiary and specific subordinations of any Lease to
                  this Deed of Trust, in form and substance satisfactory to
                  Beneficiary.

            Unless consented to in writing by Beneficiary or otherwise permitted
            under any other provision of the Loan Documents, Trustor shall not:

            (v)   grant any tenant under any Lease any option, right of first
                  refusal or other right to purchase all or any portion of the
                  Property under any circumstances;

            (vi)  grant any tenant under any Lease any right to prepay rent more
                  than 1 month in advance;

            (vii) except upon Beneficiary's request, execute any assignment of
                  landlord's interest in any Lease; or

           (viii) collect rent or other sums due under any Lease in advance,
                  other than to collect rent 1 month in advance of the time when
                  it becomes due.

            Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this
            Section shall be null and void.

            Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary any sums received by Trustor
            in consideration of any termination, modification or amendment of
            any Lease or any release or discharge of any tenant under any Lease
            from any obligation thereunder and any such sums received by Trustor
            shall be held in trust by Trustor for such purpose. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, so long as no Default exists, the portion of any such
            sum received by Trustor with respect to any Lease which is less than
            $50,000 shall be payable to Trustor. All such sums received by
            Beneficiary with respect to any Lease shall be deemed "Impounds" (as
            defined in Section 6.12b) and shall be deposited by Beneficiary into
            a pledged account in accordance with Section 6.12b. If no Default
            exists, Beneficiary shall release such Impounds to Trustor from time
            to time


                                       4

            as necessary to pay or reimburse Trustor for such tenant
            improvements, brokerage commissions and other leasing costs as may
            be required to re-tenant the affected space; provided, however,
            Beneficiary shall have received and approved each of the following
            for each tenant for which such costs were incurred; (1) Trustor's
            written request for such release, including the name of the tenant,
            the location and net rentable area of the space and a description
            and cost breakdown of the tenant improvements or other leasing costs
            covered by the request; (2) Trustor's certification that any tenant
            improvements have been completed lien-free and in a workmanlike
            manner; (3) a fully executed Lease, or extension or renewal of the
            current Lease; (4) an estoppel certificate executed by the tenant
            including its acknowledgement that all tenant improvements have been
            satisfactorily completed; and (5) such other information with
            respect to such costs as Beneficiary may require. Following the
            re-tenanting of all affected space (including, without limitation,
            the completion of all tenant improvements), and provided no Default
            exists, Beneficiary shall release any remaining such Impounds
            relating to the affected space to Trustor. Trustor shall construct
            all tenant improvements in a workmanlike manner and in accordance
            with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

      b.    MAJOR LEASES. Trustor shall, at Trustor's sole cost and expense,
            give Beneficiary prompt written notice of any material default by
            landlord or tenant under any Major Lease (as defined below). Unless
            consented to in writing by Beneficiary or otherwise permitted under
            any other provision of the Loan Documents, Trustor shall not:

            (i)   enter into any Major Lease which (aa) is not on fair market
                  terms (which terms may include free or discounted rent to the
                  extent the market so requires); (bb) does not contain a
                  provision requiring the tenant to execute and deliver to the
                  landlord an estoppel certificate in form and substance
                  satisfactory to the landlord promptly upon the landlord's
                  request; or (cc) allows the tenant to assign or sublet the
                  premises without the landlord's consent;

            (ii)  reduce any rent or other sums due from the tenant under any
                  Major Lease;

            (iii) terminate or materially modify or amend any Major Lease; or

            (iv)  release or discharge the tenant or any guarantor under any
                  Major Lease from any material obligation thereunder.

            Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this
            Section shall be null and void.

            "Major Lease", as used herein, shall mean any Lease, which is, at
            any time: (1) a Lease of more than 20% of the total rentable area of
            the Property, as reasonably determined by Beneficiary; or (2) a
            Lease which generates a gross base monthly rent exceeding 20% of the
            total gross base monthly rent generated by all Leases (excluding all
            Leases under which the tenant is then in default), as reasonably
            determined by Beneficiary. Trustor's obligations with respect to
            Major Leases shall be governed by the provisions of Section 3.4a as
            well as by the provisions of this Section.

      c.    FAILURE TO DENY REQUEST. Beneficiary's failure to deny any written
            request by Trustor for Beneficiary's consent under the provisions of
            Sections 3.4(a) or 3.4(b) within 10 Business Days after
            Beneficiary's receipt of such request (and all documents and
            information reasonably related thereto) shall be deemed to
            constitute Beneficiary's consent to such request.

3.5   RIGHT OF SUBORDINATION. Beneficiary may at any time and from time to time
      by specific written instrument intended for the purpose unilaterally
      subordinate the lien of this Deed of Trust to any Lease, without joinder
      or consent of, or notice to, Trustor, any tenant or any other person.
      Notice is hereby given to each tenant under a Lease of such right to
      subordinate. No subordination referred to in this Section shall constitute
      a subordination to any lien or other encumbrance, whenever arising, or
      improve the right of any junior lienholder. Nothing herein shall be
      construed as subordinating this Deed of Trust to any Lease.

            hereafter conducted thereon by Trustor; all permits, consents,

      hereafter becomes a "fixture" under applicable law, this Deed of Trust
      constitutes a fixture filing under the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code, as
      amended or recodified from time to time ("UCC").

4.2   COVENANTS. Trustor agrees: (a) to execute and deliver such documents as
      Beneficiary reasonably deems necessary to create, perfect and continue the
      security interests contemplated hereby; (b) not to change its name, and,
      as applicable, its chief executive offices, its principal residence or the
      jurisdiction in which it is organized without giving Beneficiary at least
      30 days' prior written notice thereof; and (c) to cooperate with
      Beneficiary in perfecting all security interests granted herein and in
      obtaining such agreements from third parties as Beneficiary deems
      necessary, proper or convenient in connection with the preservation,
      perfection or enforcement of any of Beneficiary's rights hereunder.

4.3   RIGHTS OF BENEFICIARY. In addition to Beneficiary's rights as a "Secured
      Party" under the UCC, Beneficiary may, but shall not be obligated to, at
      any time without notice and at the expense of Trustor: (a) give notice to
      any person of Beneficiary's rights hereunder and enforce such rights at
      law or in equity; (b) insure, protect, defend and preserve the Collateral
      or any rights or interests of Beneficiary therein; and (c) inspect the
      Collateral during normal business hours upon reasonable prior written
      notice, provided, however, that such notice shall not be required in the
      event of an emergency. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall
      Beneficiary be deemed to have accepted any property other than cash in
      satisfaction of any obligation of Trustor to Beneficiary unless
      Beneficiary shall make an express written election of said remedy under
      the UCC or other applicable law.


                                       6

4.4   ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF BENEFICIARY UPON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of a
      Default, then in addition to all of Beneficiary's rights as a "Secured
      Party" under the UCC or otherwise at law:

      a.    DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL. Beneficiary may: (i) upon written notice,
            require Trustor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to
            Beneficiary at a place reasonably designated by Beneficiary; (ii)
            without prior notice (to the extent permitted by law), enter upon
            the Property or other place where the Collateral may be located and
            take possession of, collect, sell, lease, license and otherwise
            dispose of the Collateral, and store the same at locations
            acceptable to Beneficiary at Trustor's expense; or (iii) sell,
            assign and deliver the Collateral at any place or in any lawful
            manner and bid and become purchaser at any such sales; and

      b.    OTHER RIGHTS. Beneficiary may, for the account of Trustor and at
            Trustor's expense: (i) operate, use, consume, sell, lease, license
            or otherwise dispose of the Collateral as Beneficiary reasonably
            deems appropriate for the purpose of performing any or all of the
            Secured Obligations; (ii) enter into any agreement, compromise or
            settlement including insurance claims, which Beneficiary may
            reasonably deem desirable or proper with respect to the Collateral;
            and (iii) endorse and deliver evidences of title for, and receive,
            enforce and collect by legal action or otherwise, all indebtedness
            and obligations now or hereafter owing to Trustor in connection with
            or on account of the Collateral.

        Trustor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the Collateral in
        accordance with Beneficiary's rights and remedies as heretofore provided
        is a disposition thereof in a commercially reasonable manner and that 5
        Business Days prior notice of such disposition is commercially
        reasonable notice. Beneficiary shall have no obligation to process or
        prepare the Collateral for sale or other disposition. In disposing of
        the Collateral, Beneficiary may disclaim all warranties of title,
        possession, quiet enjoyment and the like. Any proceeds of any sale or
        other disposition of the Collateral may be applied by Beneficiary first
        to the reasonable expenses incurred by Beneficiary in connection
        therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
        disbursements, and then to the payment of the Secured Obligations, in
        such order of application as Beneficiary may from time to time elect.

4.5     POWER OF ATTORNEY. Trustor hereby irrevocably appoints Beneficiary as
        Trustor's attorney-in-fact (such agency being coupled with an interest),
        and as such attorney-in-fact, Beneficiary may, without the obligation to
        do so, in Beneficiary's name or in the name of Trustor, prepare,
        execute, file and record financing statements, continuation statements,
        applications for registration and like papers necessary to create,
        perfect or preserve any of Beneficiary's security interests and rights
        in or to the Collateral, and upon a Default, take any other action
        required of Trustor; provided, however, that Beneficiary as such
        attorney-in-fact shall be accountable only for such funds as are
        actually received by Beneficiary.

                    ARTICLE 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

5.1   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Trustor represents and warrants to
      Beneficiary that, to Trustor's current actual knowledge after reasonable

      as of the Effective Date:

      a.    LEGAL STATUS. Trustor and Borrower are duly organized and existing
            and in good standing under the laws of the state(s) in which Trustor
            and Borrower are organized. Trustor and Borrower are qualified or
            licensed to do business in all jurisdictions in which such
            qualification or licensing is required.

      b.    PERMITS. Trustor and Borrower possess all permits, franchises and
            licenses and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and
            fictitious names, if any, necessary to enable Trustor and Borrower
            to conduct the business(es) in which Trustor and Borrower are now
            engaged in compliance with applicable law.


                                       7
<PAGE>
      c.    AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The execution and delivery of the Loan
            Documents have been duly authorized and the Loan Documents
            constitute valid and binding obligations of Trustor, Borrower or the
            party which executed the same, enforceable in accordance with their
            respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
            bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting the
            enforcement of creditors' rights, or by the application of rules of
            equity .

      d.    VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance by Trustor and
            Borrower of each of the Loan Documents do not violate any provision
            of any law or regulation, or result in any breach or default under
            any contract, obligation, indenture or other instrument to which
            Trustor or Borrower is a party or by which Trustor or Borrower is
            bound.

      e.    LITIGATION. There are no pending or threatened actions, claims,
            investigations, suits or proceedings before any governmental
            authority, court or administrative agency which may adversely affect
            the financial condition or operations of Trustor or Borrower other
            than those previously disclosed in writing by Trustor or Borrower to
            Beneficiary.

      f.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements of Trustor and
            Borrower, of each general partner (if Trustor or Borrower is a
            partnership), of each member (if Trustor or Borrower is a limited
            liability company) and of each guarantor, if any, previously
            delivered by Trustor or Borrower to Beneficiary: (i) are materially
            complete and correct; (ii) present fairly the financial condition of
            such party; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with the same
            accounting standard used by Trustor or Borrower to prepare the
            financial statements delivered to and approved by Beneficiary in
            connection with the making of the Loan, or other accounting
            standards approved by Beneficiary. Since the date of such financial
            statements, there has been no material adverse change in such
            financial condition, nor have any assets or properties reflected on
            such financial statements been sold, transferred, assigned,
            mortgaged, pledged or encumbered except as previously disclosed in
            writing by Trustor or Borrower to Beneficiary and approved in
            writing by Beneficiary.

      g.    REPORTS. All reports, documents, instruments and information
            delivered to Beneficiary in connection with the Loan: (i) are
            correct in all material respects and sufficiently complete to give
            Beneficiary accurate knowledge of their subject matter; and (ii) do
            not contain any misrepresentation of a material fact or omission of
            a material fact which omission makes the provided information
            misleading.

      h.    INCOME TAXES. There are no material pending assessments or
            adjustments of Trustor's or Borrower's income tax payable with
            respect to any year.

      i.    SUBORDINATION. There is no agreement or instrument to which Borrower
            is a party or by which Borrower is bound that would require the
            subordination in right of payment of any of Borrower's obligations
            under the Note to an obligation owed to another party.

      j.    TITLE. Trustor lawfully holds and possesses fee simple title to the
            Property, without limitation on the right to encumber same. This
            Deed of Trust is a first lien on the Property prior and superior to
            all other liens and encumbrances on the Property except: (i) liens
            for real estate taxes and assessments not yet due and payable; (ii)
            senior exceptions previously approved by Beneficiary and shown in
            the title insurance policy insuring the lien of this Deed of Trust;
            and (iii) other matters, if any, previously disclosed to Beneficiary
            by Trustor in a writing specifically referring to this
            representation and warranty.

      k.    MECHANICS' LIENS. There are no mechanics' or similar liens or claims
            which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are
            outstanding that under law could give rise to any such liens)
            affecting the Property which are or may be prior to or equal to the
            lien of this Deed of Trust, other than those (if any) previously
            approved by Beneficiary and shown on the title insurance policy
            insuring the lien of this Deed of Trust.


                                       8

      l.    ENCROACHMENTS. Except as shown in the survey, if any, previously
            delivered to Beneficiary, none of the buildings or other
            improvements which were included for the purpose of determining the
            appraised value of the Property lies outside of the boundaries or
            building restriction lines of the Property and no buildings or other
            improvements located on adjoining properties encroach upon the
            Property.

      m.    LEASES. All existing Leases are in full force and effect and are
            enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. Except as
            disclosed on a rent roll provided to Beneficiary prior to the date
            hereof, no material breach or default by any party, or event which
            would constitute a material breach or default by any party after
            notice or the passage of time, or both, exists under any existing
            Lease. None of the landlord's interests under any of the Leases,
            including, but not limited to, rents, additional rents, charges,
            issues or profits, has been transferred or assigned. Except as
            disclosed on a rent roll provided to Beneficiary prior to the date

            condition of the Property is intended by Beneficiary and Trustor to
            be an "environmental provision" for purposes of California Code of
            Civil Procedure Section 736.

6.3   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Trustor shall comply with all federal, state and
      local laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Property, including,
      without limitation, all zoning and building requirements and all
      requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.
      Section 12101 et seq.), as amended from time to time. Trustor shall
      possess and maintain or cause Borrower to possess and maintain in full
      force and effect at all times (a) all certificates of occupancy and other
      licenses, permits and authorizations required by applicable law for the
      existing use of the Property and (b) all permits, franchises and licenses
      and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and fictitious
      names, if any, required by applicable law for Trustor and Borrower to
      conduct the business(es) in which Trustor and Borrower are now engaged.

6.4   LITIGATION. Trustor shall promptly notify Beneficiary in writing of any
      litigation pending or threatened in writing against Trustor or Borrower
      claiming damages in excess of $100,000 and of all pending or threatened

      (in writing) litigation against Trustor or Borrower if the aggregate
      damage claims against Trustor or Borrower exceed $500,000.

6.5   MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, TRANSFER OF ASSETS. Trustor shall not: (a) merge or
      consolidate with any other entity or permit Borrower to merge or
      consolidate with any other entity; (b) make any substantial change in the

      permit Borrower to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any
      other entity; or (d) sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of

      Trustor's business or permit Borrower to sell, lease, assign, transfer or
      otherwise dispose of a material part of Borrower's assets except in the
      ordinary course of Borrower's business.

6.6   ACCOUNTING RECORDS. Trustor shall maintain and cause Borrower to maintain
      adequate books and records in accordance with the same accounting standard
      used by Trustor or Borrower to prepare the financial statements delivered
      to and approved by Beneficiary in connection with the making of the Loan
      or other accounting standards approved by Beneficiary. Trustor shall
      permit and shall cause Borrower to permit any representative of
      Beneficiary, at any reasonable time and from time to time, upon reasonable
      prior notice to Trustor, to inspect, audit and examine such books and
      records and make copies of same.

6.7   COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Trustor shall pay to Beneficiary the
      full amount of all costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
      reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of Beneficiary's in-house or
      outside counsel, incurred by Beneficiary in connection with: (a)
      appraisals and inspections of the Property or Collateral required by
      Beneficiary as a result of (i) a Transfer or proposed Transfer (as defined
      below), or (ii) a Default; (b) appraisals and inspections of the Property
      or Collateral required by applicable law, including, without limitation,
      federal or state regulatory reporting requirements; and (c) any acts
      performed by Beneficiary at Trustor's request or wholly or partially for
      the benefit of Trustor (including, without limitation, the preparation or
      review of amendments, assumptions, waivers, releases, reconveyances,
      estoppel certificates or statements of amounts owing under any Secured
      Obligation). In connection with appraisals and inspections, Trustor
      specifically (but not by way of limitation) acknowledges that: (aa) a
      formal written appraisal of the Property by a state certified or licensed
      appraiser may be required by federal regulatory reporting requirements on
      an annual or more frequent basis; and (bb) Beneficiary may require
      inspection of the Property by an independent supervising architect, a cost
      engineering specialist, or both. Trustor shall pay all indebtedness
      arising under this Section immediately upon demand by Beneficiary together
      with interest thereon following notice of such indebtedness at the rate of
      interest then applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified
      therein.

6.8   LIENS, ENCUMBRANCES AND CHARGES. Subject to the terms of Section 8.4,
      Trustor shall immediately discharge by bonding or otherwise any lien,
      charge or other encumbrance which attaches to the Property in violation of
      Section 6.15. Subject to Trustor's right to contest such matters under
      this Deed of Trust or as expressly permitted in the Loan Documents,
      Trustor shall pay when due all obligations secured by or reducible to
      liens and encumbrances which shall now or hereafter encumber or appear to
      encumber all or any part of the Property or any interest therein, whether
      senior or subordinate hereto, including, without limitation, all claims
      for work or labor performed, or materials or supplies furnished, in
      connection with any work of demolition, alteration, repair, improvement or
      construction of or upon the Property, except such as Trustor may in good
      faith contest or as to which a bona fide dispute may arise (provided
      provision is made to the satisfaction of Beneficiary for eventual payment
      thereof in the event that Trustor is obligated to make such payment and
      that any recorded claim of lien, charge or other encumbrance against the
      Property is immediately discharged by bonding or otherwise).

6.9   TAXES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. Trustor shall pay and discharge when due any
      and all indebtedness, obligations, assessments and taxes, both real and
      personal and including federal and state income taxes and state and local
      property taxes and assessments. Trustor shall promptly provide to
      Beneficiary copies of all tax and assessment notices pertaining to the
      Property. Trustor hereby authorizes Beneficiary to obtain, at Trustor's


                                       15
<PAGE>
      expense, a tax service contract which shall provide tax information on the
      Property to Beneficiary for the term of the Loan and any extensions or
      renewals of the Loan.

6.10  INSURANCE COVERAGE. Trustor shall insure the Property against loss or
      damage by fire and such other hazards as Beneficiary shall from time to
      time require; provided, however, Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's election,
      may only require flood insurance if all or any portion of the improvements
      located on the Property is or becomes located in a special flood hazard
      area, and Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's election, may only require
      earthquake insurance if all or any portion of the Property is or becomes
      located in an earthquake fault zone. Trustor shall also carry public
      liability insurance and such other insurance as Beneficiary may reasonably
      require, including, without limitation, business interruption insurance or
      loss of rents insurance. Such policies shall contain a standard mortgage
      clause naming Beneficiary and its successors in interest as a loss payee
      and requiring at least 30 days prior notice to the holder at termination
      or cancellation. Trustor shall maintain all required insurance throughout
      the term of the Loan and while any liabilities of Borrower or Trustor to
      Beneficiary under any of the Loan Documents remain outstanding at
      Trustor's expense, with companies, and in substance and form satisfactory
      to Beneficiary. Neither Beneficiary nor Trustee, by reason of accepting,
      rejecting, approving or obtaining insurance shall incur any liability for:
      (a) the existence, nonexistence, form or legal sufficiency of any
      insurance; (b) the solvency of any insurer; or (c) the payment of claims.

6.11  CONDEMNATION AND INSURANCE PROCEEDS.

      a.    ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. Trustor absolutely and irrevocably assigns to
            Beneficiary all of the following rights, claims and amounts
            (collectively, "Claims"), all of which shall be paid to Beneficiary:
            (i) all awards of damages and all other compensation payable
            directly or indirectly by reason of a condemnation or proposed
            condemnation for public or private use affecting all or any part of,
            or any interest in, the Property; (ii) all other claims and awards
            for damages to or decrease in value of all or any part of, or any
            interest in, the Property; (iii) all proceeds of any insurance
            policies payable by reason of loss sustained to all or any part of
            the Property; and (iv) all interest which may accrue on any of the
            foregoing. Trustor shall give Beneficiary prompt written notice of
            the occurrence of any casualty affecting, or the institution of any
            proceedings for eminent domain or for the condemnation of, the
            Property or any portion thereof. So long as no Default has occurred
            and is continuing at the time, Trustor shall have the right to
            adjust, compromise and settle any Claim of $100,000 or less without
            the consent of Beneficiary, provided, however, all awards, proceeds
            and other sums described herein shall continue to be payable to
            Beneficiary. Beneficiary may commence, appear in, defend or
            prosecute any Claim exceeding $100,000, and may adjust, compromise
            and settle all Claims (except for Claims which Trustor may settle as
            provided herein), but shall not be responsible for any failure to
            commence, appear in, defend, prosecute or collect any such Claim
            regardless of the cause of the failure. All awards, proceeds and
            other sums described herein shall be payable to Beneficiary.

      b.    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; NO DEFAULT. So long as no Default has
            occurred and is continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of
            the proceeds of the Claims ("Proceeds") and no Default occurs
            thereafter, Beneficiary shall apply the Proceeds in the following
            order of priority: First, to Beneficiary's expenses in settling,
            prosecuting or defending the Claims; Second, to the repair or
            restoration of the Property; and Third, to Trustor if the repair or
            restoration of the Property has been completed, but to the Secured
            Obligations in any order without suspending, extending or reducing
            any obligation of Trustor to make installment payments if the repair
            or restoration of the Property has not been completed.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary shall have no obligation
            to make any Proceeds available for the repair or restoration of the
            Property unless and until all the following conditions have been
            satisfied: (i) delivery to Beneficiary of the Proceeds plus any
            additional amount which is needed to pay all costs of the repair or
            restoration (including, without limitation, taxes, financing
            charges, insurance and rent during the repair period); (ii)
            establishment of an arrangement for lien releases and disbursement
            of funds acceptable to Beneficiary; (iii) delivery to Beneficiary in
            form and content acceptable to Beneficiary of all of the following:
            (aa) plans and specifications for the work; (bb) a contract for the
            work, signed by a contractor acceptable to Beneficiary; (cc) a cost


                                       16
<PAGE>
            breakdown for the work; (dd) if reasonably required by Beneficiary,
            a payment and performance bond for the work; (ee) evidence of the
            continuation of substantially all Leases unless consented to in
            writing by Beneficiary; (ff) evidence that, upon completion of the
            work, the size, capacity, value, and income coverage ratios for the
            Property will be at least as great as those which existed
            immediately before the damage or condemnation occurred; and (gg)
            evidence of the satisfaction of any additional conditions that
            Beneficiary may reasonably establish to protect Beneficiary's
            security. Trustor acknowledges that the specific conditions
            described above are reasonable.

      c.    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; DEFAULT. If a Default has occurred and is
            continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of the Proceeds or
            if a Default occurs at any time thereafter, Beneficiary may, at
            Beneficiary's absolute discretion and regardless of any impairment
            of security or lack of impairment of security, but subject to
            applicable law governing use of the Proceeds, if any, apply all or
            any of the Proceeds to Beneficiary's expenses in settling,
            prosecuting or defending the Claims and then apply the balance to
            the Secured Obligations in any order without suspending, extending
            or reducing any obligation of Trustor to make installment payments,
            and may release all or any part of the Proceeds to Trustor upon any
            conditions Beneficiary chooses.

6.12  IMPOUNDS.

      a.    POST-DEFAULT IMPOUNDS. If required by Beneficiary at any time after
            a Default occurs (and regardless of whether such Default is
            thereafter cured), Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary such
            amounts ("Post-Default Impounds") on such dates (determined by
            Beneficiary as provided below) as will be sufficient to pay any or
            all "Costs" (as defined below) specified by Beneficiary. Beneficiary
            in its reasonable discretion shall estimate the amount of such Costs
            that will be payable or required during any period selected by
            Beneficiary not exceeding 1 year and shall determine the fractional
            portion thereof that Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary on each
            date specified by Beneficiary during such period. If the
            Post-Default Impounds paid by Trustor are not sufficient to pay the
            related Costs, Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary upon demand an
            amount equal to the deficiency. All Post-Default Impounds shall be
            payable by Trustor in addition to (but without duplication of) any
            other Impounds (as defined below).

      b.    ALL IMPOUNDS. Post-Default Impounds and any other impounds that may
            be payable by Borrower under the Note are collectively called
            "Impounds". All Impounds shall be deposited into one or more
            segregated or commingled accounts maintained by Beneficiary or its
            servicing agent. Except as otherwise provided in the Note, such
            account(s) shall not bear interest. Beneficiary shall not be a
            trustee, special depository or other fiduciary for Trustor with
            respect to such account, and the existence of such account shall not
            limit Beneficiary's rights under this Deed of Trust, any other
            agreement or any provision of law. If no Default exists, Beneficiary
            shall apply all Impounds to the payment of the related Costs, or in
            Beneficiary's sole discretion may release any or all Impounds to
            Trustor for application to and payment of such Costs. If a Default
            exists, Beneficiary may apply any or all Impounds to any Secured
            Obligation and/or to cure such Default, whereupon Trustor shall
            restore all Impounds so applied and cure all Defaults not cured by
            such application. The obligations of Trustor hereunder shall not be
            diminished by deposits of Impounds made by Trustor, except to the
            extent that such obligations have actually been met by application
            of such Impounds. Upon any assignment of this Deed of Trust,
            Beneficiary may assign all Impounds in its possession to
            Beneficiary's assignee, whereupon Beneficiary and Trustee shall be
            released from all liability with respect to such Impounds. Within 60
            days following full repayment of the Secured Obligations (other than
            as a consequence of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of
            foreclosure) or at such earlier time as Beneficiary may elect,
            Beneficiary shall pay to Trustor all Impounds in its possession, and
            no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. "Costs" means
            (i) all taxes and other liabilities payable by Trustor under Section
            6.9, (ii) all insurance premiums payable by Trustor under Section
            6.10, (iii) all other costs and expenses for which Impounds are
            required under the Note, and/or (iv) all other amounts that will be
            required to preserve the value of the Property. Trustor shall
            deliver to Beneficiary, promptly upon receipt, all bills for Costs
            for which Beneficiary has required Post-Default Impounds.


                                       17
<PAGE>
6.13  DEFENSE AND NOTICE OF LOSSES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS. Trustor shall protect,
      preserve and defend the Property and title to and right of possession of
      the Property, the security of this Deed of Trust and the rights and powers
      of Beneficiary and Trustee hereunder at Trustor's sole expense against all
      adverse claims, whether the claim: (a) is against a possessory or
      non-possessory interest; (b) arose prior or subsequent to the Effective
      Date; or (c) is senior or junior to Trustor's or Beneficiary's rights.
      Trustor shall give Beneficiary and Trustee prompt notice in writing of the
      assertion of any claim, of the filing of any action or proceeding, of the
      occurrence of any damage to the Property and of any condemnation offer or
      action.

6.14  RIGHT OF INSPECTION. Beneficiary and its independent contractors, agents
      and employees may enter the Property from time to time at any reasonable
      time upon reasonable prior notice to Trustor (except that such notice
      shall not be required in the event of an emergency) for the purpose of
      inspecting the Property and ascertaining Trustor's compliance with the
      terms of this Deed of Trust. Beneficiary shall use reasonable efforts to
      assure that Beneficiary's entry upon and inspection of the Property shall
      not materially and unreasonably interfere with the business or operations
      of Trustor or Trustor's tenants on the Property.

6.15  PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN TRUSTOR. Trustor
      acknowledges that Beneficiary has relied upon the principals of Trustor
      and Borrower and their experience in owning and operating properties
      similar to the Property in connection with the closing of the Loan.
      Accordingly, except with the prior written consent of Beneficiary or as
      otherwise expressly permitted in the Note, Trustor shall not: (a) cause or
      permit any sale, exchange, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment,
      encumbrance or other transfer, conveyance or disposition, whether
      voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law ("Transfer") of all or
      any part of, or all or any direct or indirect interest in, the Property or
      the Collateral (except for equipment and inventory in the ordinary course
      of its business); or (b) cause or permit a Transfer of any direct or
      indirect interest in any partnership, limited liability company,
      corporation, trust, or other entity comprising all or any portion of or
      holding any direct or indirect interest in Trustor or Borrower (other than
      the sale or exchange of a limited partnership interest or a non-managing
      membership interest). If any Transfer not expressly permitted in the Note
      or this Deed of Trust is made without the prior written consent of
      Beneficiary, Beneficiary shall have the absolute right at its option,
      without prior demand or notice, to declare all of the Secured Obligations
      immediately due and payable, except to the extent prohibited by law, and
      pursue its rights and remedies under Section 7.3 herein. Trustor agrees to
      pay any prepayment fee as set forth in the Note in the event the Secured
      Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the terms of this Section. Consent
      to one such Transfer shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to
      require the consent to future or successive Transfers. Except for
      Transfers expressly permitted under the Note, Beneficiary's consent to any
      Transfer may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in Beneficiary's sole and
      absolute discretion.

6.16  ACCEPTANCE OF TRUST; POWERS AND DUTIES OF TRUSTEE. Trustee accepts this
      trust when this Deed of Trust is recorded. From time to time and without
      affecting the personal liability of any person for payment of any
      indebtedness or performance of any Secured Obligation, Beneficiary, or
      Trustee at the direction of Beneficiary, may, without liability therefor
      and without notice: (a) reconvey all or any part of the Property; (b)
      consent to the making of any map or plat of the Property; (c) join with
      Trustor in granting any easement on the Property; (d) join with Trustor in
      any declaration of covenants and restrictions; or (e) join in any
      extension agreement or any agreement subordinating the lien or charge of
      this Deed of Trust. Nothing contained in the immediately preceding
      sentence shall be construed to limit, impair or otherwise affect the
      rights of Trustor in any respect. Except as may otherwise be required by
      applicable law, Trustee or Beneficiary may from time to time apply to any
      court of competent jurisdiction for aid and direction in the execution of
      the trusts hereunder and the enforcement of the rights and remedies
      available hereunder, and Trustee or Beneficiary may obtain orders or
      decrees directing or confirming or approving acts in the execution of said
      trusts and the enforcement of said remedies. Trustee has no obligation to
      notify any party of any pending sale or any action or proceeding
      (including, without limitation, actions in which Trustor, Beneficiary or
      Trustee shall be a party) unless held or commenced and maintained by
      Trustee under this Deed of Trust. Trustee shall not be obligated to
      perform any act required of it hereunder unless the performance of the act
      is requested in writing and Trustee is reasonably indemnified and held
      harmless against loss, cost, liability and expense.


                                       18

6.17  COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEE. Trustor shall pay to Trustee reasonable
      compensation and reimbursement for services and expenses in the
      administration of this trust, including, without limitation, reasonable
      attorneys' fees. Trustor shall pay all indebtedness arising under this
      Section immediately upon demand by Trustee or Beneficiary together with
      interest thereon from the date the indebtedness arises at the rate of
      interest then applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified
      therein.

6.18  EXCULPATION. Beneficiary shall not directly or indirectly be liable to
      Trustor or any other person as a consequence of: (a) the exercise of the
      rights, remedies or powers granted to Beneficiary in this Deed of Trust;
      (b) the failure or refusal of Beneficiary to perform or discharge any
      obligation or liability of Trustor under any agreement related to the
      Property or under this Deed of Trust; or (c) any loss sustained by Trustor
      or any third party resulting from Beneficiary's failure to lease the
      Property after a Default or from any other act or omission of Beneficiary
      in managing the Property after a Default unless the loss is caused by the
      willful misconduct and bad faith of Beneficiary and no such liability
      shall be asserted or enforced against Beneficiary, all such liability
      being expressly waived and released by Trustor.

6.19  INDEMNITY. Without in any way limiting any other indemnity contained in
      this Deed of Trust, Trustor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
      Trustee and the Beneficiary Group (as defined below) from and against any
      claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly
      arising out of: (a) the making of the Loan, except for violations of
      banking laws or regulations by the Beneficiary Group; (b) this Deed of
      Trust; (c) the execution of this Deed of Trust or the performance of any
      act required or permitted hereunder or by law; (d) any failure of Trustor
      to perform Trustor's obligations under this Deed of Trust or the other
      Loan Documents; (e) any alleged obligation or undertaking on the
      Beneficiary Group's part to perform or discharge any of the
      representations, warranties, conditions, covenants or other obligations
      contained in any other document related to the Property; (f) any act or
      omission by Trustor or any contractor, agent, employee or representative
      of Trustor with respect to the Property; or (g) any claim, loss, damage,
      cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising out of: (i) the
      use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, release, threatened
      release, discharge, disposal, transportation or presence of any Hazardous
      Materials which are found in, on, under or about the Property (including,
      without limitation, underground contamination); or (ii) the breach of any
      covenant, representation or warranty of Trustor under Sections 5.1.p,
      5.1.q, 5.1.r, or 6.2 above. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding,
      this indemnity shall not include any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
      liability directly or indirectly arising out of the gross negligence or
      willful misconduct of any member of the Beneficiary Group or Trustee, or
      any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the
      Beneficiary Group or Trustee arising from any act or incident on the
      Property occurring after the full reconveyance and release of the lien of
      this Deed of Trust on the Property, or with respect to the matters set
      forth in clause (g) above, any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
      liability incurred by the Beneficiary Group resulting from the
      introduction and initial release of Hazardous Materials on the Property
      occurring after the transfer of title to the Property at a foreclosure
      sale under this Deed of Trust, either pursuant to judicial decree or the
      power of sale, or by deed in lieu of such foreclosure. This indemnity
      shall include, without limitation: (aa) all consequential damages
      (including, without limitation, any third party tort claims or
      governmental claims, fines or penalties against Trustee or the Beneficiary
      Group); (bb) all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees (including,
      without limitation, expert witness fees) paid or incurred by Trustee or
      the Beneficiary Group; and (cc) the costs, whether foreseeable or
      unforeseeable, of any investigation, repair, cleanup or detoxification of
      the Property which is required by any governmental entity or is otherwise
      necessary to render the Property in compliance with all laws and
      regulations pertaining to Hazardous Materials. "Beneficiary Group", as
      used herein, shall mean (1) Beneficiary (including, without limitation,
      any participant in the Loan), (2) any entity controlling, controlled by or
      under common control with Beneficiary, (3) the directors, officers,
      employees and agents of Beneficiary and such other entities, and (4) the
      successors, heirs and assigns of the entities and persons described in
      foregoing clauses (1) through (3). Trustor shall pay immediately upon
      Trustee's or Beneficiary's demand any amounts owing under this indemnity
      together with interest from the date the indebtedness arises until paid at
      the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of the Note as
      specified therein. Trustor agrees to use legal counsel reasonably
      acceptable to Trustee and the Beneficiary Group in any action or
      proceeding arising under this indemnity. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION
      SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION AND


                                       19
<PAGE>
      RECONVEYANCE OF THIS DEED OF TRUST, BUT TRUSTOR'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS
      INDEMNITY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECTION IN THE NOTE
      ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

6.20  SUBSTITUTION OF TRUSTEE. From time to time, by a writing signed and
      acknowledged by Beneficiary, Beneficiary may appoint another trustee to
      act in the place and stead of Trustee or any successor. Such writing shall
      set forth any information required by law and shall be recorded in the
      Office of the Recorder of the County in which the Property is situated.
      Beneficiary shall give such additional notice as may be required by law.
      Such instrument of substitution and the compliance with any other
      requirements of applicable law shall discharge Trustee herein named and
      shall appoint the new trustee as the trustee hereunder with the same
      effect as if originally named trustee herein. A writing recorded pursuant
      to the provisions of this Section shall be conclusive proof of the proper
      substitution of such new trustee.

6.21  RELEASES, EXTENSIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY. Without
      notice to or the consent, approval or agreement of any persons or entities
      having any interest at any time in the Property or in any manner obligated
      under the Secured Obligations ("Interested Parties"), Beneficiary may,
      from time to time: (a) fully or partially release any person or entity
      from liability for the payment or performance of any Secured Obligation;
      (b) extend the maturity of any Secured Obligation; (c) make any agreement
      with Borrower increasing the amount or otherwise altering the terms of any
      Secured Obligation; (d) accept additional security for any Secured
      Obligation; or (e) release all or any portion of the Property, Collateral
      and other security for any Secured Obligation. None of the foregoing
      actions shall release or reduce the personal liability of any of said
      Interested Parties, or release or impair the priority of the lien of this
      Deed of Trust upon the Property.

6.22  SALE OR PARTICIPATION OF LOAN. Trustor agrees that Beneficiary may at any
      time sell, assign, participate or securitize all or any portion of
      Beneficiary's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, and that
      any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization may be to one
      or more financial institutions or other entities, to private investors,
      and/or into the public securities market, in Beneficiary's sole
      discretion. Trustor further agrees that Beneficiary may disseminate to any
      such actual or potential purchaser(s), assignee(s) or participant(s) all
      documents and financial and other information heretofore or hereafter
      provided to or known to Beneficiary with respect to: (a) the Property and
      its operation; and/or (b) any party connected with the Loan (including,
      without limitation, Trustor, any partner or member of Trustor, any
      constituent partner or member of Trustor, any guarantor and any
      nonborrower trustor). In the event of any such sale, assignment,
      participation or securitization, Beneficiary and the other parties to the
      same shall share in the rights and obligations of Beneficiary set forth in
      the Loan Documents as and to the extent they shall agree among themselves.
      In connection with any such sale, assignment, participation or
      securitization, Trustor further agrees that the Loan Documents shall be
      sufficient evidence of the obligations of Trustor to each purchaser,
      assignee or participant, and Trustor shall, within 15 days after request
      by Beneficiary, (x) deliver an estoppel certificate verifying for the
      benefit of Beneficiary and any other party designated by Beneficiary the
      status and the terms and provisions of the Loan in form and substance
      acceptable to Beneficiary, (y) provide any information, legal opinions or
      documents regarding Trustor, Guarantor (as defined in the Loan Documents),
      the Property and any tenants of the Property as Beneficiary or
      Beneficiary's rating agencies may reasonably request, and (z) enter into
      such amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents or the
      organizational documents of Trustor as may be reasonably required in order
      to facilitate any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization
      without impairing Trustor's rights or increasing Trustor's obligations.
      The indemnity obligations of Trustor under the Loan Documents shall also
      apply with respect to any purchaser, assignee or participant.

6.23  RECONVEYANCE. Upon Beneficiary's written request, and upon surrender of
      this Deed of Trust or certified copy thereof and any note, instrument or
      instruments setting forth all obligations secured hereby to Trustee for
      cancellation, Trustee shall reconvey, without warranty, the Property or
      that portion thereof then held hereunder. The recitals of any matters or
      facts in any reconveyance executed hereunder shall be conclusive proof of
      the truthfulness thereof. To the extent permitted by law, the reconveyance
      may describe the grantee as "the person or persons legally entitled
      thereto". Neither Beneficiary nor Trustee shall have any duty to determine
      the rights of persons claiming to be rightful grantees of any
      reconveyance. When the Property has been fully reconveyed,


                                       20
<PAGE>
      the last such reconveyance shall operate as a reassignment of all future
      rents, issues and profits of the Property to the person or persons legally
      entitled thereto.

6.24  SUBROGATION. Beneficiary shall be subrogated to the lien of all
      encumbrances, whether released of record or not, paid in whole or in part
      by Beneficiary pursuant to this Deed of Trust or by the proceeds of any
      loan secured by this Deed of Trust.

6.25  COMMUNITY FACILITIES DISTRICT. Without obtaining the prior written consent
      of Beneficiary, Trustor shall not consent to, or vote in favor of, the
      inclusion of all or any part of the Property in any Community Facilities
      District formed pursuant to the Community Facilities District Act, A.R.S.
      Section 48-701, et seq., as amended from time to time. Trustor shall
      immediately give notice to Beneficiary of any notification or advice that
      Trustor may receive from any municipality or other third party of any
      intent or proposal to include all or any part of the Property in a
      Community Facilities District. Beneficiary shall have the right to file a
      written objection to the inclusion of all or any part of the Property in a
      Community Facilities District, either in its own name or in the name of
      Trustor, and to appear at, and participate in, any hearing with respect to
      the formation of any such district.

6.26  MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. Without the prior written consent of Beneficiary,
      Trustor shall not terminate, modify, amend or enter into any agreement
      providing for the management, leasing or operation of the Property.
      Trustor represents, warrants and covenants that any existing management
      agreement includes, and any future management agreement entered into by
      Trustor shall include, a provision which provides that the management
      agreement is automatically terminated upon the transfer of the Property by
      Trustor, either by sale, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or
      otherwise, to Beneficiary or any other purchaser of the Property. Upon a
      Default under the Loan Documents or a default under any management
      agreement then in effect, which default is not cured within any applicable
      grace or cure period, Beneficiary shall have the right to terminate, or to
      direct Trustor to terminate, such management agreement upon thirty (30)
      days' written notice and to retain, or to direct Trustor to retain, a new
      management agent approved by Beneficiary.

7.1   DEFAULT. For all purposes hereof, "Default" shall mean either an "Optional
      Default" (as defined below) or an "Automatic Default" (as defined below).

      a.    OPTIONAL DEFAULT. An "Optional Default" shall occur, at
            Beneficiary's option, upon the occurrence of any of the following
            events:

            (i)   MONETARY. Borrower or Trustor shall fail to (aa) pay when due
                  any sums payable under the Loan Documents which by their
                  express terms require immediate payment without any grace
                  period or sums which are payable on the Maturity Date, or (bb)
                  pay within 5 days when due any other sums payable under the
                  Note, this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents,

                  the Note.

            (ii)  FAILURE TO PERFORM. Borrower or Trustor shall fail to observe,
                  perform or discharge any of Borrower's or Trustor's
                  obligations, covenants, conditions or agreements, other than
                  Borrower's or Trustor's payment obligations, under the Note,
                  this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, and
                  (aa) such failure shall remain uncured for 30 days after
                  written notice thereof shall have been given to Borrower or
                  Trustor, as the case may be, by Beneficiary or (bb) if such
                  failure is of such a nature that it cannot be cured within
                  such 30 day period, Borrower or Trustor shall fail to commence
                  to cure such failure within such 30 day period or shall fail
                  to diligently prosecute such curative action thereafter.

            (iii) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Any representation, warranty,
                  certificate or other statement (financial or otherwise) made
                  or furnished by or on behalf of Borrower, Trustor, or a
                  guarantor, if


                                       21
<PAGE>
                  any, to Beneficiary or in connection with any of the Loan
                  Documents, or as an inducement to Beneficiary to make the
                  Loan, shall be false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading in
                  any material respect when made or furnished.

            (iv)  CONDEMNATION; ATTACHMENT. The condemnation, seizure or
                  appropriation of any material portion (as reasonably
                  determined by Beneficiary) of the Property; or the
                  sequestration or attachment of, or levy or execution upon any
                  of the Property, the Collateral or any other collateral
                  provided by Borrower or Trustor under any of the Loan
                  Documents, or any material portion of the other assets of
                  Borrower or Trustor, which sequestration, attachment, levy or
                  execution is not released or dismissed within 45 days after
                  its occurrence; or the sale of any assets affected by any of
                  the foregoing.

            (v)   UNINSURED CASUALTY. The occurrence of an uninsured casualty
                  with respect to any material portion (as reasonably determined
                  by Beneficiary) of the Property unless: (aa) no other Default
                  has occurred and is continuing at the time of such casualty or
                  occurs thereafter; (bb) Trustor promptly notifies Beneficiary
                  of the occurrence of such casualty; and (cc) not more than 45
                  days after the occurrence of such casualty, Trustor delivers
                  to Beneficiary immediately available funds in an amount
                  sufficient, in Beneficiary's reasonable opinion, to pay all
                  costs of the repair or restoration (including, without
                  limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent
                  during the repair period). So long as no Default has occurred
                  and is continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of such
                  funds and no Default occurs thereafter, Beneficiary shall make
                  such funds available for the repair or restoration of the
                  Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary shall
                  have no obligation to make any funds available for repair or
                  restoration of the Property unless and until all the
                  conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the second
                  sentence of Section 6.11(b) of this Deed of Trust have been
                  satisfied. Trustor acknowledges that the specific conditions
                  described above are reasonable.

            (vi)  ADVERSE FINANCIAL CHANGE. Any material adverse change in the
                  financial condition of Borrower or any general partner or
                  managing member of Borrower, any guarantor, or any other
                  person or entity from the condition shown on the financial
                  statement(s) submitted to Beneficiary and relied upon by
                  Beneficiary in making the Loan, and which change Beneficiary
                  reasonably determines will have a material adverse effect on
                  (aa) the business, operations or condition of the Property; or
                  (bb) the ability of Borrower or Trustor to pay or perform
                  Borrower's or Trustor's obligations in accordance with the
                  terms of the Note, this Deed of Trust, and the other Loan
                  Documents.

                  under any other present or future state or federal law
                  regarding bankruptcy, reorganization or other relief to
                  debtors (collectively, "Debtor Relief Law"); or (bb)
                  Borrower's filing any pleading in any involuntary proceeding
                  under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law which
                  admits the jurisdiction of a court to regulate Borrower or the
                  Property or the petition's material allegations regarding
                  Borrower's insolvency; or (cc) Borrower's making a general
                  assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (dd) Borrower's
                  applying for, or the appointment of, a receiver, trustee,
                  custodian or liquidator of Borrower or any of its property; or

                                       22
<PAGE>
                  or in any way restrains or limits Borrower or Beneficiary
                  regarding the Loan or the Property, prior to the earlier of
                  the entry of any order granting relief sought in the
                  involuntary petition or 45 days after the date of filing of
                  the petition.

            (iii) PARTNERS, GUARANTORS. The occurrence of an event specified in

7.2   ACCELERATION. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Default, Beneficiary may,
      at its option, declare all sums owing to Beneficiary under the Note and
      the other Loan Documents immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence

            time and to do such acts and things as Beneficiary or Trustee deem
            necessary or desirable in order to inspect, investigate, assess and
            protect the security hereof or to cure any Default, including,

            Beneficiary's rights to enter and inspect the Property for Hazardous
            Materials; and/or (x) to employ legal counsel, accountants,

            instrument as a mortgage or to obtain specific enforcement of the
            covenants of Trustor hereunder, and Trustor agrees that such

            laches and any applicable statute of limitations;

      d.    NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE. To give such notice of Default and of
            election to cause the Property to be sold as may be required by law
            or as may be necessary to cause the Trustee to exercise the power of
            sale granted herein. Trustee shall give and record such notice as
            the law then requires as a condition precedent to a trustee's sale.
            When the minimum period of time required by law after such notice
            has elapsed, Trustee, without notice to or demand upon Trustor
            except as required by law, shall sell the Property at the time and
            place of sale fixed by it in the notice of sale, at one or several
            sales, either as a whole or in separate parcels and in such manner
            and order, as directed by Beneficiary, or by Trustor to the extent
            required by law, at public auction to the highest bidder for cash,
            in lawful money of the United States, payable at time of sale.
            Except as required by law, neither Trustor nor any other person or
            entity other than Beneficiary shall have the right to direct the
            order in which the Property is sold. Subject to requirements and
            limits imposed by law, Trustee may, from time to time postpone sale
            of all or any portion of the Property by public announcement at such
            time and place of sale, and from time to time may postpone the sale
            by public announcement at the time and place fixed by the preceding
            postponement. A sale of less than the whole of the Property or any
            defective or irregular sale made hereunder shall not exhaust the
            power of sale provided for herein. Trustee shall deliver to the
            purchaser at such sale a deed conveying the Property or portion
            thereof so sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express or
            implied. The recitals in the deed of any matters or facts shall be
            conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any person, including
            Trustee, Trustor or Beneficiary, may purchase at the sale.

            Upon sale of the Property at any judicial or nonjudicial
            foreclosure, Beneficiary may credit bid (as determined by
            Beneficiary in its sole and absolute discretion) all or any portion
            of the Secured Obligations. In determining such credit bid,
            Beneficiary may, but is not obligated to, take into account all or
            any of the following: (i) appraisals of the Property as such
            appraisals may be discounted or adjusted by Beneficiary in its sole
            and absolute underwriting discretion; (ii) expenses and costs
            incurred by Beneficiary with respect to the Property prior to
            foreclosure; (iii) expenses and costs which Beneficiary anticipates
            will be incurred with respect to the Property after foreclosure, but
            prior to resale, including, without limitation, costs of structural
            reports and other due diligence, costs to carry the Property prior
            to resale, costs of resale (e.g. commissions, attorneys' fees, and
            taxes), costs of any Hazardous Materials clean-up and monitoring,
            costs of deferred maintenance, repair, refurbishment and retrofit,
            costs of defending or settling litigation affecting the Property,
            and lost opportunity costs (if any), including the time value of
            money during any anticipated holding period by Beneficiary; (iv)
            declining trends in real property values generally and with respect
            to properties similar to the Property; (v) anticipated discounts
            upon resale of the Property as a distressed or foreclosed property;
            (vi) the fact of additional collateral (if any), for the Secured
            Obligations; and (vii) such other factors or matters that
            Beneficiary (in its sole and absolute discretion) deems appropriate.
            In regard to the above, Trustor acknowledges and agrees that: (viii)
            Beneficiary is not required to use any or all of the foregoing
            factors to determine the amount of its credit bid; (ix) this
            paragraph does not impose upon Beneficiary any additional
            obligations that are not imposed by law at the time the credit bid
            is made; (x) the amount of Beneficiary's credit bid need not have
            any relation to any loan-to-value ratios specified in the Loan
            Documents or previously discussed between Trustor and Beneficiary;
            and (xi) Beneficiary's credit bid may be (at Beneficiary's sole and
            absolute discretion) higher or lower than any appraised value of the
            Property;

      e.    MULTIPLE FORECLOSURES. To resort to and realize upon the security
            hereunder and any other security now or later held by Beneficiary
            concurrently or successively and in one or several consolidated or
            independent judicial actions or lawfully taken nonjudicial
            proceedings, or both, and to apply the proceeds received upon the
            Secured Obligations all in such order and manner as Beneficiary
            determines in its sole discretion;

      f.    RIGHTS TO COLLATERAL. To exercise all rights Trustee or Beneficiary
            may have with respect to the Collateral under this Deed of Trust,
            the UCC or otherwise at law; and


                                       24
<PAGE>
      g.    OTHER RIGHTS. To exercise such other rights as Trustee or
            Beneficiary may have at law or in equity or pursuant to the terms
            and conditions of this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan
            Documents.

      In connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Beneficiary may elect to
      treat any of the Property which consists of a right in action or which is
      property that can be severed from the Property (including, without
      limitation, any improvements forming a part thereof) without causing
      structural damage thereto as if the same were personal property or a
      fixture, as the case may be, and dispose of the same in accordance with
      applicable law, separate and apart from the sale of the Property. Any sale
      of Collateral hereunder shall be conducted in any manner permitted by the
      UCC.

7.4   APPLICATION OF FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS. If any foreclosure sale is
      effected, except as otherwise may be required by applicable law, Trustee
      shall apply the proceeds of such sale in the following order of priority:
      First, to the costs and expenses of exercising the power of sale and of
      sale, including the payment of the trustee's fees and reasonable
      attorneys' fees actually incurred; Second, to the payment of the contract
      or contracts secured; Third, to the payment of all other Secured
      Obligations; Fourth, to junior lienholders or encumbrancers in order of
      their priority; and Fifth, the remainder, if any, to the person or persons
      legally entitled thereto.

7.5   WAIVER OF MARSHALING RIGHTS. Trustor, for itself and for all parties
      claiming through or under Trustor, and for all parties who may acquire a
      lien on or interest in the Property, hereby waives all rights to have the
      Property and/or any other property, including, without limitation, the
      Collateral, which is now or later may be security for any Secured
      Obligation, marshaled upon any foreclosure of this Deed of Trust or on a
      foreclosure of any other security for any of the Secured Obligations.

7.6   NO CURE OR WAIVER. Neither Beneficiary's nor Trustee's nor any receiver's
      entry upon and taking possession of all or any part of the Property, nor
      any collection of rents, issues, profits, insurance proceeds, condemnation
      proceeds or damages, other security or proceeds of other security, or
      other sums, nor the application of any collected sum to any Secured
      Obligation, nor the exercise of any other right or remedy by Beneficiary
      or Trustee or any receiver shall cure or waive any Default or notice of
      default under this Deed of Trust, or nullify the effect of any notice of
      default or sale (unless all Secured Obligations then due have been paid or
      performed and Trustor has cured all other Defaults hereunder), or impair
      the status of the security, or prejudice Beneficiary or Trustee in the
      exercise of any right or remedy, or be construed as an affirmation by
      Beneficiary of any tenancy, lease or option or a subordination of the lien
      of this Deed of Trust.

7.7   PAYMENT OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Trustor agrees to pay to
      Beneficiary immediately and upon demand all costs and expenses incurred by
      Trustee and Beneficiary in the enforcement of the terms and conditions of
      this Deed of Trust (including, without limitation, statutory trustee's
      fees, court costs and attorneys' fees, whether incurred in litigation or
      not) with interest from the date of expenditure until said sums have been
      paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of the
      Note as specified therein.

7.8   POWER TO FILE NOTICES AND CURE DEFAULTS. Trustor hereby irrevocably
      appoints Beneficiary and its successors and assigns, as its
      attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, to perform any
      obligation of Trustor hereunder upon the occurrence of an event, act or
      omission which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a
      Default, provided, however, that: (a) Beneficiary as such attorney-in-fact
      shall only be accountable for such funds as are actually received by
      Beneficiary; and (b) Beneficiary shall not be liable to Trustor or any
      other person or entity for any failure to act under this Section.

7.9   REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights and remedies of Beneficiary and Trustee
      under this Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and
      are in addition to all rights and remedies provided by applicable law
      (including specifically that of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust as
      though it were a mortgage). Beneficiary may enforce any one or more
      remedies or rights under the Loan Documents either successively or
      concurrently.

                       ARTICLE 8. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

8.1   ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. The Loan Documents contain or incorporate by
      reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters
      contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations. The Loan
      Documents grant further rights to Beneficiary and contain further
      agreements and affirmative and negative covenants by Trustor which apply
      to this Deed of Trust and to the Property and such further rights and
      agreements are incorporated herein by this reference. THE OBLIGATIONS AND
      LIABILITIES OF TRUSTOR UNDER THIS DEED OF TRUST AND THE OTHER LOAN
      DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECTION IN THE NOTE
      ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

8.2   NON-WAIVER. By accepting payment of any amount secured hereby after its
      due date or late performance of any other Secured Obligation, Beneficiary
      shall not waive its right against any person obligated directly or
      indirectly hereunder or on any Secured Obligation, either to require
      prompt payment or performance when due of all other sums and obligations
      so secured or to declare default for failure to make such prompt payment
      or performance. No exercise of any right or remedy by Beneficiary or
      Trustee hereunder shall constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy
      herein contained or provided by law. No failure by Beneficiary or Trustee
      to exercise any right or remedy hereunder arising upon any Default shall
      be construed to prejudice Beneficiary's or Trustee's rights or remedies
      upon the occurrence of any other or subsequent Default. No delay by
      Beneficiary or Trustee in exercising any such right or remedy shall be
      construed to preclude Beneficiary or Trustee from the exercise thereof at
      any time while that Default is continuing. No notice to nor demand on
      Trustor shall of itself entitle Trustor to any other or further notice or
      demand in similar or other circumstances.

8.3   CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND EXPENSES. Wherever Beneficiary's consent,
      approval, acceptance or satisfaction is required under any provision of
      this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, such consent,
      approval, acceptance or satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld,
      conditioned or delayed by Beneficiary unless such provision expressly so
      provides. Wherever costs or expenses are required to be paid under any
      provision of this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, such
      costs or expenses shall be reasonable.

8.4   PERMITTED CONTESTS. After prior written notice to Beneficiary, Trustor may
      contest, by appropriate legal or other proceedings conducted in good faith
      and with due diligence, the amount, validity or application, in whole or
      in part, of any lien, levy, tax or assessment, or any lien of any laborer,
      mechanic, materialman, supplier or vendor, or the application to Trustor
      or the Property of any law or the validity thereof, the assertion or
      imposition of which, or the failure to pay when due, would constitute a
      Default; provided that (a) Trustor pursues the contest diligently, in a
      manner which Beneficiary determines is not prejudicial to Beneficiary, and
      does not impair the lien of this Deed of Trust; (b) the Property, or any
      part hereof or estate or interest therein, shall not be in any danger of
      being sold, forfeited or lost by reason of such proceedings; (c) in the
      case of the contest of any law or other legal requirement, Beneficiary
      shall not be in any danger of any civil or criminal liability; and (d) if
      required by Beneficiary, Trustor deposits with Beneficiary any funds or
      other forms of assurance (including a bond or letter of credit)
      satisfactory to Beneficiary to protect Beneficiary from the consequences
      of the contest being unsuccessful. Trustor's right to contest pursuant to
      the terms of this provision shall in no way relieve Trustor or Borrower of
      its obligations under the Loan or to make payments to Beneficiary as and
      when due.

8.5   FURTHER ASSURANCES. Trustor shall, upon demand by Beneficiary or Trustee,
      execute, acknowledge (if appropriate) and deliver any and all documents
      and instruments and do or cause to be done all further acts reasonably
      necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the Loan Documents
      and to perfect any assignments contained therein.

8.6   ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action, suit or proceeding is commenced
      between Trustor and Beneficiary regarding their respective rights and
      obligations under this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents,
      the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to damages
      or other relief, costs and expenses,


                                       26
<PAGE>
      reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs (including, without limitation,
      expert witness fees). Court costs and attorneys' fees shall be set by the
      court and not by a jury. As used herein the term "prevailing party" shall
      mean the party which obtains the principal relief it has sought, whether
      by compromise settlement or judgment. If the party which commenced or
      instituted the action, suit or proceeding shall dismiss or discontinue it
      without the concurrence of the other party, such other party shall be
      deemed the prevailing party.

8.7   TRUSTOR AND BENEFICIARY DEFINED. The term "Trustor" includes both the
      original Trustor and any subsequent owner or owners of any of the
      Property, and the term "Beneficiary" includes the original Beneficiary and
      any future owner or holder, including assignees, pledgees and
      participants, of the Note or any interest therein.

8.8   DISCLAIMERS.

      a.    RELATIONSHIP. The relationship of Trustor and Beneficiary under this
            Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents is, and shall at all
            times remain, solely that of borrower and lender; and Beneficiary
            neither undertakes nor assumes any responsibility or duty to Trustor
            or to any third party with respect to the Property. Notwithstanding
            any other provisions of this Deed of Trust and the other Loan
            Documents: (i) Beneficiary is not, and shall not be construed to be,
            a partner, joint venturer, member, alter ego, manager, controlling
            person or other business associate or participant of any kind of
            Trustor, and Beneficiary does not intend to ever assume such status;
            (ii) Beneficiary's activities in connection with this Deed of Trust
            and the other Loan Documents shall not be "outside the scope of
            activities of a lender of money" within the meaning of California
            Civil Code Section 3434, as amended or recodified from time to time,
            and Beneficiary does not intend to ever assume any responsibility to
            any person for the quality, suitability, safety or condition of the
            Property; and (iii) Beneficiary shall not be deemed responsible for
            or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions of Trustor.

      b.    NO LIABILITY. Beneficiary shall not be directly or indirectly liable
            or responsible for any loss, claim, cause of action, liability,
            indebtedness, damage or injury of any kind or character to any
            person or property arising from any construction on, or occupancy or
            use of, the Property, whether caused by or arising from: (i) any
            defect in any building, structure, grading, fill, landscaping or
            other improvements thereon or in any on-site or off-site improvement
            or other facility therein or thereon; (ii) any act or omission of
            Trustor or any of Trustor's agents, employees, independent
            contractors, licensees or invitees; (iii) any accident in or on the
            Property or any fire, flood or other casualty or hazard thereon;
            (iv) the failure of Trustor or any of Trustor's licensees,
            employees, invitees, agents, independent contractors or other
            representatives to maintain the Property in a safe condition; or (v)
            any nuisance made or suffered on any part of the Property.

8.9   SEVERABILITY. If any term of this Deed of Trust or any other Loan
      Document, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances,
      shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
      Deed of Trust or such other Loan Document, or the application of such term
      to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or
      unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term of this Deed
      of Trust or such other Loan Document shall be valid and enforceable to the
      fullest extent permitted by law. In addition, should this instrument be or
      become ineffective as a deed of trust, then these presents shall be
      construed and enforced as a realty mortgage with the Trustor being the
      mortgagor and Beneficiary being the mortgagee.

8.10  RELATIONSHIP OF ARTICLES. The rights, remedies and interests of
      Beneficiary under the deed of trust established by Article 1 and the
      security agreement established by Article 4 are independent and
      cumulative, and there shall be no merger of any lien created by the deed
      of trust with any security interest created by the security agreement.
      Beneficiary may elect to exercise or enforce any of its rights, remedies
      or interests under either or both the deed of trust or the security
      agreement as Beneficiary may from time to time deem


                                       27
<PAGE>
      appropriate. The absolute assignment of rents and leases established by
      Article 3 is similarly independent of and separate from the deed of trust
      and the security agreement.

8.11  MERGER. No merger shall occur as a result of Beneficiary's acquiring any
      other estate in, or any other lien on, the Property unless Beneficiary
      consents to a merger in writing.

8.12  OBLIGATIONS OF TRUSTOR, JOINT AND SEVERAL. If more than one person has
      executed this Deed of Trust as "Trustor", the obligations of all such
      persons hereunder shall be joint and several.

8.13  SEPARATE AND COMMUNITY PROPERTY. Any married person who executes this Deed
      of Trust as a "Trustor" agrees that any money judgment which Beneficiary
      or Trustee obtains pursuant to the terms of this Deed of Trust or any
      other obligation of that married person secured by this Deed of Trust may
      be collected by execution upon any separate property or community property
      of that person.

8.14  INTEGRATION; INTERPRETATION. The Loan Documents contain or expressly
      incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect
      to the matters contemplated therein and supersede all prior negotiations
      or agreements, written or oral. The Loan Documents shall not be modified
      except by written instrument executed by all parties. Any reference in any
      of the Loan Documents to the Property or Collateral shall include all or
      any part of the Property or Collateral. Any reference to the Loan
      Documents includes any amendments, renewals or extensions now or hereafter
      approved by Beneficiary in writing. When the identity of the parties or
      other circumstances make it appropriate, the masculine gender includes the
      feminine and/or neuter, and the singular number includes the plural.

8.15  CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall
      have the meanings set forth in the Note.

8.16  SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST. The terms, covenants, and conditions contained
      herein and in the other Loan Documents herein and in the other Loan
      Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs,
      successors and assigns of the parties. The foregoing sentence shall not be
      construed to permit Trustor to assign the Loan except as otherwise
      permitted under the Note or the other Loan Documents.

8.17  GOVERNING LAW. This Deed of Trust was accepted by Beneficiary in the state
      of California and the proceeds of the Note secured hereby were disbursed
      from the state of California, which state the parties agree has a
      substantial relationship to the parties and to the underlying transaction
      embodied hereby. Accordingly, in all respects, including, without limiting
      the generality of the foregoing, matters of construction, validity,
      enforceability and performance, this Deed of Trust, the Note and the other
      Loan Documents and the obligations arising hereunder and thereunder shall
      be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of
      California applicable to contracts made and performed in such state and
      any applicable law of the United States of America, except that at all
      times the provisions for enforcement of Beneficiary's STATUTORY POWER OF
      SALE and all other remedies granted hereunder and the creation, perfection
      and enforcement of the security interests created pursuant hereto and
      pursuant to the other Loan Documents in any Collateral which is located in
      the state where the Property is located shall be governed by and construed
      according to the law of the state where the Property is located. Except as
      provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Trustor hereby
      unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
      law, any claim to assert that the law of any jurisdiction other than
      California governs this Deed of Trust, the Note and other Loan Documents.

8.18  CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Trustor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction
      of: (a) any state or federal court sitting in the state of California over
      any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by Trustor against Beneficiary,
      arising out of or relating to this Deed of Trust, the Note or the Loan;
      (b) any state or federal court sitting in the state where the Property is
      located or the state in which Trustor's principal place of business is
      located over any suit, action or proceeding, brought by Beneficiary
      against Trustor, arising out of or relating to this Deed of Trust, the
      Note or the Loan; and (c) any state court sitting in the county of the
      state where the


                                       28
<PAGE>
      Property is located over any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by
      Beneficiary to exercise its STATUTORY POWER OF SALE under this Deed of
      Trust or any action brought by Beneficiary to enforce its rights with
      respect to the Collateral. Trustor irrevocably waives, to the fullest
      extent permitted by law, any objection that Trustor may now or hereafter
      have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action, or proceeding
      brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action, or
      proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
      forum.

8.19  EXHIBITS. Exhibit A is incorporated into this Deed of Trust by this
      reference.

8.20  ADDRESSES; REQUEST FOR NOTICE. All notices and other communications that
      are required or permitted to be given to a party under this Deed of Trust
      or the other Loan Documents shall be in writing, refer to the Loan number,
      and shall be sent to such party, either by personal delivery, by overnight
      delivery service, by certified first class mail, return receipt requested,
      or by facsimile transmission to the addressee or facsimile number below.
      All such notices and communications shall be effective upon receipt of

               ARTICLE 3. ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

3.1   ASSIGNMENT. Trustor irrevocably assigns to Beneficiary all of Trustor's
      right, title and interest in, to and under: (a) all present and future
      leases of the Property or any portion thereof, all licenses and agreements
      relating to the management, leasing or operation of the Property or any
      portion thereof, and all other agreements of any kind relating to the use
      or occupancy of the Property or any portion thereof, whether such leases,
      licenses and agreements are now existing or entered into after the date
      hereof ("Leases"); and (b) the rents, issues, deposits and profits of the
      Property, including, without limitation, all amounts payable and all
      rights and benefits accruing to Trustor under the Leases ("Payments"). The
      term "Leases" shall also include all guarantees of and security for the
      tenants' performance thereunder, and all amendments, extensions, renewals
      or modifications thereto which are permitted hereunder. This is a present
      and absolute assignment, not an assignment for security purposes only, and
      Beneficiary's right to the Leases and Payments is not contingent upon, and
      may be exercised without possession of, the Property.

3.2   GRANT OF LICENSE. Notwithstanding the terms contained in Section 3.1,
      Beneficiary confers upon Trustor a revocable license ("License") to
      collect and retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the
      occurrence of a Default (as hereinafter defined). Upon a Default, the
      License shall be automatically revoked and Beneficiary may collect and
      apply the Payments pursuant to the terms hereof without notice and without
      taking possession of the Property. All Payments thereafter collected by
      Trustor shall be held by Trustor as trustee under a constructive trust for
      the benefit of Beneficiary. Trustor hereby irrevocably authorizes and
      directs the tenants under the Leases, upon notice of a Default from
      Beneficiary, to rely upon and comply with any notice or demand by
      Beneficiary for the payment to Beneficiary of any rental or other sums
      which may at any time become due under the Leases, or for the performance
      of any of the tenants' undertakings under the Leases, and the tenants
      shall have no right or duty to inquire as to whether any Default has
      actually occurred or is then existing. Trustor hereby relieves the tenants
      from any liability to Trustor by reason of relying upon and complying with
      any such notice or demand by Beneficiary. Beneficiary may apply, in its
      sole discretion, any Payments so collected by Beneficiary against any
      Secured Obligation or any other obligation of Borrower, Trustor or any
      other person or entity, under any document or instrument related to or
      executed in connection with the Loan Documents, whether existing on the
      date hereof or hereafter arising. Collection of any Payments by
      Beneficiary shall not cure or waive any Default or notice of Default or
      invalidate any acts done pursuant to such notice. If and when no Default
      exists, Beneficiary shall re-confer the License upon Trustor until the
      occurrence of another Default.


                                       3
<PAGE>
3.3   EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT. The foregoing irrevocable assignment shall not cause
      Beneficiary to be: (a) a mortgagee in possession; (b) responsible or
      liable for the control, care, management or repair of the Property or for
      performing any of the terms, agreements, undertakings, obligations,
      representations, warranties, covenants and conditions of the Leases; (c)
      responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property by the
      tenants under any of the Leases or by any other parties; for any dangerous
      or defective condition of the Property; or for any negligence in the
      management, upkeep, repair or control of the Property resulting in loss or
      injury or death to any tenant, licensee, employee, invitee or other
      person; or (d) responsible for or impose upon Beneficiary any duty to
      produce rents or profits. Beneficiary shall not directly or indirectly be
      liable to Trustor or any other person as a consequence of: (e) the
      exercise of or failure to exercise any of the rights, remedies or powers
      granted to Beneficiary hereunder; or (f) the failure or refusal of
      Beneficiary to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of
      Trustor arising under the Leases.

      a.    ALL LEASES. Trustor shall, at Trustor's sole cost and expense:

            (i)   perform all obligations of the landlord under the Leases and
                  use reasonable efforts to enforce performance by the tenants
                  of all obligations of the tenants under the Leases;

            (ii)  use reasonable efforts to keep the Property leased at all
                  times to tenants whom Trustor reasonably and in good faith
                  believes are creditworthy at rents not less than the fair
                  market rental value (including, but not limited to, free or
                  discounted rents to the extent the market so requires);

            (iii) promptly upon Beneficiary's request, deliver to Beneficiary a
                  copy of each requested Lease and all amendments thereto and
                  waivers thereof; and

            (iv)  promptly upon Beneficiary's request, execute and record any
                  additional assignments of landlord's interest under any Lease
                  to Beneficiary and specific subordinations of any Lease to
                  this Deed of Trust, in form and substance satisfactory to
                  Beneficiary.

            Unless consented to in writing by Beneficiary or otherwise permitted
            under any other provision of the Loan Documents, Trustor shall not:

            (v)   grant any tenant under any Lease any option, right of first
                  refusal or other right to purchase all or any portion of the
                  Property under any circumstances;

            (vi)  grant any tenant under any Lease any right to prepay rent more
                  than 1 month in advance;

            (vii) except upon Beneficiary's request, execute any assignment of
                  landlord's interest in any Lease; or

           (viii) collect rent or other sums due under any Lease in advance,
                  other than to collect rent 1 month in advance of the time when
                  it becomes due.

            Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this
            Section shall be null and void.

            Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary any sums received by Trustor
            in consideration of any termination, modification or amendment of
            any Lease or any release or discharge of any tenant under any Lease
            from any obligation thereunder and any such sums received by Trustor
            shall be held in trust by Trustor for such purpose. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, so long as no Default exists, the portion of any such
            sum received by Trustor with respect to any Lease which is less than
            $50,000 shall be payable to Trustor. All such sums received by
            Beneficiary with respect to any Lease shall be deemed "Impounds" (as
            defined in Section 6.12b) and shall be deposited by Beneficiary into
            a pledged account in accordance with Section 6.12b. If no Default
            exists, Beneficiary shall release such Impounds to Trustor from time
            to time


                                       4

            as necessary to pay or reimburse Trustor for such tenant
            improvements, brokerage commissions and other leasing costs as may
            be required to re-tenant the affected space; provided, however,
            Beneficiary shall have received and approved each of the following
            for each tenant for which such costs were incurred; (1) Trustor's
            written request for such release, including the name of the tenant,
            the location and net rentable area of the space and a description
            and cost breakdown of the tenant improvements or other leasing costs
            covered by the request; (2) Trustor's certification that any tenant
            improvements have been completed lien-free and in a workmanlike
            manner; (3) a fully executed Lease, or extension or renewal of the
            current Lease; (4) an estoppel certificate executed by the tenant
            including its acknowledgement that all tenant improvements have been
            satisfactorily completed; and (5) such other information with
            respect to such costs as Beneficiary may require. Following the
            re-tenanting of all affected space (including, without limitation,
            the completion of all tenant improvements), and provided no Default
            exists, Beneficiary shall release any remaining such Impounds
            relating to the affected space to Trustor. Trustor shall construct
            all tenant improvements in a workmanlike manner and in accordance
            with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

      b.    MAJOR LEASES. Trustor shall, at Trustor's sole cost and expense,
            give Beneficiary prompt written notice of any material default by
            landlord or tenant under any Major Lease (as defined below). Unless
            consented to in writing by Beneficiary or otherwise permitted under
            any other provision of the Loan Documents, Trustor shall not:

            (i)   enter into any Major Lease which (aa) is not on fair market
                  terms (which terms may include free or discounted rent to the
                  extent the market so requires); (bb) does not contain a
                  provision requiring the tenant to execute and deliver to the
                  landlord an estoppel certificate in form and substance
                  satisfactory to the landlord promptly upon the landlord's
                  request; or (cc) allows the tenant to assign or sublet the
                  premises without the landlord's consent;

            (ii)  reduce any rent or other sums due from the tenant under any
                  Major Lease;

            (iii) terminate or materially modify or amend any Major Lease; or

            (iv)  release or discharge the tenant or any guarantor under any
                  Major Lease from any material obligation thereunder.

            Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this
            Section shall be null and void.

            "Major Lease", as used herein, shall mean any Lease, which is, at
            any time: (1) a Lease of more than 20% of the total rentable area of
            the Property, as reasonably determined by Beneficiary; or (2) a
            Lease which generates a gross base monthly rent exceeding 20% of the
            total gross base monthly rent generated by all Leases (excluding all
            Leases under which the tenant is then in default), as reasonably
            determined by Beneficiary. Trustor's obligations with respect to
            Major Leases shall be governed by the provisions of Section 3.4a as
            well as by the provisions of this Section.

      c.    FAILURE TO DENY REQUEST. Beneficiary's failure to deny any written
            request by Trustor for Beneficiary's consent under the provisions of
            Sections 3.4(a) or 3.4(b) within 10 Business Days after
            Beneficiary's receipt of such request (and all documents and
            information reasonably related thereto) shall be deemed to
            constitute Beneficiary's consent to such request.

3.5   RIGHT OF SUBORDINATION. Beneficiary may at any time and from time to time
      by specific written instrument intended for the purpose unilaterally
      subordinate the lien of this Deed of Trust to any Lease, without joinder
      or consent of, or notice to, Trustor, any tenant or any other person.
      Notice is hereby given to each tenant under a Lease of such right to
      subordinate. No subordination referred to in this Section shall constitute
      a subordination to any lien or other encumbrance, whenever arising, or
      improve the right of any junior lienholder. Nothing herein shall be
      construed as subordinating this Deed of Trust to any Lease.

            arising from or related to the Property or any business now or
            hereafter conducted thereon by Trustor; all permits, consents,
            approvals, licenses, authorizations and other rights granted by,
            given by or obtained from, any governmental entity with respect to
            the Property; all deposits or other security now or hereafter made
            with or given to utility companies by Trustor with respect to the
            Property; all advance payments of insurance premiums made by Trustor
            with respect to the Property; all plans, drawings and specifications

      As to all of the above described personal property which is or which
      hereafter becomes a "fixture" under applicable law, this Deed of Trust
      constitutes a fixture filing under the Arizona Uniform Commercial Code, as
      amended or recodified from time to time ("UCC").

4.2   COVENANTS. Trustor agrees: (a) to execute and deliver such documents as
      Beneficiary reasonably deems necessary to create, perfect and continue the
      security interests contemplated hereby; (b) not to change its name, and,
      as applicable, its chief executive offices, its principal residence or the
      jurisdiction in which it is organized without giving Beneficiary at least
      30 days' prior written notice thereof; and (c) to cooperate with
      Beneficiary in perfecting all security interests granted herein and in
      obtaining such agreements from third parties as Beneficiary deems
      necessary, proper or convenient in connection with the preservation,
      perfection or enforcement of any of Beneficiary's rights hereunder.

4.3   RIGHTS OF BENEFICIARY. In addition to Beneficiary's rights as a "Secured
      Party" under the UCC, Beneficiary may, but shall not be obligated to, at
      any time without notice and at the expense of Trustor: (a) give notice to
      any person of Beneficiary's rights hereunder and enforce such rights at
      law or in equity; (b) insure, protect, defend and preserve the Collateral
      or any rights or interests of Beneficiary therein; and (c) inspect the
      Collateral during normal business hours upon reasonable prior written
      notice, provided, however, that such notice shall not be required in the
      event of an emergency. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall
      Beneficiary be deemed to have accepted any property other than cash in
      satisfaction of any obligation of Trustor to Beneficiary unless
      Beneficiary shall make an express written election of said remedy under
      the UCC or other applicable law.


                                       6

4.4   ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF BENEFICIARY UPON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of a
      Default, then in addition to all of Beneficiary's rights as a "Secured
      Party" under the UCC or otherwise at law:

      a.    DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL. Beneficiary may: (i) upon written notice,
            require Trustor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to
            Beneficiary at a place reasonably designated by Beneficiary; (ii)
            without prior notice (to the extent permitted by law), enter upon
            the Property or other place where the Collateral may be located and
            take possession of, collect, sell, lease, license and otherwise
            dispose of the Collateral, and store the same at locations
            acceptable to Beneficiary at Trustor's expense; or (iii) sell,
            assign and deliver the Collateral at any place or in any lawful
            manner and bid and become purchaser at any such sales; and

      b.    OTHER RIGHTS. Beneficiary may, for the account of Trustor and at
            Trustor's expense: (i) operate, use, consume, sell, lease, license
            or otherwise dispose of the Collateral as Beneficiary reasonably
            deems appropriate for the purpose of performing any or all of the
            Secured Obligations; (ii) enter into any agreement, compromise or
            settlement including insurance claims, which Beneficiary may
            reasonably deem desirable or proper with respect to the Collateral;
            and (iii) endorse and deliver evidences of title for, and receive,
            enforce and collect by legal action or otherwise, all indebtedness
            and obligations now or hereafter owing to Trustor in connection with
            or on account of the Collateral.

      Trustor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the Collateral in
      accordance with Beneficiary's rights and remedies as heretofore provided
      is a disposition thereof in a commercially reasonable manner and that 5
      Business Days prior notice of such disposition is commercially reasonable
      notice. Beneficiary shall have no obligation to process or prepare the
      Collateral for sale or other disposition. In disposing of the Collateral,
      Beneficiary may disclaim all warranties of title, possession, quiet
      enjoyment and the like. Any proceeds of any sale or other disposition of
      the Collateral may be applied by Beneficiary first to the reasonable
      expenses incurred by Beneficiary in connection therewith, including,
      without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, and then
      to the payment of the Secured Obligations, in such order of application as
      Beneficiary may from time to time elect.

4.5   POWER OF ATTORNEY. Trustor hereby irrevocably appoints Beneficiary as
      Trustor's attorney-in-fact (such agency being coupled with an interest),
      and as such attorney-in-fact, Beneficiary may, without the obligation to
      do so, in Beneficiary's name or in the name of Trustor, prepare, execute,
      file and record financing statements, continuation statements,
      applications for registration and like papers necessary to create, perfect
      or preserve any of Beneficiary's security interests and rights in or to
      the Collateral, and upon a Default, take any other action required of
      Trustor; provided, however, that Beneficiary as such attorney-in-fact
      shall be accountable only for such funds as are actually received by
      Beneficiary.

                    ARTICLE 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

5.1   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Trustor represents and warrants to
      Beneficiary that, to Trustor's current actual knowledge after reasonable
      investigation and inquiry, the following statements are true and correct
      as of the Effective Date:

      a.    LEGAL STATUS. Trustor and Borrower are duly organized and existing
            and in good standing under the laws of the state(s) in which Trustor
            and Borrower are organized. Trustor and Borrower are qualified or
            licensed to do business in all jurisdictions in which such
            qualification or licensing is required.

      b.    PERMITS. Trustor and Borrower possess all permits, franchises and
            licenses and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and
            fictitious names, if any, necessary to enable Trustor and Borrower
            to conduct the business(es) in which Trustor and Borrower are now
            engaged in compliance with applicable law.


                                       7
<PAGE>
      c.    AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The execution and delivery of the Loan
            Documents have been duly authorized and the Loan Documents
            constitute valid and binding obligations of Trustor, Borrower or the
            party which executed the same, enforceable in accordance with their
            respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
            bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting the
            enforcement of creditors' rights, or by the application of rules of
            equity .

      d.    VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance by Trustor and
            Borrower of each of the Loan Documents do not violate any provision
            of any law or regulation, or result in any breach or default under
            any contract, obligation, indenture or other instrument to which
            Trustor or Borrower is a party or by which Trustor or Borrower is
            bound.

      e.    LITIGATION. There are no pending or threatened actions, claims,
            investigations, suits or proceedings before any governmental
            authority, court or administrative agency which may adversely affect
            the financial condition or operations of Trustor or Borrower other
            than those previously disclosed in writing by Trustor or Borrower to
            Beneficiary.

      f.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements of Trustor and
            Borrower, of each general partner (if Trustor or Borrower is a
            partnership), of each member (if Trustor or Borrower is a limited
            liability company) and of each guarantor, if any, previously
            delivered by Trustor or Borrower to Beneficiary: (i) are materially
            complete and correct; (ii) present fairly the financial condition of
            such party; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with the same
            accounting standard used by Trustor or Borrower to prepare the
            financial statements delivered to and approved by Beneficiary in
            connection with the making of the Loan, or other accounting
            standards approved by Beneficiary. Since the date of such financial
            statements, there has been no material adverse change in such
            financial condition, nor have any assets or properties reflected on
            such financial statements been sold, transferred, assigned,
            mortgaged, pledged or encumbered except as previously disclosed in
            writing by Trustor or Borrower to Beneficiary and approved in
            writing by Beneficiary.

      g.    REPORTS. All reports, documents, instruments and information
            delivered to Beneficiary in connection with the Loan: (i) are
            correct in all material respects and sufficiently complete to give
            Beneficiary accurate knowledge of their subject matter; and (ii) do
            not contain any misrepresentation of a material fact or omission of
            a material fact which omission makes the provided information
            misleading.

      h.    INCOME TAXES. There are no material pending assessments or
            adjustments of Trustor's or Borrower's income tax payable with
            respect to any year.

      i.    SUBORDINATION. There is no agreement or instrument to which Borrower
            is a party or by which Borrower is bound that would require the
            subordination in right of payment of any of Borrower's obligations
            under the Note to an obligation owed to another party.

      j.    TITLE. Trustor lawfully holds and possesses fee simple title to the
            Property, without limitation on the right to encumber same. This
            Deed of Trust is a first lien on the Property prior and superior to
            all other liens and encumbrances on the Property except: (i) liens
            for real estate taxes and assessments not yet due and payable; (ii)
            senior exceptions previously approved by Beneficiary and shown in
            the title insurance policy insuring the lien of this Deed of Trust;
            and (iii) other matters, if any, previously disclosed to Beneficiary
            by Trustor in a writing specifically referring to this
            representation and warranty.

      k.    MECHANICS' LIENS. There are no mechanics' or similar liens or claims
            which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are
            outstanding that under law could give rise to any such liens)
            affecting the Property which are or may be prior to or equal to the
            lien of this Deed of Trust, other than those (if any) previously
            approved by Beneficiary and shown on the title insurance policy
            insuring the lien of this Deed of Trust.


                                       8
<PAGE>
      l.    ENCROACHMENTS. Except as shown in the survey, if any, previously
            delivered to Beneficiary, none of the buildings or other
            improvements which were included for the purpose of determining the
            appraised value of the Property lies outside of the boundaries or
            building restriction lines of the Property and no buildings or other
            improvements located on adjoining properties encroach upon the
            Property.

      m.    LEASES. All existing Leases are in full force and effect and are
            enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. Except as
            disclosed on a rent roll provided to Beneficiary prior to the date
            hereof, no material breach or default by any party, or event which
            would constitute a material breach or default by any party after
            notice or the passage of time, or both, exists under any existing
            Lease. None of the landlord's interests under any of the Leases,
            including, but not limited to, rents, additional rents, charges,
            issues or profits, has been transferred or assigned. Except as
            disclosed on a rent roll provided to Beneficiary prior to the date
            hereof, no rent or other payment under any existing Lease has been

            (i) the discovery of any Hazardous Materials on, under or about the

            required by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 726.5; and

            (together with any indemnity applicable to a breach of any such
            representation and warranty) with respect to the environmental
            condition of the Property is intended by Beneficiary and Trustor to
            be an "environmental provision" for purposes of California Code of
            Civil Procedure Section 736.

6.3   COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Trustor shall comply with all federal, state and
      local laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Property, including,
      without limitation, all zoning and building requirements and all
      requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.
      Section 12101 et seq.), as amended from time to time. Trustor shall
      possess and maintain or cause Borrower to possess and maintain in full
      force and effect at all times (a) all certificates of occupancy and other
      licenses, permits and authorizations required by applicable law for the
      existing use of the Property and (b) all permits, franchises and licenses
      and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and fictitious
      names, if any, required by applicable law for Trustor and Borrower to
      conduct the business(es) in which Trustor and Borrower are now engaged.

6.4   LITIGATION. Trustor shall promptly notify Beneficiary in writing of any
      litigation pending or threatened in writing against Trustor or Borrower
      claiming damages in excess of $100,000 and of all pending or threatened

      litigation against Trustor or Borrower if the aggregate damage claims
      against Trustor or Borrower exceed $500,000.

6.5   MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, TRANSFER OF ASSETS. Trustor shall not: (a) merge or
      consolidate with any other entity or permit Borrower to merge or

      Trustor's business or permit Borrower to sell, lease, assign, transfer or
      otherwise dispose of a material part of Borrower's assets except in the
      ordinary course of Borrower's business.

6.6   ACCOUNTING RECORDS. Trustor shall maintain and cause Borrower to maintain
      adequate books and records in accordance with the same accounting standard
      used by Trustor or Borrower to prepare the financial statements delivered
      to and approved by Beneficiary in connection with the making of the Loan
      or other accounting standards approved by Beneficiary. Trustor shall
      permit and shall cause Borrower to permit any representative of
      Beneficiary, at any reasonable time and from time to time, upon reasonable
      prior notice to Trustor, to inspect, audit and examine such books and
      records and make copies of same.

6.7   COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Trustor shall pay to Beneficiary the
      full amount of all costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
      reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of Beneficiary's in-house or
      outside counsel, incurred by Beneficiary in connection with: (a)
      appraisals and inspections of the Property or Collateral required by
      Beneficiary as a result of (i) a Transfer or proposed Transfer (as defined
      below), or (ii) a Default; (b) appraisals and inspections of the Property
      or Collateral required by applicable law, including, without limitation,
      federal or state regulatory reporting requirements; and (c) any acts
      performed by Beneficiary at Trustor's request or wholly or partially for
      the benefit of Trustor (including, without limitation, the preparation or
      review of amendments, assumptions, waivers, releases, reconveyances,
      estoppel certificates or statements of amounts owing under any Secured
      Obligation). In connection with appraisals and inspections, Trustor
      specifically (but not by way of limitation) acknowledges that: (aa) a
      formal written appraisal of the Property by a state certified or licensed
      appraiser may be required by federal regulatory reporting requirements on
      an annual or more frequent basis; and (bb) Beneficiary may require
      inspection of the Property by an independent supervising architect, a cost
      engineering specialist, or both. Trustor shall pay all indebtedness
      arising under this Section immediately upon demand by Beneficiary together
      with interest thereon following notice of such indebtedness at the rate of
      interest then applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified
      therein.

6.8   LIENS, ENCUMBRANCES AND CHARGES. Subject to the terms of Section 8.4,
      Trustor shall immediately discharge by bonding or otherwise any lien,
      charge or other encumbrance which attaches to the Property in violation of
      Section 6.15. Subject to Trustor's right to contest such matters under
      this Deed of Trust or as expressly permitted in the Loan Documents,
      Trustor shall pay when due all obligations secured by or reducible to
      liens and encumbrances which shall now or hereafter encumber or appear to
      encumber all or any part of the Property or any interest therein, whether
      senior or subordinate hereto, including, without limitation, all claims
      for work or labor performed, or materials or supplies furnished, in
      connection with any work of demolition, alteration, repair, improvement or
      construction of or upon the Property, except such as Trustor may in good
      faith contest or as to which a bona fide dispute may arise (provided
      provision is made to the satisfaction of Beneficiary for eventual payment
      thereof in the event that Trustor is obligated to make such payment and
      that any recorded claim of lien, charge or other encumbrance against the
      Property is immediately discharged by bonding or otherwise).

6.9   TAXES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. Trustor shall pay and discharge when due any
      and all indebtedness, obligations, assessments and taxes, both real and
      personal and including federal and state income taxes and state and local
      property taxes and assessments. Trustor shall promptly provide to
      Beneficiary copies of all tax and assessment notices pertaining to the
      Property. Trustor hereby authorizes Beneficiary to obtain, at Trustor's


                                       15
<PAGE>
      expense, a tax service contract which shall provide tax information on the
      Property to Beneficiary for the term of the Loan and any extensions or
      renewals of the Loan.

6.10  INSURANCE COVERAGE. Trustor shall insure the Property against loss or
      damage by fire and such other hazards as Beneficiary shall from time to
      time require; provided, however, Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's election,
      may only require flood insurance if all or any portion of the improvements
      located on the Property is or becomes located in a special flood hazard
      area, and Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's election, may only require
      earthquake insurance if all or any portion of the Property is or becomes
      located in an earthquake fault zone. Trustor shall also carry public
      liability insurance and such other insurance as Beneficiary may reasonably
      require, including, without limitation, business interruption insurance or
      loss of rents insurance. Such policies shall contain a standard mortgage
      clause naming Beneficiary and its successors in interest as a loss payee
      and requiring at least 30 days prior notice to the holder at termination
      or cancellation. Trustor shall maintain all required insurance throughout
      the term of the Loan and while any liabilities of Borrower or Trustor to
      Beneficiary under any of the Loan Documents remain outstanding at
      Trustor's expense, with companies, and in substance and form satisfactory
      to Beneficiary. Neither Beneficiary nor Trustee, by reason of accepting,
      rejecting, approving or obtaining insurance shall incur any liability for:
      (a) the existence, nonexistence, form or legal sufficiency of any
      insurance; (b) the solvency of any insurer; or (c) the payment of claims.

6.11  CONDEMNATION AND INSURANCE PROCEEDS.

      a.    ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. Trustor absolutely and irrevocably assigns to
            Beneficiary all of the following rights, claims and amounts
            (collectively, "Claims"), all of which shall be paid to Beneficiary:
            (i) all awards of damages and all other compensation payable
            directly or indirectly by reason of a condemnation or proposed
            condemnation for public or private use affecting all or any part of,
            or any interest in, the Property; (ii) all other claims and awards
            for damages to or decrease in value of all or any part of, or any
            interest in, the Property; (iii) all proceeds of any insurance
            policies payable by reason of loss sustained to all or any part of
            the Property; and (iv) all interest which may accrue on any of the
            foregoing. Trustor shall give Beneficiary prompt written notice of
            the occurrence of any casualty affecting, or the institution of any
            proceedings for eminent domain or for the condemnation of, the
            Property or any portion thereof. So long as no Default has occurred
            and is continuing at the time, Trustor shall have the right to
            adjust, compromise and settle any Claim of $100,000 or less without
            the consent of Beneficiary, provided, however, all awards, proceeds
            and other sums described herein shall continue to be payable to
            Beneficiary. Beneficiary may commence, appear in, defend or
            prosecute any Claim exceeding $100,000, and may adjust, compromise
            and settle all Claims (except for Claims which Trustor may settle as
            provided herein), but shall not be responsible for any failure to
            commence, appear in, defend, prosecute or collect any such Claim
            regardless of the cause of the failure. All awards, proceeds and
            other sums described herein shall be payable to Beneficiary.

      b.    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; NO DEFAULT. So long as no Default has
            occurred and is continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of
            the proceeds of the Claims ("Proceeds") and no Default occurs
            thereafter, Beneficiary shall apply the Proceeds in the following
            order of priority: First, to Beneficiary's expenses in settling,
            prosecuting or defending the Claims; Second, to the repair or
            restoration of the Property; and Third, to Trustor if the repair or
            restoration of the Property has been completed, but to the Secured
            Obligations in any order without suspending, extending or reducing
            any obligation of Trustor to make installment payments if the repair
            or restoration of the Property has not been completed.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary shall have no obligation
            to make any Proceeds available for the repair or restoration of the
            Property unless and until all the following conditions have been
            satisfied: (i) delivery to Beneficiary of the Proceeds plus any
            additional amount which is needed to pay all costs of the repair or
            restoration (including, without limitation, taxes, financing
            charges, insurance and rent during the repair period); (ii)
            establishment of an arrangement for lien releases and disbursement
            of funds acceptable to Beneficiary; (iii) delivery to Beneficiary in
            form and content acceptable to Beneficiary of all of the following:
            (aa) plans and specifications for the work; (bb) a contract for the
            work, signed by a contractor acceptable to Beneficiary; (cc) a cost


                                       16
<PAGE>
            breakdown for the work; (dd) if reasonably required by Beneficiary,
            a payment and performance bond for the work; (ee) evidence of the
            continuation of substantially all Leases unless consented to in
            writing by Beneficiary; (ff) evidence that, upon completion of the
            work, the size, capacity, value, and income coverage ratios for the
            Property will be at least as great as those which existed
            immediately before the damage or condemnation occurred; and (gg)
            evidence of the satisfaction of any additional conditions that
            Beneficiary may reasonably establish to protect Beneficiary's
            security. Trustor acknowledges that the specific conditions
            described above are reasonable.

      c.    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; DEFAULT. If a Default has occurred and is
            continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of the Proceeds or
            if a Default occurs at any time thereafter, Beneficiary may, at
            Beneficiary's absolute discretion and regardless of any impairment
            of security or lack of impairment of security, but subject to
            applicable law governing use of the Proceeds, if any, apply all or
            any of the Proceeds to Beneficiary's expenses in settling,
            prosecuting or defending the Claims and then apply the balance to
            the Secured Obligations in any order without suspending, extending
            or reducing any obligation of Trustor to make installment payments,
            and may release all or any part of the Proceeds to Trustor upon any
            conditions Beneficiary chooses.

6.12  IMPOUNDS.

      a.    POST-DEFAULT IMPOUNDS. If required by Beneficiary at any time after
            a Default occurs (and regardless of whether such Default is
            thereafter cured), Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary such
            amounts ("Post-Default Impounds") on such dates (determined by
            Beneficiary as provided below) as will be sufficient to pay any or
            all "Costs" (as defined below) specified by Beneficiary. Beneficiary
            in its reasonable discretion shall estimate the amount of such Costs
            that will be payable or required during any period selected by
            Beneficiary not exceeding 1 year and shall determine the fractional
            portion thereof that Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary on each
            date specified by Beneficiary during such period. If the
            Post-Default Impounds paid by Trustor are not sufficient to pay the
            related Costs, Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary upon demand an
            amount equal to the deficiency. All Post-Default Impounds shall be
            payable by Trustor in addition to (but without duplication of) any
            other Impounds (as defined below).

      b.    ALL IMPOUNDS. Post-Default Impounds and any other impounds that may
            be payable by Borrower under the Note are collectively called
            "Impounds". All Impounds shall be deposited into one or more
            segregated or commingled accounts maintained by Beneficiary or its
            servicing agent. Except as otherwise provided in the Note, such
            account(s) shall not bear interest. Beneficiary shall not be a
            trustee, special depository or other fiduciary for Trustor with
            respect to such account, and the existence of such account shall not
            limit Beneficiary's rights under this Deed of Trust, any other
            agreement or any provision of law. If no Default exists, Beneficiary
            shall apply all Impounds to the payment of the related Costs, or in
            Beneficiary's sole discretion may release any or all Impounds to
            Trustor for application to and payment of such Costs. If a Default
            exists, Beneficiary may apply any or all Impounds to any Secured
            Obligation and/or to cure such Default, whereupon Trustor shall
            restore all Impounds so applied and cure all Defaults not cured by
            such application. The obligations of Trustor hereunder shall not be
            diminished by deposits of Impounds made by Trustor, except to the
            extent that such obligations have actually been met by application
            of such Impounds. Upon any assignment of this Deed of Trust,
            Beneficiary may assign all Impounds in its possession to
            Beneficiary's assignee, whereupon Beneficiary and Trustee shall be
            released from all liability with respect to such Impounds. Within 60
            days following full repayment of the Secured Obligations (other than
            as a consequence of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of
            foreclosure) or at such earlier time as Beneficiary may elect,
            Beneficiary shall pay to Trustor all Impounds in its possession, and
            no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. "Costs" means
            (i) all taxes and other liabilities payable by Trustor under Section
            6.9, (ii) all insurance premiums payable by Trustor under Section
            6.10, (iii) all other costs and expenses for which Impounds are
            required under the Note, and/or (iv) all other amounts that will be
            required to preserve the value of the Property. Trustor shall
            deliver to Beneficiary, promptly upon receipt, all bills for Costs
            for which Beneficiary has required Post-Default Impounds.


                                       17
<PAGE>
6.13  DEFENSE AND NOTICE OF LOSSES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS. Trustor shall protect,
      preserve and defend the Property and title to and right of possession of
      the Property, the security of this Deed of Trust and the rights and powers
      of Beneficiary and Trustee hereunder at Trustor's sole expense against all
      adverse claims, whether the claim: (a) is against a possessory or
      non-possessory interest; (b) arose prior or subsequent to the Effective
      Date; or (c) is senior or junior to Trustor's or Beneficiary's rights.
      Trustor shall give Beneficiary and Trustee prompt notice in writing of the
      assertion of any claim, of the filing of any action or proceeding, of the
      occurrence of any damage to the Property and of any condemnation offer or
      action.

6.14  RIGHT OF INSPECTION. Beneficiary and its independent contractors, agents
      and employees may enter the Property from time to time at any reasonable
      time upon reasonable prior notice to Trustor (except that such notice
      shall not be required in the event of an emergency) for the purpose of
      inspecting the Property and ascertaining Trustor's compliance with the
      terms of this Deed of Trust. Beneficiary shall use reasonable efforts to
      assure that Beneficiary's entry upon and inspection of the Property shall
      not materially and unreasonably interfere with the business or operations
      of Trustor or Trustor's tenants on the Property.

6.15  PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN TRUSTOR. Trustor
      acknowledges that Beneficiary has relied upon the principals of Trustor
      and Borrower and their experience in owning and operating properties
      similar to the Property in connection with the closing of the Loan.
      Accordingly, except with the prior written consent of Beneficiary or as
      otherwise expressly permitted in the Note, Trustor shall not: (a) cause or
      permit any sale, exchange, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment,
      encumbrance or other transfer, conveyance or disposition, whether
      voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law ("Transfer") of all or
      any part of, or all or any direct or indirect interest in, the Property or
      the Collateral (except for equipment and inventory in the ordinary course
      of its business); or (b) cause or permit a Transfer of any direct or
      indirect interest in any partnership, limited liability company,
      corporation, trust, or other entity comprising all or any portion of or
      holding any direct or indirect interest in Trustor or Borrower (other than
      the sale or exchange of a limited partnership interest or a non-managing
      membership interest). If any Transfer not expressly permitted in the Note
      or this Deed of Trust is made without the prior written consent of
      Beneficiary, Beneficiary shall have the absolute right at its option,
      without prior demand or notice, to declare all of the Secured Obligations
      immediately due and payable, except to the extent prohibited by law, and
      pursue its rights and remedies under Section 7.3 herein. Trustor agrees to
      pay any prepayment fee as set forth in the Note in the event the Secured
      Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the terms of this Section. Consent
      to one such Transfer shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to
      require the consent to future or successive Transfers. Except for
      Transfers expressly permitted under the Note, Beneficiary's consent to any
      Transfer may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in Beneficiary's sole and
      absolute discretion.

6.16  ACCEPTANCE OF TRUST; POWERS AND DUTIES OF TRUSTEE. Trustee accepts this
      trust when this Deed of Trust is recorded. From time to time and without
      affecting the personal liability of any person for payment of any
      indebtedness or performance of any Secured Obligation, Beneficiary, or
      Trustee at the direction of Beneficiary, may, without liability therefor
      and without notice: (a) reconvey all or any part of the Property; (b)
      consent to the making of any map or plat of the Property; (c) join with
      Trustor in granting any easement on the Property; (d) join with Trustor in
      any declaration of covenants and restrictions; or (e) join in any
      extension agreement or any agreement subordinating the lien or charge of
      this Deed of Trust. Nothing contained in the immediately preceding
      sentence shall be construed to limit, impair or otherwise affect the
      rights of Trustor in any respect. Except as may otherwise be required by
      applicable law, Trustee or Beneficiary may from time to time apply to any
      court of competent jurisdiction for aid and direction in the execution of
      the trusts hereunder and the enforcement of the rights and remedies
      available hereunder, and Trustee or Beneficiary may obtain orders or
      decrees directing or confirming or approving acts in the execution of said
      trusts and the enforcement of said remedies. Trustee has no obligation to
      notify any party of any pending sale or any action or proceeding
      (including, without limitation, actions in which Trustor, Beneficiary or
      Trustee shall be a party) unless held or commenced and maintained by
      Trustee under this Deed of Trust. Trustee shall not be obligated to
      perform any act required of it hereunder unless the performance of the act
      is requested in writing and Trustee is reasonably indemnified and held
      harmless against loss, cost, liability and expense.


                                       18

6.17  COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEE. Trustor shall pay to Trustee reasonable
      compensation and reimbursement for services and expenses in the
      administration of this trust, including, without limitation, reasonable
      attorneys' fees. Trustor shall pay all indebtedness arising under this
      Section immediately upon demand by Trustee or Beneficiary together with
      interest thereon from the date the indebtedness arises at the rate of
      interest then applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified
      therein.

6.18  EXCULPATION. Beneficiary shall not directly or indirectly be liable to
      Trustor or any other person as a consequence of: (a) the exercise of the
      rights, remedies or powers granted to Beneficiary in this Deed of Trust;
      (b) the failure or refusal of Beneficiary to perform or discharge any
      obligation or liability of Trustor under any agreement related to the
      Property or under this Deed of Trust; or (c) any loss sustained by Trustor
      or any third party resulting from Beneficiary's failure to lease the
      Property after a Default or from any other act or omission of Beneficiary
      in managing the Property after a Default unless the loss is caused by the
      willful misconduct and bad faith of Beneficiary and no such liability
      shall be asserted or enforced against Beneficiary, all such liability
      being expressly waived and released by Trustor.

6.19  INDEMNITY. Without in any way limiting any other indemnity contained in
      this Deed of Trust, Trustor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
      Trustee and the Beneficiary Group (as defined below) from and against any
      claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly
      arising out of: (a) the making of the Loan, except for violations of
      banking laws or regulations by the Beneficiary Group; (b) this Deed of
      Trust; (c) the execution of this Deed of Trust or the performance of any
      act required or permitted hereunder or by law; (d) any failure of Trustor
      to perform Trustor's obligations under this Deed of Trust or the other
      Loan Documents; (e) any alleged obligation or undertaking on the
      Beneficiary Group's part to perform or discharge any of the
      representations, warranties, conditions, covenants or other obligations
      contained in any other document related to the Property; (f) any act or
      omission by Trustor or any contractor, agent, employee or representative
      of Trustor with respect to the Property; or (g) any claim, loss, damage,
      cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising out of: (i) the
      use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, release, threatened
      release, discharge, disposal, transportation or presence of any Hazardous
      Materials which are found in, on, under or about the Property (including,
      without limitation, underground contamination); or (ii) the breach of any
      covenant, representation or warranty of Trustor under Sections 5.1.p,
      5.1.q, 5.1.r, or 6.2 above. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding,
      this indemnity shall not include any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
      liability directly or indirectly arising out of the gross negligence or
      willful misconduct of any member of the Beneficiary Group or Trustee, or
      any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the
      Beneficiary Group or Trustee arising from any act or incident on the
      Property occurring after the full reconveyance and release of the lien of
      this Deed of Trust on the Property, or with respect to the matters set
      forth in clause (g) above, any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
      liability incurred by the Beneficiary Group resulting from the
      introduction and initial release of Hazardous Materials on the Property
      occurring after the transfer of title to the Property at a foreclosure
      sale under this Deed of Trust, either pursuant to judicial decree or the
      power of sale, or by deed in lieu of such foreclosure. This indemnity
      shall include, without limitation: (aa) all consequential damages
      (including, without limitation, any third party tort claims or
      governmental claims, fines or penalties against Trustee or the Beneficiary
      Group); (bb) all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees (including,
      without limitation, expert witness fees) paid or incurred by Trustee or
      the Beneficiary Group; and (cc) the costs, whether foreseeable or
      unforeseeable, of any investigation, repair, cleanup or detoxification of
      the Property which is required by any governmental entity or is otherwise
      necessary to render the Property in compliance with all laws and
      regulations pertaining to Hazardous Materials. "Beneficiary Group", as
      used herein, shall mean (1) Beneficiary (including, without limitation,
      any participant in the Loan), (2) any entity controlling, controlled by or
      under common control with Beneficiary, (3) the directors, officers,
      employees and agents of Beneficiary and such other entities, and (4) the
      successors, heirs and assigns of the entities and persons described in
      foregoing clauses (1) through (3). Trustor shall pay immediately upon
      Trustee's or Beneficiary's demand any amounts owing under this indemnity
      together with interest from the date the indebtedness arises until paid at
      the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of the Note as
      specified therein. Trustor agrees to use legal counsel reasonably
      acceptable to Trustee and the Beneficiary Group in any action or
      proceeding arising under this indemnity. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION
      SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION AND


                                       19
<PAGE>
      RECONVEYANCE OF THIS DEED OF TRUST, BUT TRUSTOR'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS
      INDEMNITY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECTION IN THE NOTE
      ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

6.20  SUBSTITUTION OF TRUSTEE. From time to time, by a writing signed and
      acknowledged by Beneficiary, Beneficiary may appoint another trustee to
      act in the place and stead of Trustee or any successor. Such writing shall
      set forth any information required by law and shall be recorded in the
      Office of the Recorder of the County in which the Property is situated.
      Beneficiary shall give such additional notice as may be required by law.
      Such instrument of substitution and the compliance with any other
      requirements of applicable law shall discharge Trustee herein named and
      shall appoint the new trustee as the trustee hereunder with the same
      effect as if originally named trustee herein. A writing recorded pursuant
      to the provisions of this Section shall be conclusive proof of the proper
      substitution of such new trustee.

6.21  RELEASES, EXTENSIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY. Without
      notice to or the consent, approval or agreement of any persons or entities
      having any interest at any time in the Property or in any manner obligated
      under the Secured Obligations ("Interested Parties"), Beneficiary may,
      from time to time: (a) fully or partially release any person or entity
      from liability for the payment or performance of any Secured Obligation;
      (b) extend the maturity of any Secured Obligation; (c) make any agreement
      with Borrower increasing the amount or otherwise altering the terms of any
      Secured Obligation; (d) accept additional security for any Secured
      Obligation; or (e) release all or any portion of the Property, Collateral
      and other security for any Secured Obligation. None of the foregoing
      actions shall release or reduce the personal liability of any of said
      Interested Parties, or release or impair the priority of the lien of this
      Deed of Trust upon the Property.

6.22  SALE OR PARTICIPATION OF LOAN. Trustor agrees that Beneficiary may at any
      time sell, assign, participate or securitize all or any portion of
      Beneficiary's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, and that
      any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization may be to one
      or more financial institutions or other entities, to private investors,
      and/or into the public securities market, in Beneficiary's sole
      discretion. Trustor further agrees that Beneficiary may disseminate to any
      such actual or potential purchaser(s), assignee(s) or participant(s) all
      documents and financial and other information heretofore or hereafter
      provided to or known to Beneficiary with respect to: (a) the Property and
      its operation; and/or (b) any party connected with the Loan (including,
      without limitation, Trustor, any partner or member of Trustor, any
      constituent partner or member of Trustor, any guarantor and any
      nonborrower trustor). In the event of any such sale, assignment,
      participation or securitization, Beneficiary and the other parties to the
      same shall share in the rights and obligations of Beneficiary set forth in
      the Loan Documents as and to the extent they shall agree among themselves.
      In connection with any such sale, assignment, participation or
      securitization, Trustor further agrees that the Loan Documents shall be
      sufficient evidence of the obligations of Trustor to each purchaser,
      assignee or participant, and Trustor shall, within 15 days after request
      by Beneficiary, (x) deliver an estoppel certificate verifying for the
      benefit of Beneficiary and any other party designated by Beneficiary the
      status and the terms and provisions of the Loan in form and substance
      acceptable to Beneficiary, (y) provide any information, legal opinions or
      documents regarding Trustor, Guarantor (as defined in the Loan Documents),
      the Property and any tenants of the Property as Beneficiary or
      Beneficiary's rating agencies may reasonably request, and (z) enter into
      such amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents or the
      organizational documents of Trustor as may be reasonably required in order
      to facilitate any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization
      without impairing Trustor's rights or increasing Trustor's obligations.
      The indemnity obligations of Trustor under the Loan Documents shall also
      apply with respect to any purchaser, assignee or participant.

6.23  RECONVEYANCE. Upon Beneficiary's written request, and upon surrender of
      this Deed of Trust or certified copy thereof and any note, instrument or
      instruments setting forth all obligations secured hereby to Trustee for
      cancellation, Trustee shall reconvey, without warranty, the Property or
      that portion thereof then held hereunder. The recitals of any matters or
      facts in any reconveyance executed hereunder shall be conclusive proof of
      the truthfulness thereof. To the extent permitted by law, the reconveyance
      may describe the grantee as "the person or persons legally entitled
      thereto". Neither Beneficiary nor Trustee shall have any duty to determine
      the rights of persons claiming to be rightful grantees of any
      reconveyance. When the Property has been fully reconveyed,


                                       20
<PAGE>
      the last such reconveyance shall operate as a reassignment of all future
      rents, issues and profits of the Property to the person or persons legally
      entitled thereto.

6.24  SUBROGATION. Beneficiary shall be subrogated to the lien of all
      encumbrances, whether released of record or not, paid in whole or in part
      by Beneficiary pursuant to this Deed of Trust or by the proceeds of any
      loan secured by this Deed of Trust.

6.25  COMMUNITY FACILITIES DISTRICT. Without obtaining the prior written consent
      of Beneficiary, Trustor shall not consent to, or vote in favor of, the
      inclusion of all or any part of the Property in any Community Facilities
      District formed pursuant to the Community Facilities District Act, A.R.S.
      Section 48-701, et seq., as amended from time to time. Trustor shall
      immediately give notice to Beneficiary of any notification or advice that
      Trustor may receive from any municipality or other third party of any
      intent or proposal to include all or any part of the Property in a
      Community Facilities District. Beneficiary shall have the right to file a
      written objection to the inclusion of all or any part of the Property in a
      Community Facilities District, either in its own name or in the name of
      Trustor, and to appear at, and participate in, any hearing with respect to
      the formation of any such district.

6.26  MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. Without the prior written consent of Beneficiary,
      Trustor shall not terminate, modify, amend or enter into any agreement
      providing for the management, leasing or operation of the Property.
      Trustor represents, warrants and covenants that any existing management
      agreement includes, and any future management agreement entered into by
      Trustor shall include, a provision which provides that the management
      agreement is automatically terminated upon the transfer of the Property by
      Trustor, either by sale, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or
      otherwise, to Beneficiary or any other purchaser of the Property. Upon a
      Default under the Loan Documents or a default under any management
      agreement then in effect, which default is not cured within any applicable
      grace or cure period, Beneficiary shall have the right to terminate, or to
      direct Trustor to terminate, such management agreement upon thirty (30)
      days' written notice and to retain, or to direct Trustor to retain, a new
      management agent approved by Beneficiary.

7.1   DEFAULT. For all purposes hereof, "Default" shall mean either an "Optional
      Default" (as defined below) or an "Automatic Default" (as defined below).

      a.    OPTIONAL DEFAULT. An "Optional Default" shall occur, at
            Beneficiary's option, upon the occurrence of any of the following
            events:

            (i)   MONETARY. Borrower or Trustor shall fail to (aa) pay when due
                  any sums payable under the Loan Documents which by their
                  express terms require immediate payment without any grace
                  period or sums which are payable on the Maturity Date, or (bb)
                  pay within 5 days when due any other sums payable under the
                  Note, this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents,

                  the Note.

            (ii)  FAILURE TO PERFORM. Borrower or Trustor shall fail to observe,
                  perform or discharge any of Borrower's or Trustor's
                  obligations, covenants, conditions or agreements, other than
                  Borrower's or Trustor's payment obligations, under the Note,
                  this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, and
                  (aa) such failure shall remain uncured for 30 days after
                  written notice thereof shall have been given to Borrower or
                  Trustor, as the case may be, by Beneficiary or (bb) if such
                  failure is of such a nature that it cannot be cured within
                  such 30 day period, Borrower or Trustor shall fail to commence
                  to cure such failure within such 30 day period or shall fail
                  to diligently prosecute such curative action thereafter.

            (iii) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Any representation, warranty,
                  certificate or other statement (financial or otherwise) made
                  or furnished by or on behalf of Borrower, Trustor, or a
                  guarantor, if


                                       21
<PAGE>
                  any, to Beneficiary or in connection with any of the Loan
                  Documents, or as an inducement to Beneficiary to make the
                  Loan, shall be false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading in
                  any material respect when made or furnished.

            (iv)  CONDEMNATION; ATTACHMENT. The condemnation, seizure or
                  appropriation of any material portion (as reasonably
                  determined by Beneficiary) of the Property; or the
                  sequestration or attachment of, or levy or execution upon any
                  of the Property, the Collateral or any other collateral
                  provided by Borrower or Trustor under any of the Loan
                  Documents, or any material portion of the other assets of
                  Borrower or Trustor, which sequestration, attachment, levy or
                  execution is not released or dismissed within 45 days after
                  its occurrence; or the sale of any assets affected by any of
                  the foregoing.

            (v)   UNINSURED CASUALTY. The occurrence of an uninsured casualty
                  with respect to any material portion (as reasonably determined
                  by Beneficiary) of the Property unless: (aa) no other Default
                  has occurred and is continuing at the time of such casualty or
                  occurs thereafter; (bb) Trustor promptly notifies Beneficiary
                  of the occurrence of such casualty; and (cc) not more than 45
                  days after the occurrence of such casualty, Trustor delivers
                  to Beneficiary immediately available funds in an amount
                  sufficient, in Beneficiary's reasonable opinion, to pay all
                  costs of the repair or restoration (including, without
                  limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent
                  during the repair period). So long as no Default has occurred
                  and is continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of such
                  funds and no Default occurs thereafter, Beneficiary shall make
                  such funds available for the repair or restoration of the
                  Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary shall
                  have no obligation to make any funds available for repair or
                  restoration of the Property unless and until all the
                  conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the second
                  sentence of Section 6.11(b) of this Deed of Trust have been
                  satisfied. Trustor acknowledges that the specific conditions
                  described above are reasonable.

            (vi)  ADVERSE FINANCIAL CHANGE. Any material adverse change in the
                  financial condition of Borrower or any general partner or
                  managing member of Borrower, any guarantor, or any other
                  person or entity from the condition shown on the financial
                  statement(s) submitted to Beneficiary and relied upon by
                  Beneficiary in making the Loan, and which change Beneficiary
                  reasonably determines will have a material adverse effect on
                  (aa) the business, operations or condition of the Property; or
                  (bb) the ability of Borrower or Trustor to pay or perform
                  Borrower's or Trustor's obligations in accordance with the
                  terms of the Note, this Deed of Trust, and the other Loan
                  Documents.

                  under any other present or future state or federal law
                  regarding bankruptcy, reorganization or other relief to
                  debtors (collectively, "Debtor Relief Law"); or (bb)
                  Borrower's filing any pleading in any involuntary proceeding
                  under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law which
                  admits the jurisdiction of a court to regulate Borrower or the
                  Property or the petition's material allegations regarding
                  Borrower's insolvency; or (cc) Borrower's making a general
                  assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (dd) Borrower's
                  applying for, or the appointment of, a receiver, trustee,
                  custodian or liquidator of Borrower or any of its property; or

                                       22
<PAGE>
                  or in any way restrains or limits Borrower or Beneficiary
                  regarding the Loan or the Property, prior to the earlier of
                  the entry of any order granting relief sought in the
                  involuntary petition or 45 days after the date of filing of
                  the petition.

            (iii) PARTNERS, GUARANTORS. The occurrence of an event specified in

7.2   ACCELERATION. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Default, Beneficiary may,
      at its option, declare all sums owing to Beneficiary under the Note and
      the other Loan Documents immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence

            time and to do such acts and things as Beneficiary or Trustee deem
            necessary or desirable in order to inspect, investigate, assess and
            protect the security hereof or to cure any Default, including,

            Beneficiary's rights to enter and inspect the Property for Hazardous
            Materials; and/or (x) to employ legal counsel, accountants,

            instrument as a mortgage or to obtain specific enforcement of the
            covenants of Trustor hereunder, and Trustor agrees that such

            laches and any applicable statute of limitations;

      d.    NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE. To give such notice of Default and of
            election to cause the Property to be sold as may be required by law
            or as may be necessary to cause the Trustee to exercise the power of
            sale granted herein. Trustee shall give and record such notice as
            the law then requires as a condition precedent to a trustee's sale.
            When the minimum period of time required by law after such notice
            has elapsed, Trustee, without notice to or demand upon Trustor
            except as required by law, shall sell the Property at the time and
            place of sale fixed by it in the notice of sale, at one or several
            sales, either as a whole or in separate parcels and in such manner
            and order, as directed by Beneficiary, or by Trustor to the extent
            required by law, at public auction to the highest bidder for cash,
            in lawful money of the United States, payable at time of sale.
            Except as required by law, neither Trustor nor any other person or
            entity other than Beneficiary shall have the right to direct the
            order in which the Property is sold. Subject to requirements and
            limits imposed by law, Trustee may, from time to time postpone sale
            of all or any portion of the Property by public announcement at such
            time and place of sale, and from time to time may postpone the sale
            by public announcement at the time and place fixed by the preceding
            postponement. A sale of less than the whole of the Property or any
            defective or irregular sale made hereunder shall not exhaust the
            power of sale provided for herein. Trustee shall deliver to the
            purchaser at such sale a deed conveying the Property or portion
            thereof so sold, but without any covenant or warranty, express or
            implied. The recitals in the deed of any matters or facts shall be
            conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. Any person, including
            Trustee, Trustor or Beneficiary, may purchase at the sale.

            Upon sale of the Property at any judicial or nonjudicial
            foreclosure, Beneficiary may credit bid (as determined by
            Beneficiary in its sole and absolute discretion) all or any portion
            of the Secured Obligations. In determining such credit bid,
            Beneficiary may, but is not obligated to, take into account all or
            any of the following: (i) appraisals of the Property as such
            appraisals may be discounted or adjusted by Beneficiary in its sole
            and absolute underwriting discretion; (ii) expenses and costs
            incurred by Beneficiary with respect to the Property prior to
            foreclosure; (iii) expenses and costs which Beneficiary anticipates
            will be incurred with respect to the Property after foreclosure, but
            prior to resale, including, without limitation, costs of structural
            reports and other due diligence, costs to carry the Property prior
            to resale, costs of resale (e.g. commissions, attorneys' fees, and
            taxes), costs of any Hazardous Materials clean-up and monitoring,
            costs of deferred maintenance, repair, refurbishment and retrofit,
            costs of defending or settling litigation affecting the Property,
            and lost opportunity costs (if any), including the time value of
            money during any anticipated holding period by Beneficiary; (iv)
            declining trends in real property values generally and with respect
            to properties similar to the Property; (v) anticipated discounts
            upon resale of the Property as a distressed or foreclosed property;
            (vi) the fact of additional collateral (if any), for the Secured
            Obligations; and (vii) such other factors or matters that
            Beneficiary (in its sole and absolute discretion) deems appropriate.
            In regard to the above, Trustor acknowledges and agrees that: (viii)
            Beneficiary is not required to use any or all of the foregoing
            factors to determine the amount of its credit bid; (ix) this
            paragraph does not impose upon Beneficiary any additional
            obligations that are not imposed by law at the time the credit bid
            is made; (x) the amount of Beneficiary's credit bid need not have
            any relation to any loan-to-value ratios specified in the Loan
            Documents or previously discussed between Trustor and Beneficiary;
            and (xi) Beneficiary's credit bid may be (at Beneficiary's sole and
            absolute discretion) higher or lower than any appraised value of the
            Property;

      e.    MULTIPLE FORECLOSURES. To resort to and realize upon the security
            hereunder and any other security now or later held by Beneficiary
            concurrently or successively and in one or several consolidated or
            independent judicial actions or lawfully taken nonjudicial
            proceedings, or both, and to apply the proceeds received upon the
            Secured Obligations all in such order and manner as Beneficiary
            determines in its sole discretion;

      f.    RIGHTS TO COLLATERAL. To exercise all rights Trustee or Beneficiary
            may have with respect to the Collateral under this Deed of Trust,
            the UCC or otherwise at law; and


                                       24
<PAGE>
      g.    OTHER RIGHTS. To exercise such other rights as Trustee or
            Beneficiary may have at law or in equity or pursuant to the terms
            and conditions of this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan
            Documents.

      In connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Beneficiary may elect to
      treat any of the Property which consists of a right in action or which is
      property that can be severed from the Property (including, without
      limitation, any improvements forming a part thereof) without causing
      structural damage thereto as if the same were personal property or a
      fixture, as the case may be, and dispose of the same in accordance with
      applicable law, separate and apart from the sale of the Property. Any sale
      of Collateral hereunder shall be conducted in any manner permitted by the
      UCC.

7.4   APPLICATION OF FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS. If any foreclosure sale is
      effected, except as otherwise may be required by applicable law, Trustee
      shall apply the proceeds of such sale in the following order of priority:
      First, to the costs and expenses of exercising the power of sale and of
      sale, including the payment of the trustee's fees and reasonable
      attorneys' fees actually incurred; Second, to the payment of the contract
      or contracts secured; Third, to the payment of all other Secured
      Obligations; Fourth, to junior lienholders or encumbrancers in order of
      their priority; and Fifth, the remainder, if any, to the person or persons
      legally entitled thereto.

7.5   WAIVER OF MARSHALING RIGHTS. Trustor, for itself and for all parties
      claiming through or under Trustor, and for all parties who may acquire a
      lien on or interest in the Property, hereby waives all rights to have the
      Property and/or any other property, including, without limitation, the
      Collateral, which is now or later may be security for any Secured
      Obligation, marshaled upon any foreclosure of this Deed of Trust or on a
      foreclosure of any other security for any of the Secured Obligations.

7.6   NO CURE OR WAIVER. Neither Beneficiary's nor Trustee's nor any receiver's
      entry upon and taking possession of all or any part of the Property, nor
      any collection of rents, issues, profits, insurance proceeds, condemnation
      proceeds or damages, other security or proceeds of other security, or
      other sums, nor the application of any collected sum to any Secured
      Obligation, nor the exercise of any other right or remedy by Beneficiary
      or Trustee or any receiver shall cure or waive any Default or notice of
      default under this Deed of Trust, or nullify the effect of any notice of
      default or sale (unless all Secured Obligations then due have been paid or
      performed and Trustor has cured all other Defaults hereunder), or impair
      the status of the security, or prejudice Beneficiary or Trustee in the
      exercise of any right or remedy, or be construed as an affirmation by
      Beneficiary of any tenancy, lease or option or a subordination of the lien
      of this Deed of Trust.

7.7   PAYMENT OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Trustor agrees to pay to
      Beneficiary immediately and upon demand all costs and expenses incurred by
      Trustee and Beneficiary in the enforcement of the terms and conditions of
      this Deed of Trust (including, without limitation, statutory trustee's
      fees, court costs and attorneys' fees, whether incurred in litigation or
      not) with interest from the date of expenditure until said sums have been
      paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of the
      Note as specified therein.

7.8   POWER TO FILE NOTICES AND CURE DEFAULTS. Trustor hereby irrevocably
      appoints Beneficiary and its successors and assigns, as its
      attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, to perform any
      obligation of Trustor hereunder upon the occurrence of an event, act or
      omission which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a
      Default, provided, however, that: (a) Beneficiary as such attorney-in-fact
      shall only be accountable for such funds as are actually received by
      Beneficiary; and (b) Beneficiary shall not be liable to Trustor or any
      other person or entity for any failure to act under this Section.

7.9   REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights and remedies of Beneficiary and Trustee
      under this Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and
      are in addition to all rights and remedies provided by applicable law
      (including specifically that of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust as
      though it were a mortgage). Beneficiary may enforce any one or more
      remedies or rights under the Loan Documents either successively or
      concurrently.

                       ARTICLE 8. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

8.1   ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. The Loan Documents contain or incorporate by
      reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters
      contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations. The Loan
      Documents grant further rights to Beneficiary and contain further
      agreements and affirmative and negative covenants by Trustor which apply
      to this Deed of Trust and to the Property and such further rights and
      agreements are incorporated herein by this reference. THE OBLIGATIONS AND
      LIABILITIES OF TRUSTOR UNDER THIS DEED OF TRUST AND THE OTHER LOAN
      DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECTION IN THE NOTE
      ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

8.2   NON-WAIVER. By accepting payment of any amount secured hereby after its
      due date or late performance of any other Secured Obligation, Beneficiary
      shall not waive its right against any person obligated directly or
      indirectly hereunder or on any Secured Obligation, either to require
      prompt payment or performance when due of all other sums and obligations
      so secured or to declare default for failure to make such prompt payment
      or performance. No exercise of any right or remedy by Beneficiary or
      Trustee hereunder shall constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy
      herein contained or provided by law. No failure by Beneficiary or Trustee
      to exercise any right or remedy hereunder arising upon any Default shall
      be construed to prejudice Beneficiary's or Trustee's rights or remedies
      upon the occurrence of any other or subsequent Default. No delay by
      Beneficiary or Trustee in exercising any such right or remedy shall be
      construed to preclude Beneficiary or Trustee from the exercise thereof at
      any time while that Default is continuing. No notice to nor demand on
      Trustor shall of itself entitle Trustor to any other or further notice or
      demand in similar or other circumstances.

8.3   CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND EXPENSES. Wherever Beneficiary's consent,
      approval, acceptance or satisfaction is required under any provision of
      this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, such consent,
      approval, acceptance or satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld,
      conditioned or delayed by Beneficiary unless such provision expressly so
      provides. Wherever costs or expenses are required to be paid under any
      provision of this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, such
      costs or expenses shall be reasonable.

8.4   PERMITTED CONTESTS. After prior written notice to Beneficiary, Trustor may
      contest, by appropriate legal or other proceedings conducted in good faith
      and with due diligence, the amount, validity or application, in whole or
      in part, of any lien, levy, tax or assessment, or any lien of any laborer,
      mechanic, materialman, supplier or vendor, or the application to Trustor
      or the Property of any law or the validity thereof, the assertion or
      imposition of which, or the failure to pay when due, would constitute a
      Default; provided that (a) Trustor pursues the contest diligently, in a
      manner which Beneficiary determines is not prejudicial to Beneficiary, and
      does not impair the lien of this Deed of Trust; (b) the Property, or any
      part hereof or estate or interest therein, shall not be in any danger of
      being sold, forfeited or lost by reason of such proceedings; (c) in the
      case of the contest of any law or other legal requirement, Beneficiary
      shall not be in any danger of any civil or criminal liability; and (d) if
      required by Beneficiary, Trustor deposits with Beneficiary any funds or
      other forms of assurance (including a bond or letter of credit)
      satisfactory to Beneficiary to protect Beneficiary from the consequences
      of the contest being unsuccessful. Trustor's right to contest pursuant to
      the terms of this provision shall in no way relieve Trustor or Borrower of
      its obligations under the Loan or to make payments to Beneficiary as and
      when due.

8.5   FURTHER ASSURANCES. Trustor shall, upon demand by Beneficiary or Trustee,
      execute, acknowledge (if appropriate) and deliver any and all documents
      and instruments and do or cause to be done all further acts reasonably
      necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the Loan Documents
      and to perfect any assignments contained therein.

8.6   ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action, suit or proceeding is commenced
      between Trustor and Beneficiary regarding their respective rights and
      obligations under this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents,
      the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to damages
      or other relief, costs and expenses,


                                       26
<PAGE>
      reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs (including, without limitation,
      expert witness fees). Court costs and attorneys' fees shall be set by the
      court and not by a jury. As used herein the term "prevailing party" shall
      mean the party which obtains the principal relief it has sought, whether
      by compromise settlement or judgment. If the party which commenced or
      instituted the action, suit or proceeding shall dismiss or discontinue it
      without the concurrence of the other party, such other party shall be
      deemed the prevailing party.

8.7   TRUSTOR AND BENEFICIARY DEFINED. The term "Trustor" includes both the
      original Trustor and any subsequent owner or owners of any of the
      Property, and the term "Beneficiary" includes the original Beneficiary and
      any future owner or holder, including assignees, pledgees and
      participants, of the Note or any interest therein.

8.8   DISCLAIMERS.

      a.    RELATIONSHIP. The relationship of Trustor and Beneficiary under this
            Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents is, and shall at all
            times remain, solely that of borrower and lender; and Beneficiary
            neither undertakes nor assumes any responsibility or duty to Trustor
            or to any third party with respect to the Property. Notwithstanding
            any other provisions of this Deed of Trust and the other Loan
            Documents: (i) Beneficiary is not, and shall not be construed to be,
            a partner, joint venturer, member, alter ego, manager, controlling
            person or other business associate or participant of any kind of
            Trustor, and Beneficiary does not intend to ever assume such status;
            (ii) Beneficiary's activities in connection with this Deed of Trust
            and the other Loan Documents shall not be "outside the scope of
            activities of a lender of money" within the meaning of California
            Civil Code Section 3434, as amended or recodified from time to time,
            and Beneficiary does not intend to ever assume any responsibility to
            any person for the quality, suitability, safety or condition of the
            Property; and (iii) Beneficiary shall not be deemed responsible for
            or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions of Trustor.

      b.    NO LIABILITY. Beneficiary shall not be directly or indirectly liable
            or responsible for any loss, claim, cause of action, liability,
            indebtedness, damage or injury of any kind or character to any
            person or property arising from any construction on, or occupancy or
            use of, the Property, whether caused by or arising from: (i) any
            defect in any building, structure, grading, fill, landscaping or
            other improvements thereon or in any on-site or off-site improvement
            or other facility therein or thereon; (ii) any act or omission of
            Trustor or any of Trustor's agents, employees, independent
            contractors, licensees or invitees; (iii) any accident in or on the
            Property or any fire, flood or other casualty or hazard thereon;
            (iv) the failure of Trustor or any of Trustor's licensees,
            employees, invitees, agents, independent contractors or other
            representatives to maintain the Property in a safe condition; or (v)
            any nuisance made or suffered on any part of the Property.

8.9   SEVERABILITY. If any term of this Deed of Trust or any other Loan
      Document, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances,
      shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
      Deed of Trust or such other Loan Document, or the application of such term
      to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or
      unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term of this Deed
      of Trust or such other Loan Document shall be valid and enforceable to the
      fullest extent permitted by law. In addition, should this instrument be or
      become ineffective as a deed of trust, then these presents shall be
      construed and enforced as a realty mortgage with the Trustor being the
      mortgagor and Beneficiary being the mortgagee.

8.10  RELATIONSHIP OF ARTICLES. The rights, remedies and interests of
      Beneficiary under the deed of trust established by Article 1 and the
      security agreement established by Article 4 are independent and
      cumulative, and there shall be no merger of any lien created by the deed
      of trust with any security interest created by the security agreement.
      Beneficiary may elect to exercise or enforce any of its rights, remedies
      or interests under either or both the deed of trust or the security
      agreement as Beneficiary may from time to time deem


                                       27
<PAGE>
      appropriate. The absolute assignment of rents and leases established by
      Article 3 is similarly independent of and separate from the deed of trust
      and the security agreement.

8.11  MERGER. No merger shall occur as a result of Beneficiary's acquiring any
      other estate in, or any other lien on, the Property unless Beneficiary
      consents to a merger in writing.

8.12  OBLIGATIONS OF TRUSTOR, JOINT AND SEVERAL. If more than one person has
      executed this Deed of Trust as "Trustor", the obligations of all such
      persons hereunder shall be joint and several.

8.13  SEPARATE AND COMMUNITY PROPERTY. Any married person who executes this Deed
      of Trust as a "Trustor" agrees that any money judgment which Beneficiary
      or Trustee obtains pursuant to the terms of this Deed of Trust or any
      other obligation of that married person secured by this Deed of Trust may
      be collected by execution upon any separate property or community property
      of that person.

8.14  INTEGRATION; INTERPRETATION. The Loan Documents contain or expressly
      incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect
      to the matters contemplated therein and supersede all prior negotiations
      or agreements, written or oral. The Loan Documents shall not be modified
      except by written instrument executed by all parties. Any reference in any
      of the Loan Documents to the Property or Collateral shall include all or
      any part of the Property or Collateral. Any reference to the Loan
      Documents includes any amendments, renewals or extensions now or hereafter
      approved by Beneficiary in writing. When the identity of the parties or
      other circumstances make it appropriate, the masculine gender includes the
      feminine and/or neuter, and the singular number includes the plural.

8.15  CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall
      have the meanings set forth in the Note.

8.16  SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST. The terms, covenants, and conditions contained
      herein and in the other Loan Documents herein and in the other Loan
      Documents shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs,
      successors and assigns of the parties. The foregoing sentence shall not be
      construed to permit Trustor to assign the Loan except as otherwise
      permitted under the Note or the other Loan Documents.

8.17  GOVERNING LAW. This Deed of Trust was accepted by Beneficiary in the state
      of California and the proceeds of the Note secured hereby were disbursed
      from the state of California, which state the parties agree has a
      substantial relationship to the parties and to the underlying transaction
      embodied hereby. Accordingly, in all respects, including, without limiting
      the generality of the foregoing, matters of construction, validity,
      enforceability and performance, this Deed of Trust, the Note and the other
      Loan Documents and the obligations arising hereunder and thereunder shall
      be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of
      California applicable to contracts made and performed in such state and
      any applicable law of the United States of America, except that at all
      times the provisions for enforcement of Beneficiary's STATUTORY POWER OF
      SALE and all other remedies granted hereunder and the creation, perfection
      and enforcement of the security interests created pursuant hereto and
      pursuant to the other Loan Documents in any Collateral which is located in
      the state where the Property is located shall be governed by and construed
      according to the law of the state where the Property is located. Except as
      provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Trustor hereby
      unconditionally and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
      law, any claim to assert that the law of any jurisdiction other than
      California governs this Deed of Trust, the Note and other Loan Documents.

8.18  CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Trustor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction
      of: (a) any state or federal court sitting in the state of California over
      any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by Trustor against Beneficiary,
      arising out of or relating to this Deed of Trust, the Note or the Loan;
      (b) any state or federal court sitting in the state where the Property is
      located or the state in which Trustor's principal place of business is
      located over any suit, action or proceeding, brought by Beneficiary
      against Trustor, arising out of or relating to this Deed of Trust, the
      Note or the Loan; and (c) any state court sitting in the county of the
      state where the


                                       28
<PAGE>
      Property is located over any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by
      Beneficiary to exercise its STATUTORY POWER OF SALE under this Deed of
      Trust or any action brought by Beneficiary to enforce its rights with
      respect to the Collateral. Trustor irrevocably waives, to the fullest
      extent permitted by law, any objection that Trustor may now or hereafter
      have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action, or proceeding
      brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action, or
      proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
      forum.

8.19  EXHIBITS. Exhibit A is incorporated into this Deed of Trust by this
      reference.

8.20  ADDRESSES; REQUEST FOR NOTICE. All notices and other communications that
      are required or permitted to be given to a party under this Deed of Trust
      or the other Loan Documents shall be in writing, refer to the Loan number,
      and shall be sent to such party, either by personal delivery, by overnight
      delivery service, by certified first class mail, return receipt requested,
      or by facsimile transmission to the addressee or facsimile number below.
      All such notices and communications shall be effective upon receipt of

               ARTICLE 3. ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

3.1   ASSIGNMENT. Trustor irrevocably assigns to Beneficiary all of Trustor's
      right, title and interest in, to and under: (a) all present and future
      leases of the Property or any portion thereof, all licenses and agreements
      relating to the management, leasing or operation of the Property or any
      portion thereof, and all other agreements of any kind relating to the use
      or occupancy of the Property or any portion thereof, whether such leases,
      licenses and agreements are now existing or entered into after the date
      hereof ("Leases"); and (b) the rents, issues, deposits and profits of the
      Property, including, without limitation, all amounts payable and all
      rights and benefits accruing to Trustor under the Leases ("Payments"). The
      term "Leases" shall also include all guarantees of and security for the
      tenants' performance thereunder, and all amendments, extensions, renewals
      or modifications thereto which are permitted hereunder. This is a present
      and absolute assignment, not an assignment for security purposes only, and
      Beneficiary's right to the Leases and Payments is not contingent upon, and
      may be exercised without possession of, the Property.

3.2   GRANT OF LICENSE. Notwithstanding the terms of contained in Section 3.1,
      Beneficiary confers upon Trustor a revocable license ("License") to
      collect and retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the
      occurrence of a Default (as hereinafter defined). Upon a Default, the
      License shall be automatically revoked and Beneficiary may collect and
      apply the Payments pursuant to the terms hereof without notice and without
      taking possession of the Property. All Payments thereafter collected by
      Trustor shall be held by Trustor as trustee under a constructive trust for
      the benefit of Beneficiary. Trustor hereby irrevocably authorizes and
      directs the tenants under the Leases, upon notice of a Default from
      Beneficiary, to rely upon and comply with any notice or demand by
      Beneficiary for the payment to Beneficiary of any rental or other sums
      which may at any time become due under the Leases, or for the performance
      of any of the tenants' undertakings under the Leases, and the tenants
      shall have no right or duty to inquire as to whether any Default has
      actually occurred or is then existing. Trustor hereby relieves the tenants
      from any liability to Trustor by reason of relying upon and complying with
      any such notice or demand by Beneficiary. Beneficiary may apply, in its
      sole discretion, any Payments so collected by Beneficiary against any
      Secured Obligation or any other obligation of Borrower, Trustor or any
      other person or entity, under any document or instrument related to or
      executed in connection with the Loan Documents, whether existing on the
      date hereof or hereafter arising. Collection of any Payments by
      Beneficiary shall not cure or waive any Default or notice of Default or
      invalidate any acts done pursuant to such notice. If and when no Default
      exists, Beneficiary shall re-confer the License upon Trustor until the
      occurrence of another Default.

      performing any of the terms, agreements, undertakings, obligations,

      granted to Beneficiary hereunder; or (f) the failure or refusal of

      a.    ALL LEASES. Trustor shall, at Trustor's sole cost and expense:

            (i)   perform all obligations of the landlord under the Leases and
                  use reasonable efforts to enforce performance by the tenants
                  of all obligations of the tenants under the Leases;

            (ii)  use reasonable efforts to keep the Property leased at all
                  times to tenants which Trustor reasonably and in good faith
                  believes are creditworthy at rents not less than the fair
                  market rental value (including, but not limited to, free or
                  discounted rents to the extent the market so requires);

            (iii) promptly upon Beneficiary's request, deliver to Beneficiary a
                  copy of each requested Lease and all amendments thereto and
                  waivers thereof; and

            (iv)  promptly upon Beneficiary's request, execute and record any
                  additional assignments of landlord's interest under any Lease
                  to Beneficiary and specific subordinations of any Lease to
                  this Deed of Trust, in form and substance satisfactory to
                  Beneficiary.

            Unless consented to in writing by Beneficiary or otherwise permitted
            under any other provision of the Loan Documents, Trustor shall not:

            (v)   grant any tenant under any Lease any option, right of first
                  refusal or other right to purchase all or any portion of the
                  Property under any circumstances;

            (vi)  grant any tenant under any Lease any right to prepay rent more
                  than 1 month in advance;

            (vii) except upon Beneficiary's request, execute any assignment of
                  landlord's interest in any Lease; or

           (viii) collect rent or other sums due under any Lease in advance,
                  other than to collect rent 1 month in advance of the time when
                  it becomes due.

            Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this
            Section shall be null and void.

            Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary any sums received by Trustor
            in consideration of any termination, modification or amendment of
            any Lease or any release or discharge of any tenant under any Lease
            from any obligation thereunder and any such sums received by Trustor
            shall be held in trust by Trustor for such purpose. Notwithstanding
            the foregoing, so long as no Default exists, the portion of any such
            sum received by Trustor with respect to any Lease which is less than
            $50,000 shall be payable to Trustor. All such sums received by
            Beneficiary with respect to any Lease shall be deemed "Impounds" (as
            defined in Section 6.12b) and shall be deposited by Beneficiary into
            a pledged account in accordance with Section 6.12b. If no Default
            exists, Beneficiary shall release such Impounds to Trustor from time
            to time


                                       4

            as necessary to pay or reimburse Trustor for such tenant
            improvements, brokerage commissions and other leasing costs as may
            be required to re-tenant the affected space; provided, however,
            Beneficiary shall have received and approved each of the following
            for each tenant for which such costs were incurred; (1) Trustor's
            written request for such release, including the name of the tenant,
            the location and net rentable area of the space and a description
            and cost breakdown of the tenant improvements or other leasing costs
            covered by the request; (2) Trustor's certification that any tenant
            improvements have been completed lien-free and in a workmanlike
            manner; (3) a fully executed Lease, or extension or renewal of the
            current Lease; (4) an estoppel certificate executed by the tenant
            including its acknowledgement that all tenant improvements have been
            satisfactorily completed; and (5) such other information with
            respect to such costs as Beneficiary may require. Following the
            re-tenanting of all affected space (including, without limitation,
            the completion of all tenant improvements), and provided no Default
            exists, Beneficiary shall release any remaining such Impounds
            relating to the affected space to Trustor. Trustor shall construct
            all tenant improvements in a workmanlike manner and in accordance
            with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

      b.    MAJOR LEASES. Trustor shall, at Trustor's sole cost and expense,
            give Beneficiary prompt written notice of any material default by
            landlord or tenant under any Major Lease (as defined below). Unless
            consented to in writing by Beneficiary or otherwise permitted under
            any other provision of the Loan Documents, Trustor shall not:

            (i)   enter into any Major Lease which (aa) is not on fair market
                  terms (which terms may include free or discounted rent to the
                  extent the market so requires); (bb) does not contain a
                  provision requiring the tenant to execute and deliver to the
                  landlord an estoppel certificate in form and substance
                  satisfactory to the landlord promptly upon the landlord's
                  request; or (cc) allows the tenant to assign or sublet the
                  premises without the landlord's consent;

            (ii)  reduce any rent or other sums due from the tenant under any
                  Major Lease;

            (iii) terminate or materially modify or amend any Major Lease; or

            (iv)  release or discharge the tenant or any guarantor under any
                  Major Lease from any material obligation thereunder.

            Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this
            Section shall be null and void.

            "Major Lease", as used herein, shall mean any Lease, which is, at
            any time: (1) a Lease of more than 20% of the total rentable area of
            the Property, as reasonably determined by Beneficiary; or (2) a
            Lease which generates a gross base monthly rent exceeding 20% of the
            total gross base monthly rent generated by all Leases (excluding all
            Leases under which the tenant is then in default), as reasonably
            determined by Beneficiary. Trustor's obligations with respect to
            Major Leases shall be governed by the provisions of Section 3.4a as
            well as by the provisions of this Section.

      c.    FAILURE TO DENY REQUEST. Beneficiary's failure to deny any written
            request by Trustor for Beneficiary's consent under the provisions of
            Sections 3.4(a) or 3.4(b) within 10 Business Days after
            Beneficiary's receipt of such request (and all documents and
            information reasonably related thereto) shall be deemed to
            constitute Beneficiary's consent to such request.

3.5   RIGHT OF SUBORDINATION. Beneficiary may at any time and from time to time
      by specific written instrument intended for the purpose unilaterally
      subordinate the lien of this Deed of Trust to any Lease, without joinder
      or consent of, or notice to, Trustor, any tenant or any other person.
      Notice is hereby given to each tenant under a Lease of such right to
      subordinate. No subordination referred to in this Section shall constitute
      a subordination to any lien or other encumbrance, whenever arising, or
      improve the right of any junior lienholder. Nothing herein shall be
      construed as subordinating this Deed of Trust to any Lease.

                ARTICLE 4. SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

4.1   SECURITY INTEREST. Trustor pledges to Beneficiary and grants and assigns

      all of the Secured Obligations, in all of Trustor's right, title and

      Trustor now or at any time hereafter has any interest ("Collateral"):

            All goods, building and other materials, supplies, work in process,

            incorporated into, used in connection with or appropriated for use
            on the Property; all rents, issues, deposits and profits of the
            Property (to the extent, if any, they are not subject to the
            Absolute Assignment of Rents and Leases); all inventory, accounts,
            cash receipts, deposit accounts, impounds, accounts receivable,
            contract rights, general intangibles, software, chattel paper,
            instruments, documents, promissory notes, drafts, letters of credit,
            letter of credit rights, supporting obligations, insurance policies,
            insurance and condemnation awards and proceeds, any other rights to
            the payment of money, trade names, trademarks and service marks
            arising from or related to the Property or any business now or
            hereafter conducted thereon by Trustor; all permits, consents,
            approvals, licenses, authorizations and other rights granted by,
            given by or obtained from, any governmental entity with respect to
            the Property; all deposits or other security now or hereafter made
            with or given to utility companies by Trustor with respect to the
            Property; all advance payments of insurance premiums made by Trustor
            with respect to the Property; all plans, drawings and specifications
            relating to the Property; all loan funds held by Beneficiary,
            whether or not disbursed; all funds deposited with Beneficiary
            pursuant to any Loan Document, all reserves, deferred payments,
            deposits, accounts, refunds, cost savings and payments of any kind

            limitation, all "Impounds" as defined herein; together with all
            replacements and proceeds of, and additions and accessions to, any
            of the foregoing, and all books, records and files relating to any
            of the foregoing.

      As to all of the above described personal property which is or which
      hereafter becomes a "fixture" under applicable law, this Deed of Trust
      constitutes a fixture filing under the Uniform Commercial Code, as enacted
      in the State of Nevada, Chapters 104 and 104A of the Nevada Revised
      Statutes, as amended or recodified from time to time ("UCC").

4.2   COVENANTS. Trustor agrees: (a) to execute and deliver such documents as
      Beneficiary reasonably deems necessary to create, perfect and continue the
      security interests contemplated hereby; (b) not to change its name, and,
      as applicable, its chief executive offices, its principal residence or the
      jurisdiction in which it is organized without giving Beneficiary at least
      30 days' prior written notice thereof; and (c) to cooperate with
      Beneficiary in perfecting all security interests granted herein and in
      obtaining such agreements from third parties as Beneficiary deems
      necessary, proper or convenient in connection with the preservation,
      perfection or enforcement of any of Beneficiary's rights hereunder.

4.3   RIGHTS OF BENEFICIARY. In addition to Beneficiary's rights as a "Secured
      Party" under the UCC, Beneficiary may, but shall not be obligated to, at
      any time without notice and at the expense of Trustor: (a) give notice to
      any person of Beneficiary's rights hereunder and enforce such rights at
      law or in equity; (b) insure, protect, defend and preserve the Collateral
      or any rights or interests of Beneficiary therein; and (c) inspect the
      Collateral during normal business hours upon reasonable prior written
      notice, provided, however, that such notice shall not be required in the
      event of an emergency. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall
      Beneficiary be deemed to have accepted any property other than cash in
      satisfaction of any obligation of Trustor to Beneficiary unless
      Beneficiary shall make an express written election of said remedy under
      the UCC or other applicable law.


                                       6
<PAGE>
4.4   ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF BENEFICIARY UPON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence of a
      Default, then in addition to all of Beneficiary's rights as a "Secured
      Party" under the UCC or otherwise at law:

      a.    DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL. Beneficiary may: (i) upon written notice,
            require Trustor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to
            Beneficiary at a place reasonably designated by Beneficiary; (ii)
            without prior notice (to the extent permitted by law), enter upon
            the Property or other place where the Collateral may be located and
            take possession of, collect, sell, lease, license and otherwise
            dispose of the Collateral, and store the same at locations
            acceptable to Beneficiary at Trustor's expense; or (iii) sell,
            assign and deliver the Collateral at any place or in any lawful
            manner and bid and become purchaser at any such sales; and

      b.    OTHER RIGHTS. Beneficiary may, for the account of Trustor and at
            Trustor's expense: (i) operate, use, consume, sell, lease, license
            or otherwise dispose of the Collateral as Beneficiary reasonably
            deems appropriate for the purpose of performing any or all of the
            Secured Obligations; (ii) enter into any agreement, compromise or
            settlement including insurance claims, which Beneficiary may
            reasonably deem desirable or proper with respect to the Collateral;
            and (iii) endorse and deliver evidences of title for, and receive,
            enforce and collect by legal action or otherwise, all indebtedness
            and obligations now or hereafter owing to Trustor in connection with
            or on account of the Collateral.

      Trustor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the Collateral in
      accordance with Beneficiary's rights and remedies as heretofore provided
      is a disposition thereof in a commercially reasonable manner and that 5
      Business Days prior notice of such disposition is commercially reasonable
      notice. Beneficiary shall have no obligation to process or prepare the
      Collateral for sale or other disposition. In disposing of the Collateral,
      Beneficiary may disclaim all warranties of title, possession, quiet
      enjoyment and the like. Any proceeds of any sale or other disposition of
      the Collateral may be applied by Beneficiary first to the reasonable
      expenses incurred by Beneficiary in connection therewith, including,
      without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements, and then
      to the payment of the Secured Obligations, in such order of application as
      Beneficiary may from time to time elect.

4.5   POWER OF ATTORNEY. Trustor hereby irrevocably appoints Beneficiary as
      Trustor's attorney-in-fact (such agency being coupled with an interest),
      and as such attorney-in-fact, Beneficiary may, without the obligation to
      do so, in Beneficiary's name or in the name of Trustor, prepare, execute,
      file and record financing statements, continuation statements,
      applications for registration and like papers necessary to create, perfect
      or preserve any of Beneficiary's security interests and rights in or to
      the Collateral, and upon a Default, take any other action required of
      Trustor; provided, however, that Beneficiary as such attorney-in-fact
      shall be accountable only for such funds as are actually received by
      Beneficiary.

                    ARTICLE 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

5.1   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Trustor represents and warrants to
      Beneficiary that, to Trustor's current actual knowledge after reasonable
      investigation and inquiry, the following statements are true and correct
      as of the Effective Date:

      a.    LEGAL STATUS. Trustor and Borrower are duly organized and existing
            and in good standing under the laws of the state(s) in which Trustor
            and Borrower are organized. Trustor and Borrower are qualified or
            licensed to do business in all jurisdictions in which such
            qualification or licensing is required.

      b.    PERMITS. Trustor and Borrower possess all permits, franchises and
            licenses and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and
            fictitious names, if any, necessary to enable Trustor and Borrower
            to conduct the business(es) in which Trustor and Borrower are now
            engaged in compliance with applicable law.


                                       7
<PAGE>
      c.    AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The execution and delivery of the Loan
            Documents have been duly authorized and the Loan Documents
            constitute valid and binding obligations of Trustor, Borrower or the
            party which executed the same, enforceable in accordance with their
            respective terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by
            bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws affecting the
            enforcement of creditors' rights, or by the application of rules of
            equity .

      d.    VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance by Trustor and
            Borrower of each of the Loan Documents do not violate any provision
            of any law or regulation, or result in any breach or default under
            any contract, obligation, indenture or other instrument to which
            Trustor or Borrower is a party or by which Trustor or Borrower is
            bound.

      e.    LITIGATION. There are no pending or threatened actions, claims,
            investigations, suits or proceedings before any governmental
            authority, court or administrative agency which may adversely affect
            the financial condition or operations of Trustor or Borrower other
            than those previously disclosed in writing by Trustor or Borrower to
            Beneficiary.

      f.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements of Trustor and
            Borrower, of each general partner (if Trustor or Borrower is a
            partnership), of each member (if Trustor or Borrower is a limited
            liability company) and of each guarantor, if any, previously
            delivered by Trustor or Borrower to Beneficiary: (i) are materially
            complete and correct; (ii) present fairly the financial condition of
            such party; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance with the same
            accounting standard used by Trustor or Borrower to prepare the
            financial statements delivered to and approved by Beneficiary in
            connection with the making of the Loan, or other accounting
            standards approved by Beneficiary. Since the date of such financial
            statements, there has been no material adverse change in such
            financial condition, nor have any assets or properties reflected on
            such financial statements been sold, transferred, assigned,
            mortgaged, pledged or encumbered except as previously disclosed in
            writing by Trustor or Borrower to Beneficiary and approved in
            writing by Beneficiary.

      g.    REPORTS. All reports, documents, instruments and information
            delivered to Beneficiary in connection with the Loan: (i) are
            correct in all material respects and sufficiently complete to give
            Beneficiary accurate knowledge of their subject matter; and (ii) do
            not contain any misrepresentation of a material fact or omission of
            a material fact which omission makes the provided information
            misleading.

      h.    INCOME TAXES. There are no material pending assessments or
            adjustments of Trustor's or Borrower's income tax payable with
            respect to any year.

      i.    SUBORDINATION. There is no agreement or instrument to which Borrower
            is a party or by which Borrower is bound that would require the
            subordination in right of payment of any of Borrower's obligations
            under the Note to an obligation owed to another party.

      j.    TITLE. Trustor lawfully holds and possesses fee simple title to the
            Property, without limitation on the right to encumber same. This
            Deed of Trust is a first lien on the Property prior and superior to
            all other liens and encumbrances on the Property except: (i) liens
            for real estate taxes and assessments not yet due and payable; (ii)
            senior exceptions previously approved by Beneficiary and shown in
            the title insurance policy insuring the lien of this Deed of Trust;
            and (iii) other matters, if any, previously disclosed to Beneficiary
            by Trustor in a writing specifically referring to this
            representation and warranty.

      k.    MECHANICS' LIENS. There are no mechanics' or similar liens or claims
            which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are
            outstanding that under law could give rise to any such liens)
            affecting the Property which are or may be prior to or equal to the
            lien of this Deed of Trust, other than those (if any) previously
            approved by Beneficiary and shown on the title insurance policy
            insuring the lien of this Deed of Trust.


                                       8
<PAGE>
      l.    ENCROACHMENTS. Except as shown in the survey, if any, previously
            delivered to Beneficiary, none of the buildings or other
            improvements which were included for the purpose of determining the
            appraised value of the Property lies outside of the boundaries or
            building restriction lines of the Property and no buildings or other
            improvements located on adjoining properties encroach upon the
            Property.

      m.    LEASES. All existing Leases are in full force and effect and are
            enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. Except as
            disclosed on a rent roll provided to Beneficiary prior to the date
            hereof, no material breach or default by any party, or event which
            would constitute a material breach or default by any party after
            notice or the passage of time, or both, exists under any existing
            Lease. None of the landlord's interests under any of the Leases,
            including, but not limited to, rents, additional rents, charges,
            issues or profits, has been transferred or assigned. Except as
            disclosed on a rent roll provided to Beneficiary prior to the date

      requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C.
      Section 12101 et seq.), as amended from time to time. Trustor shall
      possess and maintain or cause Borrower to possess and maintain in full
      force and effect at all times (a) all certificates of occupancy and other
      licenses, permits and authorizations required by applicable law for the
      existing use of the Property and (b) all permits, franchises and licenses
      and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and fictitious
      names, if any, required by applicable law for Trustor and Borrower to
      conduct the business(es) in which Trustor and Borrower are now engaged.

6.4   LITIGATION. Trustor shall promptly notify Beneficiary in writing of any
      litigation pending or threatened in writing against Trustor or Borrower
      claiming damages in excess of $100,000 and of all pending or threatened

      (in writing) litigation against Trustor or Borrower if the aggregate
      damage claims against Trustor or Borrower exceed $500,000.

6.5   MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, TRANSFER OF ASSETS. Trustor shall not: (a) merge or
      consolidate with any other entity or permit Borrower to merge or

      substantial change in the nature of Borrower's business or structure; (c)
      acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any other entity or
      permit Borrower to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any

      ordinary course of Borrower's business.

6.6   ACCOUNTING RECORDS. Trustor shall maintain and cause Borrower to maintain
      adequate books and records in accordance with the same accounting standard
      used by Trustor or Borrower to prepare the financial statements delivered
      to and approved by Beneficiary in connection with the making of the Loan
      or other accounting standards approved by Beneficiary. Trustor shall
      permit and shall cause Borrower to permit any representative of
      Beneficiary, at any reasonable time and from time to time, upon reasonable
      prior notice to Trustor, to inspect, audit and examine such books and
      records and make copies of same.

6.7   COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Trustor shall pay to Beneficiary the
      full amount of all costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
      reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of Beneficiary's in-house or
      outside counsel, incurred by Beneficiary in connection with: (a)
      appraisals and inspections of the Property or Collateral required by
      Beneficiary as a result of (i) a Transfer or proposed Transfer (as defined
      below), or (ii) a Default; (b) appraisals and inspections of the Property
      or Collateral required by applicable law, including, without limitation,
      federal or state regulatory reporting requirements; and (c) any acts
      performed by Beneficiary at Trustor's request or wholly or partially for
      the benefit of Trustor (including, without limitation, the preparation or
      review of amendments, assumptions, waivers, releases, reconveyances,
      estoppel certificates or statements of amounts owing under any Secured
      Obligation). In connection with appraisals and inspections, Trustor
      specifically (but not by way of limitation) acknowledges that: (aa) a
      formal written appraisal of the Property by a state certified or licensed
      appraiser may be required by federal regulatory reporting requirements on
      an annual or more frequent basis; and (bb) Beneficiary may require
      inspection of the Property by an independent supervising architect, a cost
      engineering specialist, or both. Trustor shall pay all indebtedness
      arising under this Section immediately upon demand by Beneficiary together
      with interest thereon following notice of such indebtedness at the rate of
      interest then applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified
      therein.

6.8   LIENS, ENCUMBRANCES AND CHARGES. Subject to the terms of Section 8.4,
      Trustor shall immediately discharge by bonding or otherwise any lien,
      charge or other encumbrance which attaches to the Property in violation of
      Section 6.15. Subject to Trustor's right to contest such matters under
      this Deed of Trust or as expressly permitted in the Loan Documents,
      Trustor shall pay when due all obligations secured by or reducible to
      liens and encumbrances which shall now or hereafter encumber or appear to
      encumber all or any part of the Property or any interest therein, whether
      senior or subordinate hereto, including, without limitation, all claims
      for work or labor performed, or materials or supplies furnished, in
      connection with any work of demolition, alteration, repair, improvement or
      construction of or upon the Property, except such as Trustor may in good
      faith contest or as to which a bona fide dispute may arise (provided
      provision is made to the satisfaction of Beneficiary for eventual payment
      thereof in the event that Trustor is obligated to make such payment and
      that any recorded claim of lien, charge or other encumbrance against the
      Property is immediately discharged by bonding or otherwise).

6.9   TAXES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. Trustor shall pay and discharge when due any
      and all indebtedness, obligations, assessments and taxes, both real and
      personal and including federal and state income taxes and state and local
      property taxes and assessments. Trustor shall promptly provide to
      Beneficiary copies of all tax and assessment notices pertaining to the
      Property. Trustor hereby authorizes Beneficiary to obtain, at Trustor's


                                       15
<PAGE>
      expense, a tax service contract which shall provide tax information on the
      Property to Beneficiary for the term of the Loan and any extensions or
      renewals of the Loan.

6.10  INSURANCE COVERAGE. Trustor shall insure the Property against loss or
      damage by fire and such other hazards as Beneficiary shall from time to
      time require; provided, however, (a) Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's
      election, may only require flood insurance if all or any portion of the
      improvements located on the Property is or becomes located in a special
      flood hazard area, and (b) Beneficiary, at Beneficiary's election, may
      only require earthquake insurance if all or any portion of the Property is
      or becomes located in an earthquake fault zone. Trustor shall also carry
      public liability insurance and such other insurance as Beneficiary may
      reasonably require, including, without limitation, business interruption
      insurance or loss of rents insurance. Such policies shall contain a
      standard mortgage clause naming Beneficiary and its successors in interest
      as a loss payee and requiring at least 30 days prior notice to the holder
      at termination or cancellation. Trustor shall maintain all required
      insurance throughout the term of the Loan and while any liabilities of
      Borrower or Trustor to Beneficiary under any of the Loan Documents remain
      outstanding at Trustor's expense, with companies, and in substance and
      form satisfactory to Beneficiary. Neither Beneficiary nor Trustee, by
      reason of accepting, rejecting, approving or obtaining insurance shall
      incur any liability for: (c) the existence, nonexistence, form or legal
      sufficiency of any insurance; (d) the solvency of any insurer; or (e) the
      payment of claims.

6.11  CONDEMNATION AND INSURANCE PROCEEDS.

      a.    ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. Trustor absolutely and irrevocably assigns to
            Beneficiary all of the following rights, claims and amounts
            (collectively, "Claims"), all of which shall be paid to Beneficiary:
            (i) all awards of damages and all other compensation payable
            directly or indirectly by reason of a condemnation or proposed
            condemnation for public or private use affecting all or any part of,
            or any interest in, the Property; (ii) all other claims and awards
            for damages to or decrease in value of all or any part of, or any
            interest in, the Property; (iii) all proceeds of any insurance
            policies payable by reason of loss sustained to all or any part of
            the Property; and (iv) all interest which may accrue on any of the
            foregoing. Trustor shall give Beneficiary prompt written notice of
            the occurrence of any casualty affecting, or the institution of any
            proceedings for eminent domain or for the condemnation of, the
            Property or any portion thereof. So long as no Default has occurred
            and is continuing at the time, Trustor shall have the right to
            adjust, compromise and settle any Claim of $100,000 or less without
            the consent of Beneficiary, provided, however, all awards, proceeds
            and other sums described herein shall continue to be payable to
            Beneficiary. Beneficiary may commence, appear in, defend or
            prosecute any Claim exceeding $100,000, and may adjust, compromise
            and settle all Claims (except for Claims which Trustor may settle as
            provided herein), but shall not be responsible for any failure to
            commence, appear in, defend, prosecute or collect any such Claim
            regardless of the cause of the failure. All awards, proceeds and
            other sums described herein shall be payable to Beneficiary.

      b.    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; NO DEFAULT. So long as no Default has
            occurred and is continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of
            the proceeds of the Claims ("Proceeds") and no Default occurs
            thereafter, Beneficiary shall apply the Proceeds in the following
            order of priority: First, to Beneficiary's expenses in settling,
            prosecuting or defending the Claims; Second, to the repair or
            restoration of the Property; and Third, to Trustor if the repair or
            restoration of the Property has been completed, but to the Secured
            Obligations in any order without suspending, extending or reducing
            any obligation of Trustor to make installment payments if the repair
            or restoration of the Property has not been completed.
            Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary shall have no obligation
            to make any Proceeds available for the repair or restoration of the
            Property unless and until all the following conditions have been
            satisfied: (i) delivery to Beneficiary of the Proceeds plus any
            additional amount which is needed to pay all costs of the repair or
            restoration (including, without limitation, taxes, financing
            charges, insurance and rent during the repair period); (ii)
            establishment of an arrangement for lien releases and disbursement
            of funds acceptable to Beneficiary; (iii) delivery to Beneficiary in
            form and content acceptable to Beneficiary of all of the following:
            (aa) plans and specifications for the work; (bb) a contract for the
            work, signed by a contractor acceptable to Beneficiary; (cc) a cost
            breakdown for the work; (dd) if


                                       16
<PAGE>
            reasonably required by Beneficiary, a payment and performance bond
            for the work; (ee) evidence of the continuation of substantially all
            Leases unless consented to in writing by Beneficiary; (ff) evidence
            that, upon completion of the work, the size, capacity, value, and
            income coverage ratios for the Property will be at least as great as
            those which existed immediately before the damage or condemnation
            occurred; and (gg) evidence of the satisfaction of any additional
            conditions that Beneficiary may reasonably establish to protect
            Beneficiary's security. Trustor acknowledges that the specific
            conditions described above are reasonable.

      c.    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; DEFAULT. If a Default has occurred and is
            continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of the Proceeds or
            if a Default occurs at any time thereafter, Beneficiary may, at
            Beneficiary's absolute discretion and regardless of any impairment
            of security or lack of impairment of security, but subject to
            applicable law governing use of the Proceeds, if any, apply all or
            any of the Proceeds to Beneficiary's expenses in settling,
            prosecuting or defending the Claims and then apply the balance to
            the Secured Obligations in any order without suspending, extending
            or reducing any obligation of Trustor to make installment payments,
            and may release all or any part of the Proceeds to Trustor upon any
            conditions Beneficiary chooses.

6.12  IMPOUNDS.

      a.    POST-DEFAULT IMPOUNDS. If required by Beneficiary at any time after
            a Default occurs (and regardless of whether such Default is
            thereafter cured), Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary such
            amounts ("Post-Default Impounds") on such dates (determined by
            Beneficiary as provided below) as will be sufficient to pay any or
            all "Costs" (as defined below) specified by Beneficiary. Beneficiary
            in its reasonable discretion shall estimate the amount of such Costs
            that will be payable or required during any period selected by
            Beneficiary not exceeding 1 year and shall determine the fractional
            portion thereof that Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary on each
            date specified by Beneficiary during such period. If the
            Post-Default Impounds paid by Trustor are not sufficient to pay the
            related Costs, Trustor shall deposit with Beneficiary upon demand an
            amount equal to the deficiency. All Post-Default Impounds shall be
            payable by Trustor in addition to (but without duplication of) any
            other Impounds (as defined below).

      b.    ALL IMPOUNDS. Post-Default Impounds and any other impounds that may
            be payable by Borrower under the Note are collectively called
            "Impounds". All Impounds shall be deposited into one or more
            segregated or commingled accounts maintained by Beneficiary or its
            servicing agent. Except as otherwise provided in the Note, such
            account(s) shall not bear interest. Beneficiary shall not be a
            trustee, special depository or other fiduciary for Trustor with
            respect to such account, and the existence of such account shall not
            limit Beneficiary's rights under this Deed of Trust, any other
            agreement or any provision of law. If no Default exists, Beneficiary
            shall apply all Impounds to the payment of the related Costs, or in
            Beneficiary's sole discretion may release any or all Impounds to
            Trustor for application to and payment of such Costs. If a Default
            exists, Beneficiary may apply any or all Impounds to any Secured
            Obligation and/or to cure such Default, whereupon Trustor shall
            restore all Impounds so applied and cure all Defaults not cured by
            such application. The obligations of Trustor hereunder shall not be
            diminished by deposits of Impounds made by Trustor, except to the
            extent that such obligations have actually been met by application
            of such Impounds. Upon any assignment of this Deed of Trust,
            Beneficiary may assign all Impounds in its possession to
            Beneficiary's assignee, whereupon Beneficiary and Trustee shall be
            released from all liability with respect to such Impounds. Within 60
            days following full repayment of the Secured Obligations (other than
            as a consequence of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of
            foreclosure) or at such earlier time as Beneficiary may elect,
            Beneficiary shall pay to Trustor all Impounds in its possession, and
            no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. "Costs" means
            (i) all taxes and other liabilities payable by Trustor under Section
            6.9, (ii) all insurance premiums payable by Trustor under Section
            6.10, (iii) all other costs and expenses for which Impounds are
            required under the Note, and/or (iv) all other amounts that will be
            required to preserve the value of the Property. Trustor shall
            deliver to Beneficiary, promptly upon receipt, all bills for Costs
            for which Beneficiary has required Post-Default Impounds.


                                       17
<PAGE>
6.13  DEFENSE AND NOTICE OF LOSSES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS. Trustor shall protect,
      preserve and defend the Property and title to and right of possession of
      the Property, the security of this Deed of Trust and the rights and powers
      of Beneficiary and Trustee hereunder at Trustor's sole expense against all
      adverse claims, whether the claim: (a) is against a possessory or
      non-possessory interest; (b) arose prior or subsequent to the Effective
      Date; or (c) is senior or junior to Trustor's or Beneficiary's rights.
      Trustor shall give Beneficiary and Trustee prompt notice in writing of the
      assertion of any claim, of the filing of any action or proceeding, of the
      occurrence of any damage to the Property and of any condemnation offer or
      action.

6.14  RIGHT OF INSPECTION. Beneficiary and its independent contractors, agents
      and employees may enter the Property from time to time at any reasonable
      time upon reasonable prior notice to Trustor (except that such notice
      shall not be required in the event of an emergency) for the purpose of
      inspecting the Property and ascertaining Trustor's compliance with the
      terms of this Deed of Trust. Beneficiary shall use reasonable efforts to
      assure that Beneficiary's entry upon and inspection of the Property shall
      not materially and unreasonably interfere with the business or operations
      of Trustor or Trustor's tenants on the Property.

6.15  PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN TRUSTOR. Trustor
      acknowledges that Beneficiary has relied upon the principals of Trustor
      and Borrower and their experience in owning and operating properties
      similar to the Property in connection with the closing of the Loan.
      Accordingly, except with the prior written consent of Beneficiary or as
      otherwise expressly permitted in the Note, Trustor shall not: (a) cause or
      permit any sale, exchange, mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment,
      encumbrance or other transfer, conveyance or disposition, whether
      voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of law ("Transfer") of all or
      any part of, or all or any direct or indirect interest in, the Property or
      the Collateral (except for equipment and inventory in the ordinary course
      of its business); or (b) cause or permit a Transfer of any direct or
      indirect interest in any partnership, limited liability company,
      corporation, trust, or other entity comprising all or any portion of or
      holding any direct or indirect interest in Trustor or Borrower (other than
      the sale or exchange of a limited partnership interest or a non-managing
      membership interest). If any Transfer not expressly permitted in the Note
      or this Deed of Trust is made without the prior written consent of
      Beneficiary, Beneficiary shall have the absolute right at its option,
      without prior demand or notice, to declare all of the Secured Obligations
      immediately due and payable, except to the extent prohibited by law, and
      pursue its rights and remedies under Section 7.3 herein. Trustor agrees to
      pay any prepayment fee as set forth in the Note in the event the Secured
      Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the terms of this Section. Consent
      to one such Transfer shall not be deemed to be a waiver of the right to
      require the consent to future or successive Transfers. Except for
      Transfers expressly permitted under the Note, Beneficiary's consent to any
      Transfer may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in Beneficiary's sole and
      absolute discretion.

6.16  ACCEPTANCE OF TRUST; POWERS AND DUTIES OF TRUSTEE. Trustee accepts this
      trust when this Deed of Trust is recorded. From time to time upon written
      request of Beneficiary and presentation of this Deed of Trust, or a
      certified copy thereof, for endorsement, and without affecting the
      personal liability of any person for payment of any indebtedness or
      performance of any Secured Obligation, Trustee may, without liability
      therefor and without notice: (a) reconvey all or any part of the Property;
      (b) consent to the making of any map or plat of the Property; (c) join
      with Trustor in granting any easement on the Property; (d) join with
      Trustor in any declaration of covenants and restrictions; or (e) join in
      any extension agreement or any agreement subordinating the lien or charge
      of this Deed of Trust. Nothing contained in the immediately preceding
      sentence shall be construed to limit, impair or otherwise affect the
      rights of Trustor in any respect. Except as may otherwise be required by
      applicable law, Trustee or Beneficiary may from time to time apply to any
      court of competent jurisdiction for aid and direction in the execution of
      the trusts hereunder and the enforcement of the rights and remedies
      available hereunder, and Trustee or Beneficiary may obtain orders or
      decrees directing or confirming or approving acts in the execution of said
      trusts and the enforcement of said remedies. Trustee has no obligation to
      notify any party of any pending sale or any action or proceeding
      (including, without limitation, actions in which Trustor, Beneficiary or
      Trustee shall be a party) unless held or commenced and maintained by
      Trustee under this Deed of Trust. Trustee shall not be obligated to
      perform any act required of it hereunder


                                       18
<PAGE>
      unless the performance of the act is requested in writing and Trustee is
      reasonably indemnified and held harmless against loss, cost, liability and
      expense.

6.17  COMPENSATION OF TRUSTEE. Trustor shall pay to Trustee reasonable
      compensation and reimbursement for services and expenses in the
      administration of this trust, including, without limitation, reasonable
      attorneys' fees. Trustor shall pay all indebtedness arising under this
      Section immediately upon demand by Trustee or Beneficiary together with
      interest thereon from the date the indebtedness arises at the rate of
      interest then applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified
      therein.

6.18  EXCULPATION. Beneficiary shall not directly or indirectly be liable to
      Trustor or any other person as a consequence of: (a) the exercise of the
      rights, remedies or powers granted to Beneficiary in this Deed of Trust;
      (b) the failure or refusal of Beneficiary to perform or discharge any
      obligation or liability of Trustor under any agreement related to the
      Property or under this Deed of Trust; or (c) any loss sustained by Trustor
      or any third party resulting from Beneficiary's failure to lease the
      Property after a Default or from any other act or omission of Beneficiary
      in managing the Property after a Default unless the loss is caused by the
      willful misconduct and bad faith of Beneficiary and no such liability
      shall be asserted or enforced against Beneficiary, all such liability
      being expressly waived and released by Trustor.

6.19  INDEMNITY. Without in any way limiting any other indemnity contained in
      this Deed of Trust, Trustor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless
      Trustee and the Beneficiary Group (as defined below) from and against any
      claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly
      arising out of: (a) the making of the Loan, except for violations of
      banking laws or regulations by the Beneficiary Group; (b) this Deed of
      Trust; (c) the execution of this Deed of Trust or the performance of any
      act required or permitted hereunder or by law; (d) any failure of Trustor
      to perform Trustor's obligations under this Deed of Trust or the other
      Loan Documents; (e) any alleged obligation or undertaking on the
      Beneficiary Group's part to perform or discharge any of the
      representations, warranties, conditions, covenants or other obligations
      contained in any other document related to the Property; (f) any act or
      omission by Trustor or any contractor, agent, employee or representative
      of Trustor with respect to the Property; or (g) any claim, loss, damage,
      cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising out of: (i) the
      use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, release, threatened
      release, discharge, disposal, transportation or presence of any Hazardous
      Materials which are found in, on, under or about the Property (including,
      without limitation, underground contamination); or (ii) the breach of any
      covenant, representation or warranty of Trustor under Sections 5.1.p,
      5.1.q, 5.1.r, or 6.2 above. The foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding,
      this indemnity shall not include any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
      liability directly or indirectly arising out of the gross negligence or
      willful misconduct of any member of the Beneficiary Group or Trustee, or
      any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the
      Beneficiary Group or Trustee arising from any act or incident on the
      Property occurring after the full reconveyance and release of the lien of
      this Deed of Trust on the Property, or with respect to the matters set
      forth in clause (g) above, any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or
      liability incurred by the Beneficiary Group resulting from the
      introduction and initial release of Hazardous Materials on the Property
      occurring after the transfer of title to the Property at a foreclosure
      sale under this Deed of Trust, either pursuant to judicial decree or the
      power of sale, or by deed in lieu of such foreclosure. This indemnity
      shall include, without limitation: (aa) all consequential damages
      (including, without limitation, any third party tort claims or
      governmental claims, fines or penalties against Trustee or the Beneficiary
      Group); (bb) all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees (including,
      without limitation, expert witness fees) paid or incurred by Trustee or
      the Beneficiary Group; and (cc) the costs, whether foreseeable or
      unforeseeable, of any investigation, repair, cleanup or detoxification of
      the Property which is required by any governmental entity or is otherwise
      necessary to render the Property in compliance with all laws and
      regulations pertaining to Hazardous Materials. "Beneficiary Group", as
      used herein, shall mean (1) Beneficiary (including, without limitation,
      any participant in the Loan), (2) any entity controlling, controlled by or
      under common control with Beneficiary, (3) the directors, officers,
      employees and agents of Beneficiary and such other entities, and (4) the
      successors, heirs and assigns of the entities and persons described in
      foregoing clauses (1) through (3). Trustor shall pay immediately upon
      Trustee's or Beneficiary's demand any amounts owing under this indemnity
      together with interest from the date the indebtedness arises until paid at
      the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of the Note as
      specified therein. Trustor agrees to use legal


                                       19
<PAGE>
      counsel reasonably acceptable to Trustee and the Beneficiary Group in any
      action or proceeding arising under this indemnity. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
      SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE TERMINATION AND RECONVEYANCE OF THIS DEED OF
      TRUST, BUT TRUSTOR'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS INDEMNITY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO
      THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECTION IN THE NOTE ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

6.20  SUBSTITUTION OF TRUSTEE. From time to time, by a writing signed and
      acknowledged by Beneficiary and recorded in the Office of the Recorder of
      the County in which the Property is situated, Beneficiary may appoint
      another trustee to act in the place and stead of Trustee or any successor.
      Such writing shall set forth any information required by law. The
      recordation of such instrument of substitution shall discharge Trustee
      herein named and shall appoint the new trustee as the trustee hereunder
      with the same effect as if originally named trustee herein. A writing
      recorded pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall be conclusive
      proof of the proper substitution of such new trustee.

6.21  RELEASES, EXTENSIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY. Without
      notice to or the consent, approval or agreement of any persons or entities
      having any interest at any time in the Property or in any manner obligated
      under the Secured Obligations ("Interested Parties"), Beneficiary may,
      from time to time: (a) fully or partially release any person or entity
      from liability for the payment or performance of any Secured Obligation;
      (b) extend the maturity of any Secured Obligation; (c) make any agreement
      with Borrower increasing the amount or otherwise altering the terms of any
      Secured Obligation; (d) accept additional security for any Secured
      Obligation; or (e) release all or any portion of the Property, Collateral
      and other security for any Secured Obligation. None of the foregoing
      actions shall release or reduce the personal liability of any of said
      Interested Parties, or release or impair the priority of the lien of this
      Deed of Trust upon the Property.

6.22  SALE OR PARTICIPATION OF LOAN. Trustor agrees that Beneficiary may at any
      time sell, assign, participate or securitize all or any portion of
      Beneficiary's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, and that
      any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization may be to one
      or more financial institutions or other entities, to private investors,
      and/or into the public securities market, in Beneficiary's sole
      discretion. Trustor further agrees that Beneficiary may disseminate to any
      such actual or potential purchaser(s), assignee(s) or participant(s) all
      documents and financial and other information heretofore or hereafter
      provided to or known to Beneficiary with respect to: (a) the Property and
      its operation; and/or (b) any party connected with the Loan (including,
      without limitation, Trustor, any partner or member of Trustor, any
      constituent partner or member of Trustor, any guarantor and any
      nonborrower trustor). In the event of any such sale, assignment,
      participation or securitization, Beneficiary and the other parties to the
      same shall share in the rights and obligations of Beneficiary set forth in
      the Loan Documents as and to the extent they shall agree among themselves.
      In connection with any such sale, assignment, participation or
      securitization, Trustor further agrees that the Loan Documents shall be
      sufficient evidence of the obligations of Trustor to each purchaser,
      assignee or participant, and Trustor shall, within 15 days after request
      by Beneficiary, (x) deliver an estoppel certificate verifying for the
      benefit of Beneficiary and any other party designated by Beneficiary the
      status and the terms and provisions of the Loan in form and substance
      acceptable to Beneficiary, (y) provide any information, legal opinions or
      documents regarding Trustor, Guarantor (as defined in the Loan Documents),
      the Property and any tenants of the Property as Beneficiary or
      Beneficiary's rating agencies may reasonably request, and (z) enter into
      such amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents or the
      organizational documents of Trustor as may be reasonably required in order
      to facilitate any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization
      without impairing Trustor's rights or increasing Trustor's obligations.
      The indemnity obligations of Trustor under the Loan Documents shall also
      apply with respect to any purchaser, assignee or participant.

6.23  RECONVEYANCE. Upon Beneficiary's written request, and upon surrender of
      this Deed of Trust or certified copy thereof and any note, instrument or
      instruments setting forth all obligations secured hereby to Trustee for
      cancellation, Trustee shall reconvey, without warranty, the Property or
      that portion thereof then held hereunder. The recitals of any matters or
      facts in any reconveyance executed hereunder shall be conclusive proof of
      the truthfulness thereof. To the extent permitted by law, the reconveyance
      may describe the grantee as "the person or persons legally entitled
      thereto". Neither Beneficiary nor Trustee shall have any duty to determine
      the rights


                                       20
<PAGE>
      of persons claiming to be rightful grantees of any reconveyance. When the
      Property has been fully reconveyed, the last such reconveyance shall
      operate as a reassignment of all future rents, issues and profits of the
      Property to the person or persons legally entitled thereto.

6.24  SUBROGATION. Beneficiary shall be subrogated to the lien of all
      encumbrances, whether released of record or not, paid in whole or in part
      by Beneficiary pursuant to this Deed of Trust or by the proceeds of any
      loan secured by this Deed of Trust.

6.25  MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. Without the prior written consent of Beneficiary,
      Trustor shall not terminate, modify, amend or enter into any agreement
      providing for the management, leasing or operation of the Property.
      Trustor represents, warrants and covenants that any existing management
      agreement includes, and any future management agreement entered into by
      Trustor shall include, a provision which provides that the management
      agreement is automatically terminated upon the transfer of the Property by
      Trustor, either by sale, foreclosure, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or
      otherwise, to Beneficiary or any other purchaser of the Property. Upon a
      Default under the Loan Documents or a default under any management
      agreement then in effect, which default is not cured within any applicable
      grace or cure period, Beneficiary shall have the right to terminate, or to
      direct Trustor to terminate, such management agreement upon thirty (30)
      days' written notice and to retain, or to direct Trustor to retain, a new
      management agent approved by Beneficiary.

                               ARTICLE 7. DEFAULT

      Default" (as defined below) or an "Automatic Default" (as defined below).

      a.    OPTIONAL DEFAULT. An "Optional Default" shall occur, at
            Beneficiary's option, upon the occurrence of any of the following
            events:

            (i)   MONETARY. Borrower or Trustor shall fail to (aa) pay when due
                  any sums payable under the Loan Documents which by their
                  express terms require immediate payment without any grace
                  period or sums which are payable on the Maturity Date, or (bb)
                  pay within 5 days when due any other sums payable under the
                  Note, this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents,
                  including without limitation, any monthly payment due under
                  the Note.

            (ii)  FAILURE TO PERFORM. Borrower or Trustor shall fail to observe,
                  perform or discharge any of Borrower's or Trustor's
                  obligations, covenants, conditions or agreements, other than
                  Borrower's or Trustor's payment obligations, under the Note,
                  this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, and
                  (aa) such failure shall remain uncured for 30 days after
                  written notice thereof shall have been given to Borrower or
                  Trustor, as the case may be, by Beneficiary or (bb) if such
                  failure is of such a nature that it cannot be cured within
                  such 30 day period, Borrower or Trustor shall fail to commence
                  to cure such failure within such 30 day period or shall fail
                  to diligently prosecute such curative action thereafter.

            (iii) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Any representation, warranty,
                  certificate or other statement (financial or otherwise) made
                  or furnished by or on behalf of Borrower, Trustor, or a
                  guarantor, if any, to Beneficiary or in connection with any of
                  the Loan Documents, or as an inducement to Beneficiary to make
                  the Loan, shall be false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading
                  in any material respect when made or furnished.

            (iv)  CONDEMNATION; ATTACHMENT. The condemnation, seizure or
                  appropriation of any material portion (as reasonably
                  determined by Beneficiary) of the Property; or the
                  sequestration or attachment of, or levy or execution upon any
                  of the Property, the Collateral or any other collateral
                  provided by Borrower or Trustor under any of the Loan
                  Documents, or any material portion of


                                       21
<PAGE>
                  the other assets of Borrower or Trustor, which sequestration,
                  attachment, levy or execution is not released or dismissed
                  within 45 days after its occurrence; or the sale of any assets
                  affected by any of the foregoing.

            (v)   UNINSURED CASUALTY. The occurrence of an uninsured casualty
                  with respect to any material portion (as reasonably determined
                  by Beneficiary) of the Property unless: (aa) no other Default
                  has occurred and is continuing at the time of such casualty or
                  occurs thereafter; (bb) Trustor promptly notifies Beneficiary
                  of the occurrence of such casualty; and (cc) not more than 45
                  days after the occurrence of such casualty, Trustor delivers
                  to Beneficiary immediately available funds in an amount
                  sufficient, in Beneficiary's reasonable opinion, to pay all
                  costs of the repair or restoration (including, without
                  limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent
                  during the repair period). So long as no Default has occurred
                  and is continuing at the time of Beneficiary's receipt of such
                  funds and no Default occurs thereafter, Beneficiary shall make
                  such funds available for the repair or restoration of the
                  Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Beneficiary shall
                  have no obligation to make any funds available for repair or
                  restoration of the Property unless and until all the
                  conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the second
                  sentence of Section 6.11(b) of this Deed of Trust have been
                  satisfied. Trustor acknowledges that the specific conditions
                  described above are reasonable.

            (vi)  ADVERSE FINANCIAL CHANGE. Any material adverse change in the
                  financial condition of Borrower or any general partner or
                  managing member of Borrower, any guarantor, or any other
                  person or entity from the condition shown on the financial
                  statement(s) submitted to Beneficiary and relied upon by
                  Beneficiary in making the Loan, and which change Beneficiary
                  reasonably determines will have a material adverse effect on
                  (aa) the business, operations or condition of the Property; or
                  (bb) the ability of Borrower or Trustor to pay or perform
                  Borrower's or Trustor's obligations in accordance with the
                  terms of the Note, this Deed of Trust, and the other Loan
                  Documents.

      b.    AUTOMATIC DEFAULT. An "Automatic Default" shall occur automatically

            (i)   VOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY, DISSOLUTION. (aa) Borrower's
                  filing a petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Reform Act

                  under any other present or future state or federal law
                  regarding bankruptcy, reorganization or other relief to
                  debtors (collectively, "Debtor Relief Law"); or (bb)
                  Borrower's filing any pleading in any involuntary proceeding
                  under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law which
                  admits the jurisdiction of a court to regulate Borrower or the
                  Property or the petition's material allegations regarding
                  Borrower's insolvency; or (cc) Borrower's making a general
                  assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (dd) Borrower's
                  applying for, or the appointment of, a receiver, trustee,
                  custodian or liquidator of Borrower or any of its property; or
                  (ee) the filing by Borrower of a petition seeking the

                  Code or other Debtor Relief Law that is filed against Borrower
                  or in any way restrains or limits Borrower or Beneficiary
                  regarding the Loan or the Property, prior to the earlier of
                  the entry of any order granting relief sought in the
                  involuntary petition or 45 days after the date of filing of
                  the petition.

<PAGE>
            (iii) PARTNERS, GUARANTORS. The occurrence of an event specified in
                  clauses (i) or (ii) as to Trustor, any general partner or

7.2   ACCELERATION. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Default, Beneficiary may,
      at its option, declare all sums owing to Beneficiary under the Note and
      the other Loan Documents immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence
      of an Automatic Default, all sums owing to Beneficiary under the Note and
      the other Loan Documents shall automatically become immediately due and
      payable.

7.3   RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. In addition to the rights and remedies in Section 7.2
      above, at any time after a Default, Beneficiary shall have all of the
      following rights and remedies:

      a.    ENTRY ON PROPERTY. With or without notice, and without releasing
            Trustor from any Secured Obligation, and without becoming a
            mortgagee in possession, to enter upon the Property from time to
            time and to do such acts and things as Beneficiary or Trustee deem
            necessary or desirable in order to inspect, investigate, assess and
            protect the security hereof or to cure any Default, including,
            without limitation: (i) to take and possess all documents, books,

            proceeding purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or
            powers of Beneficiary or Trustee hereunder; (v) to pay, purchase,
            contest or compromise any encumbrance, charge, lien or claim of lien
            which, in the sole judgment of either Beneficiary or Trustee, is or
            may be senior in priority hereto, the judgment of Beneficiary or
            Trustee being conclusive as between the parties hereto; (vi) to
            obtain insurance; (vii) to pay any premiums or charges with respect
            to insurance required to be carried hereunder; (viii) to obtain a

            Property for Hazardous Materials, in which regard the decision of
            Beneficiary as to whether there exists a release or threatened
            release of Hazardous Materials onto the Property shall be deemed
            reasonable and conclusive as between the parties hereto; (ix) to
            have a receiver appointed pursuant to applicable law to enforce
            Beneficiary's rights to enter and inspect the Property for Hazardous
            Materials; and/or (x) to employ legal counsel, accountants,
            engineers, consultants, contractors and other appropriate persons to

            right to collect Payments and to enter on and inspect the Property
            for Hazardous Materials, as a matter of strict right and without
            regard to: (i) the adequacy of the security for the repayment of the
            Secured Obligations; (ii) the existence of a declaration that the
            Secured Obligations are immediately due and payable; (iii) the
            filing of a notice of default; or (iv) the solvency of Trustor,

      c.    JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE; INJUNCTION. To commence and maintain an action
            or actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to foreclose this
            instrument as a mortgage or to obtain specific enforcement of the
            covenants of Trustor hereunder, and Trustor agrees that such
            covenants shall be specifically enforceable by injunction or any
            other appropriate equitable remedy and that for the purposes of any
            suit brought under this subparagraph, Trustor waives the defense of
            laches and any applicable statute of limitations;

      d.    NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE. To execute a written notice of such Default

            When the minimum period of time required by law after such notice
            has elapsed, Trustee, without notice to or demand upon Trustor
            except as


                                       23
<PAGE>
            required by law, shall sell the Property at the time and place of
            sale fixed by it in the notice of sale, at one or several sales,
            either as a whole or in separate parcels and in such manner and
            order, all as Beneficiary in its sole discretion may determine, at
            public auction to the highest bidder for cash, in lawful money of
            the United States, payable at time of sale. Neither Trustor nor any
            other person or entity other than Beneficiary shall have the right
            to direct the order in which the Property is sold. Subject to
            requirements and limits imposed by law, Trustee may, from time to
            time postpone sale of all or any portion of the Property by public
            announcement at such time and place of sale, and from time to time
            may postpone the sale by public announcement at the time and place
            fixed by the preceding postponement. A sale of less than the whole
            of the Property or any defective or irregular sale made hereunder
            shall not exhaust the power of sale provided for herein. Trustee
            shall deliver to the purchaser at such sale a deed conveying the
            Property or portion thereof so sold, but without any covenant or
            warranty, express or implied. The recitals in the deed of any
            matters or facts shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness
            thereof. Any person, including Trustee, Trustor or Beneficiary may
            purchase at the sale;

            Upon sale of the Property at any judicial or nonjudicial
            foreclosure, Beneficiary may credit bid (as determined by
            Beneficiary in its sole and absolute discretion) all or any portion
            of the Secured Obligations. In determining such credit bid,
            Beneficiary may, but is not obligated to, take into account all or
            any of the following: (i) appraisals of the Property as such
            appraisals may be discounted or adjusted by Beneficiary in its sole
            and absolute underwriting discretion; (ii) expenses and costs
            incurred by Beneficiary with respect to the Property prior to
            foreclosure; (iii) expenses and costs which Beneficiary anticipates
            will be incurred with respect to the Property after foreclosure, but
            prior to resale, including, without limitation, costs of structural
            reports and other due diligence, costs to carry the Property prior
            to resale, costs of resale (e.g. commissions, attorneys' fees, and
            taxes), costs of any Hazardous Materials clean-up and monitoring,
            costs of deferred maintenance, repair, refurbishment and retrofit,
            costs of defending or settling litigation affecting the Property,
            and lost opportunity costs (if any), including the time value of
            money during any anticipated holding period by Beneficiary; (iv)
            declining trends in real property values generally and with respect
            to properties similar to the Property; (v) anticipated discounts
            upon resale of the Property as a distressed or foreclosed property;
            (vi) the fact of additional collateral (if any), for the Secured
            Obligations; and (vii) such other factors or matters that
            Beneficiary (in its sole and absolute discretion) deems appropriate.
            In regard to the above, Trustor acknowledges and agrees that: (viii)
            Beneficiary is not required to use any or all of the foregoing
            factors to determine the amount of its credit bid; (ix) this
            paragraph does not impose upon Beneficiary any additional
            obligations that are not imposed by law at the time the credit bid
            is made; (x) the amount of Beneficiary's credit bid need not have
            any relation to any loan-to-value ratios specified in the Loan
            Documents or previously discussed between Trustor and Beneficiary;
            and (xi) Beneficiary's credit bid may be (at Beneficiary's sole and
            absolute discretion) higher or lower than any appraised value of the
            Property;

      e.    MULTIPLE FORECLOSURES. To resort to and realize upon the security
            hereunder and any other security now or later held by Beneficiary
            concurrently or successively and in one or several consolidated or
            independent judicial actions or lawfully taken nonjudicial
            proceedings, or both, and to apply the proceeds received upon the
            Secured Obligations all in such order and manner as Trustee and
            Beneficiary or either of them determine in their sole discretion;

      f.    RIGHTS TO COLLATERAL. To exercise all rights Trustee or Beneficiary
            may have with respect to the Collateral under this Deed of Trust,
            the UCC or otherwise at law; and

      g.    OTHER RIGHTS. To exercise such other rights as Trustee or
            Beneficiary may have at law or in equity or pursuant to the terms
            and conditions of this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan
            Documents.

      In connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Beneficiary may elect to
      treat any of the Property which consists of a right in action or which is
      property that can be severed from the Property (including, without
      limitation, any improvements forming a part thereof) without causing
      structural damage thereto as if the same were personal


                                       24
<PAGE>
      property or a fixture, as the case may be, and dispose of the same in
      accordance with applicable law, separate and apart from the sale of the
      Property. Any sale of Collateral hereunder shall be conducted in any
      manner permitted by the UCC.

7.4   APPLICATION OF FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS. If any foreclosure sale is
      effected, Trustee shall apply the proceeds of such sale in the following
      order of priority: First, to the costs, fees and expenses of exercising
      the power of sale and of sale, including, without limitation, the payment
      of reasonable Trustee's fees and attorneys' fees; Second, to the payment
      of the Secured Obligations which are secured by this Deed of Trust, in
      such order as Beneficiary shall determine in its sole discretion; Third,
      to satisfy the outstanding balance of obligations secured by any junior
      liens or encumbrances in the order of their priority; and Fourth, to the
      Trustor or the Trustor's successor in interest, or in the event the
      Property has been sold or transferred to another, to the vested owner of
      record at the time of the Trustee's sale.

7.5   WAIVER OF MARSHALING RIGHTS. Trustor, for itself and for all parties
      claiming through or under Trustor, and for all parties who may acquire a
      lien on or interest in the Property, hereby waives all rights to have the
      Property and/or any other property, including, without limitation, the
      Collateral, which is now or later may be security for any Secured
      Obligation, marshaled upon any foreclosure of this Deed of Trust or on a
      foreclosure of any other security for any of the Secured Obligations.

7.6   NO CURE OR WAIVER. Neither Beneficiary's nor Trustee's nor any receiver's
      entry upon and taking possession of all or any part of the Property, nor
      any collection of rents, issues, profits, insurance proceeds, condemnation
      proceeds or damages, other security or proceeds of other security, or
      other sums, nor the application of any collected sum to any Secured
      Obligation, nor the exercise of any other right or remedy by Beneficiary
      or Trustee or any receiver shall cure or waive any Default or notice of
      default under this Deed of Trust, or nullify the effect of any notice of
      default or sale (unless all Secured Obligations then due have been paid or
      performed and Trustor has cured all other Defaults hereunder), or impair
      the status of the security, or prejudice Beneficiary or Trustee in the
      exercise of any right or remedy, or be construed as an affirmation by
      Beneficiary of any tenancy, lease or option or a subordination of the lien
      of this Deed of Trust.

7.7   PAYMENT OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Trustor agrees to pay to
      Beneficiary immediately and upon demand all costs and expenses incurred by
      Trustee and Beneficiary in the enforcement of the terms and conditions of
      this Deed of Trust (including, without limitation, statutory trustee's
      fees, court costs and attorneys' fees, whether incurred in litigation or
      not) with interest from the date of expenditure until said sums have been
      paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal balance of the
      Note as specified therein.

7.8   POWER TO FILE NOTICES AND CURE DEFAULTS. Trustor hereby irrevocably
      appoints Beneficiary and its successors and assigns, as its
      attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, to perform any
      obligation of Trustor hereunder upon the occurrence of an event, act or
      omission which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a
      Default, provided, however, that: (a) Beneficiary as such attorney-in-fact
      shall only be accountable for such funds as are actually received by
      Beneficiary; and (b) Beneficiary shall not be liable to Trustor or any
      other person or entity for any failure to act under this Section.

7.9   REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights and remedies of Beneficiary and Trustee
      under this Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents are cumulative and
      are in addition to all rights and remedies provided by applicable law
      (including specifically that of foreclosure of this Deed of Trust as
      though it were a mortgage). Beneficiary may enforce any one or more
      remedies or rights under the Loan Documents either successively or
      concurrently.

                       ARTICLE 8. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

8.1   ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. The Loan Documents contain or incorporate by
      reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters
      contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations. The


                                       25
<PAGE>
      Loan Documents grant further rights to Beneficiary and contain further
      agreements and affirmative and negative covenants by Trustor which apply
      to this Deed of Trust and to the Property and such further rights and
      agreements are incorporated herein by this reference. THE OBLIGATIONS AND
      LIABILITIES OF TRUSTOR UNDER THIS DEED OF TRUST AND THE OTHER LOAN
      DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE SECTION IN THE NOTE
      ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

8.2   NON-WAIVER. By accepting payment of any amount secured hereby after its
      due date or late performance of any other Secured Obligation, Beneficiary
      shall not waive its right against any person obligated directly or
      indirectly hereunder or on any Secured Obligation, either to require
      prompt payment or performance when due of all other sums and obligations
      so secured or to declare default for failure to make such prompt payment
      or performance. No exercise of any right or remedy by Beneficiary or
      Trustee hereunder shall constitute a waiver of any other right or remedy
      herein contained or provided by law. No failure by Beneficiary or Trustee
      to exercise any right or remedy hereunder arising upon any Default shall
      be construed to prejudice Beneficiary's or Trustee's rights or remedies
      upon the occurrence of any other or subsequent Default. No delay by
      Beneficiary or Trustee in exercising any such right or remedy shall be
      construed to preclude Beneficiary or Trustee from the exercise thereof at
      any time while that Default is continuing. No notice to nor demand on
      Trustor shall of itself entitle Trustor to any other or further notice or
      demand in similar or other circumstances.

8.3   CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND EXPENSES. Wherever Beneficiary's consent,
      approval, acceptance or satisfaction is required under any provision of
      this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, such consent,
      approval, acceptance or satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld,
      conditioned or delayed by Beneficiary unless such provision expressly so
      provides. Wherever costs or expenses are required to be paid under any
      provision of this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents, such
      costs or expenses shall be reasonable.

8.4   PERMITTED CONTESTS. After prior written notice to Beneficiary, Trustor may
      contest, by appropriate legal or other proceedings conducted in good faith
      and with due diligence, the amount, validity or application, in whole or
      in part, of any lien, levy, tax or assessment, or any lien of any laborer,
      mechanic, materialman, supplier or vendor, or the application to Trustor
      or the Property of any law or the validity thereof, the assertion or
      imposition of which, or the failure to pay when due, would constitute a
      Default; provided that (a) Trustor pursues the contest diligently, in a
      manner which Beneficiary determines is not prejudicial to Beneficiary, and
      does not impair the lien of this Deed of Trust; (b) the Property, or any
      part hereof or estate or interest therein, shall not be in any danger of
      being sold, forfeited or lost by reason of such proceedings; (c) in the
      case of the contest of any law or other legal requirement, Beneficiary
      shall not be in any danger of any civil or criminal liability; and (d) if
      required by Beneficiary, Trustor deposits with Beneficiary any funds or
      other forms of assurance (including a bond or letter of credit)
      satisfactory to Beneficiary to protect Beneficiary from the consequences
      of the contest being unsuccessful. Trustor's right to contest pursuant to
      the terms of this provision shall in no way relieve Trustor or Borrower of
      its obligations under the Loan or to make payments to Beneficiary as and
      when due.

8.5   FURTHER ASSURANCES. Trustor shall, upon demand by Beneficiary or Trustee,
      execute, acknowledge (if appropriate) and deliver any and all documents
      and instruments and do or cause to be done all further acts reasonably
      necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of the Loan Documents
      and to perfect any assignments contained therein.

8.6   ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action, suit or proceeding is commenced
      between Trustor and Beneficiary regarding their respective rights and
      obligations under this Deed of Trust or any of the other Loan Documents,
      the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to damages
      or other relief, costs and expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees and court
      costs (including, without limitation, expert witness fees). As used herein
      the term "prevailing party" shall mean the party which obtains the
      principal relief it has sought, whether by compromise settlement or
      judgment. If the party which commenced or instituted the action, suit or
      proceeding shall dismiss or discontinue it without the concurrence of the
      other party, such other party shall be deemed the prevailing party.


                                       26
<PAGE>
8.7   TRUSTOR AND BENEFICIARY DEFINED. The term "Trustor" includes both the
      original Trustor and any subsequent owner or owners of any of the
      Property, and the term "Beneficiary" includes the original Beneficiary and
      any future owner or holder, including assignees, pledges and participants,
      of the Note or any interest therein.

8.8   DISCLAIMERS.

      a.    RELATIONSHIP. The relationship of Trustor and Beneficiary under this
            Deed of Trust and the other Loan Documents is, and shall at all
            times remain, solely that of borrower and lender; and Beneficiary
            neither undertakes nor assumes any responsibility or duty to Trustor
            or to any third party with respect to the Property. Notwithstanding
            any other provisions of this Deed of Trust and the other Loan
            Documents: (i) Beneficiary is not, and shall not be construed to be,
            a partner, joint venturer, member, alter ego, manager, controlling
            person or other business associate or participant of any kind of
            Trustor, and Beneficiary does not intend to ever assume such status;
            (ii) Beneficiary's activities in connection with this Deed of Trust
            and the other Loan Documents shall not be "outside the scope of
            activities of a lender of money" within the meaning of California
            Civil Code Section 3434, as amended or recodified from time to time,
            and Beneficiary does not intend to ever assume any responsibility to
            any person for the quality, suitability, safety or condition of the
            Property; and (iii) Beneficiary shall not be deemed responsible for
            or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions of Trustor.

      b.    NO LIABILITY. Beneficiary shall not be directly or indirectly liable
            or responsible for any loss, claim, cause of action, liability,
            indebtedness, damage or injury of any kind or character to any
            person or property arising from any construction on, or occupancy or
            use of, the Property, whether caused by or arising from: (i) any
            defect in any building, structure, grading, fill, landscaping or
            other improvements thereon or in any on-site or off-site improvement
            or other facility therein or thereon; (ii) any act or omission of
            Trustor or any of Trustor's agents, employees, independent
            contractors, licensees or invitees; (iii) any accident in or on the
            Property or any fire, flood or other casualty or hazard thereon;
            (iv) the failure of Trustor or any of Trustor's licensees,
            employees, invitees, agents, independent contractors or other
            representatives to maintain the Property in a safe condition; or (v)
            any nuisance made or suffered on any part of the Property.

8.9   SEVERABILITY. If any term of this Deed of Trust or any other Loan
      Document, or the application thereof to any person or circumstances,
      shall, to any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
      Deed of Trust or such other Loan Document, or the application of such term
      to persons or circumstances other than those as to which it is invalid or
      unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term of this Deed
      of Trust or such other Loan Document shall be valid and enforceable to the
      fullest extent permitted by law.

8.10  RELATIONSHIP OF ARTICLES. The rights, remedies and interests of
      Beneficiary under the deed of trust established by Article 1 and the
      security agreement established by Article 4 are independent and
      cumulative, and there shall be no merger of any lien created by the deed
      of trust with any security interest created by the security agreement.
      Beneficiary may elect to exercise or enforce any of its rights, remedies
      or interests under either or both the deed of trust or the security
      agreement as Beneficiary may from time to time deem appropriate. The
      absolute assignment of rents and leases established by Article 3 is
      similarly independent of and separate from the deed of trust and the
      security agreement.

8.11  MERGER. No merger shall occur as a result of Beneficiary's acquiring any
      other estate in, or any other lien on, the Property unless Beneficiary
      consents to a merger in writing.

8.12  OBLIGATIONS OF TRUSTOR, JOINT AND SEVERAL. If more than one person has
      executed this Deed of Trust as "Trustor", the obligations of all such
      persons hereunder shall be joint and several.


                                       27
<PAGE>
8.13  SEPARATE AND COMMUNITY PROPERTY. Any married person who executes this Deed
      of Trust as a "Trustor" agrees that any money judgment which Beneficiary
      or Trustee obtains pursuant to the terms of this Deed of Trust or any
      other obligation of that married person secured by this Deed of Trust may
      be collected by execution upon any separate property or community property
      of that person.

8.14  INTEGRATION; INTERPRETATION. The Loan Documents contain or expressly
      incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect
      to the matters contemplated therein and supersede all prior negotiations
      or agreements, written or oral. The Loan Documents shall not be modified
      except by written instrument executed by all parties. Any reference in any
      of the Loan Documents to the Property or Collateral shall include all or
      any part of the Property or Collateral. Any reference to the Loan
      Documents includes any amendments, renewals or extensions now or hereafter
      approved by Beneficiary in writing. When the identity of the parties or
      other circumstances make it appropriate, the masculine gender includes the
      feminine and/or neuter, and the singular number includes the plural.

8.15  CAPITALIZED TERMS. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall
      have the meanings set forth in the Note.

8.16  SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST. The terms, covenants, and conditions contained
      herein and in the other Loan Documents shall be binding upon and inure to
      the benefit of the heirs, successors and assigns of the parties. The
      foregoing sentence shall not be construed to permit Trustor to assign the
      Loan except as otherwise permitted under the Note or the other Loan
      Documents.

8.17  GOVERNING LAW. This Deed of Trust was accepted by Beneficiary in the state
      of California and the proceeds of the Note secured hereby were disbursed
      from the state of California, which state the parties agree has a
      substantial relationship to the parties and to the underlying transaction
      embodied hereby. Accordingly, in all respects, including, without limiting
      the generality of the foregoing, matters of construction, validity,
      enforceability and performance, this Deed of Trust, the Note and the other
      Loan Documents and the obligations arising hereunder and thereunder shall
      be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the state of
      California applicable to contracts made and performed in such state and
      any applicable law of the United States of America, except that at all
      times the provisions for enforcement of Beneficiary's STATUTORY POWER OF
      SALE and all other remedies granted hereunder, Beneficiary's rights under
      Section 6.2 above, and the creation, perfection and enforcement of the
      security interests created pursuant hereto and pursuant to the other Loan
      Documents in any Collateral which is located in the state where the
      Property is located shall be governed by and construed according to the
      law of the state where the Property is located. Except as provided in the
      immediately preceding sentence, Trustor hereby unconditionally and
      irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim to
      assert that the law of any jurisdiction other than California governs this
      Deed of Trust, the Note and other Loan Documents.

8.18  CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Trustor irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction
      of: (a) any state or federal court sitting in the state of California over
      any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by Trustor against Beneficiary,
      arising out of or relating to this Deed of Trust, the Note or the Loan;
      (b) any state or federal court sitting in the state where the Property is
      located or the state in which Trustor's principal place of business is
      located over any suit, action or proceeding, brought by Beneficiary
      against Trustor, arising out of or relating to this Deed of Trust, the
      Note or the Loan; and (c) any state court sitting in the county of the
      state where the Property is located over any suit, action, or proceeding,
      brought by Beneficiary to exercise its STATUTORY POWER OF SALE under this
      Deed of Trust or any action brought by Beneficiary to enforce its rights
      with respect to the Collateral. Trustor irrevocably waives, to the fullest
      extent permitted by law, any objection that Trustor may now or hereafter
      have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action, or proceeding
      brought in any such court and any claim that any such suit, action, or
      proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
      forum.

8.19  EXHIBITS. Exhibit A is incorporated into this Deed of Trust by this
      reference.

<PAGE>
            (h) All proceeds of any of the foregoing.

All of the property described above is hereinafter collectively defined as the

as a limitation of general terms.

                        ARTICLE II. OBLIGATIONS SECURED


            2.1 OBLIGATIONS SECURED. Mortgagor makes the foregoing grant and
assignment for the purpose of securing the following obligations ("Secured
Obligations"):

            (a) Full and punctual payment to Mortgagee of all sums at any time
owing under the Note;

            (b) Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations of
Mortgagor under this Mortgage, including, without limitation, indemnification
obligations and advances made to protect the Property;

            (c) Payment and performance of all additional covenants and
obligations of Borrower and Mortgagor under the Loan Documents;

            (d) Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations, if
any, which any rider attached as an exhibit to this Mortgage recites are secured
hereby;

            (e) Payment and performance of all future advances and other
obligations that the then record owner of all or part of the Property may agree
to pay and/or perform (whether as principal, surety or guarantor) for the
benefit of Mortgagee, when the obligation is evidenced by a writing which
recites that it is secured by this Mortgage;

            (f) All interest and charges on all obligations secured hereby
including, without limitation, prepayment charges, late charges and loan fees;
and

            (g) All modifications, extensions and renewals of any of the
obligations secured hereby, however evidenced, including, without limitation:
(i) modifications of the required principal payment dates or interest payment
dates or both, as the case may be, deferring or accelerating payment dates
wholly or partly; and (ii) modifications, extensions or renewals at a different
rate of interest whether or not any such modification, extension or renewal is
evidenced by a new or additional promissory note or notes.

            2.2 FUTURE ADVANCES. This Mortgage is given to secure not only the
Secured Obligations, but also such future advances, whether such advances are
obligatory or are to be made at the option of Mortgagee or the holder hereof, or
otherwise as are made within twenty years from the date hereof, to the same
extent as if such future advances were made on the date of the execution of this
Mortgage. The total amount of Secured Obligations that may be so secured by this
Mortgage may be increased or decreased from time to time, but the total unpaid
balance so secured at any one time shall not exceed twice the face amount of the
Note, plus interest thereon, and any disbursements made under this Mortgage for
the payment of impositions, taxes, assessments, levies, insurance, or otherwise
with interest on such disbursements as provided for

                                     Page 3
<PAGE>
herein, plus any increases in the principal balance as the result of negative
amortization or deferred interest, if any. It is agreed that any additional sum
or sums advanced by Mortgagee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be equally
secured with and have the same priority as the original Secured Obligations and
shall be subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions of this
Mortgage, whether or not such additional loans or advances are evidenced by
other promissory notes or other guaranties of Mortgagor and whether or not
identified by a recital that it or they are secured by this Mortgage. It is
further agreed that any additional promissory note or guaranty or promissory
notes or guaranties executed and delivered pursuant to this paragraph shall
automatically be deemed to be included in the term "Note" wherever it appears in
the context of this Mortgage. Without the prior written consent of Mortgagee,
which Mortgagee may grant or withhold in its sole discretion, Mortgagor shall
not file for record any notice limiting the maximum principal amount that may be
secured by this Mortgage to a sum less than the maximum principal amount set
forth in this paragraph.

            2.3 OBLIGATIONS. The term "obligations" is used herein in its
broadest and most comprehensive sense and shall be deemed to include, without
limitation, all interest and charges, prepayment charges, late charges and loan
fees at any time accruing or assessed on any of the Secured Obligations.

            2.4 MATURITY DATE. The maturity date of the Note is September 1,
2011.

            2.5 INCORPORATION. All terms and conditions of the documents which
evidence any of the Secured Obligations are incorporated herein by this
reference. All persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Property shall
be deemed to have notice of the terms of the Secured Obligations and to have
notice that the rate of interest on one or more Secured Obligations may vary
from time to time.

              ARTICLE III. ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

            3.1 ASSIGNMENT. Mortgagor irrevocably assigns to Mortgagee all of
Mortgagor's right, title and interest in, to and under: (a) all present and
future leases of the Property or any portion thereof, all licenses and
agreements relating to the management, leasing or operation of the Property or
any portion thereof, and all other agreements of any kind relating to the use or
occupancy of the Property or any portion thereof, whether such leases, licenses
and agreements are now existing or entered into after the date hereof
("Leases"); and (b) the rents, issues, deposits and profits of the Property,
including, without limitation, all amounts payable and all rights and benefits
accruing to Mortgagor under the Leases ("Payments"). The term "Leases" shall
also include all guarantees of and security for the tenants' performance
thereunder, and all amendments, extensions, renewals or modifications thereto
which are permitted hereunder. This is a present and absolute assignment, not an
assignment for security purposes only, and Mortgagee's right to the Leases and
Payments is not contingent upon, and may be exercised without possession of, the
Property.

            3.2 GRANT OF LICENSE. Notwithstanding the terms contained in Section
3.1, Mortgagee confers upon Mortgagor a revocable license ("License") to collect
and retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the occurrence of
a Default (as hereinafter defined). Upon a Default, the License shall be
automatically revoked and Mortgagee may collect

                                     Page 4
<PAGE>
and apply the Payments pursuant to the terms hereof without notice and without
taking possession of the Property. Upon Mortgagor's cure of the Default,
Mortgagee shall re-confer upon Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and
retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the occurrence of a
Default. All Payments thereafter collected by Mortgagor shall be held by
Mortgagor as trustee under a constructive trust for the benefit of Mortgagee.
Mortgagor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the tenants under the
Leases, upon notice of a Default from Mortgagee, to rely upon and comply with
any notice or demand by Mortgagee for the payment to Mortgagee of any rental or
other sums which may at any time become due under the Leases, or for the
performance of any of the tenants' undertakings under the Leases, and the
tenants shall have no right or duty to inquire as to whether any Default has
actually occurred or is then existing. Mortgagor hereby relieves the tenants
from any liability to Mortgagor by reason of relying upon and complying with any
such notice or demand by Mortgagee. Mortgagee may apply, in its sole discretion,
any Payments so collected by Mortgagee against any Secured Obligation or any
other obligation of Borrower, Mortgagor or any other person or entity, under any
document or instrument related to or executed in connection with the Loan
Documents, whether existing on the date hereof or hereafter arising. Collection
of any Payments by Mortgagee shall not cure or waive any Default or notice of
Default or invalidate any acts done pursuant to such notice.

            3.3 EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT. The foregoing irrevocable assignment shall
not cause Mortgagee to be: (a) a mortgagee in possession; (b) responsible or
liable for the control, care, management or repair of the Property or for
performing any of the terms, agreements, undertakings, obligations,
representations, warranties, covenants and conditions of the Leases; (c)
responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property by the tenants
under any of the Leases or by any other parties; for any dangerous or defective
condition of the Property; or for any negligence in the management, upkeep,
repair or control of the Property resulting in loss or injury or death to any
tenant, licensee, employee, invitee or other person; or (d) responsible for or
impose upon Mortgagee any duty to produce rents or profits. Mortgagee shall not
directly or indirectly be liable to Mortgagor or any other person as a
consequence of: (e) the exercise of or failure to exercise any of the rights,
remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee hereunder; or (f) the failure or refusal
of Mortgagee to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of
Mortgagor arising under the Leases.

            3.4 COVENANTS.

            (a) ALL LEASES. Mortgagor shall, at Mortgagor's sole cost and
expense:

            (i) perform all obligations of the landlord under the Leases and use
reasonable efforts to enforce performance by the tenants of all obligations of
the tenants under the Leases;

            (ii) use reasonable efforts to keep the Property leased at all times
to tenants whom Mortgagor reasonably and in good faith believes are creditworthy
at rents not less than the fair market rental value (including, but not limited
to, free or discounted rents to the extent the market so requires);

            (iii) promptly upon Mortgagee's request, deliver to Mortgagee a copy
of each requested Lease and all amendments thereto and waivers thereof; and


                                     Page 5
<PAGE>
            (iv) promptly upon Mortgagee's request, execute and record any
additional assignments of landlord's interest under any Lease to Mortgagee and
specific subordinations of any Lease to this Mortgage, in form and substance
satisfactory to Mortgagee.

Unless consented to in writing by Mortgagee or otherwise permitted under any
other provision of the Loan Documents, Mortgagor shall not:

            (v) grant any tenant under any Lease any option, right of first
refusal or other right to purchase all or any portion of the Property under any
circumstances;

            (vi) grant any tenant under any Lease any right to prepay rent more
than 1 month in advance;


            (vii) except upon Mortgagee's request, execute any assignment of
landlord's interest in any Lease; or

            (viii) collect rent or other sums due under any Lease in advance,
other than to collect rent 1 month in advance of the time when it becomes due.

Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this Section shall
be null and void.

Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee any sums received by Mortgagor in
consideration of any termination, modification or amendment of any Lease or any
release or discharge of any tenant under any Lease from any obligation
thereunder and any such sums received by Mortgagor shall be held in trust by
Mortgagor for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Default
exists, the portion of any such sum received by Mortgagor with respect to any
Lease which is less than $50,000 shall be payable to Mortgagor. All such sums
received by Mortgagee with respect to any Lease shall be deemed "Impounds" (as
defined in Section 6.12) and shall be deposited by Mortgagee into a pledged
account in accordance with Section 6.12. If no Default exists, Mortgagee shall
release such Impounds to Mortgagor from time to time as necessary to pay or
reimburse Mortgagor for such tenant improvements, brokerage commissions and
other leasing costs as may be required to re-tenant the affected space;
provided, however, Mortgagee shall have received and approved each of the
following for each tenant for which such costs were incurred; (1) Mortgagor's
written request for such release, including the name of the tenant, the location
and net rentable area of the space and a description and cost breakdown of the
tenant improvements or other leasing costs covered by the request; (2)
Mortgagor's certification that any tenant improvements have been completed
lien-free and in a workmanlike manner; (3) a fully executed Lease, or extension
or renewal of the current Lease; (4) an estoppel certificate executed by the
tenant including its acknowledgement that all tenant improvements have been
satisfactorily completed; and (5) such other information with respect to such
costs as Mortgagee may require. Following the re-tenanting of all affected space
(including, without limitation, the completion of all tenant improvements), and
provided no Default exists, Mortgagee shall release any remaining such Impounds
relating to the affected space to Mortgagor. Mortgagor shall construct all
tenant improvements in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

            (b) MAJOR LEASES. Mortgagor shall, at Mortgagor's sole cost and
expense, give Mortgagee prompt written notice of any material default by
landlord or tenant under any

                                     Page 6
<PAGE>
Major Lease (as defined below). Unless consented to in writing by Mortgagee or
otherwise permitted under any other provision of the Loan Documents, Mortgagor
shall not:

            (i) enter into any Major Lease which (aa) is not on fair market
terms (which terms may include free or discounted rent to the extent the market
so requires); (bb) does not contain a provision requiring the tenant to execute
and deliver to the landlord an estoppel certificate in form and substance
satisfactory to the landlord promptly upon the landlord's request; or (cc)
allows the tenant to assign or sublet the premises without the landlord's
consent;

            (ii) materially reduce any rent or other sums due from the tenant
under any Major Lease;

            (iii) terminate or materially modify or amend any Major Lease; or

            (iv) release or discharge the tenant or any guarantor under any
Major Lease from any material obligation thereunder.

Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this Section shall
be null and void.

"Major Lease", as used herein, shall mean any Lease, which is, at any time: (1)
a Lease of more than 20% of the total rentable area of the Property, as
reasonably determined by Mortgagee; or (2) a Lease which generates a gross base
monthly rent exceeding 20% of the total gross base monthly rent generated by all
Leases (excluding all Leases under which the tenant is then in default), as
reasonably determined by Mortgagee. Mortgagor's obligations with respect to
Major Leases shall be governed by the provisions of Section 3.4(a) as well as by
the provisions of this Section.

            (c) FAILURE TO DENY REQUEST Mortgagee's failure to deny any written
request by Mortgagor for Mortgagee's consent under the provisions of Sections
3.4(a) or 3.4(b) within 10 Business Days after Mortgagee's receipt of such
request (and all documents and information reasonably related thereto) shall be
deemed to constitute Mortgagee's consent to such request.

            3.5 RIGHT OF SUBORDINATION. Mortgagee may at any time and from time
to time by specific written instrument intended for the purpose unilaterally
subordinate the lien of this Mortgage to any Lease, without joinder or consent
of, or notice to, Mortgagor, any tenant or any other person. Notice is hereby
given to each tenant under a Lease of such right to subordinate. No
subordination referred to in this Section shall constitute a subordination to
any lien or other encumbrance, whenever arising, or improve the right of any

            4.1 SECURITY INTEREST. Mortgagor grants and assigns to Mortgagee a

following described personal property in which Mortgagor now or at any time
hereafter has any interest ("Collateral"):


                                     Page 7
<PAGE>
      All goods, building and other materials, supplies, work in process,
      equipment, machinery, fixtures, furniture, furnishings, signs and other
      personal property, wherever situated, which are or are to be incorporated
      into, used in connection with or appropriated for use on the Property; all
      rents, issues, deposits and profits of the Property (to the extent, if
      any, they are not subject to the Absolute Assignment of Rents and Leases);
      all inventory, accounts, cash receipts, deposit accounts, impounds,
      accounts receivable, contract rights, general intangibles, software,
      chattel paper, instruments, documents, promissory notes, drafts, letters
      of credit, letter of credit rights, supporting obligations, insurance
      policies, insurance and condemnation awards and proceeds, any other rights
      to the payment of money, trade names, trademarks and service marks arising
      from or related to the Property or any business now or hereafter conducted
      thereon by Mortgagor; all permits, consents, approvals, licenses,
      authorizations and other rights granted by, given by or obtained from, any
      governmental entity with respect to the Property; all deposits or other
      security now or hereafter made with or given to utility companies by
      Mortgagor with respect to the Property; all advance payments of insurance
      premiums made by Mortgagor with respect to the Property; all plans,
      drawings and specifications relating to the Property; all loan funds held
      by Mortgagee, whether or not disbursed; all funds deposited with Mortgagee
      pursuant to any Loan Document, all reserves, deferred payments, deposits,
      accounts, refunds, cost savings and payments of any kind related to the
      Property or any portion thereof, including, without limitation, all
      "Impounds" as defined herein; together with all replacements and proceeds
      of, and additions and accessions to, any of the foregoing, and all books,
      records and files relating to any of the foregoing.

            As to all of the above described personal property which is or which
hereafter becomes a "fixture" under the Florida Uniform Commercial Code (the
"UCC"), this Mortgage constitutes a fixture filing under Florida Statutes
Section 679.313 and 679.402, as amended and recodified from time to time, this
Mortgage shall constitute a fixture filing recorded in the real estate records.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be deemed to create any lien
or interest in favor of Mortgagee under this Mortgage in any such Collateral
which is not a fixture, and the purpose of this Article IV is to create a
fixture filing under Florida Statutes Section 679.313 and 679.402, as amended or
recodified from time to time.

            4.2 COVENANTS. Mortgagor agrees: (a) to execute and deliver such
documents as Mortgagee reasonably deems necessary to create, perfect and
continue the security interests contemplated hereby; (b) not to change its name,
and, as applicable, its chief executive offices, its principal residence or the
jurisdiction in which it is organized without giving Mortgagee at least 30 days'
prior written notice thereof; and (c) to cooperate with Mortgagee in perfecting
all security interests granted herein and in obtaining such agreements from
third parties as Mortgagee deems necessary, proper or convenient in connection
with the preservation, perfection or enforcement of any of Mortgagee's rights
hereunder.

            4.3 RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE. In addition to Mortgagee's rights as a
"Secured Party" under the UCC, Mortgagee may, but shall not be obligated to, at
any time without notice and at the expense of Mortgagor: (a) give notice to any
person of Mortgagee's rights hereunder and enforce such rights at law or in
equity; (b) insure, protect, defend and

                                     Page 8
<PAGE>
preserve the Collateral or any rights or interests of Mortgagee therein; and (c)
inspect the Collateral during normal business hours upon reasonable prior
written notice, provided, however, that such notice shall not be required in the
event of an emergency. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall Mortgagee be
deemed to have accepted any property other than cash in satisfaction of any
obligation of Mortgagor to Mortgagee unless Mortgagee shall make an express
written election of said remedy under the UCC or other applicable law.

            4.4 ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE UPON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence
of a Default, then in addition to all of Mortgagee's rights as a "Secured Party"
under the UCC or otherwise at law:

            (a) DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL. Mortgagee may: (i) upon written
notice, require Mortgagor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to
Mortgagee at a place reasonably designated by Mortgagee; (ii) without prior
notice (to the extent permitted by law), enter upon the Property or other place
where the Collateral may be located and take possession of, collect, sell,
lease, license and otherwise dispose of the Collateral, and store the same at
locations acceptable to Mortgagee at Mortgagor's expense; or (iii) sell, assign
and deliver the Collateral at any place or in any lawful manner and bid and
become purchaser at any such sales; and

            (b) OTHER RIGHTS. Mortgagee may, for the account of Mortgagor and at
Mortgagor's expense: (i) operate, use, consume, sell, lease, license or
otherwise dispose of the Collateral as Mortgagee reasonably deems appropriate
for the purpose of performing any or all of the Secured Obligations; (ii) enter
into any agreement, compromise or settlement including insurance claims, which
Mortgagee may reasonably deem desirable or proper with respect to the
Collateral; and (iii) endorse and deliver evidences of title for, and receive,
enforce and collect by legal action or otherwise, all indebtedness and
obligations now or hereafter owing to Mortgagor in connection with or on account
of the Collateral.

            Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the
Collateral in accordance with Mortgagee's rights and remedies as heretofore
provided is a disposition thereof in a commercially reasonable manner and that 5
Business Days prior notice of such disposition is commercially reasonable
notice. Mortgagee shall have no obligation to process or prepare the Collateral
for sale or other disposition. In disposing of the Collateral, Mortgagee may
disclaim all warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment and the like. Any
proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral may be applied by
Mortgagee first to the reasonable expenses incurred by Mortgagee in connection
therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, and then to the payment of the Secured Obligations, in such order
of application as Mortgagee may from time to time elect.

            4.5 POWER OF ATTORNEY. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints
Mortgagee as Mortgagor's attorney-in-fact (such agency being coupled with an
interest), and as such attorney-in-fact, Mortgagee may, without the obligation
to do so, in Mortgagee's name or in the name of Mortgagor, prepare, execute,
file and record financing statements, continuation statements, applications for
registration and like papers necessary to create, perfect or preserve any of
Mortgagee's security interests and rights in or to the Collateral, and upon a
Default, take

                                     Page 9
<PAGE>
any other action required of Mortgagor; provided, however, that Mortgagee as
such attorney-in-fact shall be accountable only for such funds as are actually
received by Mortgagee.

                   ARTICLE V. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            5.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Mortgagor represents and
warrants to Mortgagee that, to Mortgagor's current actual knowledge after
reasonable investigation and inquiry, the following statements are true and
correct as of the Effective Date:

            (a) LEGAL STATUS. Mortgagor and Borrower are duly organized and
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state(s) in which Mortgagor
and Borrower are organized. Mortgagor and Borrower are qualified or licensed to
do business in all jurisdictions in which such qualification or licensing is
required.

            (b) PERMITS. Mortgagor and Borrower possess all permits, franchises
and licenses and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and
fictitious names, if any, necessary to enable Mortgagor and Borrower to conduct
the business(es) in which Mortgagor and Borrower are now engaged in compliance
with applicable law.

            (c) AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The execution and delivery of the
Loan Documents have been duly authorized and the Loan Documents constitute valid
and binding obligations of Mortgagor, Borrower or the party which executed the
same, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights, or by the application of rules
of equity.

            (d) VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance by Mortgagor
and Borrower of each of the Loan Documents do not violate any provision of any
law or regulation, or result in any breach or default under any contract,
obligation, indenture or other instrument to which Mortgagor or Borrower is a
party or by which Mortgagor or Borrower is bound.

            (e) LITIGATION. There are no pending or threatened actions, claims,
investigations, suits or proceedings before any governmental authority, court or
administrative agency which may adversely affect the financial condition or
operations of Mortgagor or Borrower other than those previously disclosed in
writing by Mortgagor or Borrower to Mortgagee.

            (f) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements of Mortgagor and
Borrower, of each general partner (if Mortgagor or Borrower is a partnership),
of each member (if Mortgagor or Borrower is a limited liability company) and of
each guarantor, if any, previously delivered by Mortgagor or Borrower to
Mortgagee: (i) are materially complete and correct; (ii) present fairly the
financial condition of such party; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance
with the same accounting standard used by Mortgagor or Borrower to prepare the
financial statements delivered to and approved by Mortgagee in connection with
the making of the Loan, or other accounting standards approved by Mortgagee.
Since the date of such financial statements, there has been no material adverse
change in such financial condition, nor have any assets or properties reflected
on such financial statements been sold, transferred, assigned, mortgaged,


                                    Page 10
<PAGE>
pledged or encumbered except as previously disclosed in writing by Mortgagor or
Borrower to Mortgagee and approved in writing by Mortgagee.

            (g) REPORTS. All reports, documents, instruments and information
delivered to Mortgagee in connection with the Loan: (i) are correct in all
material respects and sufficiently complete to give Mortgagee accurate knowledge
of their subject matter; and (ii) do not contain any misrepresentation of a
material fact or omission of a material fact which omission makes the provided
information misleading.

            (h) INCOME TAXES. There are no material pending assessments or
adjustments of Mortgagor's or Borrower's income tax payable with respect to any
year.

            (i) SUBORDINATION. There is no agreement or instrument to which
Borrower is a party or by which Borrower is bound that would require the
subordination in right of payment of any of Borrower's obligations under the
Note to an obligation owed to another party.

            (j) TITLE. Mortgagor lawfully holds and possesses fee simple title
to the Property, without limitation on the right to encumber same. This Mortgage
is a first lien on the Property prior and superior to all other liens and
encumbrances on the Property except: (i) liens for real estate taxes and
assessments not yet due and payable; (ii) senior exceptions previously approved
by Mortgagee and shown in the title insurance policy insuring the lien of this
Mortgage; and (iii) other matters, if any, previously disclosed to Mortgagee by
Mortgagor in a writing specifically referring to this representation and
warranty.

            (k) MECHANICS' LIENS. There are no mechanics' or similar liens or
claims which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are
outstanding that under law could give rise to any such liens) affecting the
Property which are or may be prior to or equal to the lien of this Mortgage,
other than those (if any) previously approved by Mortgagee and shown in the
title insurance policy insuring the lien of this Mortgage.

            (l) ENCROACHMENTS. Except as shown in the survey, if any, previously

            (m) LEASES. All existing Leases are in full force and effect and are
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms. Except as disclosed on a
rent roll provided to Mortgagee prior to the date hereof, no material breach or
default by any party, or event which would constitute a material breach or
default by any party after notice or the passage of time, or both, exists under
any existing Lease. None of the landlord's interests under any of the Leases,
including, but not limited to, rents, additional rents, charges, issues or
profits, has been transferred or assigned. Except as disclosed on a rent roll
provided to Mortgagee prior to the date hereof, no rent or other payment under
any existing Lease has been paid by any tenant for more than 1 month in advance.

            (n) COLLATERAL. Mortgagor has good title to the existing Collateral,

or the right to foreclose this Mortgage.

            (x) SOLVENCY. None of the transactions contemplated by the Loan will
be or have been made with an actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any

existence, location, nature and magnitude of any past or present release or
threatened release of any Hazardous Materials into, onto, beneath or from the
Property.

            (f) LEGAL EFFECT OF SECTION. Mortgagor and Mortgagee agree that: (i)
this Hazardous Materials Section is intended as Mortgagee's written request for

state and local laws, rules and regulations applicable to the Property,
including, without limitation, all zoning and building requirements and all
requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. Section

of any litigation pending or threatened in writing against Mortgagor or Borrower
claiming damages in excess of $100,000 and of all pending or threatened (in

            6.5 MERGER, CONSOLIDATION, TRANSFER OF ASSETS. Mortgagor shall not:
(a) merge or consolidate with any other entity or permit Borrower to merge or


                                    Page 18
<PAGE>
consolidate with any other entity; (b) make any substantial change in the nature
of Mortgagor's business or structure or permit Borrower to make any substantial

assets except in the ordinary course of Mortgagor's business or permit Borrower
to sell, lease, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of a material part of
Borrower's assets except in the ordinary course of Borrower's business.

            6.6 ACCOUNTING RECORDS. Mortgagor shall maintain and cause Borrower
to maintain adequate books and records in accordance with the same accounting
standard used by Mortgagor or Borrower to prepare the financial statements
delivered to and approved by Mortgagee in connection with the making of the Loan
or other accounting standards approved by Mortgagee. Mortgagor shall permit and
shall cause Borrower to permit any representative of Mortgagee, at any
reasonable time and from time to time, upon reasonable prior notice to
Mortgagor, to inspect, audit and examine such books and records and make copies
of same.

            6.7 COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Mortgagor shall pay to
Mortgagee the full amount of all costs and expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of Mortgagee's in-house or
outside counsel, incurred by Mortgagee in connection with: (a) appraisals and
inspections of the Property or Collateral required by Mortgagee as a result of
(i) a Transfer or proposed Transfer (as defined below), or (ii) a Default; (b)
appraisals and inspections of the Property or Collateral required by applicable
law, including, without limitation, federal or state regulatory reporting
requirements; and (c) any acts performed by Mortgagee at Mortgagor's request or
wholly or partially for the benefit of Mortgagor (including, without limitation,
the preparation or review of amendments, assumptions, waivers, releases,
reconveyances, estoppel certificates or statements of amounts owing under any
Secured Obligation). In connection with appraisals and inspections, Mortgagor
specifically (but not by way of limitation) acknowledges that: (aa) a formal
written appraisal of the Property by a state certified or licensed appraiser may
be required by federal regulatory reporting requirements on an annual or more
frequent basis; and (bb) Mortgagee may require inspection of the Property by an
independent supervising architect, a cost engineering specialist, or both.
Mortgagor shall pay all indebtedness arising under this Section immediately upon
demand by Mortgagee together with interest thereon following notice of such
indebtedness at the rate of interest then applicable to the principal balance of
the Note as specified therein.

            6.8 LIENS, ENCUMBRANCES AND CHARGES. Subject to the terms of Section
8.4, Mortgagor shall immediately discharge by bonding or otherwise any lien,
charge or other encumbrance which attaches to the Property in violation of
Section 6.15. Subject to Mortgagor's right to contest such matters under this
Mortgage or as expressly permitted in the Loan Documents, Mortgagor shall pay
when due all obligations secured by or reducible to liens and encumbrances which
shall now or hereafter encumber or appear to encumber all or any part of the
Property or any interest therein, whether senior or subordinate hereto,
including, without limitation, all claims for work or labor performed, or
materials or supplies furnished, in connection with any work of demolition,
alteration, repair, improvement or construction of or upon the Property, except
such as Mortgagor may in good faith contest or as to which a bona fide dispute
may arise (provided provision is made to the satisfaction of Mortgagee for
eventual payment thereof in the

                                    Page 19
<PAGE>
event that Mortgagor is obligated to make such payment and that any recorded
claim of lien, charge or other encumbrance against the Property is immediately
discharged by bonding or otherwise).

            6.9 TAXES AND OTHER LIABILITIES. Mortgagor shall pay and discharge
when due any and all indebtedness, obligations, assessments and taxes, both real
and personal and including federal and state income taxes and state and local
property taxes and assessments. Mortgagor shall promptly provide to Mortgagee
copies of all tax and assessment notices pertaining to the Property. Mortgagor
hereby authorizes Mortgagee to obtain, at Mortgagor's expense, a tax service
contract which shall provide tax information on the Property to Mortgagee for
the term of the Loan and any extensions or renewals of the Loan.

            6.10 INSURANCE COVERAGE. Mortgagor shall insure the Property against
loss or damage by fire and such other hazards as Mortgagee shall from time to
time require; provided, however, (a) Mortgagee, at Mortgagee's election, may
only require flood insurance if all or any portion of the improvements located
on the Property is or becomes located in a special flood hazard area, and (b)
Mortgagee, at Mortgagee's election, may only require earthquake insurance if all
or any portion of the Property is or becomes located in an earthquake fault
zone. Mortgagor shall also carry public liability insurance and such other
insurance as Mortgagee may reasonably require, including, without limitation,
business interruption insurance or loss of rents insurance. Such policies shall
contain a standard mortgage clause naming Mortgagee and its successors in
interest as a loss payee and requiring at least 30 days prior notice to the
holder at termination or cancellation. Mortgagor shall maintain all required
insurance throughout the term of the Loan and while any liabilities of Borrower
or Mortgagor to Mortgagee under any of the Loan Documents remain outstanding at
Mortgagor's expense, with companies, and in substance and form satisfactory to
Mortgagee. Mortgagee, by reason of accepting, rejecting, approving or obtaining
insurance shall not incur any liability for: (c) the existence, nonexistence,
form or legal sufficiency of any insurance; (d) the solvency of any insurer; or
(e) the payment of claims.

            6.11 INSURANCE AND CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS.

            (a) ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. Mortgagor absolutely and irrevocably
assigns to Mortgagee all of the following rights, claims and amounts
(collectively, "Claims"), all of which shall be paid to Mortgagee: (i) all
awards of damages and all other compensation payable directly or indirectly by
reason of a condemnation or proposed condemnation for public or private use
affecting all or any part of, or any interest in, the Property; (ii) all other
claims and awards for damages to or decrease in value of all or any part of, or
any interest in, the Property; (iii) all proceeds of any insurance policies
payable by reason of loss sustained to all or any part of the Property; and (iv)
all interest which may accrue on any of the foregoing. Mortgagor shall give
Mortgagee prompt written notice of the occurrence of any casualty affecting, or
the institution of any proceedings for eminent domain or for the condemnation
of, the Property or any portion thereof. So long as no Default has occurred and
is continuing at the time, Mortgagor shall have the right to adjust, compromise
and settle any Claim of $100,000 or less without the consent of Mortgagee,
provided, however, all awards, proceeds and other sums described herein shall
continue to be payable to Mortgagee. Mortgagee may commence, appear in, defend
or prosecute any Claim exceeding $100,000, and may adjust, compromise and settle
all Claims (except for Claims which Mortgagor may settle as provided herein),
but shall not be responsible

                                    Page 20
<PAGE>
for any failure to commence, appear in, defend, prosecute or collect any such
Claim regardless of the cause of the failure. All awards, proceeds and other
sums described herein shall be payable to Mortgagee.

            (b) APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; NO DEFAULT. So long as no Default has
occurred and is continuing at the time of Mortgagee's receipt of the proceeds of
the Claims ("Proceeds") and no Default occurs thereafter, Mortgagee shall apply
the Proceeds in the following order of priority: First, to Mortgagee's expenses
in settling, prosecuting or defending the Claims; Second, to the repair or
restoration of the Property; and Third, to Mortgagor if the repair or
restoration of the Property has been completed, but to the Secured Obligations
in any order without suspending, extending or reducing any obligation of
Mortgagor to make installment payments if the repair or restoration of the
Property has not been completed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagee shall
have no obligation to make any Proceeds available for the repair or restoration
of the Property unless and until all the following conditions have been
satisfied: (i) delivery to Mortgagee of the Proceeds plus any additional amount
which is needed to pay all costs of the repair or restoration (including,
without limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent during the
repair period); (ii) establishment of an arrangement for lien releases and
disbursement of funds acceptable to Mortgagee; (iii) delivery to Mortgagee in
form and content acceptable to Mortgagee of all of the following: (aa) plans and
specifications for the work; (bb) a contract for the work, signed by a
contractor acceptable to Mortgagee; (cc) a cost breakdown for the work; (dd) if
reasonably required by Mortgagee, a payment and performance bond for the work;
(ee) evidence of the continuation of substantially all Leases unless consented
to in writing by Mortgagee; (ff) evidence that, upon completion of the work, the
size, capacity, value, and income coverage ratios for the Property will be at
least as great as those which existed immediately before the damage or
condemnation occurred; and (gg) evidence of the satisfaction of any additional
conditions that Mortgagee may reasonably establish to protect Mortgagee's
security. Mortgagor acknowledges that the specific conditions described above
are reasonable.

            (c) APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; DEFAULT. If a Default has occurred and
is continuing at the time of Mortgagee's receipt of the Proceeds or if a Default
occurs at any time thereafter, Mortgagee may, at Mortgagee's absolute discretion
and regardless of any impairment of security or lack of impairment of security,
but subject to applicable law governing use of the Proceeds, if any, apply all
or any of the Proceeds to Mortgagee's expenses in settling, prosecuting or
defending the Claims and then apply the balance to the Secured Obligations in
any order without suspending, extending or reducing any obligation of Mortgagor
to make installment payments, and may release all or any part of the Proceeds to
Mortgagor upon any conditions Mortgagee chooses.

            6.12 IMPOUNDS.

            (a) POST-DEFAULT IMPOUNDS. If required by Mortgagee at any time
after a Default occurs (and regardless of whether such Default is thereafter
cured), Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee such amounts ("Post-Default
Impounds") on such dates (determined by Mortgagee as provided below) as will be
sufficient to pay any or all "Costs" (as defined below) specified by Mortgagee.
Mortgagee in its reasonable discretion shall estimate the amount of such Costs
that will be payable or required during any period selected by Mortgagee not
exceeding 1 year and shall determine the fractional portion thereof that
Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee

                                    Page 21
<PAGE>
on each date specified by Mortgagee during such period. If the Post-Default
Impounds paid by Mortgagor are not sufficient to pay the related Costs,
Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee upon demand an amount equal to the
deficiency. All Post-Default Impounds shall be payable by Mortgagor in addition
to (but without duplication of) any other Impounds (as defined below).

            (b) ALL IMPOUNDS. Post-Default Impounds and any other impounds that
may be payable by Borrower under the Note are collectively called "Impounds".
All Impounds shall be deposited into one or more segregated or commingled
accounts maintained by Mortgagee or its servicing agent. Except as otherwise
provided in the Note, such account(s) shall not bear interest. Mortgagee shall
not be a trustee, special depository or other fiduciary for Mortgagor with
respect to such account, and the existence of such account shall not limit
Mortgagee's rights under this Mortgage, any other agreement or any provision of
law. If no Default exists, Mortgagee shall apply all Impounds to the payment of
the related Costs, or in Mortgagee's sole discretion may release any or all
Impounds to Mortgagor for application to and payment of such Costs. If a Default
exists, Mortgagee may apply any or all Impounds to any Secured Obligation and/or
to cure such Default, whereupon Mortgagor shall restore all Impounds so applied
and cure all Defaults not cured by such application. The obligations of
Mortgagor hereunder shall not be diminished by deposits of Impounds made by
Mortgagor, except to the extent that such obligations have actually been met by
application of such Impounds. Upon any assignment of this Mortgage, Mortgagee
may assign all Impounds in its possession to Mortgagee's assignee, whereupon
Mortgagee shall be released from all liability with respect to such Impounds.
Within 60 days following full repayment of the Secured Obligations (other than
as a consequence of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure) or at such
earlier time as Mortgagee may elect, Mortgagee shall pay to Mortgagor all
Impounds in its possession, and no other party shall have any right or claim
thereto. "Costs" means (i) all taxes and other liabilities payable by Mortgagor
under Section 6.9, (ii) all insurance premiums payable by Mortgagor under
Section 6.10, (iii) all other costs and expenses for which Impounds are required
under the Note, and/or (iv) all other amounts that will be required to preserve
the value of the Property. Mortgagor shall deliver to Mortgagee, promptly upon
receipt, all bills for Costs for which Mortgagee has required Post-Default
Impounds.

            6.13 DEFENSE AND NOTICE OF LOSSES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS. Mortgagor
shall protect, preserve and defend the Property and title to and right of
possession of the Property, the security of this Mortgage and the rights and
powers of Mortgagee hereunder at Mortgagor's sole expense against all adverse
claims, whether the claim: (a) is against a possessory or non-possessory
interest; (b) arose prior or subsequent to the Effective Date; or (c) is senior
or junior to Mortgagor's or Mortgagee's rights. Mortgagor shall give Mortgagee
prompt notice in writing of the assertion of any claim, of the filing of any
action or proceeding, of the occurrence of any damage to the Property and of any
condemnation offer or action.

            6.14 RIGHT OF INSPECTION. Mortgagee and its independent contractors,
agents and employees may enter the Property from time to time at any reasonable
time upon reasonable prior notice to Mortgagor (except that such notice shall
not be required in the event of an emergency) for the purpose of inspecting the
Property and ascertaining Mortgagor's compliance with the terms of this
Mortgage. Mortgagee shall use reasonable efforts to assure that Mortgagee's
entry upon and inspection of the Property shall not materially and unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of Mortgagor or Mortgagor's tenants on
the Property.

            6.15 PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN MORTGAGOR.
Mortgagor acknowledges that Mortgagee has relied upon the principals of
Mortgagor and Borrower and their experience in owning and operating properties
similar to the Property in connection with the closing of the Loan. Accordingly,
except with the prior written consent of Mortgagee or as otherwise expressly
permitted in the Note, Mortgagor shall not cause or permit any sale, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment, encumbrance or other transfer,
conveyance or disposition, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of
law ("Transfer") of all or any part of, or all or any direct or indirect
interest in, the Property or the Collateral (except for equipment and inventory
in the ordinary course of its business), or cause or permit a Transfer of any
direct or indirect interest (whether general partnership interest, stock,
non-managing member limited liability company interest, trust, or otherwise) in
Mortgagor or Borrower. In the event of any Transfer that is not expressly
permitted in the Note and is without the prior written consent of Mortgagee,
Mortgagee shall have the absolute right at its option, without prior demand or
notice, to declare all of the Secured Obligations immediately due and payable,
except to the extent prohibited by law, and pursue its rights and remedies under
Section 7.3 herein. Mortgagor agrees to pay any prepayment fee as set forth in
the Note in the event the Secured Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the
terms of this Section. Consent to one such Transfer shall not be deemed to be a
waiver of the right to require the consent to future or successive Transfers.
Except for Transfers expressly permitted under the Note, Mortgagee's consent to
any Transfer may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in Mortgagee's sole and
absolute discretion.

            6.16 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.17 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.18 EXCULPATION. Mortgagee shall not directly or indirectly be
liable to Mortgagor or any other person as a consequence of: (a) the exercise of
the rights, remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee in this Mortgage; (b) the
failure or refusal of Mortgagee to perform or discharge any obligation or
liability of Mortgagor under any agreement related to the Property or under this
Mortgage; or (c) any loss sustained by Mortgagor or any third party resulting
from Mortgagee's failure to lease the Property after a Default or from any other
act or omission of Mortgagee in managing the Property after a Default unless the
loss is caused by the willful misconduct and bad faith of Mortgagee and no such
liability shall be asserted or enforced against Mortgagee, all such liability
being expressly waived and released by Mortgagor.

            6.19 INDEMNITY. Without in any way limiting any other indemnity
contained in this Mortgage, Mortgagor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Mortgagee Group (as hereinafter defined) from and against any
claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising
out of: (a) the making of the Loan, except for violations of banking laws or
regulations by the Mortgagee Group; (b) this Mortgage; (c) the execution of this
Mortgage or the performance of any act required or permitted hereunder or by
law; (d) any failure of Mortgagor to perform Mortgagor's obligations under this
Mortgage or the other Loan Documents; (e) any alleged obligation or undertaking
on the Mortgagee Group's part to perform or discharge any of the
representations, warranties, conditions, covenants or other obligations
contained in any other document related to the Property; (f) any act or omission
by Mortgagor or any contractor, agent, employee or representative of Mortgagor
with respect to the Property; or (g) any claim, loss,

                                    Page 23

damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising out of: (i)
the use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, release, threatened
release, discharge, disposal, transportation or presence of any Hazardous
Materials which are found in, on, under or about the Property (including,
without limitation, underground contamination); or (ii) the breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty of Mortgagor under Section 6.2 above. The
foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, this indemnity shall not include any
claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any member of the Mortgagee
Group, or any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the
Mortgagee Group arising from any act or incident on the Property occurring after
the full reconveyance and release of the lien of this Mortgage on the Property,
or with respect to the matters set forth in clause (g) above, any claim, loss,
damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the Mortgagee Group resulting
from the introduction and initial release of Hazardous Materials on the Property
occurring after the transfer of title to the Property at a foreclosure sale
under this Mortgage, either pursuant to judicial decree or the power of sale, or
by deed in lieu of such foreclosure. This indemnity shall include, without
limitation: (aa) all consequential damages (including, without limitation, any
third party tort claims or governmental claims, fines or penalties against the
Mortgagee Group); (bb) all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees
(including, without limitation, expert witness fees) paid or incurred by the
Mortgagee Group; and (cc) the costs, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, of
any investigation, repair, cleanup or detoxification of the Property which is
required by any governmental entity or is otherwise necessary to render the
Property in compliance with all laws and regulations pertaining to Hazardous
Materials. "Mortgagee Group", as used herein, shall mean (1) Mortgagee
(including, without limitation, any participant in the Loan), (2) any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with Mortgagee, (3) the
directors, officers, employees and agents of Mortgagee and such other entities,
and (4) the successors, heirs and assigns of the entities and persons described
in foregoing clauses (1) through (3). Mortgagor shall pay immediately upon
Mortgagee's demand any amounts owing under this indemnity together with interest
from the date the indebtedness arises until paid at the rate of interest
applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified therein. Mortgagor
agrees to use legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Mortgagee Group in any
action or proceeding arising under this indemnity. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE SATISFACTION AND RELEASE OF THIS MORTGAGE, BUT
MORTGAGOR'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS INDEMNITY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
THE SECTION IN THE NOTE ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

            6.20 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.21 RELEASES, EXTENSIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY.
Without notice to or the consent, approval or agreement of any persons or
entities having any interest at any time in the Property or in any manner
obligated under the Secured Obligations ("Interested Parties"), Mortgagee may,
from time to time: (a) fully or partially release any person or entity from
liability for the payment or performance of any Secured Obligation; (b) extend
the maturity of any Secured Obligation; (c) make any agreement with Borrower
increasing the amount or otherwise altering the terms of any Secured Obligation;
(d) accept additional security for any Secured Obligation; or (e) release all or

            6.22 SALE OR PARTICIPATION OF LOAN. Mortgagor agrees that Mortgagee
may at any time sell, assign, participate or securitize all or any portion of
Mortgagee's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, and that any such
sale, assignment, participation or securitization may be to one or more
financial institutions or other entities, to private investors, and/or into the
public securities market, in Mortgagee's sole discretion. Mortgagor further
agrees that Mortgagee may disseminate to any such actual or potential
purchaser(s), assignee(s) or participant(s) all documents and financial and
other information heretofore or hereafter provided to or known to Mortgagee with
respect to: (a) the Property and its operation; and/or (b) any party connected
with the Loan (including, without limitation, Mortgagor, any partner or member
of Mortgagor, any constituent partner or member of Mortgagor, any guarantor and
any nonborrower mortgagor). In the event of any such sale, assignment,
participation or securitization, Mortgagee and the other parties to the same
shall share in the rights and obligations of Mortgagee set forth in the Loan
Documents as and to the extent they shall agree among themselves. In connection
with any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization, Mortgagor
further agrees that the Loan Documents shall be sufficient evidence of the
obligations of Mortgagor to each purchaser, assignee or participant, and
Mortgagor shall, within 15 days after request by Mortgagee, (x) deliver an
estoppel certificate verifying for the benefit of Mortgagee and any other party
designated by Mortgagee the status and the terms and provisions of the Loan in
form and substance acceptable to Mortgagee, (y) provide any information, legal
opinions or documents regarding Mortgagor, Guarantor (as defined in the Loan
Documents), the Property and any tenants of the Property as Mortgagee or
Mortgagee's rating agencies may reasonably request, and (z) enter into such
amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents or the organizational
documents of Mortgagor as may be reasonably required in order to facilitate any
such sale, assignment, participation or securitization without impairing
Mortgagor's rights or increasing Mortgagor's obligations. The indemnity
obligations of Mortgagor under the Loan Documents shall also apply with respect
to any purchaser, assignee or participant.

            6.23 RELEASE. Upon payment in full of the Secured Obligations, and
satisfaction of all of the covenants, warranties, undertakings and agreements
made in this Mortgage and in the other Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, repayment in full of all principal, interest and other amounts owing
under the Note) are kept and performed, and all obligations, if any, of
Mortgagee for further advances have been terminated, then, and in that event
only, Mortgagee shall release, without warranty, the Property or that portion
thereof then held hereunder. The recitals of any matters or facts in any release
executed hereunder shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. To the
extent permitted by law, the release may describe the grantee as "the person or
persons legally entitled thereto". Mortgagee shall have no duty to determine the
rights of persons claiming to be rightful grantees of any release. When the
Property has been fully released, the last such release shall operate as a
reassignment of all future rents, issues and profits of the Property to the
person or persons legally entitled thereto.

            6.24 SUBROGATION. Mortgagee shall be subrogated to the lien of all
encumbrances, whether released of record or not, paid in whole or in part by
Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage or by the proceeds of any loan secured by
this Mortgage.

            6.25 MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. Without the prior written consent of
Mortgagee, Mortgagor shall not terminate, modify, amend or enter into any
agreement providing for the management, leasing or operation of the Property.
Mortgagor represents,

                                    Page 25
<PAGE>
warrants and covenants that any existing management agreement includes, and any
future management agreement entered into by Mortgagor shall include, a provision
which provides that the management agreement is automatically terminated upon
the transfer of the Property by Mortgagor, either by sale, foreclosure, deed in
lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise, to Mortgagee or any other purchaser of the
Property. Upon a Default under the Loan Documents or a default under any
management agreement then in effect, which default is not cured within any
applicable grace or cure period, Mortgagee shall have the right to terminate, or
to direct Mortgagor to terminate, such management agreement upon thirty (30)
days' written notice and to retain, or to direct Mortgagor to retain, a new
management agent approved by Mortgagee.

                              ARTICLE VII. DEFAULT

            7.1 DEFAULT. For all purposes hereof, "Default" shall mean either an
"Optional Default" (as defined below) or an "Automatic Default" (as defined
below).

            (a) OPTIONAL DEFAULT. An "Optional Default" shall occur, at
Mortgagee's option, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

      (i) MONETARY. Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to (aa) pay when due any
sums payable under the Loan Documents which by their express terms require
immediate payment without any grace period or sums which are payable on the
Maturity Date, or (bb) pay within 5 days when due any other sums payable under
the Note, this Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, any monthly payment due under the Note.

      (ii) FAILURE TO PERFORM. Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to observe,
perform or discharge any of Borrower's or Mortgagor's obligations, covenants,
conditions or agreements, other than Borrower's or Mortgagor's payment
obligations, under the Note, this Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents,
and (aa) such failure shall remain uncured for 30 days after written notice
thereof shall have been given to Borrower or Mortgagor, as the case may be, by
Mortgagee or (bb) if such failure is of such a nature that it cannot be cured
within such 30 day period, Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to commence to cure
such failure within such 30 day period or shall fail to diligently prosecute
such curative action thereafter.

      (iii) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Any representation, warranty,
certificate or other statement (financial or otherwise) made or furnished by or
on behalf of Borrower, Mortgagor, or a guarantor, if any, to Mortgagee or in
connection with any of the Loan Documents, or as an inducement to Mortgagee to
make the Loan, shall be false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading in any
material respect when made or furnished.

      (iv) CONDEMNATION; ATTACHMENT. The condemnation, seizure or appropriation
of any material portion (as reasonably determined by Mortgagee) of the Property;
or the sequestration or attachment of, or levy or execution upon any of the
Property, the Collateral or any other collateral provided by Borrower or
Mortgagor under any of the Loan Documents, or any material portion of the other
assets of Borrower or Mortgagor, which sequestration, attachment, levy or
execution is not released or dismissed within 45 days after its occurrence; or
the sale of any assets affected by any of the foregoing.

                                    Page 26
<PAGE>
      (v) UNINSURED CASUALTY. The occurrence of an uninsured casualty with
respect to any material portion (as reasonably determined by Mortgagee) of the
Property unless: (aa) no other Default has occurred and is continuing at the
time of such casualty or occurs thereafter; (bb) Mortgagor promptly notifies
Mortgagee of the occurrence of such casualty; and (cc) not more than 45 days
after the occurrence of such casualty, Mortgagor delivers to Mortgagee
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient, in Mortgagee's reasonable
opinion, to pay all costs of the repair or restoration (including, without
limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent during the repair
period). So long as no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of
Mortgagee's receipt of such funds and no Default occurs thereafter, Mortgagee
shall make such funds available for the repair or restoration of the Property.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagee shall have no obligation to make any
funds available for repair or restoration of the Property unless and until all
the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the second sentence of
Section 6.11(b) of this Mortgage have been satisfied. Mortgagor acknowledges
that the specific conditions described above are reasonable.

      (vi) ADVERSE FINANCIAL CHANGE. Any material adverse change in the
financial condition of Borrower or any general partner or managing member of
Borrower, any guarantor, or any other person or entity from the condition shown
on the financial statement(s) submitted to Mortgagee and relied upon by
Mortgagee in making the Loan, and which change Mortgagee reasonably determines
will have a material adverse effect on (aa) the business, operations or
condition of the Property; or (bb) the ability of Borrower or Mortgagor to pay
or perform Borrower's or Mortgagor's obligations in accordance with the terms of
the Note, this Mortgage, and the other Loan Documents.

            (b) AUTOMATIC DEFAULT. An "Automatic Default" shall occur
automatically upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

      (i) VOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY, DISSOLUTION. (aa) Borrower's filing
a petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended or
recodified ("Bankruptcy Code"), or under any other present or future state or
federal law regarding bankruptcy, reorganization or other relief to debtors
(collectively, "Debtor Relief Law"); or (bb) Borrower's filing any pleading in
any involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law
which admits the jurisdiction of a court to regulate Borrower or the Property or
the petition's material allegations regarding Borrower's insolvency; or (cc)
Borrower's making a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (dd)
Borrower's applying for, or the appointment of, a receiver, trustee, custodian
or liquidator of Borrower or any of its property; or (ee) the filing by Borrower
of a petition seeking the liquidation or dissolution of Borrower or the
commencement of any other procedure to liquidate or dissolve Borrower.

      (ii) INVOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY. Borrower's failure to effect a full dismissal
of any involuntary petition under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law
that is filed against Borrower or in any way restrains or limits Borrower or
Mortgagee regarding the Loan or the Property, prior to the earlier of the entry
of any order granting relief sought in the involuntary petition or 45 days after
the date of filing of the petition.

      (iii) PARTNERS, GUARANTORS. The occurrence of an event specified in
clauses (i) or (ii) as to Mortgagor, any general partner or managing member of
Borrower or Mortgagor,

                                    Page 27
<PAGE>
or any guarantor or other person or entity in any manner obligated to Mortgagee
under the Loan Documents.

            7.2 ACCELERATION. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Default,
Mortgagee may, at its option, declare all sums owing to Mortgagee under the Note
and the other Loan Documents immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence of
an Automatic Default, all sums owing to Mortgagee under the Note and the other
Loan Documents shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

            7.3 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. In addition to the rights and remedies in
Section 7.2 above, at any time after a Default, Mortgagee shall have all of the
following rights and remedies:

            (a) ENTRY ON PROPERTY. With or without notice, and without releasing
Mortgagor from any Secured Obligation, and without becoming a mortgagee in
possession, to enter upon the Property from time to time and to do such acts and
things as Mortgagee deems necessary or desirable in order to inspect,
investigate, assess and protect the security hereof or to cure any Default,
including, without limitation: (i) to take and possess all documents, books,
records, papers and accounts of Mortgagor, Borrower or the then owner of the
Property which relate to the Property; (ii) to make, terminate, enforce or
modify leases of the Property upon such terms and conditions as Mortgagee deems
proper; (iii) to make repairs, alterations and improvements to the Property
necessary, in Mortgagee's reasonable judgment, to protect or enhance the
security hereof; (iv) to appear in and defend any action or proceeding
purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of Mortgagee
hereunder; (v) to pay, purchase, contest or compromise any encumbrance, charge,
lien or claim of lien which, in the sole judgment of Mortgagee, is or may be
senior in priority hereto, the judgment of Mortgagee being conclusive as between
the parties hereto; (vi) to obtain insurance; (vii) to pay any premiums or
charges with respect to insurance required to be carried hereunder; (viii) to
obtain a court order to enforce Mortgagee's right to enter and inspect the
Property for Hazardous Materials, in which regard the decision of Mortgagee as
to whether there exists a release or threatened release of Hazardous Materials
onto the Property shall be deemed reasonable and conclusive as between the
parties hereto; (ix) to have a receiver appointed pursuant to applicable law to
enforce Mortgagee's rights to enter and inspect the Property for Hazardous
Materials; and/or (x) to employ legal counsel, accountants, engineers,
consultants, contractors and other appropriate persons to assist them;

            (b) APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER. With or without notice or hearing, to
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for and obtain appointment of a
receiver, trustee, liquidator or conservator of the Property, for any purpose,
including, without limitation, to enforce Mortgagee's rights to collect Payments
and to enter on and inspect the Property for Hazardous Materials, as a matter of
strict right and without regard to: (i) the adequacy of the security for the
repayment of the Secured Obligations; (ii) the existence of a declaration that
the Secured Obligations are immediately due and payable; (iii) the filing of a
notice of default; or (iv) the solvency of Mortgagor, Borrower or any guarantor
or other person or entity in any manner obligated to Mortgagee under the Loan
Documents;


                                    Page 28
<PAGE>
            (c) INJUNCTION. To commence and maintain an action or actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to obtain specific enforcement of the covenants
of Mortgagor hereunder, and Mortgagor agrees that such covenants shall be
specifically enforceable by injunction or any other appropriate equitable remedy
and that for the purposes of any suit brought under this subparagraph, Mortgagor
waives the defense of laches and any applicable statute of limitations;

            (d) FORECLOSURE. Immediately commence an action to foreclose this
Mortgage or to specifically enforce its provisions or any of the indebtedness
secured hereby pursuant to the statutes in such case made and provided and sell
the Property or cause the Property to be sold in accordance with the
requirements and procedures provided by said statutes in a single parcel or in
several parcels at the option of Mortgagee.

      (i) In the event foreclosure proceedings are filed by Mortgagee, all
expenses incident to such proceeding, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs, shall be paid by Mortgagor and secured by this
Mortgage and by all of the other Loan Documents securing all or any part of the
indebtedness evidenced by the Note. The secured indebtedness and all other
obligations secured by this Mortgage, including, without limitation, interest at
the Default Rate (as defined in the Note), any prepayment charge, fee or premium
required to be paid under the Note in order to prepay principal (to the extent
permitted by applicable law), reasonable attorneys' fees and any other amounts
due and unpaid to Mortgagee under the Loan Documents, may be bid by Mortgagee in
the event of a foreclosure sale hereunder. In the event of a judicial sale
pursuant to a foreclosure decree, it is understood and agreed that Mortgagee or
its assigns may become the purchaser of the Property or any part thereof.

      (ii) Mortgagee may, by following the procedures and satisfying the
requirements prescribed by applicable law, foreclose on only a portion of the
Property and, in such event, said foreclosure shall not affect the lien of this
Mortgage on the remaining portion of the Property foreclosed.

            Upon sale of the Property at any foreclosure, Mortgagee may credit
bid (as determined by Mortgagee in its sole and absolute discretion) all or any
portion of the Secured Obligations. In determining such credit bid, Mortgagee
may, but is not obligated to, take into account all or any of the following: (i)
appraisals of the Property as such appraisals may be discounted or adjusted by
Mortgagee in its sole and absolute underwriting discretion; (ii) expenses and
costs incurred by Mortgagee with respect to the Property prior to foreclosure;
(iii) expenses and costs which Mortgagee anticipates will be incurred with
respect to the Property after foreclosure, but prior to resale, including,
without limitation, costs of structural reports and other due diligence, costs
to carry the Property prior to resale, costs of resale (e.g. commissions,
attorneys' fees, and taxes), costs of any Hazardous Materials clean-up and
monitoring, costs of deferred maintenance, repair, refurbishment and retrofit,
costs of defending or settling litigation affecting the Property, and lost
opportunity costs (if any), including the time value of money during any
anticipated holding period by Mortgagee; (iv) declining trends in real property
values generally and with respect to properties similar to the Property; (v)
anticipated discounts upon resale of the Property as a distressed or foreclosed
property; (vi) the fact of additional collateral (if any), for the Secured
Obligations; and (vii) such other factors or matters that Mortgagee (in its sole
and absolute discretion) deems appropriate. In regard to the above, Mortgagor
acknowledges and

                                    Page 29
<PAGE>
agrees that: (viii) Mortgagee is not required to use any or all of the foregoing
factors to determine the amount of its credit bid; (ix) this paragraph does not
impose upon Mortgagee any additional obligations that are not imposed by law at
the time the credit bid is made; (x) the amount of Mortgagee's credit bid need
not have any relation to any loan-to-value ratios specified in the Loan
Documents or previously discussed between Mortgagor and Mortgagee; and (xi)
Mortgagee's credit bid may be (at Mortgagee's sole and absolute discretion)
higher or lower than any appraised value of the Property;

            (e) MULTIPLE FORECLOSURES. To resort to and realize upon the
security hereunder and any other security now or later held by Mortgagee
concurrently or successively and in one or several consolidated or independent
judicial actions and to apply the proceeds received upon the Secured Obligations
all in such order and manner as Mortgagee determines in its sole discretion;

            (f) RIGHTS TO COLLATERAL. To exercise all rights Mortgagee may have
with respect to the Collateral under this Mortgage, the UCC or otherwise at law;
and

            (g) OTHER RIGHTS. To exercise such other rights as Mortgagee may
have at law or in equity or pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents.

            In connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Mortgagee may elect
to treat any of the Property which consists of a right in action or which is
property that can be severed from the Property (including, without limitation,
any improvements forming a part thereof) without causing structural damage
thereto as if the same were personal property or a fixture, as the case may be,
and dispose of the same in accordance with applicable law, separate and apart
from the sale of the Property. Any sale of Collateral hereunder shall be
conducted in any manner permitted by the UCC.

            7.4 APPLICATION OF FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, proceeds of any sale under this Mortgage shall be applied to
the extent funds are so available to the following items in such order as
Mortgagee in its discretion may determine:

            (a) To payment of the costs, expenses and fees of taking possession
of the Property, and of holding, operating, maintaining, using, leasing,
repairing, improving, marketing and selling the same and of otherwise enforcing
Mortgagee's right and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
including, but not limited to, receivers' fees, court costs, reasonable
attorneys', accountants', appraisers', managers', and other professional fees,
title charges and transfer taxes.

            (b) To payment of all sums expended by Mortgagee under the terms of
any of the Loan Documents and not yet repaid, together with interest on such
sums at the Default Rate.

            (c) To payment of the secured indebtedness and all other obligations
secured by this Mortgage, including, without limitation, interest at the Default
Rate and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any prepayment fee, charge
or premium required to be paid under the Note in order to prepay principal, in
any order that Mortgagee chooses in its sole discretion.

                                    Page 30
<PAGE>
            7.5 WAIVER OF MARSHALING RIGHTS. Mortgagor, for itself and for all
parties claiming through or under Mortgagor, and for all parties who may acquire
a lien on or interest in the Property, hereby waives all rights to have the
Property and/or any other property, including, without limitation, the
Collateral, which is now or later may be security for any Secured Obligation,
marshaled upon any foreclosure of this Mortgage or on a foreclosure of any other
security for any of the Secured Obligations.

            7.6 NO CURE OR WAIVER. Neither Mortgagee's nor any receiver's entry
upon and taking possession of all or any part of the Property, nor any
collection of rents, issues, profits, insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds
or damages, other security or proceeds of other security, or other sums, nor the
application of any collected sum to any Secured Obligation, nor the exercise of
any other right or remedy by Mortgagee or any receiver shall cure or waive any
Default or notice of default under this Mortgage, or nullify the effect of any
notice of default or sale (unless all Secured Obligations then due have been
paid or performed and Mortgagor has cured all other Defaults hereunder), or
impair the status of the security, or prejudice Mortgagee in the exercise of any
right or remedy, or be construed as an affirmation by Mortgagee of any tenancy,
lease or option or a subordination of the lien of this Mortgage.

            7.7 PAYMENT OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Mortgagor agrees
to pay to Mortgagee immediately and upon demand all costs and expenses incurred
by Mortgagee in the enforcement of the terms and conditions of this Mortgage
(including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees, whether
incurred in litigation or not) with interest from the date of expenditure until
said sums have been paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal
balance of the Note as specified therein.

            7.8 POWER TO FILE NOTICES AND CURE DEFAULTS. Mortgagor hereby
irrevocably appoints Mortgagee and its successors and assigns, as its
attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, to perform any
obligation of Mortgagor hereunder upon the occurrence of an event, act or
omission which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a
Default, provided, however, that: (a) Mortgagee as such attorney-in-fact shall
only be accountable for such funds as are actually received by Mortgagee; and
(b) Mortgagee shall not be liable to Mortgagor or any other person or entity for
any failure to act under this Section.

            7.9 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights and remedies of Mortgagee
provided hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to all rights and remedies
provided by applicable law (including specifically that of foreclosure of this
instrument as though it were a mortgage) or in any other agreements between
Mortgagor and Mortgagee. Mortgagee may enforce any one or more remedies or
rights hereunder successively or concurrently.

                     ARTICLE VIII. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

            8.1 ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. The Loan Documents contain or incorporate
by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters
contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations. The Loan Documents
grant further rights to Mortgagee and contain further agreements and affirmative
and negative covenants by Mortgagor which apply to this Mortgage and to the
Property and such further rights and agreements are incorporated herein by this
reference. THE OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF MORTGAGOR UNDER THIS

                                    Page 31
<PAGE>
MORTGAGE AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE
SECTION IN THE NOTE ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

            8.2 NON-WAIVER. By accepting payment of any amount secured hereby
after its due date or late performance of any other Secured Obligation,
Mortgagee shall not waive its right against any person obligated directly or
indirectly hereunder or on any Secured Obligation, either to require prompt
payment or performance when due of all other sums and obligations so secured or
to declare default for failure to make such prompt payment or performance. No
exercise of any right or remedy by Mortgagee hereunder shall constitute a waiver
of any other right or remedy herein contained or provided by law. No failure by
Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy hereunder arising upon any Default
shall be construed to prejudice Mortgagee's rights or remedies upon the
occurrence of any other or subsequent Default. No delay by Mortgagee in
exercising any such right or remedy shall be construed to preclude Mortgagee
from the exercise thereof at any time while that Default is continuing. No
notice to nor demand on Mortgagor shall of itself entitle Mortgagor to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

            8.3 CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND EXPENSES. Wherever Mortgagee's consent,
approval, acceptance or satisfaction is required under any provision of this
Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, such consent, approval, acceptance
or satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by
Mortgagee unless such provision expressly so provides. Wherever costs or
expenses are required to be paid under any provision of this Mortgage or any of
the other Loan Documents, such costs or expenses shall be reasonable.

            8.4 PERMITTED CONTESTS. After prior written notice to Mortgagee,
Mortgagor may contest, by appropriate legal or other proceedings conducted in
good faith and with due diligence, the amount, validity or application, in whole
or in part, of any lien, levy, tax or assessment, or any lien of any laborer,
mechanic, materialman, supplier or vendor, or the application to Mortgagor or
the Property of any law or the validity thereof, the assertion or imposition of
which, or the failure to pay when due, would constitute a Default; provided that
(a) Mortgagor pursues the contest diligently, in a manner which Mortgagee
determines is not prejudicial to Mortgagee, and does not impair the lien of this
Mortgage; (b) the Property, or any part hereof or estate or interest therein,
shall not be in any danger of being sold, forfeited or lost by reason of such
proceedings; (c) in the case of the contest of any law or other legal
requirement, Mortgagee shall not be in any danger of any civil or criminal
liability; and (d) if required by Mortgagee, Mortgagor deposits with Mortgagee
any funds or other forms of assurance (including a bond or letter of credit)
satisfactory to Mortgagee to protect Mortgagee from the consequences of the
contest being unsuccessful. Mortgagor's right to contest pursuant to the terms
of this provision shall in no way relieve Mortgagor or Borrower of its
obligations under the Loan or to make payments to Mortgagee as and when due.

            8.5 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Mortgagor shall, upon demand by Mortgagee,
execute, acknowledge (if appropriate) and deliver any and all documents and
instruments and do or cause to be done all further acts reasonably necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the provisions hereof.


                                    Page 32
<PAGE>
            8.6 ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action, suit or proceeding is
commenced between Mortgagor and Mortgagee regarding their respective rights and
obligations under this Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to damages or other
relief, costs and expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs
(including, without limitation, expert witness fees). As used herein the term
"prevailing party" shall mean the party which obtains the principal relief it
has sought, whether by compromise settlement or judgment. If the party which
commenced or instituted the action, suit or proceeding shall dismiss or
discontinue it without the concurrence of the other party, such other party
shall be deemed the prevailing party.

            8.7 MORTGAGOR AND MORTGAGEE DEFINED. The term "Mortgagor" includes
both the original Mortgagor and any subsequent owner or owners of any of the
Property, and the term "Mortgagee" includes the original Mortgagee and any
future owner or holder, including assignees, pledgees and participants, of the
Note or any interest therein.

            8.8 DISCLAIMERS.

            (a) RELATIONSHIP. The relationship of Mortgagor and Mortgagee under
this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents is, and shall at all times remain,
solely that of borrower and lender; and Mortgagee neither undertakes nor assumes
any responsibility or duty to Mortgagor or to any third party with respect to
the Property. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents: (i) Mortgagee is not, and shall not be construed to be, a
partner, joint venturer, member, alter ego, manager, controlling person or other
business associate or participant of any kind of Mortgagor, and Mortgagee does
not intend to ever assume such status; (ii) Mortgagee's activities in connection
with this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents shall not be "outside the scope
of activities of a lender of money" within the meaning of California Civil Code
Section 3434, as amended or recodified from time to time, and Mortgagee does not
intend to ever assume any responsibility to any person for the quality,
suitability, safety or condition of the Property; and (iii) Mortgagee shall not
be deemed responsible for or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions
of Mortgagor.

            (b) NO LIABILITY. Mortgagee shall not be directly or indirectly
liable or responsible for any loss, claim, cause of action, liability,
indebtedness, damage or injury of any kind or character to any person or
property arising from any construction on, or occupancy or use of, the Property,
whether caused by or arising from: (i) any defect in any building, structure,
grading, fill, landscaping or other improvements thereon or in any on-site or
off-site improvement or other facility therein or thereon; (ii) any act or
omission of Mortgagor or any of Mortgagor's agents, employees, independent
contractors, licensees or invitees; (iii) any accident in or on the Property or
any fire, flood or other casualty or hazard thereon; (iv) the failure of
Mortgagor or any of Mortgagor's licensees, employees, invitees, agents,
independent contractors or other representatives to maintain the Property in a
safe condition; or (v) any nuisance made or suffered on any part of the
Property.

            8.9 SEVERABILITY. If any term of this Mortgage, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances, shall, to any extent, be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Mortgage, or the application of such term
to persons or circumstances other than those as to

                                    Page 33
<PAGE>
which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each
term of this Mortgage shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

            8.10 RELATIONSHIP OF ARTICLES. The rights, remedies and interests of
Mortgagee under the Mortgage established by Article 1 and the security agreement
established by Article 4 are independent and cumulative, and there shall be no
merger of any lien created by the Mortgage with any security interest created by
the security agreement. Mortgagee may elect to exercise or enforce any of its
rights, remedies or interests under either or both the Mortgage or the security

of and separate from the Mortgage and the security agreement.

            8.11 MERGER. No merger shall occur as a result of Mortgagee's
acquiring any other estate in, or any other lien on, the Property unless
Mortgagee consents to a merger in writing.

Mortgagee obtains pursuant to the terms of this Mortgage or any other obligation
of that married person secured by this Mortgage may be collected by execution
upon any separate property or community property of that person.

expressly incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with
respect to the matters contemplated therein and supersede all prior negotiations
or agreements, written or oral. The Loan Documents shall not be modified except

amendments, renewals or extensions now or hereafter approved by Mortgagee in
writing. When the identity of the parties or other circumstances make it
appropriate, the masculine gender includes the feminine and/or neuter, and the

and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim to
assert that the law of any jurisdiction other than California governs this
Mortgage, the Note and other Loan Documents.

            8.18 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Mortgagor irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of: (a) any state or federal court sitting in the state of
California over any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by Mortgagor against

venue of any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such court and any
claim that any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

                               DESCRIPTION OF LAND

Exhibit A to MORTGAGE AND ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES AND SECURITY
AGREEMENT (AND FIXTURE FILING) ("Mortgage") between MHC STAGECOACH, L.L.C., a

    CALCULATION OF DOCUMENTARY STAMP AND INTANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX

Exhibit B to MORTGAGE AND ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES AND SECURITY
AGREEMENT (AND FIXTURE FILING) ("Mortgage") between MHC STAGECOACH, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company, as "Mortgagor," and WELLS FARGO BANK,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as "Mortgagee."

      This Mortgage is part of an out-of-state loan transaction which only
partially secures the loan. This Mortgage encumbers the property described on
Exhibit A, and separate mortgages are being executed and delivered by Mortgagor
encumbering certain other property located in Florida and in other states (such
other property being further described on Exhibit C and being referred to as the
"Other Property"). The Florida collateral is located in Brevard, Volusia and
Manatee Counties, and three (3) separate mortgages (the Florida Mortgages")
encumbering three (3) properties are being executed and delivered by Mortgagor
for simultaneous recording in the various Florida counties described above. The
total indebtedness secured by this Mortgage equals $50,000,000.00, as evidenced
by one (1) promissory note in the aggregate original principal amount of
$50,000,000.00 (the "Note"). The Note was made, executed and delivered outside
the State of Florida. The value of the Florida property encumbered by the
Florida Mortgages equals $27,200,000.00. The aggregate value of all other
property securing the loan and located outside the State of Florida equals
$50,400,000.00. Thus, the total aggregate value of all property securing the
loan equals $77,600,000.00. The property encumbered by the Florida Mortgages and
located in Florida represents thirty-five (35%) percent [$27,200,000.00 /
$77,600,000.00] of the total value of all property securing the loan. In
accordance with Florida Statutes, Section 201.08, and Florida Administrative
Code, Rule 12B-4.053(32)(b), documentary stamp tax is computed based upon the
percentage of indebtedness which the value of the mortgaged property located in
Florida bears to the total value of all mortgaged property (which, in this case,
equals $17,500,000.00). Accordingly, documentary stamp tax in the amount of
$61,250.00 is due upon the recording of the Florida Mortgages in the Florida
counties listed above. Pursuant to Chapter 199, Florida Statutes, non-recurring
intangible personal property tax is computed and payable based upon that portion
of the indebtedness which bears the same relation as the value of the mortgaged
property located in Florida bears to the total value of all mortgaged property,
which, in this case, equals [$50,000,000.00 x ($27,200,000.00 /
$77,600,000.00)]. Thus, non-recurring intangible personal property tax in the
amount of $35,000.00 is due and payable upon recording of the Florida Mortgages
in the Florida counties listed above.

            (h) All proceeds of any of the foregoing.

All of the property described above is hereinafter collectively defined as the

                         ARTICLE II. OBLIGATIONS SECURED

            2.1 OBLIGATIONS SECURED. Mortgagor makes the foregoing grant and
assignment for the purpose of securing the following obligations ("Secured
Obligations"):

            (a) Full and punctual payment to Mortgagee of all sums at any time
owing under the Note;

            (b) Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations of
Mortgagor under this Mortgage, including, without limitation, indemnification
obligations and advances made to protect the Property;

            (c) Payment and performance of all additional covenants and
obligations of Borrower and Mortgagor under the Loan Documents;

            (d) Payment and performance of all covenants and obligations, if
any, which any rider attached as an exhibit to this Mortgage recites are secured
hereby;

            (e) Payment and performance of all future advances and other
obligations that the then record owner of all or part of the Property may agree
to pay and/or perform (whether as principal, surety or guarantor) for the
benefit of Mortgagee, when the obligation is evidenced by a writing which
recites that it is secured by this Mortgage;

            (f) All interest and charges on all obligations secured hereby
including, without limitation, prepayment charges, late charges and loan fees;
and

            (g) All modifications, extensions and renewals of any of the
obligations secured hereby, however evidenced, including, without limitation:
(i) modifications of the required principal payment dates or interest payment
dates or both, as the case may be, deferring or accelerating payment dates
wholly or partly; and (ii) modifications, extensions or renewals at a different
rate of interest whether or not any such modification, extension or renewal is
evidenced by a new or additional promissory note or notes.

            2.2 FUTURE ADVANCES. This Mortgage is given to secure not only the
Secured Obligations, but also such future advances, whether such advances are
obligatory or are to be made at the option of Mortgagee or the holder hereof, or
otherwise as are made within twenty years from the date hereof, to the same
extent as if such future advances were made on the date of the execution of this
Mortgage. The total amount of Secured Obligations that may be so secured by this
Mortgage may be increased or decreased from time to time, but the total unpaid
balance so secured at any one time shall not exceed twice the face amount of the
Note, plus interest thereon, and any disbursements made under this Mortgage for
the payment of impositions, taxes, assessments, levies, insurance, or otherwise
with interest on such disbursements as provided for


                                     Page 3
<PAGE>
herein, plus any increases in the principal balance as the result of negative
amortization or deferred interest, if any. It is agreed that any additional sum
or sums advanced by Mortgagee pursuant to the terms hereof shall be equally
secured with and have the same priority as the original Secured Obligations and
shall be subject to all of the terms, provisions and conditions of this
Mortgage, whether or not such additional loans or advances are evidenced by
other promissory notes or other guaranties of Mortgagor and whether or not
identified by a recital that it or they are secured by this Mortgage. It is
further agreed that any additional promissory note or guaranty or promissory
notes or guaranties executed and delivered pursuant to this paragraph shall
automatically be deemed to be included in the term "Note" wherever it appears in
the context of this Mortgage. Without the prior written consent of Mortgagee,
which Mortgagee may grant or withhold in its sole discretion, Mortgagor shall
not file for record any notice limiting the maximum principal amount that may be
secured by this Mortgage to a sum less than the maximum principal amount set
forth in this paragraph.

            2.3 OBLIGATIONS. The term "obligations" is used herein in its
broadest and most comprehensive sense and shall be deemed to include, without
limitation, all interest and charges, prepayment charges, late charges and loan
fees at any time accruing or assessed on any of the Secured Obligations.

            2.4 MATURITY DATE. The maturity date of the Note is September 1,
2011.

            2.5 INCORPORATION. All terms and conditions of the documents which
evidence any of the Secured Obligations are incorporated herein by this
reference. All persons who may have or acquire an interest in the Property shall
be deemed to have notice of the terms of the Secured Obligations and to have
notice that the rate of interest on one or more Secured Obligations may vary
from time to time.


             ARTICLE III. ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES

            3.1 ASSIGNMENT. Mortgagor irrevocably assigns to Mortgagee all of
Mortgagor's right, title and interest in, to and under: (a) all present and
future leases of the Property or any portion thereof, all licenses and
agreements relating to the management, leasing or operation of the Property or
any portion thereof, and all other agreements of any kind relating to the use or
occupancy of the Property or any portion thereof, whether such leases, licenses
and agreements are now existing or entered into after the date hereof
("Leases"); and (b) the rents, issues, deposits and profits of the Property,
including, without limitation, all amounts payable and all rights and benefits
accruing to Mortgagor under the Leases ("Payments"). The term "Leases" shall
also include all guarantees of and security for the tenants' performance
thereunder, and all amendments, extensions, renewals or modifications thereto
which are permitted hereunder. This is a present and absolute assignment, not an
assignment for security purposes only, and Mortgagee's right to the Leases and
Payments is not contingent upon, and may be exercised without possession of, the
Property.

            3.2 GRANT OF LICENSE. Notwithstanding the terms contained in Section
3.1, Mortgagee confers upon Mortgagor a revocable license ("License") to collect
and retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the occurrence of
a Default (as hereinafter defined). Upon a Default, the License shall be
automatically revoked and Mortgagee may collect


                                     Page 4
<PAGE>
and apply the Payments pursuant to the terms hereof without notice and without
taking possession of the Property. Upon Mortgagor's cure of the Default,
Mortgagee shall re-confer upon Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and
retain the Payments as they become due and payable, until the occurrence of a
Default. All Payments thereafter collected by Mortgagor shall be held by
Mortgagor as trustee under a constructive trust for the benefit of Mortgagee.
Mortgagor hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs the tenants under the
Leases, upon notice of a Default from Mortgagee, to rely upon and comply with
any notice or demand by Mortgagee for the payment to Mortgagee of any rental or
other sums which may at any time become due under the Leases, or for the
performance of any of the tenants' undertakings under the Leases, and the
tenants shall have no right or duty to inquire as to whether any Default has
actually occurred or is then existing. Mortgagor hereby relieves the tenants
from any liability to Mortgagor by reason of relying upon and complying with any
such notice or demand by Mortgagee. Mortgagee may apply, in its sole discretion,
any Payments so collected by Mortgagee against any Secured Obligation or any
other obligation of Borrower, Mortgagor or any other person or entity, under any
document or instrument related to or executed in connection with the Loan
Documents, whether existing on the date hereof or hereafter arising. Collection
of any Payments by Mortgagee shall not cure or waive any Default or notice of
Default or invalidate any acts done pursuant to such notice.

            3.3 EFFECT OF ASSIGNMENT. The foregoing irrevocable assignment shall
not cause Mortgagee to be: (a) a mortgagee in possession; (b) responsible or
liable for the control, care, management or repair of the Property or for
performing any of the terms, agreements, undertakings, obligations,
representations, warranties, covenants and conditions of the Leases; (c)
responsible or liable for any waste committed on the Property by the tenants
under any of the Leases or by any other parties; for any dangerous or defective
condition of the Property; or for any negligence in the management, upkeep,
repair or control of the Property resulting in loss or injury or death to any
tenant, licensee, employee, invitee or other person; or (d) responsible for or
impose upon Mortgagee any duty to produce rents or profits. Mortgagee shall not
directly or indirectly be liable to Mortgagor or any other person as a
consequence of: (e) the exercise of or failure to exercise any of the rights,
remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee hereunder; or (f) the failure or refusal
of Mortgagee to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability of
Mortgagor arising under the Leases.

            3.4 COVENANTS.

            (a) ALL LEASES. Mortgagor shall, at Mortgagor's sole cost and
expense:

            (i) perform all obligations of the landlord under the Leases and use
reasonable efforts to enforce performance by the tenants of all obligations of
the tenants under the Leases;

            (ii) use reasonable efforts to keep the Property leased at all times
to tenants whom Mortgagor reasonably and in good faith believes are creditworthy
at rents not less than the fair market rental value (including, but not limited
to, free or discounted rents to the extent the market so requires);

            (iii) promptly upon Mortgagee's request, deliver to Mortgagee a copy
of each requested Lease and all amendments thereto and waivers thereof; and


                                     Page 5
<PAGE>
            (iv) promptly upon Mortgagee's request, execute and record any
additional assignments of landlord's interest under any Lease to Mortgagee and
specific subordinations of any Lease to this Mortgage, in form and substance
satisfactory to Mortgagee.

Unless consented to in writing by Mortgagee or otherwise permitted under any
other provision of the Loan Documents, Mortgagor shall not:

            (v) grant any tenant under any Lease any option, right of first
refusal or other right to purchase all or any portion of the Property under any
circumstances;

            (vi)  grant any tenant under any Lease any right to prepay rent
more than 1 month in advance;

            (vii) except upon Mortgagee's request, execute any assignment of
landlord's interest in any Lease; or

            (viii) collect rent or other sums due under any Lease in advance,
other than to collect rent 1 month in advance of the time when it becomes due.

Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this Section shall
be null and void.

Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee any sums received by Mortgagor in
consideration of any termination, modification or amendment of any Lease or any
release or discharge of any tenant under any Lease from any obligation
thereunder and any such sums received by Mortgagor shall be held in trust by
Mortgagor for such purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Default
exists, the portion of any such sum received by Mortgagor with respect to any
Lease which is less than $50,000 shall be payable to Mortgagor. All such sums
received by Mortgagee with respect to any Lease shall be deemed "Impounds" (as
defined in Section 6.12) and shall be deposited by Mortgagee into a pledged
account in accordance with Section 6.12. If no Default exists, Mortgagee shall
release such Impounds to Mortgagor from time to time as necessary to pay or
reimburse Mortgagor for such tenant improvements, brokerage commissions and
other leasing costs as may be required to re-tenant the affected space;
provided, however, Mortgagee shall have received and approved each of the
following for each tenant for which such costs were incurred; (1) Mortgagor's
written request for such release, including the name of the tenant, the location
and net rentable area of the space and a description and cost breakdown of the
tenant improvements or other leasing costs covered by the request; (2)
Mortgagor's certification that any tenant improvements have been completed
lien-free and in a workmanlike manner; (3) a fully executed Lease, or extension
or renewal of the current Lease; (4) an estoppel certificate executed by the
tenant including its acknowledgement that all tenant improvements have been
satisfactorily completed; and (5) such other information with respect to such
costs as Mortgagee may require. Following the re-tenanting of all affected space
(including, without limitation, the completion of all tenant improvements), and
provided no Default exists, Mortgagee shall release any remaining such Impounds
relating to the affected space to Mortgagor. Mortgagor shall construct all
tenant improvements in a workmanlike manner and in accordance with all
applicable laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

            (b) MAJOR LEASES. Mortgagor shall, at Mortgagor's sole cost and
expense, give Mortgagee prompt written notice of any material default by
landlord or tenant under any


                                     Page 6
<PAGE>
Major Lease (as defined below). Unless consented to in writing by Mortgagee or
otherwise permitted under any other provision of the Loan Documents, Mortgagor
shall not:

            (i) enter into any Major Lease which (aa) is not on fair market
terms (which terms may include free or discounted rent to the extent the market
so requires); (bb) does not contain a provision requiring the tenant to execute
and deliver to the landlord an estoppel certificate in form and substance
satisfactory to the landlord promptly upon the landlord's request; or (cc)
allows the tenant to assign or sublet the premises without the landlord's
consent;

            (ii) materially reduce any rent or other sums due from the tenant
under any Major Lease;

            (iii) terminate or materially modify or amend any Major Lease; or

            (iv) release or discharge the tenant or any guarantor under any
Major Lease from any material obligation thereunder.

Any such attempted action in violation of the provisions of this Section shall
be null and void.

"Major Lease", as used herein, shall mean any Lease, which is, at any time: (1)
a Lease of more than 20% of the total rentable area of the Property, as
reasonably determined by Mortgagee; or (2) a Lease which generates a gross base
monthly rent exceeding 20% of the total gross base monthly rent generated by all
Leases (excluding all Leases under which the tenant is then in default), as
reasonably determined by Mortgagee. Mortgagor's obligations with respect to
Major Leases shall be governed by the provisions of Section 3.40 as well as by
the provisions of this Section.

            (c) FAILURE TO DENY REQUEST Mortgagee's failure to deny any written
request by Mortgagor for Mortgagee's consent under the provisions of Sections
3.4(a) or 3.4(b) within 10 Business Days after Mortgagee's receipt of such
request (and all documents and information reasonably related thereto) shall be
deemed to constitute Mortgagee's consent to such request.

            3.5 RIGHT OF SUBORDINATION. Mortgagee may at any time and from time
to time by specific written instrument intended for the purpose unilaterally
subordinate the lien of this Mortgage to any Lease, without joinder or consent
of, or notice to, Mortgagor, any tenant or any other person. Notice is hereby
given to each tenant under a Lease of such right to subordinate. No
subordination referred to in this Section shall constitute a subordination to
any lien or other encumbrance, whenever arising, or improve the right of any
junior lienholder. Nothing herein shall be construed as subordinating this
Mortgage to any Lease.


              ARTICLE IV. SECURITY AGREEMENT AND FIXTURE FILING

            4.1 SECURITY INTEREST. Mortgagor grants and assigns to Mortgagee a
security interest to secure payment and performance of all of the Secured
Obligations, in all of Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to the
following described personal property in which Mortgagor now or at any time
hereafter has any interest ("Collateral"):


                                     Page 7
<PAGE>
      All goods, building and other materials, supplies, work in process,
      equipment, machinery, fixtures, furniture, furnishings, signs and other
      personal property, wherever situated, which are or are to be incorporated
      into, used in connection with or appropriated for use on the Property; all
      rents, issues, deposits and profits of the Property (to the extent, if
      any, they are not subject to the Absolute Assignment of Rents and Leases);
      all inventory, accounts, cash receipts, deposit accounts, impounds,
      accounts receivable, contract rights, general intangibles, software,
      chattel paper, instruments, documents, promissory notes, drafts, letters
      of credit, letter of credit rights, supporting obligations, insurance
      policies, insurance and condemnation awards and proceeds, any other rights
      to the payment of money, trade names, trademarks and service marks arising
      from or related to the Property or any business now or hereafter conducted
      thereon by Mortgagor; all permits, consents, approvals, licenses,
      authorizations and other rights granted by, given by or obtained from, any
      governmental entity with respect to the Property; all deposits or other
      security now or hereafter made with or given to utility companies by
      Mortgagor with respect to the Property; all advance payments of insurance
      premiums made by Mortgagor with respect to the Property; all plans,
      drawings and specifications relating to the Property; all loan funds held
      by Mortgagee, whether or not disbursed; all funds deposited with Mortgagee
      pursuant to any Loan Document, all reserves, deferred payments, deposits,
      accounts, refunds, cost savings and payments of any kind related to the
      Property or any portion thereof, including, without limitation, all
      "Impounds" as defined herein; together with all replacements and proceeds
      of, and additions and accessions to, any of the foregoing, and all books,
      records and files relating to any of the foregoing.

            As to all of the above described personal property which is or which
hereafter becomes a "fixture" under the Florida Uniform Commercial Code (the
"UCC"), this Mortgage constitutes a fixture filing under Florida Statutes
Section 679.313 and 679.402, as amended and recodified from time to time, this
Mortgage shall constitute a fixture filing recorded in the real estate records.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall be deemed to create any lien
or interest in favor of Mortgagee under this Mortgage in any such Collateral
which is not a fixture, and the purpose of this Article IV is to create a
fixture filing under Florida Statutes Section 679.313 and 679.402, as amended or
recodified from time to time.

            4.2 COVENANTS. Mortgagor agrees: (a) to execute and deliver such
documents as Mortgagee reasonably deems necessary to create, perfect and
continue the security interests contemplated hereby; (b) not to change its name,
and, as applicable, its chief executive offices, its principal residence or the
jurisdiction in which it is organized without giving Mortgagee at least 30 days'
prior written notice thereof; and (c) to cooperate with Mortgagee in perfecting
all security interests granted herein and in obtaining such agreements from
third parties as Mortgagee deems necessary, proper or convenient in connection
with the preservation, perfection or enforcement of any of Mortgagee's rights
hereunder.

            4.3 RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE. In addition to Mortgagee's rights as a
"Secured Party" under the UCC, Mortgagee may, but shall not be obligated to, at
any time without notice and at the expense of Mortgagor: (a) give notice to any
person of Mortgagee's rights hereunder and enforce such rights at law or in
equity; (b) insure, protect, defend and


                                     Page 8
<PAGE>
preserve the Collateral or any rights or interests of Mortgagee therein; and (c)
inspect the Collateral during normal business hours upon reasonable prior
written notice, provided, however, that such notice shall not be required in the
event of an emergency. Notwithstanding the above, in no event shall Mortgagee be
deemed to have accepted any property other than cash in satisfaction of any
obligation of Mortgagor to Mortgagee unless Mortgagee shall make an express
written election of said remedy under the UCC or other applicable law.

            4.4 ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF MORTGAGEE UPON DEFAULT. Upon the occurrence
of a Default, then in addition to all of Mortgagee's rights as a "Secured Party"
under the UCC or otherwise at law:

            (a) DISPOSITION OF COLLATERAL. Mortgagee may: (i) upon written
notice, require Mortgagor to assemble the Collateral and make it available to
Mortgagee at a place reasonably designated by Mortgagee; (ii) without prior
notice (to the extent permitted by law), enter upon the Property or other place
where the Collateral may be located and take possession of, collect, sell,
lease, license and otherwise dispose of the Collateral, and store the same at
locations acceptable to Mortgagee at Mortgagor's expense; or (iii) sell, assign
and deliver the Collateral at any place or in any lawful manner and bid and
become purchaser at any such sales; and

            (b) OTHER RIGHTS. Mortgagee may, for the account of Mortgagor and at
Mortgagor's expense: (i) operate, use, consume, sell, lease, license or
otherwise dispose of the Collateral as Mortgagee reasonably deems appropriate
for the purpose of performing any or all of the Secured Obligations; (ii) enter
into any agreement, compromise or settlement including insurance claims, which
Mortgagee may reasonably deem desirable or proper with respect to the
Collateral; and (iii) endorse and deliver evidences of title for, and receive,
enforce and collect by legal action or otherwise, all indebtedness and
obligations now or hereafter owing to Mortgagor in connection with or on account
of the Collateral.

            Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that a disposition of the
Collateral in accordance with Mortgagee's rights and remedies as heretofore
provided is a disposition thereof in a commercially reasonable manner and that 5
Business Days prior notice of such disposition is commercially reasonable
notice. Mortgagee shall have no obligation to process or prepare the Collateral
for sale or other disposition. In disposing of the Collateral, Mortgagee may
disclaim all warranties of title, possession, quiet enjoyment and the like. Any
proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral may be applied by
Mortgagee first to the reasonable expenses incurred by Mortgagee in connection
therewith, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, and then to the payment of the Secured Obligations, in such order
of application as Mortgagee may from time to time elect..

            4.5 POWER OF ATTORNEY. Mortgagor hereby irrevocably appoints
Mortgagee as Mortgagor's attorney-in-fact (such agency being coupled with an
interest), and as such attorney-in-fact, Mortgagee may, without the obligation
to do so, in Mortgagee's name or in the name of Mortgagor, prepare, execute,
file and record financing statements, continuation statements, applications for
registration and like papers necessary to create, perfect or preserve any of
Mortgagee's security interests and rights in or to the Collateral, and upon a
Default, take


                                     Page 9
<PAGE>
any other action required of Mortgagor; provided, however, that Mortgagee as
such attorney-in-fact shall be accountable only for such funds as are actually
received by Mortgagee.


                  ARTICLE V. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            5.1 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Mortgagor represents and
warrants to Mortgagee that, to Mortgagor's current actual knowledge after
reasonable investigation and inquiry, the following statements are true and
correct as of the Effective Date:

            (a) LEGAL STATUS. Mortgagor and Borrower are duly organized and
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state(s) in which Mortgagor
and Borrower are organized. Mortgagor and Borrower are qualified or licensed to
do business in all jurisdictions in which such qualification or licensing is
required.

            (b) PERMITS. Mortgagor and Borrower possess all permits, franchises
and licenses and all rights to all trademarks, trade names, patents and
fictitious names, if any, necessary to enable Mortgagor and Borrower to conduct
the business(es) in which Mortgagor and Borrower are now engaged in compliance
with applicable law.

            (c) AUTHORIZATION AND VALIDITY. The execution and delivery of the
Loan Documents have been duly authorized and the Loan Documents constitute valid
and binding obligations of Mortgagor, Borrower or the party which executed the
same, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other laws
affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights, or by the application of rules
of equity.

            (d) VIOLATIONS. The execution, delivery and performance by Mortgagor
and Borrower of each of the Loan Documents do not violate any provision of any
law or regulation, or result in any breach or default under any contract,
obligation, indenture or other instrument to which Mortgagor or Borrower is a
party or by which Mortgagor or Borrower is bound.

            (e) LITIGATION. There are no pending or threatened actions, claims,
investigations, suits or proceedings before any governmental authority, court or
administrative agency which may adversely affect the financial condition or
operations of Mortgagor or Borrower other than those previously disclosed in
writing by Mortgagor or Borrower to Mortgagee.

            (f) FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The financial statements of Mortgagor and
Borrower, of each general partner (if Mortgagor or Borrower is a partnership),
of each member (if Mortgagor or Borrower is a limited liability company) and of
each guarantor, if any, previously delivered by Mortgagor or Borrower to
Mortgagee: (i) are materially complete and correct; (ii) present fairly the
financial condition of such party; and (iii) have been prepared in accordance
with the same accounting standard used by Mortgagor or Borrower to prepare the
financial statements delivered to and approved by Mortgagee in connection with
the making of the Loan, or other accounting standards approved by Mortgagee.
Since the date of such financial statements, there has been no material adverse
change in such financial condition, nor have any assets or properties reflected
on such financial statements been sold, transferred, assigned, mortgaged,


                                    Page 10
<PAGE>
pledged or encumbered except as previously disclosed in writing by Mortgagor or
Borrower to Mortgagee and approved in writing by Mortgagee.

            (g) REPORTS. All reports, documents, instruments and information
delivered to Mortgagee in connection with the Loan: (i) are correct in all
material respects and sufficiently complete to give Mortgagee accurate knowledge
of their subject matter; and (ii) do not contain any misrepresentation of a
material fact or omission of a material fact which omission makes the provided
information misleading.

            (h)         INCOME TAXES.  There are no material pending
assessments or adjustments of Mortgagor's or Borrower's income tax payable
with respect to any year.

            (i) SUBORDINATION. There is no agreement or instrument to which
Borrower is a party or by which Borrower is bound that would require the

holder at termination or cancellation. Mortgagor shall maintain all required
insurance throughout the term of the Loan and while any liabilities of Borrower
or Mortgagor to Mortgagee under any of the Loan Documents remain outstanding at
Mortgagor's expense, with companies, and in substance and form satisfactory to
Mortgagee. Mortgagee, by reason of accepting, rejecting, approving or obtaining
insurance shall not incur any liability for: (c) the existence, nonexistence,
form or legal sufficiency of any insurance; (d) the solvency of any insurer; or
(e) the payment of claims.

            6.11  INSURANCE AND CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS.

            (a) ASSIGNMENT OF CLAIMS. Mortgagor absolutely and irrevocably
assigns to Mortgagee all of the following rights, claims and amounts
(collectively, "Claims"), all of which shall be paid to Mortgagee: (i) all
awards of damages and all other compensation payable directly or indirectly by
reason of a condemnation or proposed condemnation for public or private use
affecting all or any part of, or any interest in, the Property; (ii) all other
claims and awards for damages to or decrease in value of all or any part of, or
any interest in, the Property; (iii) all proceeds of any insurance policies
payable by reason of loss sustained to all or any part of the Property; and (iv)
all interest which may accrue on any of the foregoing. Mortgagor shall give
Mortgagee prompt written notice of the occurrence of any casualty affecting, or
the institution of any proceedings for eminent domain or for the condemnation
of, the Property or any portion thereof. So long as no Default has occurred and
is continuing at the time, Mortgagor shall have the right to adjust, compromise
and settle any Claim of $100,000 or less without the consent of Mortgagee,
provided, however, all awards, proceeds and other sums described herein shall
continue to be payable to Mortgagee. Mortgagee may commence, appear in, defend
or prosecute any Claim exceeding $100,000, and may adjust, compromise and settle
all Claims (except for Claims which Mortgagor may settle as provided herein),
but shall not be responsible


                                    Page 20
<PAGE>
for any failure to commence, appear in, defend, prosecute or collect any such
Claim regardless of the cause of the failure. All awards, proceeds and other
sums described herein shall be payable to Mortgagee.

            (b) APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; NO DEFAULT. So long as no Default has
occurred and is continuing at the time of Mortgagee's receipt of the proceeds of
the Claims ("Proceeds") and no Default occurs thereafter, Mortgagee shall apply
the Proceeds in the following order of priority: First, to Mortgagee's expenses
in settling, prosecuting or defending the Claims; Second, to the repair or
restoration of the Property; and Third, to Mortgagor if the repair or
restoration of the Property has been completed, but to the Secured Obligations
in any order without suspending, extending or reducing any obligation of
Mortgagor to make installment payments if the repair or restoration of the
Property has not been completed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagee shall
have no obligation to make any Proceeds available for the repair or restoration
of the Property unless and until all the following conditions have been
satisfied: (i) delivery to Mortgagee of the Proceeds plus any additional amount
which is needed to pay all costs of the repair or restoration (including,
without limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent during the
repair period); (ii) establishment of an arrangement for lien releases and
disbursement of funds acceptable to Mortgagee; (iii) delivery to Mortgagee in
form and content acceptable to Mortgagee of all of the following: (aa) plans and
specifications for the work; (bb) a contract for the work, signed by a
contractor acceptable to Mortgagee; (cc) a cost breakdown for the work; (dd) if
reasonably required by Mortgagee, a payment and performance bond for the work;
(ee) evidence of the continuation of substantially all Leases unless consented
to in writing by Mortgagee; (ff) evidence that, upon completion of the work, the
size, capacity, value, and income coverage ratios for the Property will be at
least as great as those which existed immediately before the damage or
condemnation occurred; and (gg) evidence of the satisfaction of any additional
conditions that Mortgagee may reasonably establish to protect Mortgagee's
security. Mortgagor acknowledges that the specific conditions described above
are reasonable.

            (c) APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS; DEFAULT. If a Default has occurred and
is continuing at the time of Mortgagee's receipt of the Proceeds or if a Default
occurs at any time thereafter, Mortgagee may, at Mortgagee's absolute discretion
and regardless of any impairment of security or lack of impairment of security,
but subject to applicable law governing use of the Proceeds, if any, apply all
or any of the Proceeds to Mortgagee's expenses in settling, prosecuting or
defending the Claims and then apply the balance to the Secured Obligations in
any order without suspending, extending or reducing any obligation of Mortgagor
to make installment payments, and may release all or any part of the Proceeds to
Mortgagor upon any conditions Mortgagee chooses.

            6.12  IMPOUNDS.

            (a) POST-DEFAULT IMPOUNDS. If required by Mortgagee at any time
after a Default occurs (and regardless of whether such Default is thereafter
cured), Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee such amounts ("Post-Default
Impounds") on such dates (determined by Mortgagee as provided below) as will be
sufficient to pay any or all "Costs" (as defined below) specified by Mortgagee.
Mortgagee in its reasonable discretion shall estimate the amount of such Costs
that will be payable or required during any period selected by Mortgagee not
exceeding 1 year and shall determine the fractional portion thereof that
Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee


                                    Page 21
<PAGE>
on each date specified by Mortgagee during such period. If the Post-Default
Impounds paid by Mortgagor are not sufficient to pay the related Costs,
Mortgagor shall deposit with Mortgagee upon demand an amount equal to the
deficiency. All Post-Default Impounds shall be payable by Mortgagor in addition
to (but without duplication of) any other Impounds (as defined below).

            (b) ALL IMPOUNDS. Post-Default Impounds and any other impounds that
may be payable by Borrower under the Note are collectively called "Impounds".
All Impounds shall be deposited into one or more segregated or commingled
accounts maintained by Mortgagee or its servicing agent. Except as otherwise
provided in the Note, such account(s) shall not bear interest. Mortgagee shall
not be a trustee, special depository or other fiduciary for Mortgagor with
respect to such account, and the existence of such account shall not limit
Mortgagee's rights under this Mortgage, any other agreement or any provision of
law. If no Default exists, Mortgagee shall apply all Impounds to the payment of
the related Costs, or in Mortgagee's sole discretion may release any or all
Impounds to Mortgagor for application to and payment of such Costs. If a Default
exists, Mortgagee may apply any or all Impounds to any Secured Obligation and/or
to cure such Default, whereupon Mortgagor shall restore all Impounds so applied
and cure all Defaults not cured by such application. The obligations of
Mortgagor hereunder shall not be diminished by deposits of Impounds made by
Mortgagor, except to the extent that such obligations have actually been met by
application of such Impounds. Upon any assignment of this Mortgage, Mortgagee
may assign all Impounds in its possession to Mortgagee's assignee, whereupon
Mortgagee shall be released from all liability with respect to such Impounds.
Within 60 days following full repayment of the Secured Obligations (other than
as a consequence of foreclosure or conveyance in lieu of foreclosure) or at such
earlier time as Mortgagee may elect, Mortgagee shall pay to Mortgagor all
Impounds in its possession, and no other party shall have any right or claim
thereto. "Costs" means (i) all taxes and other liabilities payable by Mortgagor
under Section 0, (ii) all insurance premiums payable by Mortgagor under Section
0, (iii) all other costs and expenses for which Impounds are required under the
Note, and/or (iv) all other amounts that will be required to preserve the value
of the Property. Mortgagor shall deliver to Mortgagee, promptly upon receipt,
all bills for Costs for which Mortgagee has required Post-Default Impounds.

            6.13 DEFENSE AND NOTICE OF LOSSES, CLAIMS AND ACTIONS. Mortgagor
shall protect, preserve and defend the Property and title to and right of
possession of the Property, the security of this Mortgage and the rights and
powers of Mortgagee hereunder at Mortgagor's sole expense against all adverse
claims, whether the claim: (a) is against a possessory or non-possessory
interest; (b) arose prior or subsequent to the Effective Date; or (c) is senior
or junior to Mortgagor's or Mortgagee's rights. Mortgagor shall give Mortgagee
prompt notice in writing of the assertion of any claim, of the filing of any
action or proceeding, of the occurrence of any damage to the Property and of any
condemnation offer or action.

            6.14 RIGHT OF INSPECTION. Mortgagee and its independent contractors,
agents and employees may enter the Property from time to time at any reasonable
time upon reasonable prior notice to Mortgagor (except that such notice shall
not be required in the event of an emergency) for the purpose of inspecting the
Property and ascertaining Mortgagor's compliance with the terms of this
Mortgage. Mortgagee shall use reasonable efforts to assure that Mortgagee's
entry upon and inspection of the Property shall not materially and unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of Mortgagor or Mortgagor's tenants on
the Property.

            6.15 PROHIBITION OF TRANSFER OF PROPERTY OR INTERESTS IN MORTGAGOR.
Mortgagor acknowledges that Mortgagee has relied upon the principals of
Mortgagor and Borrower and their experience in owning and operating properties
similar to the Property in connection with the closing of the Loan. Accordingly,
except with the prior written consent of Mortgagee or as otherwise expressly
permitted in the Note, Mortgagor shall not cause or permit any sale, exchange,
mortgage, pledge, hypothecation, assignment, encumbrance or other transfer,
conveyance or disposition, whether voluntarily, involuntarily or by operation of
law ("Transfer") of all or any part of, or all or any direct or indirect
interest in, the Property or the Collateral (except for equipment and inventory
in the ordinary course of its business), or cause or permit a Transfer of any
direct or indirect interest (whether general partnership interest, stock,
non-managing member limited liability company interest, trust, or otherwise) in
Mortgagor or Borrower. In the event of any Transfer that is not expressly
permitted in the Note and is without the prior written consent of Mortgagee,
Mortgagee shall have the absolute right at its option, without prior demand or
notice, to declare all of the Secured Obligations immediately due and payable,
except to the extent prohibited by law, and pursue its rights and remedies under
Section 0 herein. Mortgagor agrees to pay any prepayment fee as set forth in the
Note in the event the Secured Obligations are accelerated pursuant to the terms
of this Section. Consent to one such Transfer shall not be deemed to be a waiver
of the right to require the consent to future or successive Transfers. Except
for Transfers expressly permitted under the Note, Mortgagee's consent to any
Transfer may be withheld, conditioned or delayed in Mortgagee's sole and
absolute discretion.

            6.16 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.17 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.18 EXCULPATION. Mortgagee shall not directly or indirectly be
liable to Mortgagor or any other person as a consequence of: (a) the exercise of
the rights, remedies or powers granted to Mortgagee in this Mortgage; (b) the
failure or refusal of Mortgagee to perform or discharge any obligation or
liability of Mortgagor under any agreement related to the Property or under this
Mortgage; or (c) any loss sustained by Mortgagor or any third party resulting
from Mortgagee's failure to lease the Property after a Default or from any other
act or omission of Mortgagee in managing the Property after a Default unless the
loss is caused by the willful misconduct and bad faith of Mortgagee and no such
liability shall be asserted or enforced against Mortgagee, all such liability
being expressly waived and released by Mortgagor.

            6.19 INDEMNITY. Without in any way limiting any other indemnity
contained in this Mortgage, Mortgagor agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the Mortgagee Group (as hereinafter defined) from and against any
claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising
out of: (a) the making of the Loan, except for violations of banking laws or
regulations by the Mortgagee Group; (b) this Mortgage; (c) the execution of this
Mortgage or the performance of any act required or permitted hereunder or by
law; (d) any failure of Mortgagor to perform Mortgagor's obligations under this
Mortgage or the other Loan Documents; (e) any alleged obligation or undertaking
on the Mortgagee Group's part to perform or discharge any of the
representations, warranties, conditions, covenants or other obligations
contained in any other document related to the Property; (f) any act or omission
by Mortgagor or any contractor, agent, employee or representative of Mortgagor
with respect to the Property; or (g) any claim, loss,


                                    Page 23
<PAGE>
damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising out of: (i)
the use, generation, manufacture, storage, treatment, release, threatened
release, discharge, disposal, transportation or presence of any Hazardous
Materials which are found in, on, under or about the Property (including,
without limitation, underground contamination); or (ii) the breach of any
covenant, representation or warranty of Mortgagor under Section 0 above. The
foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, this indemnity shall not include any
claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability directly or indirectly arising
out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any member of the Mortgagee
Group, or any claim, loss, damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the
Mortgagee Group arising from any act or incident on the Property occurring after
the full reconveyance and release of the lien of this Mortgage on the Property,
or with respect to the matters set forth in clause (g) above, any claim, loss,
damage, cost, expense or liability incurred by the Mortgagee Group resulting
from the introduction and initial release of Hazardous Materials on the Property
occurring after the transfer of title to the Property at a foreclosure sale
under this Mortgage, either pursuant to judicial decree or the power of sale, or
by deed in lieu of such foreclosure. This indemnity shall include, without
limitation: (aa) all consequential damages (including, without limitation, any
third party tort claims or governmental claims, fines or penalties against the
Mortgagee Group); (bb) all court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees
(including, without limitation, expert witness fees) paid or incurred by the
Mortgagee Group; and (cc) the costs, whether foreseeable or unforeseeable, of
any investigation, repair, cleanup or detoxification of the Property which is
required by any governmental entity or is otherwise necessary to render the
Property in compliance with all laws and regulations pertaining to Hazardous
Materials. "Mortgagee Group", as used herein, shall mean (1) Mortgagee
(including, without limitation, any participant in the Loan), (2) any entity
controlling, controlled by or under common control with Mortgagee, (3) the
directors, officers, employees and agents of Mortgagee and such other entities,
and (4) the successors, heirs and assigns of the entities and persons described
in foregoing clauses (1) through (3). Mortgagor shall pay immediately upon
Mortgagee's demand any amounts owing under this indemnity together with interest
from the date the indebtedness arises until paid at the rate of interest
applicable to the principal balance of the Note as specified therein. Mortgagor
agrees to use legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the Mortgagee Group in any
action or proceeding arising under this indemnity. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS
SECTION SHALL SURVIVE THE SATISFACTION AND RELEASE OF THIS MORTGAGE, BUT
MORTGAGOR'S LIABILITY UNDER THIS INDEMNITY SHALL BE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF
THE SECTION IN THE NOTE ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

            6.20 INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

            6.21 RELEASES, EXTENSIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL SECURITY.
Without notice to or the consent, approval or agreement of any persons or
entities having any interest at any time in the Property or in any manner
obligated under the Secured Obligations ("Interested Parties"), Mortgagee may,
from time to time: (a) fully or partially release any person or entity from
liability for the payment or performance of any Secured Obligation; (b) extend
the maturity of any Secured Obligation; (c) make any agreement with Borrower
increasing the amount or otherwise altering the terms of any Secured Obligation;
(d) accept additional security for any Secured Obligation; or (e) release all or
any portion of the Property, Collateral and other security for any Secured
Obligation. None of the foregoing actions shall release or reduce the personal
liability of any of said Interested Parties, or release or impair the priority
of the lien of this Mortgage upon the Property.


                                    Page 24
<PAGE>
            6.22 SALE OR PARTICIPATION OF LOAN. Mortgagor agrees that Mortgagee
may at any time sell, assign, participate or securitize all or any portion of
Mortgagee's rights and obligations under the Loan Documents, and that any such
sale, assignment, participation or securitization may be to one or more
financial institutions or other entities, to private investors, and/or into the
public securities market, in Mortgagee's sole discretion. Mortgagor further
agrees that Mortgagee may disseminate to any such actual or potential
purchaser(s), assignee(s) or participant(s) all documents and financial and
other information heretofore or hereafter provided to or known to Mortgagee with
respect to: (a) the Property and its operation; and/or (b) any party connected
with the Loan (including, without limitation, Mortgagor, any partner or member
of Mortgagor, any constituent partner or member of Mortgagor, any guarantor and
any nonborrower mortgagor). In the event of any such sale, assignment,
participation or securitization, Mortgagee and the other parties to the same
shall share in the rights and obligations of Mortgagee set forth in the Loan
Documents as and to the extent they shall agree among themselves. In connection
with any such sale, assignment, participation or securitization, Mortgagor
further agrees that the Loan Documents shall be sufficient evidence of the
obligations of Mortgagor to each purchaser, assignee or participant, and
Mortgagor shall, within 15 days after request by Mortgagee, (x) deliver an
estoppel certificate verifying for the benefit of Mortgagee and any other party
designated by Mortgagee the status and the terms and provisions of the Loan in
form and substance acceptable to Mortgagee, (y) provide any information, legal
opinions or documents regarding Mortgagor, Guarantor (as defined in the Loan
Documents), the Property and any tenants of the Property as Mortgagee or
Mortgagee's rating agencies may reasonably request, and (z) enter into such
amendments or modifications to the Loan Documents or the organizational
documents of Mortgagor as may be reasonably required in order to facilitate any
such sale, assignment, participation or securitization without impairing
Mortgagor's rights or increasing Mortgagor's obligations. The indemnity
obligations of Mortgagor under the Loan Documents shall also apply with respect
to any purchaser, assignee or participant.

            6.23 RELEASE. Upon payment in full of the Secured Obligations, and
satisfaction of all of the covenants, warranties, undertakings and agreements
made in this Mortgage and in the other Loan Documents (including, without
limitation, repayment in full of all principal, interest and other amounts owing
under the Note) are kept and performed, and all obligations, if any, of
Mortgagee for further advances have been terminated, then, and in that event
only, Mortgagee shall release, without warranty, the Property or that portion
thereof then held hereunder. The recitals of any matters or facts in any release
executed hereunder shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof. To the
extent permitted by law, the release may describe the grantee as "the person or
persons legally entitled thereto". Mortgagee shall have no duty to determine the
rights of persons claiming to be rightful grantees of any release. When the
Property has been fully released, the last such release shall operate as a
reassignment of all future rents, issues and profits of the Property to the
person or persons legally entitled thereto.

            6.24 SUBROGATION. Mortgagee shall be subrogated to the lien of all
encumbrances, whether released of record or not, paid in whole or in part by
Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage or by the proceeds of any loan secured by
this Mortgage.

            6.25 MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. Without the prior written consent of
Mortgagee, Mortgagor shall not terminate, modify, amend or enter into any
agreement providing for the management, leasing or operation of the Property.
Mortgagor represents,


                                    Page 25
<PAGE>
warrants and covenants that any existing management agreement includes, and any
future management agreement entered into by Mortgagor shall include, a provision
which provides that the management agreement is automatically terminated upon
the transfer of the Property by Mortgagor, either by sale, foreclosure, deed in
lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise, to Mortgagee or any other purchaser of the
Property. Upon a Default under the Loan Documents or a default under any
management agreement then in effect, which default is not cured within any
applicable grace or cure period, Mortgagee shall have the right to terminate, or
to direct Mortgagor to terminate, such management agreement upon thirty (30)
days' written notice and to retain, or to direct Mortgagor to retain, a new
management agent approved by Mortgagee.


                             ARTICLE VII. DEFAULT

            7.1 DEFAULT. For all purposes hereof, "Default" shall mean either an
"Optional Default" (as defined below) or an "Automatic Default" (as defined
below).

            (a) OPTIONAL DEFAULT. An "Optional Default" shall occur, at
Mortgagee's option, upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

            (i) MONETARY. Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to (aa) pay when due
any sums payable under the Loan Documents which by their express terms require
immediate payment without any grace period or sums which are payable on the
Maturity Date, or (bb) pay within 5 days when due any other sums payable under
the Note, this Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, including, without
limitation, any monthly payment due under the Note.

            (ii) FAILURE TO PERFORM. Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to
observe, perform or discharge any of Borrower's or Mortgagor's obligations,
covenants, conditions or agreements, other than Borrower's or Mortgagor's
payment obligations, under the Note, this Mortgage or any of the other Loan
Documents, and (aa) such failure shall remain uncured for 30 days after written
notice thereof shall have been given to Borrower or Mortgagor, as the case may
be, by Mortgagee or (bb) if such failure is of such a nature that it cannot be
cured within such 30 day period, Borrower or Mortgagor shall fail to commence to
cure such failure within such 30 day period or shall fail to diligently
prosecute such curative action thereafter.

            (iii) REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Any representation, warranty,
certificate or other statement (financial or otherwise) made or furnished by or
on behalf of Borrower, Mortgagor, or a guarantor, if any, to Mortgagee or in
connection with any of the Loan Documents, or as an inducement to Mortgagee to
make the Loan, shall be false, incorrect, incomplete or misleading in any
material respect when made or furnished.

            (iv) CONDEMNATION; ATTACHMENT. The condemnation, seizure or
appropriation of any material portion (as reasonably determined by Mortgagee) of
the Property; or the sequestration or attachment of, or levy or execution upon
any of the Property, the Collateral or any other collateral provided by Borrower
or Mortgagor under any of the Loan Documents, or any material portion of the
other assets of Borrower or Mortgagor, which sequestration, attachment, levy or
execution is not released or dismissed within 45 days after its occurrence; or
the sale of any assets affected by any of the foregoing.


                                    Page 26
<PAGE>
            (v) UNINSURED CASUALTY. The occurrence of an uninsured casualty with
respect to any material portion (as reasonably determined by Mortgagee) of the
Property unless: (aa) no other Default has occurred and is continuing at the
time of such casualty or occurs thereafter; (bb) Mortgagor promptly notifies
Mortgagee of the occurrence of such casualty; and (cc) not more than 45 days
after the occurrence of such casualty, Mortgagor delivers to Mortgagee
immediately available funds in an amount sufficient, in Mortgagee's reasonable
opinion, to pay all costs of the repair or restoration (including, without
limitation, taxes, financing charges, insurance and rent during the repair
period). So long as no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of
Mortgagee's receipt of such funds and no Default occurs thereafter, Mortgagee
shall make such funds available for the repair or restoration of the Property.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mortgagee shall have no obligation to make any
funds available for repair or restoration of the Property unless and until all
the conditions set forth in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the second sentence of
Section 6.11(b) of this Mortgage have been satisfied. Mortgagor acknowledges
that the specific conditions described above are reasonable.

            (vi) ADVERSE FINANCIAL CHANGE. Any material adverse change in the
financial condition of Borrower or any general partner or managing member of
Borrower, any guarantor, or any other person or entity from the condition shown
on the financial statement(s) submitted to Mortgagee and relied upon by
Mortgagee in making the Loan, and which change Mortgagee reasonably determines
will have a material adverse effect on (aa) the business, operations or
condition of the Property; or (bb) the ability of Borrower or Mortgagor to pay
or perform Borrower's or Mortgagor's obligations in accordance with the terms of
the Note, this Mortgage, and the other Loan Documents.

            (b) AUTOMATIC DEFAULT.  An "Automatic Default" shall occur
automatically upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

            (i) VOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY, INSOLVENCY, DISSOLUTION. (aa) Borrower's
filing a petition for relief under the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, as amended
or recodified ("Bankruptcy Code"), or under any other present or future state or
federal law regarding bankruptcy, reorganization or other relief to debtors
(collectively, "Debtor Relief Law"); or (bb) Borrower's filing any pleading in
any involuntary proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor Relief Law
which admits the jurisdiction of a court to regulate Borrower or the Property or
the petition's material allegations regarding Borrower's insolvency; or (cc)
Borrower's making a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (dd)
Borrower's applying for, or the appointment of, a receiver, trustee, custodian
or liquidator of Borrower or any of its property; or (ee) the filing by Borrower
of a petition seeking the liquidation or dissolution of Borrower or the
commencement of any other procedure to liquidate or dissolve Borrower.

            (ii) INVOLUNTARY BANKRUPTCY. Borrower's failure to effect a full
dismissal of any involuntary petition under the Bankruptcy Code or other Debtor
Relief Law that is filed against Borrower or in any way restrains or limits
Borrower or Mortgagee regarding the Loan or the Property, prior to the earlier
of the entry of any order granting relief sought in the involuntary petition or
45 days after the date of filing of the petition.

            (iii) PARTNERS, GUARANTORS. The occurrence of an event specified in
clauses (i) or (ii) as to Mortgagor, any general partner or managing member of
Borrower or Mortgagor,


                                    Page 27
<PAGE>
or any guarantor or other person or entity in any manner obligated to Mortgagee
under the Loan Documents.

            7.2 ACCELERATION. Upon the occurrence of an Optional Default,
Mortgagee may, at its option, declare all sums owing to Mortgagee under the Note
and the other Loan Documents immediately due and payable. Upon the occurrence of
an Automatic Default, all sums owing to Mortgagee under the Note and the other
Loan Documents shall automatically become immediately due and payable.

            7.3 RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. In addition to the rights and remedies in
Section 0 above, at any time after a Default, Mortgagee shall have all of the
following rights and remedies:

            (a) ENTRY ON PROPERTY. With or without notice, and without releasing
Mortgagor from any Secured Obligation, and without becoming a mortgagee in
possession, to enter upon the Property from time to time and to do such acts and
things as Mortgagee deems necessary or desirable in order to inspect,
investigate, assess and protect the security hereof or to cure any Default,
including, without limitation: (i) to take and possess all documents, books,
records, papers and accounts of Mortgagor, Borrower or the then owner of the
Property which relate to the Property; (ii) to make, terminate, enforce or
modify leases of the Property upon such terms and conditions as Mortgagee deems
proper; (iii) to make repairs, alterations and improvements to the Property
necessary, in Mortgagee's reasonable judgment, to protect or enhance the
security hereof; (iv) to appear in and defend any action or proceeding
purporting to affect the security hereof or the rights or powers of Mortgagee
hereunder; (v) to pay, purchase, contest or compromise any encumbrance, charge,
lien or claim of lien which, in the sole judgment of Mortgagee, is or may be
senior in priority hereto, the judgment of Mortgagee being conclusive as between
the parties hereto; (vi) to obtain insurance; (vii) to pay any premiums or
charges with respect to insurance required to be carried hereunder; (viii) to
obtain a court order to enforce Mortgagee's right to enter and inspect the
Property for Hazardous Materials, in which regard the decision of Mortgagee as
to whether there exists a release or threatened release of Hazardous Materials
onto the Property shall be deemed reasonable and conclusive as between the
parties hereto; (ix) to have a receiver appointed pursuant to applicable law to
enforce Mortgagee's rights to enter and inspect the Property for Hazardous
Materials; and/or (x) to employ legal counsel, accountants, engineers,
consultants, contractors and other appropriate persons to assist them;

            (b) APPOINTMENT OF RECEIVER. With or without notice or hearing, to
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for and obtain appointment of a
receiver, trustee, liquidator or conservator of the Property, for any purpose,
including, without limitation, to enforce Mortgagee's rights to collect Payments
and to enter on and inspect the Property for Hazardous Materials, as a matter of
strict right and without regard to: (i) the adequacy of the security for the
repayment of the Secured Obligations; (ii) the existence of a declaration that
the Secured Obligations are immediately due and payable; (iii) the filing of a
notice of default; or (iv) the solvency of Mortgagor, Borrower or any guarantor
or other person or entity in any manner obligated to Mortgagee under the Loan
Documents;


                                    Page 28
<PAGE>
            (c) INJUNCTION. To commence and maintain an action or actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to obtain specific enforcement of the covenants
of Mortgagor hereunder, and Mortgagor agrees that such covenants shall be
specifically enforceable by injunction or any other appropriate equitable remedy
and that for the purposes of any suit brought under this subparagraph, Mortgagor
waives the defense of laches and any applicable statute of limitations;

            (d) FORECLOSURE. Immediately commence an action to foreclose this
Mortgage or to specifically enforce its provisions or any of the indebtedness
secured hereby pursuant to the statutes in such case made and provided and sell
the Property or cause the Property to be sold in accordance with the
requirements and procedures provided by said statutes in a single parcel or in
several parcels at the option of Mortgagee.

            (i) In the event foreclosure proceedings are filed by Mortgagee, all
expenses incident to such proceeding, including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs, shall be paid by Mortgagor and secured by this
Mortgage and by all of the other Loan Documents securing all or any part of the
indebtedness evidenced by the Note. The secured indebtedness and all other
obligations secured by this Mortgage, including, without limitation, interest at
the Default Rate (as defined in the Note), any prepayment charge, fee or premium
required to be paid under the Note in order to prepay principal (to the extent
permitted by applicable law), reasonable attorneys' fees and any other amounts
due and unpaid to Mortgagee under the Loan Documents, may be bid by Mortgagee in
the event of a foreclosure sale hereunder. In the event of a judicial sale
pursuant to a foreclosure decree, it is understood and agreed that Mortgagee or
its assigns may become the purchaser of the Property or any part thereof.

            (ii) Mortgagee may, by following the procedures and satisfying the
requirements prescribed by applicable law, foreclose on only a portion of the
Property and, in such event, said foreclosure shall not affect the lien of this
Mortgage on the remaining portion of the Property foreclosed.

            Upon sale of the Property at any foreclosure, Mortgagee may credit
bid (as determined by Mortgagee in its sole and absolute discretion) all or any
portion of the Secured Obligations. In determining such credit bid, Mortgagee
may, but is not obligated to, take into account all or any of the following: (i)
appraisals of the Property as such appraisals may be discounted or adjusted by
Mortgagee in its sole and absolute underwriting discretion; (ii) expenses and
costs incurred by Mortgagee with respect to the Property prior to foreclosure;
(iii) expenses and costs which Mortgagee anticipates will be incurred with
respect to the Property after foreclosure, but prior to resale, including,
without limitation, costs of structural reports and other due diligence, costs
to carry the Property prior to resale, costs of resale (e.g. commissions,
attorneys' fees, and taxes), costs of any Hazardous Materials clean-up and
monitoring, costs of deferred maintenance, repair, refurbishment and retrofit,
costs of defending or settling litigation affecting the Property, and lost
opportunity costs (if any), including the time value of money during any
anticipated holding period by Mortgagee; (iv) declining trends in real property
values generally and with respect to properties similar to the Property; (v)
anticipated discounts upon resale of the Property as a distressed or foreclosed
property; (vi) the fact of additional collateral (if any), for the Secured
Obligations; and (vii) such other factors or matters that Mortgagee (in its sole
and absolute discretion) deems appropriate. In regard to the above, Mortgagor
acknowledges and


                                    Page 29
<PAGE>
agrees that: (viii) Mortgagee is not required to use any or all of the foregoing
factors to determine the amount of its credit bid; (ix) this paragraph does not
impose upon Mortgagee any additional obligations that are not imposed by law at
the time the credit bid is made; (x) the amount of Mortgagee's credit bid need
not have any relation to any loan-to-value ratios specified in the Loan
Documents or previously discussed between Mortgagor and Mortgagee; and (xi)
Mortgagee's credit bid may be (at Mortgagee's sole and absolute discretion)
higher or lower than any appraised value of the Property;

            (e) MULTIPLE FORECLOSURES. To resort to and realize upon the
security hereunder and any other security now or later held by Mortgagee
concurrently or successively and in one or several consolidated or independent
judicial actions and to apply the proceeds received upon the Secured Obligations
all in such order and manner as Mortgagee determines in its sole discretion;

            (f) RIGHTS TO COLLATERAL.  To exercise all rights Mortgagee may have
with respect to the Collateral under this Mortgage, the UCC or otherwise at law;
and

            (g) OTHER RIGHTS.  To exercise such other rights as Mortgagee may
have at law or in equity or pursuant to the terms and conditions of this
Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents.

            In connection with any sale or sales hereunder, Mortgagee may elect
to treat any of the Property which consists of a right in action or which is
property that can be severed from the Property (including, without limitation,
any improvements forming a part thereof) without causing structural damage
thereto as if the same were personal property or a fixture, as the case may be,
and dispose of the same in accordance with applicable law, separate and apart
from the sale of the Property. Any sale of Collateral hereunder shall be
conducted in any manner permitted by the UCC.

            7.4 APPLICATION OF FORECLOSURE SALE PROCEEDS. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, proceeds of any sale under this Mortgage shall be applied to
the extent funds are so available to the following items in such order as
Mortgagee in its discretion may determine:

            (a) To payment of the costs, expenses and fees of taking possession
of the Property, and of holding, operating, maintaining, using, leasing,
repairing, improving, marketing and selling the same and of otherwise enforcing
Mortgagee's right and remedies hereunder and under the other Loan Documents,
including, but not limited to, receivers' fees, court costs, reasonable
attorneys', accountants', appraisers', managers', and other professional fees,
title charges and transfer taxes.

            (b) To payment of all sums expended by Mortgagee under the terms of
any of the Loan Documents and not yet repaid, together with interest on such
sums at the Default Rate.

            (c) To payment of the secured indebtedness and all other obligations
secured by this Mortgage, including, without limitation, interest at the Default
Rate and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any prepayment fee, charge
or premium required to be paid under the Note in order to prepay principal, in
any order that Mortgagee chooses in its sole discretion.


                                    Page 30
<PAGE>
            7.5 WAIVER OF MARSHALING RIGHTS. Mortgagor, for itself and for all
parties claiming through or under Mortgagor, and for all parties who may acquire
a lien on or interest in the Property, hereby waives all rights to have the
Property and/or any other property, including, without limitation, the
Collateral, which is now or later may be security for any Secured Obligation,
marshaled upon any foreclosure of this Mortgage or on a foreclosure of any other
security for any of the Secured Obligations.

            7.6 NO CURE OR WAIVER. Neither Mortgagee's nor any receiver's entry
upon and taking possession of all or any part of the Property, nor any
collection of rents, issues, profits, insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds
or damages, other security or proceeds of other security, or other sums, nor the
application of any collected sum to any Secured Obligation, nor the exercise of
any other right or remedy by Mortgagee or any receiver shall cure or waive any
Default or notice of default under this Mortgage, or nullify the effect of any
notice of default or sale (unless all Secured Obligations then due have been
paid or performed and Mortgagor has cured all other Defaults hereunder), or
impair the status of the security, or prejudice Mortgagee in the exercise of any
right or remedy, or be construed as an affirmation by Mortgagee of any tenancy,
lease or option or a subordination of the lien of this Mortgage.

            7.7 PAYMENT OF COSTS, EXPENSES AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. Mortgagor agrees
to pay to Mortgagee immediately and upon demand all costs and expenses incurred
by Mortgagee in the enforcement of the terms and conditions of this Mortgage
(including, without limitation, court costs and attorneys' fees, whether
incurred in litigation or not) with interest from the date of expenditure until
said sums have been paid at the rate of interest applicable to the principal
balance of the Note as specified therein.

            7.8 POWER TO FILE NOTICES AND CURE DEFAULTS. Mortgagor hereby
irrevocably appoints Mortgagee and its successors and assigns, as its
attorney-in-fact, which agency is coupled with an interest, to perform any
obligation of Mortgagor hereunder upon the occurrence of an event, act or
omission which, with notice or passage of time or both, would constitute a
Default, provided, however, that: (a) Mortgagee as such attorney-in-fact shall
only be accountable for such funds as are actually received by Mortgagee; and
(b) Mortgagee shall not be liable to Mortgagor or any other person or entity for
any failure to act under this Section.

            7.9 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. All rights and remedies of Mortgagee
provided hereunder are cumulative and are in addition to all rights and remedies
provided by applicable law (including specifically that of foreclosure of this
instrument as though it were a mortgage) or in any other agreements between
Mortgagor and Mortgagee. Mortgagee may enforce any one or more remedies or
rights hereunder successively or concurrently.


                    ARTICLE VIII. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

            8.1 ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. The Loan Documents contain or incorporate
by reference the entire agreement of the parties with respect to matters
contemplated herein and supersede all prior negotiations. The Loan Documents
grant further rights to Mortgagee and contain further agreements and affirmative
and negative covenants by Mortgagor which apply to this Mortgage and to the
Property and such further rights and agreements are incorporated herein by this
reference. THE OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITIES OF MORTGAGOR UNDER THIS


                                    Page 31
<PAGE>
MORTGAGE AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE
SECTION IN THE NOTE ENTITLED "BORROWER'S LIABILITY."

            8.2 NON-WAIVER. By accepting payment of any amount secured hereby
after its due date or late performance of any other Secured Obligation,
Mortgagee shall not waive its right against any person obligated directly or
indirectly hereunder or on any Secured Obligation, either to require prompt
payment or performance when due of all other sums and obligations so secured or
to declare default for failure to make such prompt payment or performance. No
exercise of any right or remedy by Mortgagee hereunder shall constitute a waiver
of any other right or remedy herein contained or provided by law. No failure by
Mortgagee to exercise any right or remedy hereunder arising upon any Default
shall be construed to prejudice Mortgagee's rights or remedies upon the
occurrence of any other or subsequent Default. No delay by Mortgagee in
exercising any such right or remedy shall be construed to preclude Mortgagee
from the exercise thereof at any time while that Default is continuing. No
notice to nor demand on Mortgagor shall of itself entitle Mortgagor to any other
or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

            8.3 CONSENTS, APPROVALS AND EXPENSES. Wherever Mortgagee's consent,
approval, acceptance or satisfaction is required under any provision of this
Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, such consent, approval, acceptance
or satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed by
Mortgagee unless such provision expressly so provides. Wherever costs or
expenses are required to be paid under any provision of this Mortgage or any of
the other Loan Documents, such costs or expenses shall be reasonable.

            8.4 PERMITTED CONTESTS. After prior written notice to Mortgagee,
Mortgagor may contest, by appropriate legal or other proceedings conducted in
good faith and with due diligence, the amount, validity or application, in whole
or in part, of any lien, levy, tax or assessment, or any lien of any laborer,
mechanic, materialman, supplier or vendor, or the application to Mortgagor or
the Property of any law or the validity thereof, the assertion or imposition of
which, or the failure to pay when due, would constitute a Default; provided that
(a) Mortgagor pursues the contest diligently, in a manner which Mortgagee
determines is not prejudicial to Mortgagee, and does not impair the lien of this
Mortgage; (b) the Property, or any part hereof or estate or interest therein,
shall not be in any danger of being sold, forfeited or lost by reason of such
proceedings; (c) in the case of the contest of any law or other legal
requirement, Mortgagee shall not be in any danger of any civil or criminal
liability; and (d) if required by Mortgagee, Mortgagor deposits with Mortgagee
any funds or other forms of assurance (including a bond or letter of credit)
satisfactory to Mortgagee to protect Mortgagee from the consequences of the
contest being unsuccessful. Mortgagor's right to contest pursuant to the terms
of this provision shall in no way relieve Mortgagor or Borrower of its
obligations under the Loan or to make payments to Mortgagee as and when due.

            8.5 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Mortgagor shall, upon demand by Mortgagee,
execute, acknowledge (if appropriate) and deliver any and all documents and
instruments and do or cause to be done all further acts reasonably necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the provisions hereof.


                                    Page 32
<PAGE>
            8.6 ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any legal action, suit or proceeding is
commenced between Mortgagor and Mortgagee regarding their respective rights and
obligations under this Mortgage or any of the other Loan Documents, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to damages or other
relief, costs and expenses, reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs
(including, without limitation, expert witness fees). As used herein the term
"prevailing party" shall mean the party which obtains the principal relief it
has sought, whether by compromise settlement or judgment. If the party which
commenced or instituted the action, suit or proceeding shall dismiss or
discontinue it without the concurrence of the other party, such other party
shall be deemed the prevailing party.

            8.7 MORTGAGOR AND MORTGAGEE DEFINED. The term "Mortgagor" includes
both the original Mortgagor and any subsequent owner or owners of any of the
Property, and the term "Mortgagee" includes the original Mortgagee and any
future owner or holder, including assignees, pledgees and participants, of the
Note or any interest therein.

            8.8 DISCLAIMERS.

            (a) RELATIONSHIP. The relationship of Mortgagor and Mortgagee under
this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents is, and shall at all times remain,
solely that of borrower and lender; and Mortgagee neither undertakes nor assumes
any responsibility or duty to Mortgagor or to any third party with respect to
the Property. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents: (i) Mortgagee is not, and shall not be construed to be, a
partner, joint venturer, member, alter ego, manager, controlling person or other
business associate or participant of any kind of Mortgagor, and Mortgagee does
not intend to ever assume such status; (ii) Mortgagee's activities in connection
with this Mortgage and the other Loan Documents shall not be "outside the scope
of activities of a lender of money" within the meaning of California Civil Code
Section 3434, as amended or recodified from time to time, and Mortgagee does not
intend to ever assume any responsibility to any person for the quality,
suitability, safety or condition of the Property; and (iii) Mortgagee shall not
be deemed responsible for or a participant in any acts, omissions or decisions
of Mortgagor.

            (b) NO LIABILITY. Mortgagee shall not be directly or indirectly
liable or responsible for any loss, claim, cause of action, liability,
indebtedness, damage or injury of any kind or character to any person or
property arising from any construction on, or occupancy or use of, the Property,
whether caused by or arising from: (i) any defect in any building, structure,
grading, fill, landscaping or other improvements thereon or in any on-site or
off-site improvement or other facility therein or thereon; (ii) any act or
omission of Mortgagor or any of Mortgagor's agents, employees, independent
contractors, licensees or invitees; (iii) any accident in or on the Property or
any fire, flood or other casualty or hazard thereon; (iv) the failure of
Mortgagor or any of Mortgagor's licensees, employees, invitees, agents,
independent contractors or other representatives to maintain the Property in a
safe condition; or (v) any nuisance made or suffered on any part of the
Property.

            8.9 SEVERABILITY. If any term of this Mortgage, or the application
thereof to any person or circumstances, shall, to any extent, be invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Mortgage, or the application of such term
to persons or circumstances other than those as to


                                    Page 33
<PAGE>
which it is invalid or unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each
term of this Mortgage shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent
permitted by law.

            8.10 RELATIONSHIP OF ARTICLES. The rights, remedies and interests of
Mortgagee under the Mortgage established by Article 1 and the security agreement
established by Article 4 are independent and cumulative, and there shall be no
merger of any lien created by the Mortgage with any security interest created by
the security agreement. Mortgagee may elect to exercise or enforce any of its
rights, remedies or interests under either or both the Mortgage or the security
agreement as Mortgagee may from time to time deem appropriate. The absolute
assignment of rents and leases established by Article 3 is similarly independent
of and separate from the Mortgage and the security agreement.

            8.11 MERGER. No merger shall occur as a result of Mortgagee's
acquiring any other estate in, or any other lien on, the Property unless
Mortgagee consents to a merger in writing.

            8.12  OBLIGATIONS OF MORTGAGOR, JOINT AND SEVERAL.  If more than
one person has executed this Mortgage as "Mortgagor", the obligations of all
such persons hereunder shall be joint and several.

            8.13 SEPARATE AND COMMUNITY PROPERTY. Any married person who
executes this Mortgage as a Mortgagor agrees that any money judgment which
Mortgagee obtains pursuant to the terms of this Mortgage or any other obligation
of that married person secured by this Mortgage may be collected by execution
upon any separate property or community property of that person.

            8.14 INTEGRATION; INTERPRETATION. The Loan Documents contain or
expressly incorporate by reference the entire agreement of the parties with
respect to the matters contemplated therein and supersede all prior negotiations
or agreements, written or oral. The Loan Documents shall not be modified except
by written instrument executed by all parties. Any reference in any of the Loan
Documents to the Property or Collateral shall include all or any part of the
Property or Collateral. Any reference to the Loan Documents includes any
amendments, renewals or extensions now or hereafter approved by Mortgagee in
writing. When the identity of the parties or other circumstances make it
appropriate, the masculine gender includes the feminine and/or neuter, and the
singular number includes the plural.

            8.15  CAPITALIZED TERMS.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Note.

            8.16 SUCCESSORS IN INTEREST. The terms, covenants, and conditions
herein contained shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors and assigns of the parties hereto. The foregoing sentence shall not
be construed to permit Mortgagor to assign the Loan except as otherwise
permitted under the Note or the other Loan Documents.

            8.17 GOVERNING LAW. This Mortgage was accepted by Mortgagee in the
state of California and the proceeds of the Note secured hereby were disbursed
from the state of California, which state the parties agree has a substantial
relationship to the parties and to the underlying transaction embodied hereby.
Accordingly, in all respects, including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, matters of construction, validity, enforceability and


                                    Page 34
<PAGE>
performance, this Mortgage, the Note and the other Loan Documents and the
obligations arising hereunder and thereunder shall be governed by, and construed
in accordance with, the laws of the state of California applicable to contracts
made and performed in such state and any applicable law of the United States of
America, except that at all times the provisions for the creation, perfection
and enforcement of the liens and security interests created pursuant thereto and
pursuant to the other Loan Documents shall be governed by and construed
according to the law of the state where the Property is located. Except as
provided in the immediately preceding sentence, Mortgagor hereby unconditionally
and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claim to
assert that the law of any jurisdiction other than California governs this
Mortgage, the Note and other Loan Documents.

            8.18 CONSENT TO JURISDICTION. Mortgagor irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of: (a) any state or federal court sitting in the state of
California over any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by Mortgagor against
Mortgagee, arising out of or relating to this Mortgage, the Note or the Loan;
(b) any state or federal court sitting in the state where the Property is
located or the state in which Mortgagor's principal place of business is located
over any suit, action or proceeding, brought by Mortgagee against Mortgagor,
arising out of or relating to this Mortgage, the Note or the Loan; and (c) any
state court sitting in the county of the state where the Property is located
over any suit, action, or proceeding, brought by Mortgagee to foreclose this
Mortgage or any action brought by Mortgagee to enforce its rights with respect
to the Collateral. Mortgagor irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that Mortgagor may now or hereafter have to the laying of
venue of any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such court and any
claim that any such suit, action, or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum.

            8.19  EXHIBITS.  Exhibit A is incorporated into this Mortgage by
this reference.

    CALCULATION OF DOCUMENTARY STAMP AND INTANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY TAX

Exhibit B to MORTGAGE AND ABSOLUTE ASSIGNMENT OF RENTS AND LEASES AND SECURITY
AGREEMENT (AND FIXTURE FILING) ("Mortgage") between MHC STAGECOACH, L.L.C., a
Delaware limited liability company, as "Mortgagor," and WELLS FARGO BANK,
NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as "Mortgagee."

      This Mortgage is part of an out-of-state loan transaction which only
partially secures the loan. This Mortgage encumbers the property described on
Exhibit A, and separate mortgages are being executed and delivered by Mortgagor
encumbering certain other property located in Florida and in other states (such
other property being further described on Exhibit C and being referred to as the
"Other Property"). The Florida collateral is located in Brevard, Volusia and
Manatee Counties, and three (3) separate mortgages (the Florida Mortgages")
encumbering three (3) properties are being executed and delivered by Mortgagor
for simultaneous recording in the various Florida counties described above. The
total indebtedness secured by this Mortgage equals $50,000,000.00, as evidenced
by one (1) promissory note in the aggregate original principal amount of
$50,000,000.00 (the "Note"). The Note was made, executed and delivered outside
the State of Florida. The value of the Florida property encumbered by the
Florida Mortgages equals $27,200,000.00. The aggregate value of all other
property securing the loan and located outside the State of Florida equals
$50,400,000.00. Thus, the total aggregate value of all property securing the
loan equals $77,600,000.00. The property encumbered by the Florida Mortgages and
located in Florida represents thirty-five (35%) percent [$27,200,000.00 /
$77,600,000.00] of the total value of all property securing the loan. In
accordance with Florida Statutes, Section 201.08, and Florida Administrative
Code, Rule 12B-4.053(32)(b), documentary stamp tax is computed based upon the
percentage of indebtedness which the value of the mortgaged property located in
Florida bears to the total value of all mortgaged property (which, in this case,
equals $17,500,000.00). Accordingly, documentary stamp tax in the amount of
$61,250.00 is due upon the recording of the Florida Mortgages in the Florida
counties listed above. Pursuant to Chapter 199, Florida Statutes, non-recurring
intangible personal property tax is computed and payable based upon that portion
of the indebtedness which bears the same relation as the value of the mortgaged
property located in Florida bears to the total value of all mortgaged property,
which, in this case, equals [$50,000,000.00 x ($27,200,000.00 /
$77,600,000.00)]. Thus, non-recurring intangible personal property tax in the
amount of $35,000.00 is due and payable upon recording of the Florida Mortgages
in the Florida counties listed above.
