ITEM 1. BUSINESS

                        EQUITY LIFESTYLE PROPERTIES, INC.

GENERAL

     Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with
MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") and other
consolidated subsidiaries ("Subsidiaries"), is referred to herein as the
"Company", "ELS", "we", "us", and "our". The Company is a fully integrated owner
and operator of resort and retirement oriented properties ("Properties"). The
Company leases individual developed areas ("sites" or "pads") with access to
utilities for placement of factory built homes or recreational vehicles. The
Company was formed to continue the property operations, business objectives and
acquisition strategies of an entity that had owned and operated Properties since
1969. As of December 31, 2004, we owned or had an ownership interest in a
portfolio of 275 Properties located throughout the United States containing
101,231 residential sites. These Properties are located in 25 states and British
Columbia (with the number of Properties in each state shown parenthetically) -
Florida (84), California (46), Arizona (35), Texas (15), Washington (13),
Colorado (10), Oregon (9), Delaware (7), Indiana (7), Pennsylvania (7), Nevada
(6), North Carolina (6), Wisconsin (5), Virginia (4), Illinois (3), Iowa (2),
Michigan (2), New Jersey (2), Ohio (2), South Carolina (2), Tennessee (2), Utah
(2), Montana (1), New Mexico (1), New York (1), and British Columbia (1).

     Properties are designed and improved for several home options of various
sizes and designs that are produced off-site, installed and set ("Site Set").
These homes can range from 400 to over 2,000 square feet. The smallest of these
are referred to as "Resort Cottages". Properties may also have pads that can
accommodate a variety of recreational vehicles ("RVs"). Properties generally
contain centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs and gutters and parkways. In
addition, Properties often provide a clubhouse for social activities and
recreation and other amenities, which may include restaurants, swimming pools,
golf courses, lawn bowling, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, laundry
facilities and cable television service. In some cases, utilities are provided
or arranged for by us; otherwise, the customer contracts for the utility
directly. Some Properties provide water and sewer service through municipal or
regulated utilities, while others provide these services to customers from
on-site facilities. Properties generally are designed to attract retirees,
empty-nesters, vacationers and second home owners; however, certain of the
Properties focus on affordable housing for families. We focus on owning
Properties in or near large metropolitan markets and retirement and vacation
destinations.

     On November 10, 2004, we acquired KTTI Holding Company, Inc., owner of 57
Properties and approximately 3,000 acres of vacant land, for $160 million. These
Properties are leased to Thousand Trails Operations Holding Company, L.P.
("Thousand Trails"), the largest operator of membership-based campgrounds in the
United States. The Company has provided a long-term lease of the real estate
(excluding the vacant land) to Thousand Trails, which will continue to operate
the Properties for the benefit of over 100,000 members nationwide. These
Properties are located in 16 states (primarily in the western and southern
United States) and British Columbia, and contain 17,911 sites. The lease will
generate $16 million in annual rental income to the Company on an absolute
triple net basis, subject to annual escalations of 3.25%.

EMPLOYEE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE

     We have approximately 1,500 full-time, part-time and seasonal employees
dedicated to carrying out our operating philosophy and strategies of value
enhancement and service to our customers. The operations of each Property are
coordinated by an on-site team of employees that typically includes a manager or
two-person management team, clerical and maintenance workers, each of whom works
to provide maintenance and care of the Properties. Direct supervision of on-site
management is the responsibility of our regional vice presidents and regional
and district managers. These individuals have significant experience in
addressing the needs of customers and in finding or creating innovative
approaches to maximize value and increase cash flow from property operations.
Complementing this field management staff are approximately 70 corporate
employees who assist on-site management in all property functions.

FORMATION OF THE COMPANY

     We originally incorporated as Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. in
Maryland in December 1992 and completed an initial public offering in March
1993. On November 16, 2004, we changed our name to Equity Lifestyle Properties,
Inc.

     We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a real estate investment
trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended
December 31, 1993. We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as
a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.
We cannot, therefore,


                                       3
<PAGE>
guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a REIT. The
determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters
that may not be totally within our control and we cannot provide any assurance
that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") will agree with our analysis. For
example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from
sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. We are also required to
distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income excluding
capital gains. The fact that we hold our assets through MHC Operating Limited
Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT
requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT
status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and
regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult,
or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT. We do not believe, however,
that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

     If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax
at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain
statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years
following the year we first failed to qualify. Even if the Company qualifies for
taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on
its income and property and Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed
income.

     The operations of the Company are conducted primarily through the Operating
Partnership. The Company contributed the proceeds from its initial public
offering and subsequent offerings to the Operating Partnership for a general
partnership interest. In 2004, the general partnership interest was contributed
to MHC Trust (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
contained in this Form 10-K). The financial results of the Operating Partnership
and the Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial
statements. In addition, since certain activities, if performed by the Company,
may not be qualifying REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), the Company has formed taxable REIT subsidiaries as
defined in the Code to engage in such activities.

     Several Properties acquired during 2004 are wholly owned by taxable REIT
subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI") is a
wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company that, doing business as
Carefree Sales, is engaged in the business of purchasing, selling and leasing
site set homes that are located in Properties owned and managed by the Company.
Carefree Sales also provides brokerage services to residents at such Properties.
Typically, residents move from a Property but do not relocate their homes.
Carefree Sales may provide brokerage services, in competition with other local
brokers, by seeking buyers for the site set homes. Carefree Sales also leases
inventory homes to prospective residents with the expectation that the tenant
eventually will purchase the home. Subsidiaries of RSI also lease from the
Operating Partnership certain real property within or adjacent to certain
Properties consisting of golf courses, pro shops, stores and restaurants.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND OPERATING STRATEGIES

     Our strategy seeks to maximize both current income and long-term growth in
income. We focus on Properties that have strong cash flow and we expect to hold
such Properties for long-term investment and capital appreciation. In
determining cash flow potential, we evaluate our ability to attract and retain
high quality customers in our Properties who take pride in the Property and in
their home. These business objectives and their implementation are determined by
our Board of Directors and may be changed at any time. Our investment, operating
and financing approach includes:

     -    Providing consistently high levels of services and amenities in
          attractive surroundings to foster a strong sense of community and
          pride of home ownership;

     -    Efficiently managing the Properties to increase operating margins by
          controlling expenses, increasing occupancy and maintaining competitive
          market rents;

     -    Increasing income and property values by continuing the strategic
          expansion and, where appropriate, renovation of the Properties;

     -    Utilizing management information systems to evaluate potential
          acquisitions, identify and track competing Properties and monitor
          customer satisfaction;

     -    Selectively acquiring Properties that have potential for long-term
          cash flow growth and to create property concentrations in and around
          major metropolitan areas and retirement or vacation destinations to
          capitalize on operating synergies and incremental efficiencies; and


                                       4
<PAGE>
     -    Managing our debt balances such that we maintain financial
          flexibility, minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations, and
          maintain an appropriate degree of leverage to maximize return on
          capital.

     Our strategy is to own and operate the highest quality Properties in
sought-after locations near urban areas, retirement and vacation destinations
across the United States. We focus on creating an attractive residential
environment by providing a well-maintained, comfortable Property with a variety
of organized recreational and social activities and superior amenities as well
as offering a multitude of lifestyle housing choices. In addition, we regularly
conduct evaluations of the cost of housing in the marketplaces in which our
Properties are located and survey rental rates of competing Properties. From
time to time we also conduct satisfaction surveys of our customers to determine
the factors they consider most important in choosing a Property.

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

     Over the last nine years our portfolio of Properties has grown
significantly. We owned or had an interest in 40 Properties with approximately
12,000 sites in 1996. Today we have 275 Properties with over 100,000 sites. We
continually review the Properties in our portfolio to ensure that they fit our
business objectives. Between 1999 and 2003, we sold 26 Properties, and we
redeployed capital to markets we believe had greater long-term potential. In
2004, we purchased or acquired interests in 135 Properties containing
approximately 50,000 sites. We believe that opportunities for Property
acquisitions are still available. Increasing acceptability of and demand for a
lifestyle that includes Site Set homes and RVs as well as continued constraints
on development of new Properties continue to add to their attractiveness as an
investment. We believe we have a competitive advantage in the acquisition of
additional Properties due to our experienced management, significant presence in
major real estate markets and substantial capital resources. We are actively
seeking to acquire additional Properties and are engaged in various stages of
negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of a number of Properties.

     We anticipate that newly acquired Properties will be located in the United
States, although we may consider other geographic locations provided they meet
our acquisition criteria. We utilize market information systems to identify and
evaluate acquisition opportunities, including a market database to review the
primary economic indicators of the various locations in which we expect to
expand our operations. Acquisitions will be financed from the most appropriate
sources of capital, which may include undistributed funds from operations,
issuance of additional equity securities, sales of investments, collateralized
and uncollateralized borrowings and issuance of debt securities. In addition,
the Operating Partnership may issue units of limited partnership interest ("OP
Units") to finance acquisitions. We believe that an ownership structure that
includes the Operating Partnership will permit us to acquire additional
Properties in transactions that may defer all or a portion of the sellers' tax
consequences.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we consider such factors as:

     -    The replacement cost of the Property,

     -    The geographic area and type of Property,

     -    The location, construction quality, condition and design of the
          Property,

     -    The current and projected cash flow of the Property and the ability to
          increase cash flow,

     -    The potential for capital appreciation of the Property,

     -    The terms of tenant leases, including the potential for rent
          increases,

     -    The potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
          environment of the community in which the Property is located,

     -    The potential for expansion of the physical layout of the Property and
          the number of sites and/or pads,

     -    The occupancy and demand by customers for Properties of a similar type
          in the vicinity and the customers' profile,

     -    The prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of
          the Property, and

     -    The competition from existing Properties and the potential for the
          construction of new Properties in the area.

When evaluating potential dispositions, we consider such factors as:

     -    The ability to sell the Property at a price that we believe will
          provide an appropriate return for our stockholders,

     -    Our desire to exit certain non-core markets and recycle the capital
          into core markets, and

     -    Whether the Property meets our current investment criteria.

     When investing capital we consider all potential uses of the capital
including returning capital to our stockholders. As a result, during 1999 and
2000 we implemented our stock repurchase program, and our Board of Directors
continues


                                       5
<PAGE>
to review the conditions under which we will repurchase our stock. These
conditions include, but are not limited to, market price, balance sheet
flexibility, other opportunities and capital requirements. On January 16, 2004
we paid a special dividend of $8.00 per share using proceeds from a
recapitalization (see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Financing Activities).

PROPERTY EXPANSIONS

     Several of our Properties have available land for expanding the number of
sites available to be utilized by our customers. Development of these sites
("Expansion Sites") is predicated by local market conditions and permitted by
zoning and other applicable laws. When justified, development of Expansion Sites
allows us to leverage existing facilities and amenities to increase the income
generated from the Properties. Where appropriate, facilities and amenities may
be upgraded or added to certain Properties to make those Properties more
attractive in their markets. Our acquisition philosophy has included the desire
to own Properties with potential Expansion Site development, and we have been
successful in acquiring a number of such Properties. Examples of these
Properties include the 1993 acquisition of The Heritage with potential
development of approximately 288 Expansion Sites, the 1994 acquisition of Bulow
Plantation with potential development of approximately 725 Expansion Sites, the
1997 acquisition of Golf Vista Estates with potential development of
approximately 88 Expansion Sites, the 1999 acquisition of Coquina Crossing with
potential development of approximately 300 Expansion Sites, and the 2001
acquisitions of Grand Island and The Lakes at Countrywood with combined
potential development of approximately 224 Expansion Sites. In 2004 we acquired
several Properties with potential Expansion Sites, including O'Connell's with
approximately 350 Expansion Sites, Monte Vista with 418 Expansion Sites and
Viewpoint with 566 Expansion Sites. In addition, included in the purchase of the
Thousand Trails Properties are 3,000 acres available for expansion.

     Approximately 40 of our Properties have expansion potential. In 2005, we
expect to commence development of approximately 750 Expansion Sites within five
of these Properties. As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 815 Expansion
Sites available for occupancy in 26 of the Properties. We filled 112 Expansion
Sites in 2004 and expect to fill an additional 150 Expansion Sites in 2005.

LEASES

     At our Properties, a typical lease entered into between the customer and
the Company for the rental of a site is for a month-to-month or year-to-year
term, renewable upon the consent of both parties or, in some instances, as
provided by statute. These leases are cancelable, depending on applicable law,
for non-payment of rent, violation of Property rules and regulations or other
specified defaults. Non-cancelable long-term leases, with remaining terms
ranging up to ten years, are in effect at certain sites within 37 of the
Properties. Some of these leases are subject to rental rate increases based on
the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), in some instances taking into consideration
certain floors and ceilings and allowing for pass-throughs of certain items such
as real estate taxes, utility expenses and capital expenditures. Generally,
market rate adjustments are made on an annual basis. At resort-oriented
Properties, many annual and seasonal customers generally prepay for their stay.
Many resort customers will also leave deposits to reserve a site for the
following year.

REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE

     General. Our Properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and
regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as
swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas. We believe that each Property
has the necessary permits and approvals to operate.

     Rent Control Legislation. At certain of our Properties, state and local
rent control laws, principally in California, limit our ability to increase
rents and to recover increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital
improvements. Enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time in
other jurisdictions. We presently expect to continue to maintain Properties, and
may purchase additional Properties, in markets that are either subject to rent
control or in which rent-limiting legislation exists or may be enacted. For
example, Florida has enacted a law that generally provides that rental increases
must be reasonable. Also, certain jurisdictions in California in which we own
Properties limit rent increases to changes in the CPI or some percentage
thereof. As part of our effort to realize the value of our Properties subject to
restrictive regulation, we have initiated lawsuits against several
municipalities imposing such regulation in an attempt to balance the interests
of our stockholders with the interests of our customers (see Item 3 - Legal
Proceedings).

     Insurance. We believe that the Properties are covered by adequate fire,
flood, property, earthquake and business interruption insurance (where
appropriate) provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable
deductibles and limits. Due to the lack of available commercially reasonable
coverage, we are self-insured for terrorist incidents, except at certain
Properties where terrorist insurance coverage is required by debt covenants. We


                                       6
<PAGE>
believe our insurance coverage is adequate based on our assessment of the risks
to be insured, the probability of loss and the relative cost of available
coverage. We have obtained insurance insuring good title to the Properties in an
aggregate amount that we believe to be adequate. Approximately 70 Florida
Properties suffered damage from the four hurricanes that struck Florida during
August and September 2004. As of December 31, 2004, total expenditures
approximated $7 million. Approximately $1 million has been charged to operations
as non-recoverable. The remaining portion is included in other assets as a
receivable from insurance providers. The Company expects to incur additional
expenditures to complete the work necessary to restore these Properties to their
pre-hurricanes condition. As of February 18, 2005, approximately $6 million of
these claims have been submitted for reimbursement.

                                    INDUSTRY

     We believe that modern properties similar to ours provide an opportunity
for increased cash flows and appreciation in value. These may be achieved
through increases in occupancy rates and rents, as well as expense controls,
expansion of existing Properties and opportunistic acquisitions, for the
following reasons:

     -    Barriers to Entry: We believe that the supply of new properties will
          be constrained due to barriers to entry. The most significant barrier
          has been the difficulty of securing zoning from local authorities.
          This has been the result of (i) the public's historically poor
          perception of manufactured housing, and (ii) the fact that properties
          generate less tax revenue because the homes are treated as personal
          property (a benefit to the homeowner) rather than real property.
          Another factor that creates substantial barriers to entry is the
          length of time between investment in a property's development and the
          attainment of stabilized occupancy and the generation of revenues. The
          initial development of the infrastructure may take up to two or three
          years. Once a property is ready for occupancy, it may be difficult to
          attract customers to an empty property. Substantial occupancy levels
          may take several years to achieve.

     -    Industry Consolidation: According to various industry reports, there
          are approximately 65,000 properties in the United States, and
          approximately 6.0% or approximately 4,000 of the properties have more
          than 200 sites and would be considered investment-grade. We believe
          that this relatively high degree of fragmentation provides us, as a
          national organization with experienced management and substantial
          financial resources, the opportunity to purchase additional
          properties.

     -    Customer Base: We believe that properties tend to achieve and maintain
          a stable rate of occupancy due to the following factors: (i) customers
          typically own their own homes, (ii) properties tend to foster a sense
          of community as a result of amenities such as clubhouses and
          recreational and social activities, (iii) since moving a Site Set home
          from one property to another involves substantial cost and effort,
          customers often sell their home in-place (similar to site-built
          residential housing) with no interruption of rental payments to us.

     -    Lifestyle Choice: According to the Recreational Vehicle Industry
          Association nearly 1 in 12 United States vehicle-owning households
          owns an RV. The 80 million people born from 1945 to 1964 or "baby
          boomers" make up the fastest growing segment of this market. We
          believe that this population segment, seeking an active lifestyle,
          will provide opportunities for future cash flow growth for the
          Company. Current RV owners, once finished with the more active RV
          lifestyle, will seek more permanent retirement or vacation
          establishments. The Site Set housing choice has become an increasingly
          popular housing alternative for retirement, second-home, and
          "empty-nest" living. According to a Fannie Mae survey, the baby-boom
          generation will constitute 18% of the U.S. population within the next
          30 years and more than 32 million people will reach age 55 within the
          next ten years. Among those individuals who are nearing retirement
          (age 40 to 54), approximately 33% plan on moving upon retirement.

          We believe that the housing choices in our properties are especially
          attractive to such individuals throughout this lifestyle cycle. Our
          Properties offer an appealing amenity package, close proximity to
          local services, social activities, low maintenance and a secure
          environment. In fact, many of our Properties allow for this cycle to
          occur within a single Property.

     -    Construction Quality: Since 1976, all factory built housing has been
          required to meet stringent Federal standards, resulting in significant
          increases in quality. The Department of Housing and Urban
          Development's ("HUD") standards for Site Set housing construction
          quality are the only Federally regulated standards governing housing
          quality of any type in the United States. Site Set homes produced
          since 1976 have received a "red and silver" government seal certifying
          that they were built in compliance with the Federal code. The code
          regulates Site Set home design and construction, strength and
          durability, fire resistance and energy


                                       7
<PAGE>
          efficiency, and the installation and performance of heating, plumbing,
          air conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. In newer homes, top
          grade lumber and dry wall materials are common. Also, manufacturers
          are required to follow the same fire codes as builders of site-built
          structures. In addition, although Resort Cottages do not come under
          the same regulation, many of the manufacturers of Site Set homes also
          produce Resort Cottages with many of the same quality standards.

     -    Comparability to Site-Built Homes: The Site Set housing industry has
          experienced a trend towards multi-section homes. Many modern Site Set
          homes are longer (up to 80 feet, compared to 50 feet in the 1960's)
          and wider than earlier models. Many such homes have vaulted ceilings,
          fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms, and closely resemble
          single-family ranch style site-built homes.

     -    Second Home Demographics: According to the National Association of
          Realtors ("NAR"), sales of second homes have risen almost 54.5% since
          1989. There were approximately 9.2 million second homes owned in 2003
          and approximately 6% of all home sales each year are second homes. The
          NAR study found that 48% of people who own a second home own either a
          cabin or Site Set home. Approximately 76% of vacation home owners
          prefer to be near an ocean, river or lake; 38% close to mountains or
          other natural attractions, and 37% in a specific vacation area. In
          looking ahead NAR believes that baby boomers are still in their peak
          earning years, and the leading edge of their generation is approaching
          retirement. As they continue to have the financial wherewithal to
          purchase second homes as a vacation property, investment opportunity,
          or perhaps as a retirement retreat, those baby boomers will continue
          to drive the market for second-homes. It is likely that over the next
          decade we will continue to see historically high levels of second home
          sales.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

GENERAL

     Our Properties provide attractive amenities and common facilities that
create a comfortable and attractive home for our customers, with most offering a
clubhouse, a swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television service.
Many also offer additional amenities such as sauna/whirlpool spas, golf courses,
tennis, shuffleboard and basketball courts, exercise rooms and various social
activities such as concerts. Since most of our customers generally rent our
sites on a long-term basis, it is their responsibility to maintain their homes
and the surrounding area. It is our role to ensure that customers comply with
our Property policies and to provide maintenance of the common areas, facilities
and amenities. We hold periodic meetings with our Property management personnel
for training and implementation of our strategies. The Properties historically
have had, and we believe they will continue to have, low turnover and high
occupancy rates.

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO

     As of December 31, 2004, we owned or had an ownership interest in a
portfolio of 275 Properties located throughout the United States containing
101,231 residential sites.

     The distribution of our Properties throughout the United States reflects
our belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio from
regional economic influences. We intend to target new acquisitions in or near
markets where our Properties are located and will also consider acquisitions of
Properties outside such markets. Refer to Note 3(c) of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K.

     Bay Indies located in Venice, Florida and Westwinds located in San Jose,
California each accounted for approximately 2.6% of our total property operating
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2004.

     The following table sets forth certain information relating to the
Properties we owned as of December 31, 2004, categorized by our major markets
(excluding the Thousand Trails Properties and Properties owned through joint
ventures).

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

DEANZA SANTA CRUZ

     The customers of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a Property located in
Santa Cruz, California, brought several actions opposing fees and charges in
connection with water service at the Property. As a result of one action, the
Company rebated approximately $36,000 to the customers. The DeAnza Santa Cruz
Homeowners Association ("HOA") then proceeded to a jury trial alleging these
"overcharges" entitled them to an award of punitive damages. In January 1999, a
jury awarded the HOA $6.0 million in punitive damages. On December 21, 2001 the
California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District reversed the $6.0 million
punitive damage award, the related award of attorneys' fees, and, as a result,
all post-judgment interest thereon, on the basis that punitive damages are not
available as a remedy for a statutory violation of the California Mobilehome
Residency Law ("MRL"). The decision of the appellate court left the HOA, the
plaintiff in this matter, with the right to seek a new trial in which it must
prove its entitlement to either the statutory penalty and attorneys' fees
available under the MRL or punitive damages based on causes of action for fraud,
misrepresentation or other tort. In order to resolve this matter, the Company
accrued for and agreed to pay $201,000 to the HOA. This payment resolved the
punitive damages claim. The HOA's attorney made a motion asking for an award of
attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of approximately $1.5 million as a
result of this resolution of the litigation. On April 2, 2003 the court awarded
attorney's fees to the HOA's attorney in the amount of $593,000 and court costs
of approximately $20,000. The Company appealed this award. On July 13, 2004, the
California Court of Appeal affirmed the award of attorney's fees in favor of the
HOA's attorney.

OTHER CALIFORNIA RENT CONTROL LITIGATION

     As part of the Company's effort to realize the value of its Properties
subject to rent control, the Company has initiated lawsuits against several
municipalities in California. The Company's goal is to achieve a level of
regulatory fairness in California's rent control jurisdictions, and in
particular those jurisdictions that prohibit increasing rents to market upon
turnover. This regulatory feature, called vacancy control, allows tenants to
sell their homes for a premium representing the value of the future discounted
rent-controlled rents. In the Company's view, such regulation results in a
transfer of the value of the Company's stockholders' land, which would otherwise
be reflected in market rents, to tenants upon the sales of their homes in the
form of an inflated purchase price that cannot be attributed to the value of the
home being sold. As a result, in the Company's view, the Company loses the value
of its asset and the selling tenant leaves the Property with a windfall premium.
The Company has discovered through the litigation process that certain
municipalities considered condemning the Company's Properties at values well
below the value of the underlying land. In the Company's view, a failure to
articulate market rents for sites governed by restrictive rent control would put
the Company at risk for condemnation or eminent domain proceedings based on
artificially reduced rents. Such a physical taking, should it occur, could
represent substantial lost value to stockholders. The Company is cognizant of
the need for affordable housing in the jurisdictions, but asserts that
restrictive rent regulation with vacancy control does not promote this purpose
because the benefits of such regulation are fully capitalized into the prices of
the homes sold. The Company estimates that the annual rent subsidy to tenants in
these jurisdictions is approximately $15 million. In a more well balanced
regulatory environment, the Company would receive market rents that would
eliminate the subsidy and homes would trade at or near their intrinsic value.

     In connection with such efforts, the Company announced it has entered into
a settlement agreement with the City of Santa Cruz, California and that,
pursuant to the settlement agreement, the City amended its rent control
ordinance to exempt the Company's Property from rent control as long as the
Company offers a long term lease which gives the Company the ability to increase
rents to market upon turnover and bases annual rent increases on the CPI. The
settlement agreement benefits the Company's stockholders by allowing them to
receive the value of their investment in this Property through vacancy decontrol
while preserving annual CPI based rent increases in this age restricted
Property.

     The Company has filed two lawsuits in Federal court against the City of San
Rafael, challenging its rent control ordinance on constitutional grounds. The
Company believes that one of those lawsuits was settled by the City agreeing to
amend the ordinance to permit adjustments to market rent upon turnover. The City
subsequently rejected the settlement agreement. The Court initially found the
settlement agreement was binding on the City, but then reconsidered and
determined to submit the claim of breach of the settlement agreement to a jury.
In October 2002, the first case against the City went to trial, based on both
breach of the settlement agreement and the constitutional claims. A jury found
no breach of the settlement agreement; the Company then filed motions asking the
Court to rule in its favor on that claim, notwithstanding the jury verdict. The
Court has postponed decision on those motions and on the constitutional claims,
pending a ruling on some property rights issues by the United States Supreme
Court. In the event that the Court does not rule in favor of the Company on
either the settlement agreement or the


                                       14
<PAGE>
constitutional claims, then the Company has pending claims seeking a declaration
that it can close the Property and convert it to another use.

     The Company's efforts to achieve a balanced regulatory environment
incentivize tenant groups to file lawsuits against the Company seeking large
damage awards. The homeowners association at Contempo Marin ("CMHOA"), a 396
site Property in San Rafael, California, sued the Company in December 2000 over
a prior settlement agreement on a capital expenditure pass-through after the
Company sued the City of San Rafael in October 2000 alleging its rent control
ordinance is unconstitutional. In the Contempo Marin case, the CMHOA prevailed
on a motion for summary judgment on an issue that permits the Company to collect
only $3.72 out of a monthly pass-through amount of $7.50 that the Company
believes had been agreed to by the CMHOA in a settlement agreement. On May 23,
2004, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's order dismissing
the Company's claims against the City of San Rafael. The trial court has set a
trial date in the second quarter of 2005 on the CMHOA's remaining claims for
damages. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter. The Company
believes that such lawsuits will be a consequence of the Company's efforts to
change rent control since tenant groups actively desire to preserve the premium
value of their homes in addition to the discounted rents provided by rent
control. The Company has determined that its efforts to rebalance the regulatory
environment despite the risk of litigation from tenant groups are necessary not
only because of the $15 million annual subsidy to tenants, but also because of
the condemnation risk.

     Similarly, in June 2003, the Company won a judgment against the City of
Santee in California Superior Court (case no. 777094). The effect of the
judgment was to invalidate, on state law grounds, two (2) rent control
ordinances the City of Santee had enforced against the Company and other
property owners. However, the Court allowed the City to continue to enforce a
rent control ordinance that predated the two invalid ordinances (the "prior
ordinance"). As a result of the judgment the Company was entitled to collect a
one-time rent increase based upon the difference in annual adjustments between
the invalid ordinance(s) and the prior ordinances and to adjust its base rents
to reflect what the Company could have charged had the prior ordinance been
continually in effect. The City of Santee appealed the judgment. The court of
appeal and California Supreme Court refused to stay enforcement of these rent
adjustments pending appeal. After the City was unable to obtain a stay, the City
and the tenant association each sued the Company in separate actions alleging
the rent adjustments pursuant to the judgment violate the prior ordinance (Case
Nos. GIE 020887 and GIE 020524). They seek to rescind the rent adjustments,
refunds of amounts paid, and penalties and damages in these separate actions. On
January 25, 2005, the California Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in part
and affirmed it in part with a remand. The Court of Appeal affirmed that one
ordinance was unlawfully adopted and therefore void and that the second
ordinance contained unconstitutional provisions. However, the Court ruled the
City had the authority to cure the issues with the first ordinance
retroactively. On remand the trial court is directed to decide the issue of
damages to the Company which the Company believes is consistent with the Company
receiving the economic benefit of invalidating one of the ordinances and also
consistent with the Company's position that it is entitled to market rent and
not merely a higher amount of regulated rent. The Company will petition the
Supreme Court of California for review of certain aspects of this decision. The
Company intends to vigorously defend the two new lawsuits. In addition, the
Company has sued the City of Santee in Federal court alleging all three of the
ordinances are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution because they fail to substantially advance a legitimate state
interest. Thus, it is the Company's position that the ordinances are subject to
invalidation as a matter of law in the Federal court action. Separately, the
Federal District Court granted the City's Motion for Summary Judgment in the
Company's Federal Court lawsuit. This decision was based not on the merits, but
on procedural grounds, including that the Company's claims were moot given its
success in the state court case. The Company intends to appeal this ruling and
believes the outcome will be affected by the cases currently before the Ninth
Circuit and United States Supreme Court.

     Moreover, in July 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal decided the case
of Cashman v. City of Cotati, a Property owner's challenge to the City's rent
control ordinance, and stated that a rent control ordinance that does not on its
face provide for a mechanism to prevent the capture of a premium is
unconstitutional, as a matter of law, absent sufficient externalities rendering
a premium unavailable. This reasoning supports the legal position the Company
has put forth in its opposition to rent control in general and vacancy control
in particular. The City of Cotati has petitioned the Ninth Circuit for rehearing
and that petition is pending. In addition, in October 2004, the United States
Supreme Court granted certiorari in State of Hawaii vs. Chevron USA, Inc., a
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal case that upholds the standard that a regulation
must substantially advance a legitimate state purpose in order to be
constitutionally viable. The case was argued before the United States Supreme
Court on February 22, 2005. The ultimate outcome of these cases will guide the
Company's continued efforts to realize the value of its Properties which are
subject to rent control and the Company's efforts to achieve a level of
regulatory fairness in rent control jurisdictions.

(1)  See the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included elsewhere
     herein. Certain 2003, 2002, 2001, and 2000 amounts have been reclassified
     to conform to the 2004 financial presentation. Such reclassifications have
     no effect on the operations or equity as originally presented.

     Net Income for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 have been
     restated (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     contained in this Form 10-K) to reflect a change in the Company's
     accounting policy with regards to its rent control initiatives. The Company
     received a comment letter from the SEC with regard to prior filings. These
     issues were outlined in our press release dated March 4, 2005. The issues
     have been resolved and resulted in this restatement.

(2)  On November 10, 2004, we acquired KTTI Holding Company, Inc., owner of 57
     Properties and approximately 3,000 acres of vacant land, for $160 million
     ("Thousand Trails Transaction"). These Properties are leased to Thousand
     Trails, the largest operator of membership-based campgrounds in the United
     States. The Company has provided a long-term lease of the real estate
     (excluding the vacant land) to Thousand Trails, which will continue to
     operate the Properties for the benefit of its approximately 108,000 members
     nationwide. The Properties are located in 16 states (primarily in the
     western and southern United States) and British Columbia, and contain
     17,911 sites. The lease will generate $16 million in rental income to the
     Company on an absolute triple net basis, subject to annual escalations of
     3.25%. As of December 31, 2004, approximately $2.3 million represents
     income for November 10, 2004 through December 31, 2004.

                        EQUITY LIFESTYLE PROPERTIES, INC.
                  CONSOLIDATED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION
                                   (continued)

(3)  On October 17, 2003, we closed 49 mortgage loans collateralized by 51
     Properties (the "Recap") providing total proceeds of approximately $501
     million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.84% and with a weighted
     average maturity of approximately 9 years. Approximately $170 million of
     the proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding on the Company's line
     of credit and term loan. Approximately $225 million was used to pay a
     special distribution of $8.00 per share on January 16, 2004. The remaining
     funds were used for investment purposes in 2004. The Recap resulted in
     increased interest and amortization expense and the special distribution
     resulted in decreased stockholder's equity.

     In connection with the $501 million borrowing and subsequent special
     distribution, on February 27, 2004, the Company contributed all of its
     assets to MHC Trust, a newly formed Maryland real estate investment trust,
     including the Company's entire partnership interest in the Operating
     Partnership. This restructuring resulted in a step-up in the Company's tax
     basis in its assets, generating future depreciation deductions, which in
     turn will reduce the Company's future distribution requirements. This
     provides the Company with greater financial flexibility and greater growth
     potential (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
     contained in this Form 10-K).

(4)  We believe that the book value of the Properties, which reflects the
     historical costs of such real estate assets less accumulated depreciation,
     is less than the current market value of the Properties.

(5)  Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company
     believes that FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of the National
     Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), to be an
     appropriate measure of performance for an equity REIT. While FFO is a
     relevant and widely used measure of operating performance for equity REITs,
     it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by
     GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative to these indicators
     in evaluating liquidity or operating performance.

     FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding
     gains or losses from sales of Properties, plus real estate related
     depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
     partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated
     partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same
     basis. The Company believes that FFO is helpful to investors as one of
     several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. The Company further
     believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization and
     gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on
     historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating
     current performance, FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating
     performance between periods and among other equity REITs. Investors should
     review FFO, along with GAAP net income and cash flow from operating
     activities, investing activities and financing activities, when evaluating
     an equity REIT's operating performance. The Company computes FFO in
     accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be
     comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in
     accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current
     NAREIT definition differently than we do. Investors should review FFO,
     along with GAAP net income and cash flow from operating activities,
     investing activities and financing activities, when evaluating an equity
     REIT's operating performance. FFO does not represent cash generated from
     operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash
     available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an
     alternative to net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an
     indication of our financial performance, or to cash flow from operating
     activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our
     liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs,
     including our ability to make cash distributions.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected
Financial Data" and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion may
contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which reflect management's current
views with respect to future events and financial performance. Such
forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties,
including, but not limited to, the effects of future events on the Company's
financial performance; the adverse impact of external factors such as inflation
and consumer confidence; interest rates; and the risks associated with real
estate ownership.

2004 ACCOMPLISHMENTS

     -    Invested in 135 Properties with approximately 50,000 sites.

     -    Increased presence in Florida and Arizona markets.

     -    Increased home sales volumes and profitability.

     -    Changed our name from Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. to Equity
          Lifestyle Properties, Inc., symbolizing our focus on
          lifestyle-oriented customers.

     -    Developed relationships with leading brand names such as Encore and
          Thousand Trails, creating a larger customer resource base.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

     Occupancy in our Properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates
directly affect revenues. Our revenue streams are predominantly derived from
customers renting our sites on a long-term basis.

     We have approximately 58,200 annual sites with average annual revenue of
approximately $4,400 per site. We have 7,200 seasonal sites, which are leased to
customers generally for 3 to 6 months, for which we expect to collect rent in
the range of $1,700 to $1,800. We also have 6,000 transient sites, occupied by
customers who lease on a short-term basis, for which we expect to collect annual
rent in the range of $2,000 to $2,100. We expect to service 60,000 customers
with these sites. There is significant demand for these sites. However, we
consider this revenue stream to be our most volatile. It is subject to weather
conditions, gas prices, and other factors affecting the marginal RV customer's
vacation and travel preferences. Finally, we have approximately 17,900 Thousand
Trails sites for which we receive ground rent of $16 million annually. This rent
is classified in Other Income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We
have interests in Properties owning approximately 11,800 sites for which revenue
is classified as Equity in Income from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     During 2004, the Company changed the way it accounted for costs incurred in
pursuing certain rent control initiatives. As a result, the Company has restated
its Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001 to expense the costs of the initiatives in the year in which they
were incurred because the previous method of accounting for the costs was
determined to be incorrect. The Company had historically classified these costs,
primarily legal, in other assets. To the extent the Company's efforts to
effectively change the use and operations of the Properties were successful, the
Company capitalized the costs to land improvements as an increase in the
established value of the revised project and depreciated them over 30 years. To
the extent these efforts were not successful, the costs would have been
expensed.

     See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report for a
summary of the effects of these changes on the Company's consolidated balance
sheets as of December 31, 2003 and consolidated statements of operations for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The accompanying Management's
Discussion and Analysis gives effect to these corrections. The significance of
the increase in expenses due to this change is not necessarily determinable in
future periods and depend on future rulings of the United States Supreme Court.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

     Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), which require us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that the
following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.

     In accordance with the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141
("SFAS No. 141"), we allocate the purchase price of Properties we acquire to net
tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values.
In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we
utilize a number of sources, including independent appraisals that may be
available in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective
property and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each
property as a result of our due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in
estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.

     We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments
in real estate, for impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence
of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance,
market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause
us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is
warranted.

     Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural
and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year estimated life for building
upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and
equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to
operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve
the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their
estimated useful life. However, the useful lives, salvage value, and customary
depreciation method used for land improvements and other significant assets may
significantly and materially overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets
and therefore understate the net income of the Company.

     In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN 46R")
- - an interpretation of ARB 51. The objective of FIN 46R is to provide guidance
on how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and determine when the
assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of operations of a
VIE need to be included in a company's consolidated financial statements. A
company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate such
entity if the company absorbs a majority of the entity's expected losses or
receives a majority of the entity's expected residual returns if they occur, or
both (i.e., the primary beneficiary). The Company will apply FIN 46R to all
types of entity ownership (general and limited partnerships and corporate
interests).

     The Company will re-evaluate and apply the provisions of FIN 46R to
existing entities if certain events occur which warrant re-evaluation of such
entities. In addition, the Company will apply the provisions of FIN 46R to all
new entities in the future. The Company also consolidates entities in which it
has a controlling direct or indirect voting interest. The equity method of
accounting is applied to entities in which the Company does not have a


                                       24
<PAGE>
controlling direct or indirect voting interest, but can exercise influence over
the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions. The cost method
is applied when (i) the investment is minimal (typically less than 5%) and (ii)
the Company's investment is passive.

     In applying the provisions of FIN 46R, the Company determined that its
$29.7 million investment in preferred equity interests (the "Mezzanine
Investment") in six entities controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc.
("Diversified") (see Liquidity and Capital Resources - Investing Activities) is
a VIE; however, the Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. As
such, the adoption of this pronouncement had no effect on the Company's
financial statements.

     The valuation of financial instruments under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments" ("SFAS No. 107") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS
No. 133") requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value
of the instruments. Where possible, we base the fair values of our financial
instruments, including our derivative instruments, on listed market prices and
third party quotes. Where these are not available, we base our estimates on
other factors relevant to the financial instrument.

     Prior to January 1, 2003 we accounted for our stock compensation in
accordance with APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", based
upon the intrinsic value method. This method results in no compensation expense
for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value
of the common stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, we elected
to account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and
its amendment ("SFAS No. 148"), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", which
will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of
the stock options and other equity awards issued. SFAS No. 148 provides three
possible transition methods for changing to the fair value method. We have
elected to use the modified-prospective method. This method requires that we
recognize stock-based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the
fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair
value method had been used to account for all employee awards granted, or
settled, in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value
method was applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period
presented (amounts in thousands, except per share data):

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003

     Since December 31, 2002, the gross investment in real estate increased from
$1,296 million to $2,036 million as of December 31, 2004, due primarily to the
aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period.
The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 52,349 as of
December 31, 2003 to 101,231 as of December 31, 2004.

     The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for
the Property Operations for the Core Portfolio (excludes RV and Resort Cottage
sites, and Properties owned through unconsolidated joint ventures, as well as
the sites of Properties acquired or sold during 2003 and 2004) and the Total
Portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.

PROPERTY OPERATING REVENUES

     The 3.0% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio
reflects a 4.7% increase in monthly base rent per site combined with a 1.6%
decrease in average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for
the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility income, which
resulted from higher utility expenses. Total Portfolio operating revenues
increased due to current year acquisitions (see Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K).

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES

     The 4.4% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the
Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in payroll expense, administrative
expense, repair and maintenance expense. The 5.4% increase in Core Portfolio
real estate taxes is generally due to higher property assessments on certain
Properties. Property management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects
costs of managing the Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of
Property operating revenues, increased by 1.2% due to increases in payroll costs
and computer expenses, but remains at approximately 4% of revenue. Total
Portfolio operating expenses increased due to our current year acquisitions.

</TABLE>

     New home sales gross profit reflects a 12.9% increase in sales volume
combined with an increase in average selling price of approximately $11,000 per
home or approximately 15% due to higher quality of homes. Used home sales gross
profit reflects an increase in gross margin on used home sales and an increase
in volume. Brokered resale revenues reflects increased resale volumes. The 18.3%
increase in home selling expenses primarily reflects increases in insurance cost
and other expenses. The increase in ancillary service revenue relates primarily
to income from property amenities at our newly acquired Properties.

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES

     The increase in other expenses reflects an increase in interest expense
resulting from the Recap borrowing in October 2003 (see Note 10 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K) and additional
debt assumed in the 2004 acquisitions, an increase in depreciation on real
estate assets related to the 2004 acquisitions, and increased general and
administrative expense due to increased payroll. This is partially offset by
income from other investments that includes $2.3 million of lease income from
the Thousand Trails ground lease entered into on November 10, 2004.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

EQUITY IN INCOME OF UNCONSOLIDATED JOINT VENTURES

     During 2004, we invested in preferred equity interests, the Mezzanine
Investment, in six entities containing 11 Properties and 5,054 sites. Our
average return on the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a rate of 10% per annum.
We also invested in 11 separate joint ventures (see Liquidity and Capital
Resources - Investing Activities). These investments contributed to the increase
in equity in income from unconsolidated joint ventures.

COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002

     Since December 31, 2001, the gross investment in real estate increased from
$1,238 million to $1,310 million as of December 31, 2003, due primarily to the
aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period.
The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 50,663 as of
December 31, 2001 to 51,715 as of December 31, 2003.

PROPERTY OPERATING REVENUES

     The 3.2% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio
reflects a 5.1% increase in monthly base rent per site combined with a 1.9%
decrease in average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for
the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility income, which
resulted from higher expenses for these items.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

PROPERTY OPERATING EXPENSES

The 3.7% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core
Portfolio is due primarily to increases in insurance and other expenses, utility
expense, and repair and maintenance expense, administrative expenses and payroll
expense. The 5.8% increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is generally due
to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property management
expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the Properties
and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating revenues, increased
by 1.5% due to increases in payroll costs and computer expenses.

combined with a 6.1% decrease in the gross margin. The average selling price of
new homes remained steady year over year. Used home sales gross profit reflects
a decrease in gross margin on used home sales, partially offset by an increase
in volume. Brokered resale revenues reflect increased resale volumes. The 4.0%
decrease in home selling expenses primarily reflects reductions in advertising
expenses.

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES

     In October 2003, we received approximately $501 million from the Recap. The
cash received from the Recap was used to pay down our Line of Credit and pay off
our Term Loan, with the remainder placed in short-term investments to be used
for payment of a special distribution in January 2004 and for future
acquisitions. As a result, interest income increased reflecting additional
interest earned on short-term investments with an average balance of $273
million. The decrease in general and administrative expense is due to decreased
professional fees and public company costs, partially offset by increased
payroll costs and banking expenses. Rent control initiatives decreased by $3.4
million due to lower costs relating to the DeAnza Santa Cruz and Contempo Marin
Properties. Interest and related amortization increased due to the Recap and the
payment of approximately $3 million to unwind the 2001 Swap (hereinafter
defined), partially offset by decreased interest rates during the period. The
weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002 were approximately $800 million and $731.8 million, respectively. The
effective interest rate was 6.4% and 6.8% per annum for the years ended December
31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

     The increase in income from other investments was due to the restructuring
of the Company's investment in Wolverine Property Investment Limited Partnership
(the "College Heights Joint Venture" or the "Venture"), a joint venture with
Wolverine Investors, LLP, effective September 1, 2002. The Venture included 18
Properties with 3,581 sites. The results of operations of the College Heights
Joint Venture prior to restructuring were included with the results of the
Company due to the Company's voting equity interest and control over the
Venture. Pursuant to the restructuring, the Company sold its general partnership
interest, sold all of the Company's voting equity interest and reduced the
Company's total investment in the College Heights Joint Venture. As
consideration for the sale, the Company retained sole ownership of Down Yonder,
a 361 site Property in Clearwater, Florida, received cash of approximately $5.2
million and retained preferred limited partnership interests of approximately
$10.3 million, recorded net of a $2.4 million reserve included in other assets.
Income of approximately $1.0 million and $0.2 million has been recorded in
income from other investments for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

INFLATION

     Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or
annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve
increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of
leases generally minimize the risks of inflation to the Company.

LIQUIDITY

     As of December 31, 2004, the Company had $5.3 million in cash and cash
equivalents and $44.2 million available on its line of credit. The Company
expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements, including its
distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash provided by
operating activities and availability under the existing line of credit. The
Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements such as
scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital improvements by
long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings including borrowings
under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt securities or
additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to net cash provided by
operating activities. The table below summarizes cash flow activity for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (dollars in thousands).

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

     Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $28.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 2004. This decrease reflects increased interest expense
as a result of the Recap in October, 2003 and increases in working capital,
partially offset by increases in property operating income as discussed in
"Results of Operations" above. Net cash provided by operating activities
decreased $5 million for the year ended December 31, 2003 from $80.2 million in
2002. This was primarily due to an increase in working capital.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

     Net cash used in investing activities reflects the impact of the following
investing activities:

ACQUISITIONS

     During the year ended December 31, 2004, we acquired 111 Properties (see
Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form
10-K). The combined investment in real estate for these 111 Properties was
approximately $703 million and was funded with monies held in short-term
investments, debt assumed of $352 million which includes a mark-to-market
adjustment of $10.4 million, new financing of $124 million, and borrowings from
our Line of Credit. Included in the above as previously described are 57
Properties purchased as part of the Thousand Trails Transaction; the income
related to this transaction is classified as income from other investments on
the Consolidated Statements of Operation.

     We assumed inventory of approximately $1.2 million, other assets of $4.9
million, rents received in advance of approximately $13.6 million and other
liabilities of approximately $5.8 million in connection with the 2004
acquisitions. The Company also issued common OP units for value of approximately
$32.2 million.

     During 2003, we acquired three Properties at a purchase price of $11.8
million. The acquisitions were funded with monies held in short-term investments
and debt assumed of $4.6 million. The acquisitions included the assumption of
liabilities of approximately $0.7 million. Also during 2003, we acquired a
parcel of land adjacent to one of our Properties for approximately $0.1 million.

     During 2002, we acquired eleven Properties at a purchase price of $101.6
million. The acquisitions were funded with borrowings on our Line of Credit and
the assumption of $47.9 million of mortgage debt, which includes a $3.0 million
mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we purchased adjacent land and land
improvements for several Properties for approximately $0.6 million.

DISPOSITIONS

     During the year ended December 31, 2004, we sold one Property located in
Lake Placid, Florida for a selling price of $3.4 million, with net proceeds of
$0.8 million received in July 2004. No gain or loss on disposition was
recognized in the period. The operating results have been reflected in
discontinued operations. In addition, we sold approximately 1.4 acres of land in
Montana for a gain and net proceeds of $0.6 million.

     During 2003, we sold three Properties for proceeds of $27.1 million and a
gain of $10.8 million. Proceeds from the sales were used to repay amounts on our
Line of Credit.

     During 2002, we effectively sold 17 Properties as part of a restructuring
of the College Heights Venture (hereinafter defined). In addition, we sold
Camelot Acres, a 319 site Property in Burnsville, Minnesota, for approximately
$14.2 million.

INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO JOINT VENTURES

     On February 3, 2004, the Company invested approximately $29.7 million in
preferred equity interests (the "Mezzanine Investment") in six entities
controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc. ("Diversified"). These entities own
in the aggregate 11 Properties, containing 5,054 sites. Approximately $11.7
million of the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a per annum average rate of 10%,
with a minimum pay rate of 6.5%, payable quarterly, and approximately $17.9
million of the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a per annum average rate of 11%,
with a minimum pay rate of 7%, payable quarterly. To the extent the minimum pay
rates on the respective Mezzanine Investments are not achieved, the accrual
rates increase to 12% and 13% per annum, respectively. The Company can acquire
these Properties in the future at capitalization rates of between 8% and 8.5%,
beginning in 2006. In addition, the Company has invested approximately $1.4
million in the Diversified entities managing these 11 Properties, which is
included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004.

     During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company invested approximately
$4.1 million in 11 joint ventures. The Company can acquire these Properties in
the future at capitalization rates of between 8% and 8.5%, beginning in 2006.


                                       31
<PAGE>
INVESTING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)

     In addition, the Company recorded approximately $3.7 million, $0.3 million
and $0.2 million of net income from joint ventures (net of depreciation) in the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively, and received
approximately $5.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million in distributions from
such joint ventures for the year ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
respectively. Included in such distributions for the year ended December 31,
2004 is $2.5 million return of capital, of which $0.5 million exceeded the
Company's basis and thus was recorded in income from unconsolidated joint
ventures and other.

OTHER INVESTMENTS

     Effective September 1, 2002, the Company restructured its investment in the
College Heights Joint Venture. The Venture included 18 Properties with 3,581
sites. The results of operations of the College Heights Joint Venture prior to
restructuring were included with the results of the Company due to the Company's
voting equity interest and control over the Venture. Pursuant to the
restructuring, the Company sold its general partnership interest, sold all of
the Company's voting equity interest and reduced the Company's total investment
in the College Heights Joint Venture. As consideration for the sale, the Company
retained sole ownership of Down Yonder, a 361 site Property in Clearwater,
Florida, received cash of approximately $5.2 million and retained preferred
limited partnership interests of approximately $10.3 million, recorded net of a
$2.4 million reserve included in other assets. Income of approximately $0.9
million, $1.0 million and $0.2 million has been recorded in income from other
investments for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.

CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

     Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as
recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and
corporate costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $13.7 million, $11.9 million
and $13.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
respectively. Site development costs were approximately $13.0 million, $9.0
million and $10.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
respectively, and represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the
Company's Properties and costs for improvements to sites when a smaller used
home is replaced with a larger new home. Corporate costs such as computer
hardware, office furniture and office improvements were $0.4 million, $0.1
million and $0.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
respectively.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

     Net cash used in financing activities reflects the impact of the following:

EQUITY TRANSACTIONS

     In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company
must distribute 90% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) to
its stockholders. The following distributions have been declared and paid to
common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 2002.

<PAGE>
FINANCING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)

     On December 12, 2003, we declared a one-time special distribution of $8.00
per share payable to stockholders of record on January 8, 2004. We used proceeds
from the $501 million Recap in October 2003 to pay the special distribution on
January 16, 2004. The special cash dividend is reflected on stockholders' 2004
1099-DIV issued in January 2005.

     In connection with the $501 million Recap and subsequent special
distribution, on February 27, 2004, the Company contributed all of its assets to
MHC Trust, a newly formed Maryland real estate investment trust, including the
Company's entire partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The Company
determined that a taxable transaction in connection with the special
distribution to stockholders would be in the Company's best interests. This was
accomplished by the contribution of the Company's interest in the Operating
Partnership to MHC Trust in exchange for all the common and preferred stock of
MHC Trust. Due to the Company's tax basis in its interest in the Operating
Partnership, the Company recognized $180 million of taxable income as a result
of its contribution, as opposed to a nontaxable reduction of the Company's tax
basis in its interest in the Operating Partnership. This restructuring resulted
in a step-up in the Company's tax basis in its assets, generating future
depreciation deductions, which in turn will reduce the Company's future
distribution requirements. This provides the Company with greater financial
flexibility and greater growth potential. The Company intends to continue to
qualify as a REIT under the Code, with its assets consisting of interests in MHC
Trust. MHC Trust, in turn, also intends to qualify as a real estate investment
trust under the Code and will continue to be the general partner of the
Operating Partnership. On May 1, 2004, in connection with the restructuring, MHC
Trust sold cumulative preferred stock to a limited number of unaffiliated
investors.

     During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, in connection with 2004
acquisitions the Company issued 1.2 million common OP Units valued at $36.7
million of which approximately $28.7 million has been classified as paid-in
capital. On December 21, 2004 we redeemed 126,765 common OP Units for
approximately $4.5 million of which approximately $3.5 million has been
classified as paid-in capital.

     The Operating Partnership paid distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125
million of Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units ("Preferred
Units"). Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid quarterly on the last
calendar day of each quarter beginning September 30, 1999. The Company expects
to continue to make regular quarterly distributions and has set its 2005
distribution to common stockholders at $0.10 per share per annum.

MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES

     We have two unsecured lines of credit of $110 million and $50 million which
bear interest at a per annum rate of London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")
plus 1.65%. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company borrowed
$135.8 million and paid down $20 million on its line of credit. On November 10,
2004, in connection with the Thousand Trails Transaction, we secured a $120
million three-year term loan at LIBOR plus 1.75%. In December 2004, we fixed
$180 million of this variable debt for one year with a weighted average per
annum interest rate of 4.7%.

     During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, the Company assumed
mortgage and other debt of approximately $157 million, which was recorded at
fair market value with the related premium being amortized over the life of the
loan using the effective interest rate. The Company borrowed an additional $194
million of mortgage debt for other acquisitions. The mortgages bear interest at
weighted average rates ranging from 5.14% to 5.81% per annum, and mature at
various dates through November 1, 2027.

     In 2003, the Company initiated the Recap as a result of its belief in the
stability of its cash flow from property operations and the attractive financing
terms available to borrowers such as the Company in the secured debt markets. In
conducting its evaluation of the use of proceeds from the Recap, the Company's
Board of Directors believed that to the extent no attractive alternative use was
available, a distribution to stockholders should occur. In late 2003, the
Company identified acquisition targets which would use approximately $100
million of the $325 million in net proceeds resulting from the Recap. In
December 2003, the Company's Board of Directors declared a distribution of
approximately $225 million ($8 per share). During 2004, the Company identified
additional acquisitions and has funded such acquisitions primarily with secured
and unsecured borrowings.


                                       33
<PAGE>
FINANCING ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED)

     The Recap and subsequent borrowings in connection with acquisitions have
significantly increased the Company's outstanding debt. The interest and
principal payments required under these debt agreements materially increase the
Company's future contractual payment obligations. As of December 31, 2004, the
outstanding debt balance was $1,653 million. In future years, the Company
expects to pay annual interest and principal amortization under current
obligations of approximately $114 million (not including the impact of scheduled
maturities) compared to $57 million in 2003. In light of these increased cash
flow requirements, the Company has reduced its annual dividend to common
stockholders from approximately $44 million in 2003 to approximately $1 million
in 2004. In addition, the Company expects its cash from operations to increase
significantly in 2005 compared to 2003 due to the cash generated by
newly-acquired Properties. To the extent cash flow from the Properties does not
meet the Company's expectations, the Company's Board of Directors increases the
annual dividend significantly, or the Company is required to make significant
unexpected capital improvements or other payments, the Company's financial
flexibility and ability to meet scheduled obligations could be negatively
impacted. With respect to maturing debt, the Company has staggered the
maturities of our long-term mortgage debt over an average of approximately 6
years, with no more than $330 million in principal maturities coming due in any
single year. The Company believes that it will be able to refinance its maturing
debt obligations on a secured or unsecured basis; however, to the extent the
Company is unable to refinance its debt as it matures, it believes that it will
be able to repay such maturing debt from asset sales and/or the proceeds from
equity issuances. With respect to any refinancing of maturing debt, the
Company's future cash flow requirements could be impacted by significant changes
in interest rates or other debt terms, including required amortization payments.

     In October 2003, we unwound an interest rate swap ("2001 Swap") agreement
at a cost of approximately $3 million, which is included in interest and related
amortization in 2003 in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.
The 2001 swap effectively fixed LIBOR on $100 million of our floating rate debt
at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004.
The terms of the 2001 Swap required monthly settlements on the same dates
interest payments were due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the
2001 Swap was reflected at market value.

     On April 17, 2003, we entered into an agreement to refinance and increase
the "Bay Indies Mortgage", a $44.5 million note, from approximately $21.9
million to $45 million. Under the new agreement, the Bay Indies Mortgage bears
interest at 5.69% per annum, amortizes over 25 years and matures April 17, 2013.
The net proceeds were used to pay down the Company's Line of Credit in April
2003. Also during the year ended December 31, 2003, mortgage notes payable on
four other Properties were repaid totaling approximately $23.5 million using
proceeds from borrowings on the Company's Line of Credit.

     During the year ended December 31, 2002, as part of the purchase of RSI, in
a non-cash transaction, we assumed a $12.5 million note payable ("Conseco
Financing Note"), collateralized by our home inventory. The Conseco Financing
Note was repaid at a discount during 2002 using proceeds from our Line of
Credit. In addition, we repaid a maturing mortgage note in the amount of $1.1
million and $2.1 million of other unsecured notes payable using proceeds from
our Line of Credit.

     Certain of the Company's mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants
and restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured
debt versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed
charges-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
("EBITDA"), limitations on certain holdings and other restrictions.

(1)  Balance excludes net premiums and discounts of $9.4 million.

(2)  Includes Line of Credit repayment in 2006 of $115,800. We have an option to
     extend this maturity for one year to 2007.

(3)  Includes a Term Loan repayment in 2007 of $105,600. We have an option to
     extend this maturity for two successive years to 2009.

     Included in the above table are certain capital lease obligations totaling
approximately $7.0 million. These agreements expire June 2009 and are paid
semi-annually.

     In addition, the Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases
at certain of the Properties expiring in various years from 2022 to 2032 with
terms which include minimum rent to be paid throughout the year plus additional
rents calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. For the twelve months ended
December 31, 2004 and 2003, ground lease expense was approximately $1.6 million
and $1.6 million respectively. Minimum future rental payments under the ground
leases are approximately $1.6 million for each of the next five years and
approximately $23.5 million thereafter.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

     Funds from Operations ("FFO") is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe
FFO, as defined by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real
Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), to be an appropriate measure of performance
for an equity REIT. While FFO is a relevant and widely used measure of operating
performance for equity REITs, it does not represent cash flow from operations or
net income as defined by GAAP, and it should not be considered as an alternative
to these indicators in evaluating liquidity or operating performance.

     FFO is defined as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding
gains or losses from sales of Properties, plus real estate related depreciation
and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and
joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures
are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. We believe that FFO is helpful
to investors as one of several measures of the performance of an equity REIT. We
further believe that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization and
gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical
costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance,
FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and
among other equity REITs. Investors should review FFO, along with GAAP net
income and cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and
financing activities, when evaluating an equity REIT's operating performance. We
compute FFO in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be
comparable to FFO reported by other REITs that do not define the term in
accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the current
NAREIT definition differently than we do. FFO does not represent cash generated
from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, nor does it represent cash
available to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to
net income, determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indication of our
financial performance, or to cash flow from operating activities, determined in
accordance with GAAP, as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of
funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash
distributions.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and
interest rates. Our earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial
instruments are dependent on prevailing market interest rates. The primary
market risk we face is long-term indebtedness, which bears interest at fixed and
variable rates. The fair value of our long-term debt obligations is affected by
changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2004, approximately 97% or
approximately $1.6 billion of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates,
which minimizes the market risk until the debt matures. For each increase in
interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the total
outstanding debt would decrease by approximately $93.1 million. For each
decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), the fair value of the
total outstanding debt would decrease by approximately $98.8 million.

     At December 31, 2004, approximately 3% or approximately $56 million of our
outstanding debt was short-term and at variable rates. Earnings are affected by
increases and decreases in market interest rates on this debt. For each
increase/decrease in interest rates of 1% (or 100 basis points), our earnings
and cash flows would increase/decrease by approximately $538,000 annually.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

     The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, maintain a system of disclosure
controls and procedures, designed to provide reasonable assurance that
information the Company is required to disclose in the reports that the Company
files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms.

     As mentioned in the Form 8-K filed on March 4, 2005, the Company received a
comment letter from the SEC staff raising questions regarding how the Company
accounted for costs incurred in pursuing certain rent control initiatives.
Management discussed this issue with its independent auditors and the Company's
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors ("Audit Committee"). Based on such
discussions management has changed its accounting policy to expense such costs
in the year incurred and restated prior period financial statements as discussed
in Note 2 to the financial statements because the previous method of accounting
for these costs has been determined to be incorrect.

     The Company's rent control initiatives date back prior to 2001. During
2001, given a significant expansion of the rent control initiatives, the
accounting for such costs was closely analyzed by management and discussed with
our independent auditors. The initiatives involved efforts of the Company to
realize the value of certain of its Properties subject to rent control, as more
fully discussed in Note 17. The initiatives included efforts to remove the
operations of certain Properties from existing rent regulation or to ultimately
close the Properties if the existing rent regulation remained.

     At that time the Company concluded that removal of the existing rent
regulation or Property closures would constitute a "formal plan" and that such
plan represented a "change in use" under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 67 "Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real
Estate Projects" ("SFAS No. 67") and costs were capitalized on that basis. These
financial statements were audited by our independent auditors and the auditors
provided unqualified opinions in prior periods.

     After the discussions among the Company, its Audit Committee and its
independent auditors in March 2005, the term "change in use" was no longer
interpreted to cover a change in regulation. In addition, as part of its
initiative, the Company was not willing to commit to close the Properties and
would accept other outcomes that allowed the Company to realize the value of its
Properties short of park closure (which is a "change in use"). As a result the
Company determined that it was not committed to a "formal plan" that reflected a
"change of use" under SFAS No. 67.

     The Company's management with the participation of the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2004 in light of
this restatement. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as
of December 31, 2004. However, based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date,
the controls over the accounting policy regarding the capitalization of costs
incurred in pursuing rent control initiatives is the only area in which the
disclosure controls and procedures were not operating effectively at the
reasonable assurance level.

     Prior to receipt of SEC comments the issue of the capitalization of costs
incurred in pursuing rent control initiatives was identified by the Company as
an accounting issue. While the Company concluded its disclosure controls and
procedures were not operating effectively as of December 31, 2004, management
believes 1) it closely analyzed the application of SFAS No. 67 to its situation
and this issue was discussed with its Audit Committee and it was considered by
its independent auditors in prior audits, 2) there was no authoritative
literature existing with respect to this issue that was not considered by the
Company or its Audit Committee, and 3) until the comments were received from the
SEC staff and subsequent discussion with its independent auditors, the
application of SFAS No. 67 and the Company's interpretation of "formal plan" and
"change in use" were believed to be appropriate. Lastly, the Company believes
its disclosure regarding these transactions and costs was highlighted in its
disclosure and taken in total during the relevant periods provided users with
meaningful and useful information on which to base investment decisions.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

     To remediate the material weakness in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting, subsequent to year end the Company has implemented
additional review procedures over the selection and monitoring of the
application and interpretation of accounting principles affecting the costs
incurred in pursuing rent control initiatives.

     There were no material changes to the Company's internal changes over
financial reporting during the fourth quarter.

        REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

     Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining
adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) under Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company's internal
control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.

     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework.

In performing this assessment, management reviewed the Company's accounting for
costs incurred in pursuing rent control initiatives. As a result of this review,
management concluded that the Company's controls over the application and
interpretation of accounting principles affecting the capitalization of these
costs were incorrect, and, as a result, management has determined that expenses
were understated over the last several years. The Audit Committee and the Board
of Directors and management determined to restate certain of the Company's
previously issued financial statements to reflect the correct costs incurred in
pursuing rent control initiatives, as explained in Note 2 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Management evaluated the effects of this restatement on the Company's assessment
of its internal control over financial reporting and concluded that the control
deficiency relating to the implementation and interpretation of GAAP as they
relate to the capitalization of costs in pursuing rent control initiatives
represented a material weakness. As a result of this material weakness,
management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria set
forth by COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. A material weakness in
internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency (within the
meaning of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") Auditing
Standard No. 2), or combination of control deficiencies, that results in there
being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. PCAOB
Auditing Standard No. 2 identifies a number of circumstances that, because of
their likely significant negative effect on internal control over financial
reporting, are to be regarded as at least significant deficiencies as well as
strong indicators that a material weakness exists, including the restatement of
previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of a
misstatement.

     The Company's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an
attestation report on management's assessment of the Company's internal control
over financial reporting. That report appears on page F-2 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control
                            Over Financial Reporting

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc.

     We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying
Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Equity
Lifestyle Properties, Inc. (Equity Lifestyle Properties) did not maintain
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004,
because of the effect of a material weakness due to inadequate controls over the
capitalization of certain costs, based on criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Equity Lifestyle
Properties' management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of Equity Lifestyle
Properties' internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

     We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

     A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Equity Lifestyle
Properties; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of
Equity Lifestyle Properties are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of Equity Lifestyle Properties; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of Equity Lifestyle Properties'
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

     Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

     A material weakness is a control deficiency, or combination of control
deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material
misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected. The following material weakness has been identified and included in
management's assessment. As described in the notes to the Company's 2004
financial statements, Equity Lifestyle Properties restated previously issued
financial statements to correct for errors related to the improper
capitalization of certain costs associated with changing rent control
restrictions. In connection with its assessment of internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, management determined that Equity
Lifestyle Properties' procedures and controls over the interpretation and
implementation of generally accepted accounting principles as they relate to the
capitalization of these costs were inadequate, and concluded that this
deficiency represented a material weakness in internal control over financial
reporting. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature,
timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the financial
statements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004, and this report does not affect our report
dated March 24, 2005 on those financial statements.

     In our opinion, management's assessment that Equity Lifestyle Properties,
Inc. did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO
control criteria. Also, in our opinion, because of the effect of the material
weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control
criteria, Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc. has not maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the
COSO control criteria.

            Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc.

Lifestyle Properties, Inc. ("Equity Lifestyle Properties", formerly known as
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc.) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, other comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial
statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(1) and (2). These financial
statements and the schedules are the responsibility of Equity Lifestyle
Properties' management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and the schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Equity
Lifestyle Properties at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results
of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

     As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company has restated its financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and for
each of the two years in the period then ended relating to expense recognition
for certain legal costs.

     As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003
Equity Lifestyle Properties changed its method of accounting for stock-based
employee compensation.

     We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Equity
Lifestyle Properties, Inc. and subsidiaries' internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control--Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 24, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on management's assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting and an adverse opinion on the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Equity Lifestyle Properties, Inc. (formerly Manufactured Home Communities,
Inc.), together with MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the "Operating
Partnership") and other consolidated subsidiaries ("Subsidiaries"), are referred
to herein as the "Company", "ELS", "we", "us", and "our". We believe that we
have qualified for taxation as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for
federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended December 31, 1993. We
plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. Many of these
requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. We cannot, therefore,
guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a REIT. The
determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters
that may not be totally within our control and we cannot provide any assurance
that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") will agree with our analysis. For
example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income must come from
sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. We are also required to
distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income excluding
capital gains. The fact that we hold our assets through the Operating
Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the REIT
requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT
status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and
regulations, and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult,
or impossible, for us to remain qualified as a REIT. We do not believe, however,
that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

     If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax
at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain
statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years
following the year we first failed to qualify. Even if the Company qualifies for
taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on
its income and property and Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed
income.

     The operations of the Company are conducted primarily through the Operating
Partnership. The Company contributed the proceeds from its initial public
offering and subsequent offerings to the Operating Partnership for a general
partnership interest. In 2004, the general partnership interest was contributed
to MHC Trust (see Note 5). The financial results of the Operating Partnership
and the Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial
statements. In addition, since certain activities, if performed by the Company,
may not be qualifying REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), the Company has formed taxable REIT subsidiaries as
defined in the Code to engage in such activities.

     Several Properties acquired during 2004 are wholly owned by taxable REIT
subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI") is a
wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary of the Company that, doing business as
Carefree Sales, is engaged in the business of purchasing, selling and leasing
homes that are located in Properties owned and managed by the Company. Carefree
Sales also provides brokerage services to customers at such Properties.
Typically, customers move from a Property but do not relocate their homes.
Carefree Sales may provide brokerage services, in competition with other local
brokers, by seeking buyers for the homes. Carefree Sales also leases inventory
homes to prospective customers with the expectation that the tenant eventually
will purchase the home. Subsidiaries of RSI also lease from the Operating
Partnership certain real property within or adjacent to certain Properties
consisting of golf courses, pro shops, stores and restaurants.

     The limited partners of the Operating Partnership (the "Common OP
Unitholders") receive an allocation of net income which is based on their
respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership which is shown on
the Consolidated Financial Statements as Minority Interests - Common OP Units.
As of December 31, 2004, the Minority Interests - Common OP Units represented
6,340,805 units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") which are
convertible into an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock.
The issuance of additional shares of common stock or common OP Units changes the
respective ownership of the Operating Partnership for both the Minority
Interests and the Company.

NOTE 2 - RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

     During 2004, the Company changed the way it accounted for costs incurred in
pursuing certain rent control initiatives. As a result, the Company has restated
its Consolidated Financial Statements for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002, and 2001 to expense the costs of the initiatives in the year in which they
were incurred because the previous method of accounting for the costs was
determined to be incorrect. The Company had historically classified these costs,
primarily legal, in other assets. To the extent the Company's efforts to
effectively change the use and operations of the Properties were successful, the
Company capitalized the costs to land improvements as an increase in the
established value of the revised project and depreciated them over 30 years. To
the extent these efforts were not successful, the costs would have been
expensed.

     Following is a summary of the effects of these changes on the Company's
Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 and the
Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 (amounts in thousands):

          The Company consolidates its majority-owned subsidiaries in which it
     has the ability to control the operations of the subsidiaries and all
     variable interest entities with respect to which the Company is the primary
     beneficiary. All inter-company transactions have been eliminated in
     consolidation. The Company's acquisitions were all accounted for as
     purchases in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
     No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS No. 141").

          In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
     issued Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
     ("FIN 46R") - an interpretation of ARB 51. The objective of FIN 46R is to
     provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and
     determine when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and
     results of operations of a VIE need to be included in a company's
     consolidated financial statements. A company that holds variable interests
     in an entity will need to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a
     majority of the entity's expected losses or receives a majority of the
     entity's expected residual returns if they occur, or both (i.e., the
     primary beneficiary). The Company will apply FIN 46R to all types of entity
     ownership (general and limited partnerships and corporate interests).

          The Company will re-evaluate and apply the provisions of FIN 46R to
     existing entities if certain events occur which warrant re-evaluation of
     such entities. In addition, the Company will apply the provisions of FIN
     46R to all new entities in the future. The Company also consolidates
     entities in which it has a controlling direct or indirect voting interest.
     The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which the Company
     does not have a controlling direct or indirect voting interest, but can
     exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major
     decisions. The cost method is applied when (i) the investment is minimal
     (typically less than 5%) and (ii) the Company's investment is passive.

     (b) Use of Estimates

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
     make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
     and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
     date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
     expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
     those estimates.

     (c) Segments

          We manage all our operations on a property-by-property basis. Since
     each Property has similar economic and operational characteristics the
     Company has one reportable segment, which is the operation of land lease
     Properties. The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States
     reflects our belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the
     portfolio from regional economic influences. We intend to target new
     acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located and will
     also consider acquisitions of Properties outside such markets. The
     following table identifies our five largest markets by number of sites and
     provides information regarding our Properties (excludes Properties owned
     through Joint Ventures).

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (d) Inventory

          Inventory consists of new and used Site Set homes, is stated at the
     lower of cost or market after consideration of the N.A.D.A. (National
     Automobile Dealers Association) Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide and
     the current market value of each home included in the home inventory.
     Inventory sales revenues and resale revenues are recognized when the home
     sale is closed. Resale revenues are stated net of commissions paid to
     employees of $1,163,000 and $893,000 for the years ended December 31, 2004
     and 2003, respectively.

     (e) Real Estate

          In accordance with SFAS No. 141, we allocate the purchase price of
     Properties we acquire to net tangible and identified intangible assets
     acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair values for
     purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources,
     including independent appraisals that may be available in connection with
     the acquisition or financing of the respective property and other market
     data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result
     of our due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the
     fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.

          Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
     Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated
     useful lives of the assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings
     acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year
     estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated
     life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. The values of the above and
     below market leases are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in
     the case of below market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market
     leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated lease.
     The value associated with in-place leases is amortized over the expected
     term, which includes an estimated probability of lease renewal.
     Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to
     operations as incurred, and significant renovations and improvements that
     improve the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized
     and then expensed over their estimated useful life. However the useful
     lives, salvage value, and customary depreciation method used for land
     improvements and other significant assets may significantly and materially
     overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets and therefore
     understate the net income of the Company.

          We evaluate our Properties for impairment when conditions exist which
     may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows
     (undiscounted) from a Property over the anticipated holding period is less
     than its carrying value. Upon determination that a permanent impairment has
     occurred, the applicable Property is reduced to fair value.

          For Properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized
     when the fair value of the property, less the estimated cost to sell, is
     less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the time the
     Company has a commitment to sell the property and/or is actively marketing
     the property for sale. A property to be disposed of is reported at the
     lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, less costs to
     sell. Subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition,
     depreciation expense is not recorded. The Company accounts for its
     Properties held for disposition in accordance with Statement of Financial
     Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"), "Accounting for the
     Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets". Accordingly, the results of
     operations for all assets sold or held for sale after January 1, 2003 have
     been classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

     (f) Cash and Cash Equivalents

          We consider all demand and money market accounts and certificates of
     deposit with a maturity, when purchased, of three months or less to be cash
     equivalents.

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (g) Notes Receivable

          Notes receivable generally are stated at their outstanding unpaid
     principal balances net of any deferred fees or costs on originated loans,
     or unamortized discounts or premiums net of a valuation allowance. Interest
     income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Discounts or premiums
     are amortized to income using the interest method. In certain cases we
     finance the sales of homes to our customers (referred to as "Chattel
     Loans") which loans are secured by the homes. The valuation allowance for
     the Chattel Loans is calculated based on a comparison of the outstanding
     principal balance of each note compared to the N.A.D.A. value and the
     current market value of the underlying manufactured home collateral.

     (h) Investments in Joint Ventures

          Investments in joint ventures in which the Company does not have a
     controlling direct or indirect voting interest, but can exercise
     significant influence over the entity with respect to its operations and
     major decisions, are accounted for using the equity method of accounting
     whereby the cost of an investment is adjusted for the Company's share of
     the equity in net income or loss from the date of acquisition and reduced
     by distributions received. The income or loss of each entity is allocated
     in accordance with the provisions of the applicable operating agreements.
     The allocation provisions in these agreements may differ from the ownership
     interests held by each investor. Differences between the carrying amount of
     the Company's investment in the respective entities and the Company's share
     of the underlying equity of such unconsolidated entities are amortized over
     the respective lives of the underlying assets, as applicable.

          In applying the provisions of FIN 46R (see Basis of Consolidation,
     above), the Company determined that its Mezzanine Investment is a VIE;
     however, the Company concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. As
     such, the adoption of this pronouncement had no effect on the Company's
     financial statements.

     (i) Insurance Claims

          The Properties are covered against fire, flood, property, earthquake,
     wind storm and business interruption by insurance policies containing
     various deductible requirements and coverage limits. Recoverable costs are
     classified in other assets as incurred. Proceeds are applied against the
     asset when received. Costs relating to capital items are treated in
     accordance with the Company's capitalization policy. The book value of the
     original capital item is written off in the replacement period. Insurance
     proceeds relating to the capital costs will be recorded as income in the
     period they are received.

     (j) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

          The Company's financial instruments include short-term investments,
     notes receivable, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other accrued
     expenses, mortgage notes payable and interest rate hedge arrangements. The
     fair values of all financial instruments, including notes receivable, were
     not materially different from their carrying values at December 31, 2004
     and 2003.

     (k) Deferred Financing Costs

          Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain
     long-term financing. The costs are being amortized over the terms of the
     respective loans on a level yield basis. Unamortized deferred financing
     fees are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date. Upon
     amendment of the Line of Credit, unamortized deferred financing fees are
     accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 98-14, "Debtor's Accounting for
     Changes in Line-of-Credit or Revolving-Debt Arrangements." Accumulated
     amortization for such costs was $4.9 million and $2.7 million at December
     31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (l) Revenue Recognition

          The Company accounts for leases with its customers as operating
     leases. Rental income is recognized over the term of the respective lease
     or the length of a customer's stay, the majority of which are for a term of
     not greater than one year. We will reserve for receivables when we believe
     the ultimate collection is less than probable. Our provision for
     uncollectable rents receivable was approximately $1.0 million as of
     December 31, 2004 and $0.8 million as of December 31, 2003. Income from
     home sales is recognized when the earnings process is complete. The
     earnings process is complete when the home has been delivered, the
     purchaser has accepted the home and title has transferred.

     (m) Minority Interests

          Net income is allocated to Common OP Unitholders based on their
     respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. An ownership
     percentage is represented by dividing the number of Common OP Units held by
     the Common OP Unitholders (6,340,805 and 5,312,387 at December 31, 2004 and
     2003, respectively) by OP Units and shares of Common Stock outstanding.
     Issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or Common OP Units changes
     the percentage ownership of both the Minority Interests and the Company.
     Due in part to the exchange rights (which provide for the conversion of
     Common OP Units into shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis), such
     transactions and the proceeds there from are treated as capital
     transactions and result in an allocation between stockholders' equity and
     Minority Interests to account for the change in the respective percentage
     ownership of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

     (n) Income Taxes

          Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT, the results of
     operations contain no provision for Federal income taxes. However, the
     Company may be subject to certain state and local income, excise or
     franchise taxes. We paid state and local taxes of approximately $88,000,
     $56,000 and $20,000 during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
     2002, respectively. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities
     managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal, state and
     local income taxes. As of December 31, 2004, net investment in real estate
     and notes receivable had a Federal tax basis of approximately $1,386
     million and $13.3 million, respectively.

     (o) Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

          We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
     Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
     income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
     changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the
     change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments
     through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the
     hedged item is recognized in earnings.

     (p) Reclassifications

          Certain 2003 and 2002 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
     2004 financial presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on the
     operations or equity as originally presented.

     (q) Stock Compensation

          Prior to January 1, 2003, we accounted for our stock compensation in
     accordance with APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees",
     based upon the intrinsic value method. This method results in no
     compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or
     exceeding the market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
     Effective January 1, 2003, we elected to account for our stock compensation
     in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148),
     "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", which resulted in compensation
     expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock options and
     other equity awards issued (see Note 14).

NOTE 4 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

     Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year. Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128") defines the calculation
of basic and fully diluted earnings per share. Basic and fully diluted earnings
per share are based on the weighted average shares outstanding during each year
and basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants
and convertible securities. The conversion of OP Units has been excluded from
the basic earnings per share calculation. The conversion of an OP Unit to a
share of Common Stock has no material effect on earnings per common share.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (amounts
in thousands):

     As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's percentage ownership of the
Operating Partnership was approximately 78.5% and 80%, respectively. The
remaining approximately 21.5% and 20%, respectively, is owned by the Common OP
Unitholders.

     On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125 million
private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Units ("POP
Units") with two institutional investors. The POP Units, which are callable by
the Company after five years, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption.
The Operating Partnership pays distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125
million of POP Units. Distributions on the POP Units are paid quarterly on the
last calendar day of each quarter.

     The following distributions have been declared and paid to common
stockholders and Minority Interests since January 1, 2002:

     On December 12, 2003, we declared a one-time special distribution of $8.00
per share payable to stockholders of record on January 8, 2004. We used proceeds
from the $501 million borrowing in October 2003 to pay the special distribution
on January 16, 2004. The special cash dividend was reflected on stockholders'
2004 1099-DIV issued in January 2005.

     In connection with the $501 million borrowing and subsequent special
distribution, on February 27, 2004, the Company contributed all of its assets to
MHC Trust, a newly formed Maryland real estate investment trust, including the
Company's entire partnership interest in Operating Partnership. The Company
determined that a taxable transaction in connection with the special
distribution to stockholders would be in the Company's best interests. This was
accomplished by the contribution of the Company's interest in the Operating
Partnership to MHC Trust in exchange for all the common and preferred stock of
MHC Trust. Due to the Company's tax basis in its interest in the Operating
Partnership, the Company

NOTE 5 - COMMON STOCK AND OTHER EQUITY RELATED TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

recognized $180 million of taxable income as a result of its contribution, as
opposed to a nontaxable reduction of the Company's tax basis in its interest in
the Operating Partnership. This restructuring resulted in a step-up in the
Company's tax basis in its assets, generating future depreciation deductions,
which in turn will reduce the Company's future distribution requirements. The
Company intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the Code, with its assets
consisting of interests in MHC Trust. MHC Trust, in turn, intends to also
qualify as a real estate investment trust under the Code and will be the general
partner of the Operating Partnership. On May 1, 2004, in connection with the
restructuring, MHC Trust sold cumulative preferred stock to a limited number of
unaffiliated investors.

     The Company adopted, effective July 1, 1997, the 1997 Non-Qualified
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). Pursuant to the ESPP, certain employees
and directors of the Company may each annually acquire up to $250,000 of Common
Stock of the Company. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available
under the ESPP shall not exceed 1,000,000, subject to adjustment by the
Company's Board of Directors. The Common Stock may be purchased monthly at a
price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share of Common
Stock on the last day of the offering period; and (b) the closing price for a
share of Common Stock on the first day of the offering period. Shares of Common
Stock issued through the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002 were 80,955, 82,943 and 71,107, respectively.

NOTE 6- INVESTMENT IN REAL ESTATE

     Land improvements consist primarily of improvements such as grading,
landscaping and infrastructure items such as streets, sidewalks or water mains.
Depreciable property consists of permanent buildings in the Properties such as
clubhouses, laundry facilities, maintenance storage facilities, and furniture,
fixtures and equipment.

     All acquisitions have been accounted for utilizing the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired assets are
included in the statements of operations from the dates of acquisition. We
acquired all of these Properties from unaffiliated third parties. During the
three years ended December 31, 2004, the Company acquired the following
Properties (amounts in millions, except site information):

NOTE 7 - INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES

     On February 3, 2004, the Company invested approximately $29.7 million in
preferred equity interests (the "Mezzanine Investment") in six entities
controlled by Diversified Investments, Inc. ("Diversified"). These entities own
in the aggregate 11 Properties, containing 5,054 sites. Approximately $11.7
million of the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a per annum average rate of 10%,
with a minimum per annum pay rate of 6.5%, payable quarterly, and approximately
$17.9 million of the Mezzanine Investment accrues at a per annum average rate of
11%, with a minimum pay rate of 7%, payable quarterly. To the extent the minimum
pay rates on the respective Mezzanine Investments are not achieved, the accrual
rates increase to 12% and 13% per annum, respectively. The Company can acquire
these Properties in the future at capitalization rates of between 8% and 8.5%,
beginning in 2006. In addition, the Company has invested approximately $1.4
million in the Diversified entities managing these 11 Properties, which is
included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the Company's Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2004.

     During the year ended December 31, 2004, the Company invested approximately
$4.1 million with Diversified in 11 separate property-owning entities. The
Company can acquire these Properties in the future at capitalization rates of
between 8% and 8.5%, beginning in 2006.

     The Company recorded approximately $3.7 million, $0.3 million, and $0.2
million of income from joint ventures, net of $1.2 million, $0.8 million and
$0.7 million depreciation, in the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002,
respectively; and received approximately $5.2 million, $0.8 million and $0.6
million in distributions from joint ventures in the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003, and 2002 respectively. Due to the Company's inability to control the
joint ventures, the Company accounts for its investment in the joint ventures
using the equity method of accounting.

approximately 37 of the Properties. Rental rate increases at these Properties
are primarily a function of increases in the Consumer Price Index, taking into
consideration certain floors and ceilings. Additionally, periodic market rate
adjustments are made as deemed appropriate. Future minimum rents are scheduled
to be received under non-cancelable tenant leases at December 31, 2004 as

NOTE 12 - GROUND LEASES

     The Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases at certain of
the Properties expiring in various years from 2022 to 2032 with terms which
require 12 equal payments per year plus additional rents calculated as a
percentage of gross revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and
2002, ground lease rent was approximately $1.6 million per year. Minimum future
rental payments under the ground leases are approximately $1.6 million for each
of the next five years and approximately $23.5 million thereafter.

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN AND STOCK GRANTS

     The Company's Stock Option and Stock Award Plan (the "Plan") was adopted in
December 1992 and amended and restated from time to time, most recently
effective March 23, 2001. Pursuant to the Plan, officers, directors, employees
and consultants of the Company are offered the opportunity (i) to acquire shares
of Common Stock through the grant of stock options ("Options"), including
non-qualified stock options and, for key employees, incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code; and (ii) to be
awarded shares of Common Stock ("Restricted Stock Grants"), subject to
conditions and restrictions determined by the Compensation, Nominating, and
Corporate Governance Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the
"Compensation Committee"). The Compensation Committee will determine the

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN AND STOCK GRANTS (CONTINUED)

vesting schedule, if any, of each Option and the term, which term shall not
exceed ten years from the date of grant. As to the Options that have been
granted through December 31, 2004 to officers, employees and consultants,
generally, one-third are exercisable one year after the initial grant, one-third
are exercisable two years following the date such Options were granted and the
remaining one-third are exercisable three years following the date such Options
were granted. A maximum of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock are available for
grant under the Plan and no more than 250,000 shares may be subject to grants to
any one individual in any calendar year.

     Grants under the Plan are made by the Compensation Committee, which
determines the individuals eligible to receive awards, the types of awards, and
the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to any award. In addition, the
terms of two specific types of awards are contemplated under the Plan:

     -    The first type of award is a grant of Options or Restricted Stock
          Grants of Common Stock made to each member of the Board at the meeting
          held immediately after each annual meeting of the Company's
          stockholders. Generally, if the director elects to receive Options,
          the grant will cover 10,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
          price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. If the
          director elects to receive a Restricted Stock Grant of Common Stock,
          he or she will receive an award of 2,000 shares of Common Stock.
          Exercisability or vesting with respect to either type of award will be
          with respect to one-third of the award after six months, two-thirds of
          the award after one year, and the full award after two years.

     -    The second type of award is a grant of Common Stock in lieu of 50% of
          their bonus otherwise payable to individuals with a title of Vice
          President or above. A recipient can request that the Compensation
          Committee pay a greater or lesser portion of the bonus in shares of
          Common Stock.

     Prior to 2003, we accounted for our stock compensation in accordance with
APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", based upon the intrinsic
value method. This method results in no compensation expense for Options issued
with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Common
Stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, we elected to account for
our stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment
(SFAS No. 148), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", which will result in
compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the Options and
other equity awards issued. SFAS No. 148 provides three possible transition
methods for changing to the fair value method. We have elected to use the
modified-prospective method. This method requires that we recognize stock-based
employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the
recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value method had been
used to account for all employee awards granted, or settled in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994. The following table illustrates the effect on
net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method was applied to all
outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented (amounts in thousands,

     Restricted Stock Grants

     In 2002, the Company awarded Restricted Stock Grants for 69,750 shares of
Common Stock to certain members of senior management of the Company. These
Restricted Stock Grants vest over three years, but may be restricted for a
period of up to ten years depending upon certain performance benchmarks tied to
increases in funds from operations being met. The fair market value of these
Restricted Stock Grants of approximately $2.2 million as of the date of grant
was treated in 2002 as deferred compensation and amortized in accordance with
their vesting.

     In 2004, the Company awarded Restricted Stock Grants for 135,000 shares of
Common Stock to certain members of senior management of the Company. These
Restricted Stock Grants vest over three years, but may be restricted for a
period of up to ten years depending upon certain performance benchmarks tied to
increases in funds from operations being met. The fair market value of these
Restricted Stock Grants was approximately $5.0 million as of the date of grant
and is recorded as compensation expense and paid in capital over the three year
vesting period.

     In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company awarded Restricted Stock Grants for
40,000, 35,000 and 16,000 shares of Common Stock, respectively, to directors
with a fair market value of approximately $1,386,000, $733,000 and $376,000 in
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     The Company recognized compensation expense of approximately $2.7, $1.8 and
$1.5 million related to Restricted Stock Grants in 2004, 2003 and 2002
respectively. The balance of unamortized deferred compensation as of December
31, 2004 and 2003 was approximately $0.2 and $0.5 million, respectively.

more series, 10,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock (the "Preferred
Stock"), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board may
determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to
the rights of holders of the Company's Common Stock. However, under certain
circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock may require stockholder approval
pursuant to the rules and regulations of The New York Stock Exchange. As of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, no Preferred Stock was issued by the Company.

NOTE 16 - SAVINGS PLAN

     The Company has a qualified retirement plan, with a salary deferral feature
designed to qualify under Section 401 of the Code (the "401(k) Plan"), to cover
its employees and those of its Subsidiaries, if any. The 401(k) Plan permits
eligible employees of the Company and those of any Subsidiary to defer up to 19%
of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis subject to certain maximum
amounts. In addition, the Company will match dollar-for-dollar the participant's
contribution up to 4% of the participant's eligible compensation.

     In addition, amounts contributed by the Company will vest, on a prorated
basis, according to the participant's vesting schedule. After five years of
employment with the Company, the participants will be 100% vested for all
amounts contributed by the Company. Additionally, a discretionary profit sharing
component of the 401(k) Plan provides for a contribution to be made annually for
each participant in an amount, if any, as determined by the Company. All
employee contributions are 100% vested. The Company's contribution to the 401(k)
Plan was approximately $545,271, $240,000, and $248,000, for the years ended
December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

     The Company has established a supplemental executive retirement plan (the
"SERP") to provide certain officers and directors an opportunity to defer a
portion of their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement and for
the education of their children. The SERP is restricted to investments in
Company common shares, certain marketable securities that have been specifically
approved, or cash equivalents. In accordance with EITF 97-14 "Accounting for
Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi
Trust and Invested", the deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP
and the securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are
consolidated by the Company on the balance sheet. Assets held in the SERP are
included in other assets and are classified as trading securities and reported
at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Company
shares held in the SERP are classified in stockholders equity due to the
inability of the Company to repurchase these shares.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

DEANZA SANTA CRUZ

     The customers of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a Property located in
Santa Cruz, California, brought several actions opposing fees and charges in
connection with water service at the Property. As a result of one action, the
Company rebated approximately $36,000 to the customers. The DeAnza Santa Cruz
Homeowners Association ("HOA") then proceeded to a jury trial alleging these
"overcharges" entitled them to an award of punitive damages. In January 1999, a
jury awarded the HOA $6.0 million in punitive damages. On December 21, 2001 the
California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District reversed the $6.0 million
punitive damage award, the related award of attorneys' fees, and, as a result,
all post-judgment interest thereon, on the basis that punitive damages are not
available as a remedy for a statutory violation of the California Mobilehome
Residency Law ("MRL"). The decision of the appellate court left the HOA, the
plaintiff in this matter, with the right to seek a new trial in which it must
prove its entitlement to either the statutory penalty and attorneys' fees
available under the MRL or punitive damages based on causes of action for fraud,
misrepresentation or other tort. In order to resolve this matter, the Company
accrued for and agreed to pay $201,000 to the HOA. This payment resolved the
punitive damages claim. The HOA's attorney made a motion asking for an award of
attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of approximately $1.5 million as a
result of this resolution of the litigation. On April 2, 2003 the court awarded
attorney's fees to the HOA's attorney in the amount of $593,000 and court costs
of approximately $20,000. The Company appealed this award. On July 13, 2004, the
California Court of Appeal affirmed the award of attorney's fees in favor of the
HOA's attorney.

OTHER CALIFORNIA RENT CONTROL LITIGATION

     As part of the Company's effort to realize the value of its Properties
subject to rent control, the Company has initiated lawsuits against several
municipalities in California. The Company's goal is to achieve a level of
regulatory fairness in California's rent control jurisdictions, and in
particular those jurisdictions that prohibit increasing rents to market upon
turnover. This regulatory feature, called vacancy control, allows tenants to
sell their homes for a premium representing the value of the future discounted
rent-controlled rents. In the Company's view, such regulation results in a
transfer of the value of the Company's stockholders' land, which would otherwise
be reflected in market rents, to tenants upon the sales of their

homes in the form of an inflated purchase price that cannot be attributed to the
value of the home being sold. As a result, in the Company's view, the Company
loses the value of its asset and the selling tenant leaves the Property with a
windfall premium. The Company has discovered through the litigation process that
certain municipalities considered condemning the Company's Properties at values
well below the value of the underlying land. In the Company's view, a failure to
articulate market rents for sites governed by restrictive rent control would put
the Company at risk for condemnation or eminent domain proceedings based on
artificially reduced rents. Such a physical taking, should it occur, could
represent substantial lost value to stockholders. The Company is cognizant of
the need for affordable housing in the jurisdictions, but asserts that
restrictive rent regulation with vacancy control does not promote this purpose
because the benefits of such regulation are fully capitalized into the prices of
the homes sold. The Company estimates that the annual rent subsidy to tenants in
these jurisdictions is approximately $15 million. In a more well balanced
regulatory environment, the Company would receive market rents that would
eliminate the subsidy and homes would trade at or near their intrinsic value.

     In connection with such efforts, the Company announced it has entered into
a settlement agreement with the City of Santa Cruz, California and that,
pursuant to the settlement agreement, the City amended its rent control
ordinance to exempt the Company's Property from rent control as long as the
Company offers a long term lease which gives the Company the ability to increase
rents to market upon turnover and bases annual rent increases on the CPI. The
settlement agreement benefits the Company's stockholders by allowing them to
receive the value of their investment in this Property through vacancy decontrol
while preserving annual CPI based rent increases in this age restricted
Property.

     The Company has filed two lawsuits in Federal court against the City of San
Rafael, challenging its rent control ordinance on constitutional grounds. The
Company believes that one of those lawsuits was settled by the City agreeing to
amend the ordinance to permit adjustments to market rent upon turnover. The City
subsequently rejected the settlement agreement. The Court initially found the
settlement agreement was binding on the City, but then reconsidered and
determined to submit the claim of breach of the settlement agreement to a jury.
In October 2002, the first case against the City went to trial, based on both
breach of the settlement agreement and the constitutional claims. A jury found
no breach of the settlement agreement; the Company then filed motions asking the
Court to rule in its favor on that claim, notwithstanding the jury verdict. The
Court has postponed decision on those motions and on the constitutional claims,
pending a ruling on some property rights issues by the United States Supreme
Court. In the event that the Court does not rule in favor of the Company on
either the settlement agreement or the constitutional claims, then the Company
has pending claims seeking a declaration that it can close the Property and
convert it to another use.

     The Company's efforts to achieve a balanced regulatory environment
incentivize tenant groups to file lawsuits against the Company seeking large
damage awards. The homeowners association at Contempo Marin ("CMHOA"), a 396
site Property in San Rafael, California, sued the Company in December 2000 over
a prior settlement agreement on a capital expenditure pass-through after the
Company sued the City of San Rafael in October 2000 alleging its rent control
ordinance is unconstitutional. In the Contempo Marin case, the CMHOA prevailed
on a motion for summary judgment on an issue that permits the Company to collect
only $3.72 out of a monthly pass-through amount of $7.50 that the Company
believes had been agreed to by the CMHOA in a settlement agreement. On May 23,
2004, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's order dismissing
the Company's claims against the City of San Rafael. The trial court has set a
trial date in the second quarter of 2005 on the CMHOA's remaining claims for
damages. The Company intends to vigorously defend this matter. The Company
believes that such lawsuits will be a consequence of the Company's efforts to
change rent control since tenant groups actively desire to preserve the premium
value of their homes in addition to the discounted rents provided by rent
control. The Company has determined that its efforts to rebalance the regulatory
environment despite the risk of litigation from tenant groups are necessary not
only because of the $15 million annual subsidy to tenants, but also because of
the condemnation risk.

     Similarly, in June 2003, the Company won a judgment against the City of
Santee in California Superior Court (case no. 777094). The effect of the
judgment was to invalidate, on state law grounds, two (2) rent control
ordinances the City of Santee had enforced against the Company and other
property owners. However, the Court allowed the City to continue to enforce a
rent control ordinance that predated the two invalid ordinances (the "prior
ordinance"). As a result of the judgment the Company was entitled to collect a
one-time rent increase based upon the difference in annual adjustments between
the invalid ordinance(s) and the prior ordinances and to adjust its base rents
to reflect what the Company could have charged had the prior ordinance been
continually in effect. The City of Santee appealed the judgment. The court of
appeal and California Supreme Court refused to stay enforcement of these rent
adjustments pending appeal. After the City was unable to obtain a

stay, the City and the tenant association each sued the Company in separate
actions alleging the rent adjustments pursuant to the judgment violate the prior
ordinance (Case Nos. GIE 020887 and GIE 020524). They seek to rescind the rent
adjustments, refunds of amounts paid, and penalties and damages in these
separate actions. On January 25, 2005, the California Court of Appeal reversed
the judgment in part and affirmed it in part with a remand. The Court of Appeal
affirmed that one ordinance was unlawfully adopted and therefore void and that
the second ordinance contained unconstitutional provisions. However, the Court
ruled the City had the authority to cure the issues with the first ordinance
retroactively. On remand the trial court is directed to decide the issue of
damages to the Company which the Company believes is consistent with the Company
receiving the economic benefit of invalidating one of the ordinances and also
consistent with the Company's position that it is entitled to market rent and
not merely a higher amount of regulated rent. The Company will petition the
Supreme Court of California for review of certain aspects of this decision. The
Company intends to vigorously defend the two new lawsuits. In addition, the
Company has sued the City of Santee in Federal court alleging all three of the
ordinances are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution because they fail to substantially advance a legitimate state
interest. Thus, it is the Company's position that the ordinances are subject to
invalidation as a matter of law in the Federal court action. Separately, the
Federal District Court granted the City's Motion for Summary Judgment in the
Company's Federal Court lawsuit. This decision was based not on the merits, but
on procedural grounds, including that the Company's claims were moot given its
success in the state court case. The Company intends to appeal this ruling and
believes the outcome will be affected by the cases currently before the Ninth
Circuit and United States Supreme Court.

     Moreover, in July 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal decided the case
of Cashman v. City of Cotati, a Property owner's challenge to the City's rent
control ordinance, and stated that a rent control ordinance that does not on its
face provide for a mechanism to prevent the capture of a premium is
unconstitutional, as a matter of law, absent sufficient externalities rendering
a premium unavailable. This reasoning supports the legal position the Company
has put forth in its opposition to rent control in general and vacancy control
in particular. The City of Cotati has petitioned the Ninth Circuit for rehearing
and that petition is pending. In addition, in October 2004, the United States
Supreme Court granted certiorari in State of Hawaii vs. Chevron USA, Inc., a
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal case that upholds the standard that a regulation
must substantially advance a legitimate state purpose in order to be
constitutionally viable. The case was argued before the United States Supreme
Court on February 22, 2005. The ultimate outcome of these cases will guide the
Company's continued efforts to realize the value of its Properties which are
subject to rent control and the Company's efforts to achieve a level of
regulatory fairness in rent control jurisdictions.

                       MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES, INC.

THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT:

      FIRST: The charter of Manufactured Home Communities, Inc., a Maryland

            "SECTION 1. NUMBER AND TERM. The number of directors constituting
      the entire Board of Directors shall be established in the manner provided
      in the Bylaws of the Corporation; provided, however, that (a) if there is
      stock outstanding and so long as there are three or more stockholders, the
      number of directors shall never be less than three and (b) if there is
      stock outstanding and so long as there are less than three stockholders,
      the number of directors may be less than three but not less than the
      number of stockholders. The directors of the Corporation shall be elected
      by the stockholders entitled to vote thereon at each annual meeting of
      stockholders and shall hold office until the next annual meeting of
      stockholders and until their successors are elected and qualify. The term
      of the directors in office on May 14, 2003 shall expire at the annual
      meeting of stockholders next occurring after May 14, 2003 upon the
      election and qualification of their successors."

      SECOND: The amendment to the charter of the Corporation as set forth above
has been duly advised by the Board of Directors and approved by the stockholders
of the Corporation as required by law.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Corporation has caused these Articles of Amendment
to be signed in its name and on its behalf by its Chief Executive Officer and
attested to by its Secretary on this 13th day of May, 2003.

                       MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES, INC.

                           AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS

                (INCLUDING AMENDMENTS THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2003)

                                    ARTICLE I

                                     OFFICES

      Section 1. PRINCIPAL OFFICE. The principal office of the Corporation shall
be located at such place or places as the Board of Directors may designate.

      Section 2. ADDITIONAL OFFICES. The Corporation may have additional offices
at such places as the Board of Directors may from time to time determine or the
business of the Corporation may require.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS

      Section 1. PLACE. All meetings of stockholders shall be held at the
principal office of the Corporation or at such other place within the United
States as shall be stated in the notice of the meeting.

      Section 2. ANNUAL MEETING. An annual meeting of the stockholders for the
election of directors and the transaction of any business within the powers of
the Corporation shall be held on a date and at the time set by the Board of
Directors during the month of February in 1993 and during the month of May in
each year thereafter.

      Section 3. SPECIAL MEETINGS. The president, chief, executive officer or
Board of Directors may call special meetings of the stockholders. Special
meetings of stockholders shall also be called by the secretary upon the written
request of the holders of shares entitled to cast not less than ten percent of
all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting. Such request shall state the
purpose of such meeting and the matters proposed to be acted on at such meeting.
The secretary shall inform such stockholders of the reasonably estimated cost of
preparing and mailing notice of the meeting and, upon payment to the Corporation
of such costs, the secretary shall give notice to each stockholder entitled to
notice of the meeting. Unless requested by the stockholders entitled to cast a
majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at such meeting, a special meeting
need not be called to consider any matter

<PAGE>

which is substantially the same as a matter voted on at any special meeting of
the stockholders held during the preceding twelve months.

      Section 4. NOTICE. Not less than ten nor more than 90 days before each
meeting of stockholders, the secretary shall give to each stockholder entitled
to vote at such meeting and to each stockholder not entitled to vote who is
entitled to notice of the meeting written or printed notice stating the time and
place of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting or as otherwise may
be required by statute, the purpose for which the meeting is called, either by
mail or by presenting it to such stockholder personally or by leaving it at his
residence or usual place of business. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to
be given when deposited in the United States mail addressed to the stockholder
at his post office address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with
postage thereon prepaid.

      Section 5. SCOPE OF NOTICE. Any business of the Corporation may be
transacted at an annual meeting of stockholders without being specifically
designated in the notice, except such business as is required by statute to be
stated in such notice. No business shall be transacted at a special meeting of
stockholders except as specifically designated in the notice.

      Section 6. QUORUM. At any meeting of stockholders, the presence in person
or by proxy of stockholders entitled to cast a majority of all the votes
entitled to be cast at such meeting shall constitute a quorum; but this section
shall not affect any requirement under any statute or the Charter of Corporation
for the vote necessary for the adoption of any measure. If, however, such quorum
shall not be present at any meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders
entitled to vote at such meeting, present in person or by proxy, shall have
power to adjourn the meeting from time to time to a date not more than 120 days
after the original record date without notice other than announcement at the
meeting. At such adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present, any
business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as
originally notified.

      Section 7. VOTING. A plurality of all the votes cast at a meeting of
stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to
elect a director. Each share may be voted for as many individuals as there are
directors to be elected and for whose election the share is entitled to be
voted. A majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and
at which a quorum is present shall be sufficient to approve any other matter
which may properly come before the meeting, unless more than a majority of the
votes cast is required by statute or by the Charter of Corporation. Unless
otherwise provided in the Charter, each outstanding share, regardless of class,
shall be entitled to one vote on each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of
stockholders.

                                       2
<PAGE>

      Section 8. PROXIES. A stockholder may vote the stock owned of record by
him, either in person or by proxy executed, in writing by the stockholder or by
his duly authorized attorney in fact. Such proxy shall be filed with the
secretary of the Corporation before or at the time of the meeting. No proxy
shall be valid after eleven months from the date of its execution, unless
otherwise provided in the proxy.

      Section 9. VOTING OF STOCK BY CERTAIN HOLDERS. Stock registered in the
name of a corporation, partnership, trust or other entity, if entitled to be
voted, may be voted by the president or a vice president, a general partner or
trustee thereof, as the case may be, or a proxy appointed by any of the
foregoing individuals, unless some other person who has been appointed to vote
such stock pursuant to a bylaw or a resolution of the board of directors of such
corporation or other entity presents a certified copy of such bylaw or
resolution, in which case such person may vote such stock. Any director or other
fiduciary may vote stock registered in his name as such fiduciary, either in
person or by proxy.

            Shares of stock of the Corporation directly or indirectly owned by
it shall not be voted at any meeting and shall not be counted in determining the
total number of outstanding shares entitled to be voted at any given time,
unless they are held by it in a fiduciary capacity, in which case they may be
voted and shall be counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares
at any given time.

            The Board of Directors may adopt by resolution a procedure by which
a stockholder may certify in writing to the Corporation that any shares of stock
registered in the name of the stockholder are held for the account of a
specified person other than the stockholder. The resolution shall set forth the
class of stockholders who may make the certification, the purpose for which the
certification may be made, the form of certification and the information to be
contained in it; if the certification is with respect to a record date or
closing of the stock transfer books, the time after the record date or closing
of the stock transfer books within which the certification must be received by
the Corporation; and any other provisions with respect to the procedure which
the Board of Directors considers necessary or desirable. On receipt of such
certification, the person specified in the certification shall be regarded as,
for the purposes set forth in the certification, the stockholder of record of
the specified stock in place of the stockholder who makes the certification.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of the Charter of the
Corporation or these Bylaws, Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the Corporations and
Associations Article of the Annotated Code of Maryland (or any successor
statute) shall not apply to any acquisition by any person of stock of the
Corporation.

      Section 10. INSPECTORS. At any meeting of stockholders, the chairman of
the meeting may, or upon the request of any stockholder

                                       3
<PAGE>

shall, appoint one or more persons as inspectors for such meeting. Such
inspectors shall ascertain and report the number of shares represented at the
meeting based upon their determination of the validity and effect of proxies,
count all votes, report the results and perform such other acts as are proper to
conduct the election and voting with impartiality and fairness to all the
stockholders.

            Each report of an inspector shall be in writing and signed by him or
by a majority of them if there is more than one inspector acting at such
meeting. If there is more than one inspector, the report of a majority shall be
the report of the inspectors. The report of the inspector or inspectors on the
number of shares represented at the meeting and the results of the voting shall
be prima facie evidence thereof.

      Section 11. NOMINATIONS AND STOCKHOLDER BUSINESS

            (a) ANNUAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS. (1) Nominations of persons for
election to the Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered
by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting of stockholders (i)
pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of
the Board of Directors or (iii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who was a
stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice provided for in this
Section 11(a), who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who complied with the
notice procedures set forth in this Section 11(a).

                  (2) For nominations or other business to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (iii) of paragraph
(a)(1) of this Section 11, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof
in writing to the secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's
notice shall be delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of
the Corporation not less than 60 days nor more than 90 days prior to the first
anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that in
the event that the date of the annual meeting is advanced by more than 30 days
or delayed by more than 60 days from such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 90th day
prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of business on the
later of the 60th day prior to such annual meeting or the tenth day following
the day on which public announcement of the date of such meeting is first made.
Such stockholder's notice shall set forth (i) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or reelection as a director all
information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in
solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required, in
each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Exchange Act") (including such person's written consent to
being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if
elected); (ii) as to any other business that the stockholder proposes to bring
before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to

                                       4
<PAGE>

be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the
meeting and any material interest in such business of such stockholder and of
the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (iii) as
to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose
behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (x) the name and address of such
stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation's books, and of such beneficial
owner and (y) the class and number of shares of stock of the Corporation which
are owned beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such beneficial
owner.

                  (3) Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of
paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 11 to the contrary, in the event that the
number of directors to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and
there is no public announcement naming all of the nominees for director or
specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors made by the Corporation
at least 70 days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year's annual
meeting, a stockholder's notice required by this Section 11(a) shall also be
considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions
created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the tenth day following the day on which such public announcement is
first made by the Corporation.

      (b) SPECIAL MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS. Only such business shall be
conducted at a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before
the meeting pursuant to the Corporation's notice of meeting. Nominations of
persons for election to the Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting
of stockholders at which directors are to be elected (i) pursuant to the
Corporation's notice of meeting, (ii) by or at the direction of the Board of
Directors or (iii) provided that the Board of Directors has determined that
directors shall be elected at such special meeting, by any stockholder of the
Corporation who is a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice
provided for in this Section 11(b), who is entitled to vote at the meeting and
who complied with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 11(b). In the
event the Corporation calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of
electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such stockholder
may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be) for election to such
position as specified in the Corporation's notice of meeting, if the
stockholder's notice required by paragraph (a)(2) of this Section 11(b) shall be
delivered to the secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation
not earlier than the 90th day prior to such special meeting and not later than
the close of business on the later of the 60th day prior to such special meeting
or the tenth day following the day on which public announcement is first made of
the date of the special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of
Directors to be elected at such meeting.

                                       5
<PAGE>

      (c) GENERAL. (1) Only such persons who are nominated in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 11 shall be eligible to serve as
directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders
as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Section 11. The presiding officer of the meeting shall have
the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or, any business proposed
to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 11 and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in
compliance with this Section 11, to declare that such defective nomination or
proposal be disregarded.

                  (2) For purposes of this Section 11, "public announcement"
shall mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones New Service,
Associated Press or comparable news service or in a document publicly filed by
the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sections
13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

                  (3) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
11, a stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of state
law and of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with
respect to the matters set forth in this Section 11. Nothing in this Section 11
shall be deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of
proposals in the Corporation's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the
Exchange Act.

      Section 12. INFORMAL ACTION BY STOCKHOLDERS. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at a meeting of stockholders may be taken without a
meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth such action, is signed by each
stockholder entitled, to vote on the matter and any other stockholder entitled
to notice of a meeting of stockholders (but not to vote thereat) has waived in
writing any right to dissent from such action, and such consent and waiver are
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the stockholders.

      Section 13. VOTING BY BALLOT. Voting on any question or in any election
may be viva voce unless the presiding officer shall order or any stockholder
shall demand that voting be by ballot.

                                   ARTICLE III

                                    DIRECTORS

Corporation shall be managed under the direction of its Board of Directors.

      Section 2. NUMBER, TENURE AND QUALIFICATIONS. At any regular meeting or at
any special meeting called for that purpose, a majority of the entire Board of
Directors may establish, increase or

                                       6
<PAGE>

decrease the number of directors, provided that the number thereof shall never
be less than the minimum number required by the Maryland General Corporation
Law, nor more than 15, and further provided that the tenure of office of a
director shall not be affected by any decrease in the number of directors. The
directors of the Corporation shall be elected by the stockholders entitled to
vote thereon at each annual meeting of stockholders and shall hold office until
the next annual meeting of stockholders and until their successors are elected
and qualify.

      Section 3. ANNUAL AND REGULAR MEETINGS. An annual meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held immediately after and at the same place as the annual
meeting of stockholders, no notice other than this Bylaw being necessary. The
Board of Directors may provide, by resolution, the time and place, either within
or without the State of Maryland, for the holding of regular meetings of the
Board of Directors without other notice than such resolution.

      Section 4. SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be called by or at the request of the chairman of the board (or any
co-chairman of the board if more than one), president or by a majority of the
directors then in office. The person or persons authorized to call special
meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any place, either within or without
the State of Maryland, as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board
of Directors called by them.

      Section 5. NOTICE. Notice of any special meeting shall be given by written
notice delivered personally, transmitted by facsimile, telegraphed or mailed to
each director at his business or residence address. Personally delivered,
facsimile transmitted or telegraphed notices shall be given at least two days
prior to the meeting. Notice by mail shall be given at least five days prior to
the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited
in the United States mail properly addressed, with postage thereon prepaid. If
given by telegram, such notice shall be deemed to be given when the telegram is
delivered to the telegraph company. Neither the business to be transacted at,
nor the purpose of, any annual, regular or special meeting of the Board of
Directors need be stated in the notice, unless specifically required by statute
or these Bylaws.

      Section 6. QUORUM. A majority of the directors shall constitute a quorum
for transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, provided
that, if less than a majority of such directors are present at said meeting, a
majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time
without further notice, and provided further that if, pursuant to the Charter of
the Corporation or these Bylaws, the vote of a majority of a particular group of
directors is required for action, a quorum must also include a majority of such
group.

            The Board of Directors present at a meeting which has been duly
called and convened may continue to transact business

                                       7
<PAGE>

until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough directors to leave
less than a quorum.

      Section 7. VOTING. The action of the majority of the directors present at
a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the action of the Board of
Directors, unless the concurrence of a greater proportion is required for such
action by applicable statute.

      Section 8. TELEPHONE MEETINGS. Directors may participate in a meeting by
means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment if all
persons participating in the meeting can hear each other at the same time.

such written consent is filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of
Directors.

      Section 10. VACANCIES. If for any reason any or all the directors cease to
be directors, such event shall not terminate the Corporation or affect these
Bylaws or the powers of the remaining directors hereunder (even if fewer than
three directors remain). Any vacancy on the Board of Directors for any cause
other than an increase in the number of directors shall be filled by a majority
of the remaining directors, although such majority is less than a quorum. Any
vacancy in the number of directors created by an increase in the number of
directors may be filled by a majority vote of the entire Board of Directors. Any
individual so elected as director shall hold office for the unexpired term of
the director he is replacing.

      Section 11. COMPENSATION. Directors shall not receive any stated salary
for their services as directors but, by resolution of the Board of Directors,
fixed sums per year and/or per meeting. Expenses of attendance, if any, may be
allowed to directors for attendance at each annual, regular or special meeting
of the Board of Directors or of any committee thereof; but nothing herein
contained shall be construed to preclude any directors from serving the
Corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor.

      Section 12. REMOVAL OF DIRECTORS. The stockholders may remove any director
for cause, in the manner provided in the Charter of Corporation.

      Section 13. LOSS OF DEPOSITS. No director shall be liable for any loss

loan association, or other institution with whom moneys or stock have been
deposited.

to act in reliance in good faith upon the books of account or other records of
the Corporation, upon an opinion of counsel or upon reports made to the
Corporation by any of its officers or employees or by the adviser, accountants,
appraisers or other experts or consultants selected by the Board of Directors or
officers of the Corporation, regardless of whether such counsel or expert may
also be a director.

      Section 16. CERTAIN RIGHTS OF DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS.
The directors shall have no responsibility to devote their full time to the

interests and engage in business activities similar to or in addition to those
of or relating to the Corporation.

quorum, may appoint another director to act in the place of such absent member.

      Section 4. TELEPHONE MEETINGS. Members of a committee of the Board of
Directors may participate in a meeting by means of a conference telephone or

shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.

      Section 5. INFORMAL ACTION BY COMMITTEES. Any action required or permitted
to be taken at any meeting of a committee of the Board of Directors may be taken
without a meeting, if a consent in writing

the manner hereinafter provided. Any two or more offices except president and
vice president may be held by the same person. In its discretion, the Board of
Directors may leave unfilled any office except that of president, treasurer and
secretary. Election of an officer or agent shall not of itself create contract
rights between the Corporation and such officer or agent.

      Section 2. REMOVAL AND RESIGNATION. Any officer or agent of the
Corporation may be removed by the Board of Directors if in its judgment the best
interests of the Corporation would be served thereby, but such removal shall be

officer of the Corporation may resign at any time by giving written notice of
his resignation to the Board of Directors, the chairman of the board (or any
co-chairman of the board if more than one), the president or the secretary. Any
resignation shall take effect at any time subsequent to the time specified

or them by the Board of Directors.

event of a vacancy in such office, the vice president (or in the event there be
more than one vice president, the vice presidents in the order designated at the
time of their election or, in the absence of any designation, then in the order
of their election) shall perform the duties of the president and when so acting
shall have all the powers of and be subject to all the restrictions upon the

     Section 1. CERTIFICATES. Each stockholder shall be entitled to a
certificate or certificates which shall represent and certify the number of
shares of each class of stock held by him in the Corporation. Each certificate
shall be signed by the chief executive officer, the president or a vice
president and countersigned by the secretary or an assistant secretary or the
treasurer or an assistant treasurer and may be sealed with the seal, if any, of
the Corporation. The signatures may be either manual or facsimile. Certificates
shall be consecutively numbered; and if the Corporation shall, from time to
time, issue several classes of stock, each class may have its own number series.
A certificate is valid and may be issued whether or not an officer who signed it
is still an officer when it is issued. Each certificate representing shares
which are restricted as to their transferability or voting powers, which are
preferred or limited as to their dividends or as to their allocable portion of
the assets upon liquidation or which are redeemable at the option of the
Corporation, shall have a statement of such restriction, limitation, preference
or redemption provision, or a summary thereof, plainly stated on the
certificate. In lieu of such statement or summary, the Corporation may set forth
upon the face or back of the certificate a statement that the Corporation will

                                       13
<PAGE>

furnish to any stockholder, upon request and without charge, a full statement of
such information.

      Section 2. TRANSFERS. Upon surrender to the Corporation or the transfer
agent of the Corporation of a stock certificate duly endorsed or accompanied by
proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer, the
Corporation shall issue a new certificate to the person entitled thereto, cancel
the old certificate and record the transaction upon its books.

            The Corporation shall be entitled to treat the holder of record of
any share of stock as the holder in fact thereof and, accordingly, shall not be
bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share on
the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have express or other
notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of the State of
Maryland.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, transfers of shares of any class of
stock will be subject in all respects to the Charter of the Corporation and all
of the terms and conditions contained therein.

      Section 3. LOST CERTIFICATE. The Board of Directors(or any officer
designated by it) may direct a new certificate to be issued in place of any
certificate previously issued by the Corporation alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming the certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing the
issuance of a new certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed certificate or his legal representative to advertise
the same in such manner as they shall require and/or to give bond, with
sufficient surety, to the Corporation to indemnify it against any loss or claim
which may arise as a result of the issuance of a new certificate.

      Section 4. CLOSING OF TRANSFER BOOKS OR FIXING OF RECORD DATE. The Board
of Directors may set, in advance, a record date for the purpose of determining
stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders, or
stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or the allotment of any
other rights, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for any other
proper purpose. Such date, in any case, shall not be prior to the close of
business on the day the record date is fixed and shall be not more than 90 days
and, in the case of a meeting of stockholders, not less than ten days, before
the date on which the meeting or particular action requiring such determination
of stockholders is to be held or taken.

            In lieu of fixing a record date, the Board of Directors may provide
that the stock transfer books shall be closed for a stated period but not longer
than 20 days. If the stock transfer books are closed for the purpose of
determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders, such

                                       14
<PAGE>

books shall be closed for at least ten days before the date of such meeting.

            If no record date is fixed and the stock transfer books are not
closed for the determination of stockholders, (a) the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day on which the notice of
meeting is mailed or the 30th day before the meeting, whichever is the closer
date to the meeting; and (b) the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to receive payment of a dividend or an allotment of any
other rights shall be the close of business on the day on which the resolution
of the directors, declaring the dividend or allotment of rights, is adopted.

            When a determination of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting
of stockholders has been made as provided in this section, such determination
shall apply to any adjournment thereof, except where the determination has been
made through the closing of the transfer books and the stated period of closing
has expired.

      Section 5. STOCK LEDGER. The Corporation shall maintain at its principal
office or at the office of its counsel, accountants or transfer agent, an
original or duplicate share ledger containing the name and address of each
stockholder and the number of shares of each class held by such stockholder.

      Section 6. FRACTIONAL STOCK; ISSUANCE OF UNITS. The Board of Directors may
issue fractional stock or provide for the issuance of scrip, all on such terms
and under such conditions as they may determine. Notwithstanding any other
provision of the Charter or these Bylaws, the Board of Directors may issue units
consisting of different securities of the Corporation. Any security issued in a
unit shall have the same characteristics as any identical securities issued by
the Corporation, except that the Board of Directors may provide that for a
specified period securities of the Corporation issued in such unit may be
transferred on the books of the Corporation only in such unit.

      Section 2. CONTINGENCIES. Before payment of any dividends, there may be
set aside out of any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum
or sums as the Board of Directors may from time to time, in its absolute
discretion, think proper as a reserve fund for contingencies, for equalizing
dividends, for repairing or maintaining any property of the Corporation or for
such other purpose as the Board of Directors shall determine to be in the best
interest of the Corporation, and the Board of Directors may modify or abolish
any such reserve in the manner in which it was created.

                                    ARTICLE X

                                INVESTMENT POLICY

            Subject to the provisions of the Charter of the Corporation, the
Board of Directors may from time to time adopt, amend, revise or terminate any
policy or policies with respect to investments by the Corporation as it shall
deem appropriate in its sole discretion.

                                   ARTICLE XI

      Section 1. SEAL. The Board of Directors may authorize the adoption of a
seal by the Corporation. The seal shall have inscribed thereon the name of the
Corporation and the year of its organization. The Board of Directors may
authorize one or more duplicate seals and provide for the custody thereof.

      Section 2. AFFIXING SEAL. Whenever the Corporation is required to place
its seal to a document, it shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of any
law, rule or regulation relating to a seal to place the word "(SEAL)" adjacent
to the signature of the person authorized to execute the document on behalf of
the Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE XII

<PAGE>

resolution mechanism, investigation, administrative hearing or any other
proceeding, including appeals therefrom, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative (hereinafter, a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or
she is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at
the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, trustee,
employee or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise, whether conducted for profit or not
for profit (hereinafter, an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding
is an alleged action or omission in an official capacity or in any other
capacity by reason of the indemnitee's status as a director, officer, partner,
trustee, employee or agent, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Maryland and/or any other applicable law, as the same exists or may
hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment, only to the extent
that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide broader indemnification
rights than permitted prior thereto), against all liabilities, losses,
reasonable expenses (which shall include all fees, retainers and disbursements
of counsel, court costs, arbitrator costs, transcript costs, fees of experts,
witness fees, travel expenses, duplicating costs, printing and binding costs,
telephone charges, postage, delivery service fees, and all other disbursements
or expenses of the types customarily incurred in connection with prosecuting,
defending, preparing to prosecute or defend, investigating or being or preparing
to be a witness in a proceeding (hereinafter, the "expenses")), judgments,
penalties, fines, amounts paid in settlement and ERISA excise taxes and
penalties, in each case actually incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in
connection therewith and such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee
who has ceased to be a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee or agent
and shall inure to the benefit of the indemnitee's heirs, executors and
administrators; provided, however, that, except as provided in Section 3 of this
Article with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the
Corporation shall be required to indemnify a person in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the proceeding (or
part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

      (b) The Corporation's obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who is
or was serving at its request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee
or agent of any other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee
benefit plan or other enterprise, whether conducted for profit or not for
profit, shall be reduced by any amount such person has actually received as
indemnification from such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
employee benefit plan or other enterprise.

      Section 2. RIGHT TO ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES. The right to indemnification
conferred in Section 1 of this Article shall include the right to be paid by the
Corporation the reasonable expenses (including attorneys' fees (which may be of
counsel selected by the

                                       17
<PAGE>

indemnitee) and other expenses referred to in Section 1 of this Article)
incurred by the indemnitee in connection with any proceeding for which such
right to indemnification is applicable in advance of its final disposition,
without requiring a preliminary determination of the ultimate entitlement to
indemnification; provided, however, that the Corporation shall have first
received a written affirmation by such indemnitee of the indemnitee's good faith
belief that the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by the
Corporation as authorized by the General Corporation Law of the State of
Maryland has been met, and a written undertaking by or on behalf of such
indemnitee to repay any expenses advanced if it shall ultimately be determined
by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that
such indemnitee did not meet the applicable standard of conduct. The advancement
of expenses shall not be construed as a loan to the indemnitee, and the
indemnitee shall not be obligated to repay any expenses advanced, until such
time as it shall have ultimately been determined by final judicial determination
from which there is no further right to appeal that the indemnitee did not meet
the applicable standard of conduct.

      Section 3. RIGHT OF INDEMNITEE TO BRING SUIT. The rights to
indemnification and to the advancement of expenses conferred in Sections 1 and 2
of this Article shall be contract rights. If a claim under Sections 1 and 2 of
this Article is not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days after a
written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, except in case of a
claim for an advancement of expenses, in which case the applicable period shall
be twenty days, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter bring suit against the
Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim. If successful in whole or
in part in any such suit, or in a suit brought by the Corporation to recover an
advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee
shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting or defending such
suit. In (i) any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to
indemnification hereunder (but not in a suit brought by the indemnitee to
enforce a right to an advancement of expenses) it shall be a defense of the
Corporation that, and (ii) any suit by the Corporation to recover an advancement
of expenses pursuant to the terms of an undertaking the Corporation shall be
entitled to recover such expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee
has not met any applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the General
Corporation Law of the State of Maryland. Neither the failure of the Corporation
(including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel, or its
stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper under the circumstances
because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in
the General Corporation Law of the State of Maryland, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent
legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the indemnitee has not met such
applicable standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that the indemnitee
has not met the applicable standard of conduct or, in the case of such a suit

                                       18
<PAGE>

brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such suit. In any suit brought by the
indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification or to an advancement of
expenses hereunder, or by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses
pursuant to the terms of an undertaking, the burden of proving that the
indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement of
expenses, under this Section or otherwise, shall be on he Corporation.

      Section 4. NON-EXCLUSIVITY OF RIGHTS. The rights to indemnification and to
the advancement of expenses conferred in this Article shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under any
statute, the Corporation's Articles of Incorporation, bylaw, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

      Section 5. INSURANCE. The Corporation may maintain insurance (including
self-insurance), at its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss,
whether or not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person
against such expense, liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Maryland.

      Section 6. INDEMNIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS OF THE CORPORATION. The
Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board of
Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and to the advancement of expenses,
to any employee or agent of the Corporation to the fullest extent of the
provisions of this Article with respect to indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors and officers of the Corporation.

      Section 7. REPEALS AND MODIFICATIONS. Any repeal or modification of the
foregoing provisions of this Article shall not adversely affect any right or
protection hereunder of any person in respect of any act or omission occurring
prior to the time of such repeal or modification.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                WAIVER OF NOTICE

            Whenever any notice is required to be given pursuant to the Charter
of the Corporation or these Bylaws or pursuant to applicable law, a waiver
thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to such notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at nor the
purpose of any meeting need be set forth in the waiver of notice, unless
specifically required by statute. The attendance of any person at any meeting
shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where such person
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

                               AMENDMENT OF BYLAWS

            The Board of Directors shall have the exclusive power to adopt,
alter or repeal any provision of these Bylaws and to make new Bylaws.

     MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES, INC. BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONDUCT POLICY

                               REVISED MARCH 2004

The enclosed Business Ethics and Conduct Policy sets forth certain guidelines
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. expects its officers, directors and
employees to follow in the conduct of its business. Each officer, director and
employee of Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries must
complete and sign the acknowledgement card enclosed herein. This acknowledgement
should be returned to the General Counsel's office in Chicago.

                                       1
<PAGE>

I.    INTRODUCTION

      This Policy sets forth the basic guidelines which Manufactured Home
Communities, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company") expects its
officers, directors, management, and other employees to follow in conducting
business on behalf of the Company with the Company's customers, the general
public, creditors, suppliers and competitors, governmental entities and with
fellow Company personnel. This Policy supplements and is in addition to the
information contained in the Employee Handbook previously distributed to you.
The Company reserves the right to modify this Policy from time to time.

      No policy can be complete in all respects. Good judgment based upon an
understanding of the laws, regulations, and canons of ethics is the best
safeguard against improper or unethical conduct. Each employee is expected to
attain a level of understanding of this Policy which will permit the proper
exercise of such judgment, and to seek legal counsel in those circumstances
where such judgments could be questioned.

      The Company's internal auditors and legal staff will monitor compliance
with this Policy to assure that the Company conducts itself in a manner
consistent with its obligations to society and its stockholders. In addition,
those with management responsibilities within any area covered by this Policy
may periodically be required to complete the "Management Representation of
Compliance with Company Policies" - a written assurance of compliance with the
legal and ethical principles set forth in this Policy. The form of this
questionnaire is set forth at the end of this Policy.

A.    GENERAL POLICY

      The Company and its personnel will at all times transact business in full
compliance with the law and in accordance with the highest principles of honesty
and ethical conduct. Each employee should endeavor to deal fairly with the
Company's customers, suppliers, competitors and employees. No employee should
take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of
privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other
unfair-dealing practice.

      These Policy guidelines are to be strictly adhered to at all times and
under all circumstances. Policy violations will result in disciplinary action,
including, if appropriate, discharge from employment.

B.    SCOPE

      The guidelines set forth in this Policy apply to all Company personnel and
all Company related transactions. Every director, officer and employee must be
familiar with and comply with this Policy. Moreover, those with supervisory
responsibilities must

                                       2
<PAGE>
ensure that employees under their direction or control are acquainted with
applicable portions of the Policy. Company officers and directors should also be
aware that there are special legal requirements, not covered by this Policy,
which apply to corporate fiduciaries.

      The Company's commitment to full compliance applies to all applicable
laws, regulations and judicial decrees of the United States (federal, state and
local) and of other countries where the Company transacts its business. Portions
of this Policy concentrate on laws and regulations which are particularly
relevant to our business activities; however, this special emphasis on relevant
areas of law does not limit the general policy requiring full compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations.

      In addition to compliance with all legal requirements, each officer,
director and employee must adhere to the overriding ethical and professional
standards generally governing the conduct of business. The Company's interests
are not served by any unethical practice or activity even though not in
technical violation of the law.

C.    EFFECT OF POLICY VIOLATION

      Any knowing violation of the laws, regulations, or principles of ethics
set forth in this Policy will be grounds for disciplinary action or dismissal
from employment, and may subject the employee or former employee to civil
liability and/or criminal prosecution under appropriate law. Any employee who
knowingly authorizes or permits another to engage in a violation will also be
subject to disciplinary action, dismissal, and other penalties.

D.    EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND RIGHTS UNDER POLICY

      Every employee is obliged to strictly adhere to this Policy at all times
and under all circumstances. Any employee who is aware of violations or
potential violations of laws, rules, regulations or this Policy has a duty to
advise his supervisor, or the General Counsel's office. Further, any
uncertainties regarding legal or ethical issues involving Company affairs or
doubts about the best course of action in a particular situation requires the
employee to seek the advice of the General Counsel's office for clarification.
An error in failing to secure advice or report policy violations could be costly
to the individual and to the Company.

      It is the right of every employee to report other persons' (individual or
Company) violations or seek the advice of the General Counsel's office without
risk to the employee's job status or position by reason of such report or
inquiry. It is the policy of the Company not to allow retaliation for reports of
misconduct by others made in good faith by employees. Employees are expected to
cooperate in internal investigations of misconduct.

                                       3
<PAGE>

E.    DEFINITIONS

      The terms "personnel" and "employee" apply to all Company officers,
directors, managers, and other employees. "General Counsel's office" refers to
the internal legal counsel of the Company.

F.    ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

      Additional copies of this Policy are available from the Human Resources
Department or the General Counsel's office. Any employee in doubt about whether
this Policy applies to a particular transaction or uncertain about the proper
course of conduct to follow, should contact the General Counsel's office which
is available to answer questions and provide guidance.

II.   CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES AND VIOLATIONS OF TRUST

A.    GENERAL

      The Company is determined to build and maintain a high standard of
business ethics in the conduct of its affairs. Accordingly, this places a heavy
responsibility on all employees of the Company on whose character and judgment
the confidence of the public ultimately depends. The responsibility is shared by
all employees, but obviously it rests in special measure on the directors and
officers of the Company and on those management employees by whose decisions and
advice the Company is guided.

      This portion of the Policy deals with one aspect of that responsibility -
the avoidance of circumstances which might, in fact or in appearance, cause an
individual to place his or her own interest above his or her obligations to the
Company. The words "in appearance" should be noted particularly since the
appearance of an action might tend to impair confidence even though the
individual may not actually do anything wrong. The requirements of this Policy
Statement are in addition to any provisions of law pertaining to this subject.

      For the purpose of this Policy, the interest of each director, officer or
employee includes any interests of their immediate family: (a) spouse and
children under the age of eighteen (18) and (b) children who are eighteen (18)
years of age or older, parents, siblings, mothers and fathers-in-law, sons and
daughters-in-law and brothers and sisters-in-law provided that the director,
officer or employee has knowledge of such persons conflict of interest under
this Policy.

                                       4
<PAGE>

      1.    FINANCIAL INTERESTS IN COMPANY TRANSACTIONS

      It is the duty of each director, officer and employee to avoid having any
financial interest in any transaction between the Company, any of its
subsidiaries and a third party which might conflict with the proper performance
of his or her corporate duties or responsibilities, or which might tend to
adversely affect his or her independent judgment with respect to such
transaction.

      Accordingly, (a) unless, in the case of directors and officers,
specifically approved by the Board of Directors after full disclosure of all
relevant facts or (b) unless, in the case of other employees, specifically
approved by appropriate supervisors (i.e. Regional Vice President and Executive
Vice President-Operations) and the General Counsel, and if necessary as
determined by such supervisors and General Counsel, approved by the Board of
Directors of the Company after full disclosure of all relevant facts:

      a. No director, officer or employee shall own a direct or indirect
interest in any supplier, contractor, subcontractor, competitor, customer or
other entity with which the Company does business.

      This Policy is not intended to preclude ownership of publicly-traded
securities of a corporation with which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
has dealings; nor is it intended to preclude ownership of other security
holdings which could not be used to exert any influence whether because of their
relatively small size or because of the insignificance of the company's dealings
with the Company. Accordingly, ownership of securities which are traded on a
public stock exchange and ownership of securities where the aggregate amount
owned by the director, officer or employee constitutes less than two and one
half percent (2.5%) of the securities shall not be deemed to involve financial
interest prohibited by this Policy.

      The above exception notwithstanding, purchases and sales of securities and
other property should be avoided which are so timed in relation to the Company's
or any of its subsidiaries' operations that they might be regarded or viewed as
attempting to profit by using improperly obtained special knowledge of the
Company's investment intentions or other confidential information obtained by
reason of official positions.

      b. No director, officer or employee shall acquire property with the
knowledge that its value is likely to be benefited by action that the individual
is aware is being considered by the Company.

      c. No director, officer or employee shall acquire any property where
confidential or unpublished information, obtained through the Company or in
course of performing duties for the Company, has in any way been utilized in
such acquisition.

                                       5
<PAGE>

      d. No director, officer or employee shall appropriate or divert to others
any business opportunity in which it is known or could reasonably be anticipated
that the Company would be interested.

         No employee may use corporate property, information or position for
improper personal gain, and no employee may compete with the Company directly or
indirectly. Directors, officers and employees owe a duty to the Company to
advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.

      e. No officer or employee shall be employed by or hold any officership,
directorship, partnership or other official position in a business or
professional firm or corporation outside of the Company, without the consent of
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company.

      f. All officers and full time employees should avoid outside business
activities which may conflict with their ability to devote their efforts
full-time to the business of the Company.

      In many cases, a potential conflict of interest or violation of trust may
be avoided by making a full disclosure of the facts prior to any transaction
thereby permitting the Company to make an informed, independent decision
regarding the transaction. Such disclosure should be made to the General
Counsel's office via use of the Related Party Disclosure form or other direct
communication with the General Counsel. The Company reserves the right to
condition the approval of any specific transaction on such terms and conditions
as the Company in its sole discretion may require including, but not limited to,
specific financial reporting and audit requirements.

      2.    BENEFITS, FAVORS, GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT

      It is the duty of each director, officer or employee to avoid receipt of
benefits, favors, gifts and entertainment which might conflict with the proper
performance of his or her corporate responsibilities, or which might tend to
adversely affect his or her independent judgment on behalf of the Company or any
of its subsidiaries.

      If the benefit, favor or gift is more than a token gift of insubstantial
value and is offered in return for or in expectation of corporate business, it
should not be accepted. In regard to acceptance of business entertainment, it is
recognized that entertainment often may be incidental to business relationships
of value to the Company. But expensive hospitality should not be accepted
unthinkingly. Before expensive hospitality is accepted, the individual should be
satisfied that it is consistent with the best interests of the Company and
consistent with this Policy.

                                       6
<PAGE>

      3.    DISCLOSURE

      It is the duty of each director, officer or employee, when he or she finds
that he or she has an interest or affiliation which might conflict with the
proper performance of his or her corporate duties or responsibilities or which
might tend to adversely affect his or her independent judgment on behalf of the
Company, or when he or she finds himself or herself in doubt as to the proper
application of this Policy, to report the facts to the General Counsel or
Chairman of the Audit Committee and be guided by the instructions he or she
receives from the General Counsel or Chairman. Except as otherwise directed by
those instructions, he or she should refrain from participating in any matters
which might reasonably be affected by his or her adverse interest. The Chairman
of the Audit Committee will advise the auditors of the Company of any matters
approved by the Board of Directors pursuant to this Policy.

B.    SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF CONFLICTS OR VIOLATIONS

      It may be considered to be in conflict with the Company's interest, or a
violation of trust for a director, officer or employee or any immediate member
of their family:

      1. to have an undisclosed interest in or involvement with any organization
which has business dealings with the Company where there is an opportunity for
preferential treatment to be given or received, except where such an interest
comprises securities in widely-held corporations which are quoted and sold on
the open market and the interest is not material (less than two and one half
percent of the outstanding securities);

      2. to buy, sell or lease any kind of property, facilities or equipment
from or to the Company or to any company, firm or individual who is or is
seeking to become a contractor, supplier or customer without disclosing (and
obtaining permission) prior thereto;

      3. to accept commissions, a share in profits (other than dividends or
interest on securities of widely-held corporations) or other payments, loans
(other than with established banking or financial institutions), services,
excessive entertainment and travel, or gifts of more than nominal value, from
any individual or organization doing or seeking to do business with the Company;
or

      4. to take advantage of any opportunity for personal gain that rightfully
belongs to the Company. This would include business opportunities of which an
employee becomes aware because of their employment by the Company. Such
opportunities must be offered to the Company.

                                       7
<PAGE>

C.    EFFECT OF VIOLATIONS

      As with any other violation of Policy, a violation of the above conflict
of interest and corporate opportunity provisions will be grounds for
disciplinary action including possible dismissal from employment, and may
subject the director, officer or employee to civil liability and/or criminal
prosecution under appropriate law. Even so, not every potential conflict of
interest is a Policy violation - under some circumstances following a full
disclosure by the director, officer or employee, the Board of Directors or
senior management of the Company, as provided in this Policy, may determine to
engage in a particular transaction which is beneficial to the Company
notwithstanding the potential conflict or to permit the director, officer or
employee to engage in such transaction. In such a case, the above conflict of
interest provisions are not violated. Therefore, the effect of a particular
conflict of interest will depend upon the nature of the conflict, its disclosure
by the director, officer or employee, its effect upon the Company and the means
available to recompense loss or prevent future injury.

III.  COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS, RULES AND REGULATIONS

A.    COMPLIANCE WITH GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY

      The Company and its directors, officers and employees shall comply with
the laws, regulations, decrees and orders of every governmental agency,
regulatory authority, and judicial body having jurisdiction over the Company's
operations. The Company holds information and training sessions to promote
compliance with laws, rules and regulations, including insider trading laws. The
Company shall cooperate with governmental agencies in the proper performance of
their duties to the fullest extent possible. To ensure the Company's compliance
and cooperation commitment is satisfied, the General Counsel's office should be
immediately informed of any governmental request or inquiry.

B.    ANTITRUST AND TRADE REGULATION

      Every officer, director, and employee of the Company shall at all times
abide by the antitrust laws and trade regulations of the United States.
Violations of the antitrust laws or trade regulations may subject the Company to
fines, injunctions and substantial monetary damages. Moreover, violations of
certain antitrust laws are considered felonies, exposing an employee to the risk
of fine and/or imprisonment.

C.    RELATIONSHIPS WITH GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS

      Payments (regardless of amount), entertainment (other than meals where
Company-related work activities are conducted), or gifts (of more than nominal
value) to government officials and other government personnel of the United
States and other domestic or foreign jurisdictions, regardless of motive, are
viewed by the Company as

                                       8
<PAGE>

improper and not permitted. The Company's relationship with public officials
shall in all respects be of such a nature that the integrity and reputation of
the officials and the Company will not be impugned in the event the full details
of the relationship, including any gifts or entertainment, become a matter of
public discussion.

IV.   EMPLOYMENT AND PERSONNEL PRACTICES

A.    GENERAL

      Every officer, director, and employee of the Company shall at all times
abide by the strict legal requirements governing employment practices and
employee relations. In addition, every person coming in contact with the
Company, as an employee, customer, supplier, candidate for employment, or other
third party, shall be treated fairly, courteously and respectfully. The Company
has previously published its policies on discrimination and harassment as well
as on the employment relationship in the Human Resources Policies and Procedures
Manual and this Policy is meant as a supplement to such previously published
policies.

B.    NON-DISCRIMINATION

      The Company shall not discriminate against any person on the basis of
race, religion, national origin, age, sex, disability or veteran's status or
other characteristic or status protected by applicable law. This prohibition on
discrimination applies to practices in recruiting, employment, training,
promotion, working conditions, compensation, benefits, job rules, discipline,
and all other aspects of employment and employee relations.

C.    HARASSMENT

      The Company is committed to maintaining a work environment that is free
from intimidation and harassment. Company policy prohibits sexual, racial, and
other unlawful harassment in the work place. The Company will not tolerate undue
influence, offensive behavior, sexual harassment, intimidation, or other
disrespectful conduct by one employee toward another or by an employee toward a
customer or supplier. Neither shall any employment or employee relations matter
be decided based upon the existence or non-existence of any personal
non-business relationship between employees.

D.    EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS

      The Company shall not enter into any contract of employment without the
prior written approval of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
of the Company.

                                       9
<PAGE>

E.    EMPLOYEE RECORD CONFIDENTIALITY

      The personnel records of all Company employees shall be treated as the
confidential information of the Company. No Company officer, director or
employee shall copy or release any personnel or salary record to any third
party, nor shall any private personal information contained in any personnel
record be disclosed to any third party without the prior written approval of the
General Counsel's office. Employees with authorized access to personnel or
salary records shall institute measures to prevent the disclosure of any such
records under their control.

V.    TRANSACTIONS IN SECURITIES

A.    TRADING IN COMPANY SECURITIES

      Directors, officers and employees are prohibited from trading in Company
securities when they have material information which is not publicly known.
Information is considered material if it is important enough to affect a
decision by anyone to buy, sell or hold securities. Even when a director,
officer or employee lacks undisclosed material information, it is a prudent
practice to trade only when it is unlikely there is any unannounced material
information anywhere within the Company. Therefore, it is the Company's policy
that each Company director, officer and employee contact either the General
Counsel's office or corporate secretary for approval before making any trade in
Company securities. The Company has previously published its policies on
securities trading and this Policy is meant as a supplement to such previously
published policies.

      Directors, officers and employees should not engage in short-term
speculation in Company securities, nor should they engage in any transaction
where they profit if the value of Company securities falls.

B.    TRADING IN THE SECURITIES OF OTHER COMPANIES

      Directors, officers and employees should not trade in securities of a
company which has been targeted for acquisition or is being reviewed or a
property which is being reviewed or targeted as an acquisition candidate or a
company which is being considered for or has just been awarded an important
contract or relationship with the Company without first checking with the
General Counsel's office.

C.    TRANSACTIONS BY OTHERS

      No director, officer or employee shall in any way encourage any third
party to engage in any transaction in which the director, officer or employee
himself cannot engage.

                                       10
<PAGE>

D.    TRANSACTIONS BY OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS

      Officers and directors of the Company are subject to additional statutory
restrictions covering transactions in Company securities. These restrictions (a)
prohibit officers and directors from profiting on transactions within a six
month period, (b) prohibit them from selling the stock short, and (c) may
restrict the amount of securities some of them can sell within a three month
period. Officers and directors of the Company should review proposed
transactions in Company securities with the General Counsel's office.

VI.   FAIR AND ACCURATE REPORTING AND RECORDKEEPING

      It is the policy of the Company to provide full, fair, accurate, timely
and understandable disclosure in the reports that the Company files with, or
submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and in other public
communications made by the Company. All funds, assets and disbursements of the
Company shall be properly recorded in the appropriate records and books of
account. To assure the Company's financial statements are maintained in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or such other standards
as may be appropriate and to assure that reports filed by the Company with the
SEC are accurate and complete, the following policies are specifically adopted:

      1. Full Disclosure of Accounts. No secret or unrecorded fund of monies or
other assets of the Company shall be established or maintained, and all payments
and disbursements shall be properly recorded on the books and records of the
Company.

      2. Accurate Entries to Accounts. The making of false or fictitious entries
on the books and records of the Company and the issuance of false or misleading
reports pertaining to the Company and its operations are prohibited, and no
employee or officer shall engage in any transaction that requires or
contemplates such prohibited activities on the part of the Company.

      3. Accurate Expense Accounts. All employees who seek reimbursement from
the Company for expenses shall keep and submit to the Company complete and
accurate records of such expenditures and their business purpose.

      Business records and communications often become public, and employees
should avoid exaggeration, derogatory remarks, guesswork or inappropriate
characterizations of people and companies. This applies equally to email,
internal memos and formal reports. Records should always be retained or
destroyed according to the Company's record retention policies. In accordance
with these policies, in the event of actual or possible litigation or
governmental investigation, employees should consult with the General Counsel's
office.

                                       11

VII.  DISCLOSURE OR USE OF COMPANY INFORMATION

A.    GENERAL

      Each employee shall safeguard and keep private all Company proprietary and
confidential information, including without limitation, trade secrets,
trademarks, trade names or other intellectual property, as well as all such
information relating to the Company's customers and employees. The disclosure of
such Company information shall be permitted only when required by law and the
approval of the General Counsel's office shall be obtained prior to the release
of such information. Absent such approval, it shall be considered a violation of
trust for any director, officer or employee:

      1. to use or release to a competitor, or any other third party any data on
decisions, plans, or any other information concerning the Company which might be
prejudicial to the interests of the Company;

      2. to appropriate, for their own use or for the unauthorized use by a
third party, any Company technology, software, trade secrets or written
materials (whether or not copyrighted or patented), business information,
including but not limited to contracts, sales or customer information, marketing
or other plans, data relating to costs and suppliers, system design information,
manuals, computer tapes, discs, data processing records, financial data, or any
other confidential or proprietary matters of any nature whatsoever;

      3. to copy, use, or release to a third party any employee data, personnel
records, or any other private information concerning the Company's current or
former employees; or

      4. to use or release any undisclosed material information concerning the
Company, its plans or its performance, or any unpublished facts bearing upon the
Company's business, plans, or performance.

B.    OUTSIDE INQUIRIES AND REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION

      If any third party makes contact with any Company personnel requesting an
interview or seeking information concerning any Company-related matter, or if
any media representative requests an interview or seeks information or opinions
concerning any Company-related matter, whether or not the matter is confidential
or proprietary, the requestor should be instructed to address its inquiry
directly to the General Counsel's office so that questions can be answered with
appropriate care by authorized personnel having unrestricted access to the
Company's information resources. Employees with certain responsibilities will
periodically be requested to complete a questionnaire similar to the one
presented below.

                                       12

VIII. PROTECTION AND PROPER USE OF COMPANY ASSETS

      All employees should endeavor to protect the Company's assets and ensure
their efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the
Company's profitability. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be
immediately reported for investigation. Company equipment should not be used for
non-Company business, although incidental personal use may be permitted.

      The obligation of employees to protect the Company's assets includes its
proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property
such as trade secrets, patents, trademarks and copyrights, as well as business,
marketing and service plans, databases, records, salary information and any
unpublished financial data and reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this
information would violate Company policy. It could also be illegal and result in
civil or criminal penalties.

IX.   WAIVERS OF THE BUSINESS ETHICS AND CONDUCT POLICY

      Any waiver of this Policy that applies to officers or directors may be
made only by the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors and
will be disclosed as required by law or stock exchange regulation.

               materially affected, or is reasonable likely to materially
