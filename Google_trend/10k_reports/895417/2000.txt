ITEM 1.   BUSINESS

                                   THE COMPANY

GENERAL

     Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, the "Company") is a fully integrated company which owns and
operates manufactured home communities ("Communities"). Communities are
residential developments designed and improved for the placement of detached,
single-family manufactured homes which are produced off-site and installed
within the community. The owner of each home leases the site on which it is
located. Modern Communities are similar to typical residential subdivisions
containing centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs and gutters and parkways.
In addition, these communities often provide a clubhouse for social activities
and recreation and other amenities, which may include swimming pools,
shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, laundry facilities and cable television
service. Utilities are provided or arranged for by the owner of the community.
Some communities provide water and sewer service through public or private
utilities, while others provide these services to residents from on-site
facilities.

     Each Community is generally designed to attract and is marketed to one of
two types of residents - 1) retirees and empty nesters or 2) families and
first-time homeowners. The Company believes both types of Communities are
attractive investments and focuses on owning Communities in or near large
metropolitan markets and retirement destinations.

     The Company was formed to continue the property operations, business
objectives and acquisition strategies of an entity that has owned and operated
Communities since 1969. As of December 31, 1999, the Company owned or controlled
a portfolio of 157 Communities and recreational vehicle ("RV") resorts (the
"Properties") located throughout the United States containing 54,007 residential
sites. The Properties are located in 26 states (with the number of Properties in
each state shown parenthetically) -- Florida (48), California (25), Arizona
(19), Michigan (11), Colorado (10), Delaware (7), Nevada (5), Indiana (4),
Oregon (3), Kansas (3), Missouri (3), Illinois (2), Iowa (2), New York (2), Utah
(2), Pennsylvania (1), Maryland (1), Minnesota (1), Montana (1), New Mexico (1),
Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Texas (1), Virginia (1), West Virginia (1), and
Washington (1). As of December 31, 1999, the Company also owned a commercial
building located in California.

     The Company has approximately 850 full-time employees dedicated to carrying
out the Company's operating philosophy and strategies of value enhancement and
service to residents. The Company typically utilizes a one or two-person
management team (who reside at the Properties) for the on-site management of
each of the Properties. Typically, clerical and maintenance workers are employed
to assist these individuals in the management and care of the Properties. Direct
supervision of on-site management is the responsibility of the Company's
regional vice presidents and regional managers. These individuals have
significant experience in addressing the needs of residents and in finding or
creating innovative approaches to maximize value and increase cash flow from
property operations. Complementing this field management staff are approximately
60 corporate employees who assist on-site management in all property functions.

FORMATION OF THE COMPANY

     The Company, formed in March 1993, is a Maryland corporation, which has
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The Company
generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it distributes
its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of
organizational and operational requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as
a REIT, its income is taxable at regular corporate rates. Even if the Company
qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and
local taxes on its income and property and Federal income and excise taxes on
its undistributed income.

     The operations of the Company are conducted through certain entities which
are owned or controlled by the Company. MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership") is the entity through which the Company conducts
substantially all of its operations. Sub-partnerships of the Operating
Partnership were created to: (i) facilitate mortgage financing (the "Financing
Partnerships"); (ii) facilitate the Company's ability to provide financing to
the owners of Communities ("Lending Partnership"); (iii) own the management
operations of the Company ("Management Partnerships"); and (iv) own the assets
and operations of certain utility companies which service the Properties ("MHC
Systems"). The financial results of the Operating Partnership and
sub-partnerships (together, the "Subsidiaries") are consolidated in the
Company's consolidated financial statements.




                                       3
<PAGE>   4


     In addition, since certain activities, if performed by the Company, may not
be qualifying REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), the Company has invested in the non-voting preferred stock
of various corporations which engage in such activities. Realty Systems, Inc.
("RSI") is engaged in the business of purchasing, selling, leasing and financing
manufactured homes that are located or will be located in properties managed by
the Company. RSI also provides brokerage services to residents at such
properties. Typically residents move from a community but do not relocate their
homes. RSI may provide brokerage services, in competition with other local
brokers, by seeking buyers for the homes. RSI also leases homes to prospective
residents with the expectation that the tenant eventually will purchase the
home. LP Management Corp. leases from the Operating Partnership certain real
property within or adjacent to certain of the Properties consisting of golf
courses, pro shops, restaurants and recreational vehicle areas. The Company
believes that the activities of RSI and LP Management Corp. (collectively,
"Affiliates") benefit the Company by maintaining and enhancing occupancy at the
Properties. The Company accounts for its investment in and advances to
Affiliates using the equity method of accounting.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND OPERATING STRATEGIES

     The Company seeks to maximize both current income and long-term growth in
income. The Company focuses on Communities that have strong cash flow and
expects to hold such properties for long-term investment and capital
appreciation. In determining cash flow potential, the Company evaluates the
Community's ability to attract and retain high quality residents that take pride
in their community and in their home. These business objectives and their
implementation are determined by the Company's Board of Directors and may be
changed at any time. The Company's investment and operating approach includes:

     -    Providing consistently high levels of services and amenities in
          attractive surroundings to foster a strong sense of community and
          pride of home ownership;

     -    Aggressively managing the Properties to increase operating margins by
          maintaining competitive market rents, increasing occupancy and
          controlling expenses;

     -    Increasing income and property values by continuing the strategic
          expansion and, where appropriate, renovation of the Properties;

     -    Utilizing management information systems to evaluate potential
          acquisitions, identify and track competing properties and monitor
          tenant satisfaction; and

     -    Selectively acquiring Communities that have potential for long-term
          cash flow growth and to create property concentrations in and around
          major metropolitan areas and retirement destinations to capitalize on
          operating synergies and incremental efficiencies.

     The Company is committed to enhancing its reputation as the most respected
brand name in the manufactured home community business. Its strategy is to own
and operate the highest quality communities in major metropolitan areas and
retirement destinations across the United States. The focus is on creating an
attractive residential environment for homeowners by providing a
well-maintained, comfortable community with a variety of organized recreational
and social activities and superior amenities. In addition, the Company regularly
surveys rental rates of competing properties and conducts satisfaction surveys
of residents to determine the factors residents consider most important in
choosing a manufactured home community.

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS

     The Company acquired or gained a controlling interest in eighty-eight
Properties during 1997 through 1999, more than doubling its portfolio. The
Company believes that opportunities for property acquisitions are still
available and in general consolidation within the industry will continue (see -
Industry - The Manufactured Home Community Industry - Industry Consolidation).
The company believes that transactions occurring in the private marketplace are
at valuations significantly in excess of our current public market valuations.
As a result, during 1999 the Company accelerated its' stock repurchase program.
The Company's board of directors continues to review the conditions under which
the Company will repurchase its' stock. These conditions include, but are not
limited to, market price, balance sheet flexibility, other opportunities and
capital requirements. (For more information on the Company's stock repurchase
program see Note 4 to the accompanying financial statements.) Increasing
acceptability of and demand for manufactured homes and continued constraints on
development of new manufactured home communities continues to add to their
attractiveness as an investment. The Company believes it has a competitive
advantage in the acquisition of new communities due to its experienced
management, significant presence in major real estate markets and substantial
capital resources. The Company is actively seeking to acquire additional
communities and currently is engaged in various stages of negotiations relating
to the possible acquisition of a number of communities.


                                       4
<PAGE>   5


     The Company anticipates that newly acquired properties will be located in
the United States. The Company utilizes market information systems to identify
and evaluate acquisition opportunities, including a market database to review
the primary economic indicators of the various locations in which the Company
expects to expand its operations. Acquisitions will be financed from the most
appropriate sources of capital, which may include undistributed funds from
operations, issuance of additional equity securities, sales of investments,
collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings and issuance of debt securities.
In addition, the Company may cause the Operating Partnership to issue units of
limited partnership interests ("OP Units") to finance acquisitions. The Company
believes that an ownership structure which includes the Operating Partnership
will permit the Company to acquire additional Communities in transactions that
may defer all or a portion of the sellers' tax consequences.

     When evaluating potential acquisitions, the Company will consider such
factors as: (i) the replacement cost of the property; (ii) the geographic area
and type of property; (iii) the location, construction quality, condition and
design of the property; (iv) the current and projected cash flow of the property
and the ability to increase cash flow; (v) the potential for capital
appreciation of the property; (vi) the terms of tenant leases, including the
potential for rent increases; (vii) the potential for economic growth and the
tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is
located; (viii) the potential for expansion of the physical layout of the
property and/or the number of sites; (ix) the occupancy and demand by residents
for properties of a similar type in the vicinity and the residents profile; (x)
the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the
property; and (xi) competition from existing Communities and the potential for
the construction of new communities in the area. The Company expects to purchase
Communities with physical and market characteristics similar to the Properties
in its current portfolio.

PROPERTY EXPANSIONS

     Several of the Company's Properties have available land for expanding the
number of sites available to be leased to residents. Development of these sites
("Expansion Sites") is predicated by local market conditions and permitted by
zoning and other applicable laws. When justified, development of Expansion Sites
allows the Company to leverage existing facilities and amenities to increase the
income generated from the Properties. Where appropriate, facilities and
amenities may be upgraded or added to certain Properties in order to make those
Properties more attractive in their markets. The Company's acquisition
philosophy has included the desire to own Properties with potential Expansion
Site development and has been successful in acquiring a number of such
properties. Several examples of these properties include the 1994 acquisition of
Bulow Village with potential development of approximately 750 Expansion Sites,
the 1997 acquisition of Golf Vista Estates with potential development of
approximately 180 Expansion Sites and the recent acquisition in 1999 of Coquina
Crossing with potential development of approximately 480 Expansion Sites.

     Of the 157 Properties, ten may be expanded consistent with existing zoning
regulations. In 2000, the Company expects to develop an additional 100 Expansion
Sites within four of these Properties. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had
approximately 950 Expansion Sites available for occupancy in twenty-one of the
Properties. The Company filled 260 of the Expansion Sites in 1999 and expects to
fill an additional 200 to 300 sites in 2000.

LEASES

     The typical lease entered into between the tenant and one of the Company's
Properties for the rental of a site requires a security deposit and is a
month-to-month or year-to-year term, renewable upon the consent of both parties
or, in some instances, as provided by statute. These leases are cancelable,
depending on state law, for non-payment of rent, violation of community rules
and regulations or other specified defaults. Non-cancelable long-term leases,
with remaining terms ranging up to ten years, are in effect at certain sites
within eight of the Properties. These leases are subject to rental rate
increases based on the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), in some instances taking
into consideration certain floors and ceilings and allowing for pass-throughs of
certain items such as real estate taxes, utility expenses and capital
expenditures. Generally, market rate adjustments are made on an annual basis.

REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE

     General. Communities are subject to various laws, ordinances and
regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as
swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas. The Company believes that
each Property has the necessary permits and approvals to operate.



                                       5
<PAGE>   6


     Rent Control Legislation. State and local rent control laws, principally in
California and Florida, limit the Company's ability to increase rents and to
recover increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements at
certain Properties. Enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time
in other jurisdictions. The Company presently expects to continue to maintain
manufactured home communities, and may purchase additional properties, in
markets that are either subject to rent control or in which rent-limiting
legislation exists or may be enacted. For example, Florida has enacted a law
that generally provides that rental increases must be reasonable. Also, certain
jurisdictions in California in which the Company owns Properties limit rent
increases to changes in the CPI or some percentage thereof.

     Insurance. Management believes that the Properties are covered by adequate
fire, flood, property, earthquake and business interruption insurance (where
appropriate) provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable
deductibles and limits. The Company believes its insurance coverage is adequate
based on the Company's assessment of the risks to be insured, the probability of
loss and the relative cost of available coverage. The Company has obtained title
insurance insuring fee title to the Properties in an aggregate amount which the
Company believes to be adequate.

                                    INDUSTRY

THE MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITY INDUSTRY

     The Company believes that modern manufactured home communities, such as the
Properties, provide an opportunity for increased cash flows and appreciation in
value. These may be achieved through increases in occupancy rates and rents, as
well as expense controls, expansion of existing Properties and opportunistic
acquisitions, for the following industry specific reasons:

     -    Barriers to Entry: The Company believes that the supply of new
          Communities will be constrained due to barriers to entry into the
          industry. The most significant barrier has been the difficulty in
          securing zoning from local authorities. This has been the result of
          (i) the public's historically poor perception of the industry, and
          (ii) the fact that Communities generate less tax revenue because the
          homes are treated as personal property (a benefit to the home owner)
          rather than real property. Another factor that creates substantial
          barriers to entry is the length of time between investment in the
          Community's development and the attainment of stabilized occupancy and
          the generation of revenues. The initial development of the
          infrastructure may take up to two or three years. Once the Community
          is ready for occupancy, it may be difficult to attract residents to an
          empty Community. Substantial occupancy levels may take a number of
          years to achieve.

     -    Industry Consolidation: According to an industry analyst's
          manufactured home Community industry report, there are approximately
          50,000 Communities in the United States and approximately 6.5% or
          3,250 of the Communities have more than 200 sites and would be
          considered "investment-grade" Properties. The five public REITs that
          own Communities own approximately 532 or about 16% of the
          "investment-grade" Communities. In addition, based on a report
          prepared by one analyst, the top 150 owners of Communities own
          approximately 25% of the "investment-grade" assets. The Company
          believes that this relatively high degree of fragmentation in the
          industry provides the Company, as a national organization with
          experienced management and substantial financial resources, the
          opportunity to purchase additional Communities.

     -    Stable Tenant Base: The Company believes that Communities tend to
          achieve and maintain a stable rate of occupancy due to the following
          factors: (i) residents own their own homes, (ii) Communities tend to
          foster a sense of Community as a result of amenities such as club
          houses, recreational and social activities and (iii) since moving a
          manufactured home from one Community to another involves substantial
          cost and effort, residents often sell their home in-place (similar to
          site-built residential housing) with no interruption of rental
          payments.

MANUFACTURED HOUSING

     Based on the current growth in the number of individuals living in
manufactured homes, the Company believes that manufactured homes are
increasingly viewed by the public as an attractive and economical form of
housing. According to the industry's trade association, nearly one in four new
single family homes sold in the United States today is factory-built.




                                       6
<PAGE>   7


     The Company believes that the growing popularity of manufactured housing is
primarily the result of the following factors:

- -    Importance of Home Ownership. According to the Fannie Mae ("FNMA") 1999
     National Housing Survey renters' desire to own a home is stronger now than
     at any time in the 1990's. Security and permanence are thought to be
     non-financial reasons to own a home. The commitment to home ownership is
     tempered by an awareness of the high cost of owning a home. The
     affordability of manufactured housing allows many individuals to achieve
     this goal without jeopardizing their financial security.

- -    Affordability. For a significant number of persons, manufactured housing
     represents the only means of achieving home ownership. In addition, the
     total cost of housing in a manufactured home community (home cost, site
     rent and related occupancy costs) is competitive with and often lower than
     the total cost of alternative housing, such as apartments and condominiums
     and generally substantially lower than stick built residential
     alternatives.

- -    Lifestyle Choice. As the average age of the United States population has
     increased, manufactured housing has become an increasingly popular housing
     alternative for retirement and "empty-nest" living. According to FNMA, the
     surviving baby-boom generation - the 80 million people born between 1945
     and 1964 - will constitute 18% of the U.S. population within the next 30
     years and more than 32 million will reach age 55 within the next ten years.
     Among those people who are nearing retirement (age 40 to 54), approximately
     33% plan on moving upon retirement. The Company believes that manufactured
     housing is especially attractive to such individuals when located within a
     Community that offers an appealing amenity package, close proximity to
     local services, social activities, low maintenance and a secure
     environment.

- -    Construction Quality. Since 1976, all manufactured housing has been
     required to meet stringent Federal standards, resulting in significant
     increases in the quality of the industry's product. The Department of
     Housing and Urban Development's standards for manufactured housing
     construction quality are the only Federally regulated standards governing
     housing quality of any type in the United States. Manufactured homes
     produced since 1976 have received a "red and silver" government seal
     certifying that they were built in compliance with the Federal code. The
     code regulates manufactured home design and construction, strength and
     durability, fire resistance and energy efficiency, and the installation and
     performance of heating, plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical
     systems. In newer homes, top grade lumber and dry wall materials are
     common. Also, manufacturers are required to follow the same fire codes as
     builders of site-built structures.

- -    Comparability to Site-Built Homes. The manufactured housing industry has
     experienced a recent trend towards multi-section homes. Many modern
     manufactured homes are longer (up to 80 feet compared to 50 feet in the
     1960s) and wider than earlier models. Many homes have vaulted ceilings,
     fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms and closely resemble single family
     ranch style site-built homes.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

     The Company believes that the Properties provide attractive amenities and
common facilities that create a comfortable and attractive Community for the
residents, with most offering a clubhouse, a swimming pool, laundry facilities
and cable television service. Many also offer additional amenities such as
sauna/whirlpool spas, golf courses, tennis, shuffleboard and basketball courts
and exercise rooms. Since residents own their homes, it is their responsibility
to maintain their homes and the surrounding area. It is management's role to
insure that residents comply with Community policies and to provide maintenance
of the common areas, facilities and amenities. The Company holds periodic
meetings of its property management personnel for training and implementation of
the Company's strategies. The Properties historically have had and the Company
believes they will continue to have low turnover and high occupancy rates.

     The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects
the Company's belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the
portfolio from regional economic influences. The Company intends to target new
acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located and will also
consider acquisitions of properties outside such markets. The Company's five
largest markets of Properties owned are Florida (48 Properties), California (25
Properties), Arizona (19 Properties), Michigan (11 Properties) and Colorado (10
Properties). These markets accounted for 35%, 17%, 9%, 4%, and 9%, respectively,
of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999. The
Company also has Properties located in the following markets: Northeast,
Northwest, Midwest, and Nevada/Utah/New Mexico. The Company's largest Property,
Bay Indies, located in Venice, Florida accounted for 3% of the Company's total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

DEANZA SANTA CRUZ MOBILE ESTATES

     The residents of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a property located in
Santa Cruz, California (the "City") previously brought several actions opposing
certain fees and charges in connection with water service at the Property. The
trial of the ongoing utility charge dispute with the residents of this Property
concluded on January 22, 1999. This summary provides the history and reasoning
underlying the Company's defense of the residents' claims and explains the
Company's decision to continue to defend its position, which the Company
believes is fair and accurate.

     DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates is a 198 site community overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. It is subject to the City's rent control ordinance which limits
annual rent increases to 75% of CPI. The Company purchased this Property in
August 1994 from certain unaffiliated DeAnza entities ("DeAnza"). Prior to the
Company's purchase in 1994, DeAnza made the decision to submeter the Property
for both water and sewer in 1993 in the face of the City's rapidly rising
utility costs.

     Under California Civil Code Section 798.41, DeAnza was required to reduce
rent by an amount equal to the average cost of usage over the preceding 12
months. This was done. With respect to water, not looking to submit to
jurisdiction of the California Public Utility Commission ("CPUC"), DeAnza relied
on California Public Utilities Code Section 2705.5 ("CPUC Section 2705.5") to
determine what rates would be charged for water on an ongoing basis without
becoming a public utility. This statute provides that in a submetered mobilehome
park, the property owner is not subject to regulation and control of the CPUC so
long as the users are charged what they would be charged by the utility company
if users received their water directly from the utility company. In Santa Cruz,
customers receiving their water directly from the city's water utility were
charged a certain lifeline rate for the first 400 ccfs of water and a greater
rate for usage over 400 ccfs of water, a readiness to serve charge of $7.80 per
month and tax on the total. In reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5, DeAnza
implemented its billings on this schedule notwithstanding that it did not
receive the discount for the first 400 ccfs of water because it was a commercial
and not a residential customer.

     A dispute with the residents ensued over the readiness to serve charge and
tax thereon. The residents argued that California Civil Code Section 798.41
required that the park owner could only pass through its actual costs of water
(and that the excess charges over the amount of the rent rollback were an
improper rent increase) and that CPUC Section 2705.5 was not applicable. DeAnza
unbundled the utility charges from rent consistent with California Civil Code
Section 798.41 and it has generally been undisputed that the rent rollback was
accurately calculated.

     In August 1994, when the Company acquired the Property, the Company
reviewed the respective legal positions of the Santa Cruz Homeowners Association
("HOA") and DeAnza and concurred with DeAnza. Their reliance on CPUC Section
2705.5 made both legal and practical sense in that residents paid only what they
would pay if they lived in a residential neighborhood within the city of Santa
Cruz and permitted DeAnza to recoup part of the expenses of operating a
submetered system through the readiness to serve charge.

     Over a period of 18 months from 1993 into May of 1995, a series of
complaints were filed by the HOA and Herbert Rossman, a resident, against
DeAnza, and later, the Company. DeAnza and the Company demurred to each of these
complaints on the grounds that the CPUC had exclusive jurisdiction over the
setting of water rates and that residents under rent control had to first
exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding in a civil action. At
one point, the case was dismissed (with leave to amend) on the basis that
jurisdiction was with the CPUC and, at another point, Mr. Rossman was dismissed
from the case because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies.

     On June 29, 1995, a hearing was held before a Santa Cruz rent control
officer on the submetering of both water and sewer. The Company and DeAnza
prevailed on all issues related to sewer and the rent rollback related to water,
but the hearing officer determined that the Company could only pass through its
actual cost of water, i.e., a prorated readiness to serve charge and tax
thereon. The hearing officer did not deal with the subsidy being given to
residents through the quantity charge and ordered a rebate in a fixed amount per
resident. The Company and DeAnza requested reconsideration on this issue, among
others, which reconsideration was denied by the hearing officer.

     The Company then took a writ of mandate (an appeal from an administrative
order) to the Superior Court and, pending this appeal, the residents, the
Company and the City agreed to stay the effect of the hearing officer's decision
until the Court rendered judgment.

     In July 1996, the Superior Court affirmed the hearing officer's decision
without addressing concerns about the failure to take the subsidy on the
quantity charge into account.


                                       12
<PAGE>   13


     The Company requested that the City and the HOA agree to a further stay
pending appeal to the court of appeals, but they refused and the appeals court
denied the Company's request for a stay in late November 1996. Therefore, on
January 1, 1997, the Company reduced its water charges at this Property to
reflect a pass-through of only the readiness to serve charge and tax at the
master meter (approximately $0.73) and to eliminate the subsidy on the water
charges. On their March 1, 1997 rent billings, residents were credited for
amounts previously "overcharged" for readiness to serve charge and tax. The
amount of the rebate given by the Company was $36,400. In calculating the
rebate, the Company and DeAnza took into account the previous subsidy on water
usage although this issue had not yet been decided by the court of appeals. The
Company and DeAnza felt legally safe in so doing based on language in the
hearing officer's decision that actual costs could be passed through.

     On March 12, 1997, the Company also filed an application with the CPUC to
dedicate the water system at this Property to public use and have the CPUC set
cost based rates for water usage. The Company believed it was obligated to take
this action because of its consistent reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5 as a safe
harbor from CPUC jurisdiction. That is, when the Company could no longer charge
for water as the local serving utility would charge, it was no longer exempt
from the CPUC's jurisdiction and control under CPUC Section 2705.5.

     On March 20, 1997, the court of appeals issued the writ of mandate
requested by the Company on the grounds that the hearing officer had improperly
calculated the amount of the rebate (meaning the Company had correctly
calculated the rent credits), but also ruling that the hearing officer was
correct when he found that the readiness to serve charge and tax thereon as
charged by DeAnza and the Company were an inappropriate rent increase. The court
of appeals further agreed with the Company that the city's hearing officer did
not have the authority under California Civil Code Section 798.41 to establish
rates that could be charged in the future.

     Following this decision, the CPUC granted the Company its certificate of
convenience and necessity on December 17, 1998 and approved cost based rates and
charges for water that exceed what residents were paying under the Company's
reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5. Concurrently, the CPUC also issued an Order
Instituting Investigation ("OII") confirming its exclusive jurisdiction over the
issue of water rates in a submetered system and commencing an investigation into
the confusion and turmoil over billings in submetered properties. Specifically,
the OII states: "The Commission has exclusive and primary jurisdiction over the
establishment of rates for water and sewer services provided by private
entities."

     Specifically, the CPUC ruling regarding the Company's application stated:
"The ultimate question of what fees and charges may or may not be assessed,
beyond external supplier pass-through charges, for in-park facilities when a
mobile home park does not adhere to the provisions of CPUC Section 2705.5, must
be decided by the Commission."

     After the court of appeals decision, the HOA brought all of its members
back into the underlying civil action for the purpose of determining damages,
including punitive damages, against the Company. The trial was continued from
July 1998 to January 1999 to give the CPUC time to act on the Company's
application. Notwithstanding the action taken by the CPUC in issuing the OII in
December 1998, the trial court denied the Company's motion to dismiss on
jurisdictional grounds and trial commenced before a jury on January 11, 1999.

     Not only did the trial court not consider the Company's motion to dismiss,
the trial court refused to allow evidence of the OII or the Company's CPUC
approval to go before the jury. Notwithstanding the Company's strenuous
objections, the judge also allowed evidence of the Company's and DeAnza's
litigation tactics to be used as evidence of bad faith and oppressive actions
(including evidence of the application to the CPUC requesting a $22.00 readiness
to serve charge). The Company's motion for a mistrial based upon these
evidentiary rulings was denied. On January 22, 1999, the jury returned a verdict
awarding $6.0 million of punitive damages against the Company and DeAnza. The
Company had previously agreed to indemnify DeAnza on the matter.

     The Company has bonded the judgment pending appeal in accordance with
California procedural rules, which require a bond equal to 150% of the amount of
the judgment. Post-judgment interest will accrue at the statutory rate of 10.0%
per annum.




                                       13
<PAGE>   14


     On April 19, 1999, the trial court denied all of the Company's and DeAnza's
post-trial motions for judgement notwithstanding the verdict, new trial and
remittitur. The trial court also awarded $700,000 of attorneys' fees to
plaintiffs. The Company has appealed the jury verdict and attorneys' fees award
and the Company has filed its opening brief in the jury verdict case. The
Company also has filed two related appeals challenging the result of related
litigation and a resulting attorneys' fee award. The two related appeals are
based on a preemption argument. The Company asserts the superior courts' ability
to enter an attorneys' fee award in an earlier case and take certain other
actions which were preempted by the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by the
CPUC over the issue of how to set rates for water in a submetered mobilehome
park. The Company is awaiting notice from the court of appeal setting oral
argument in these two appeals. The jury verdict appeal also raises the
jurisdictional argument as well as several other arguments for reversal of the
punitive damage award or for a new trial. One of the arguments raised by the
Company in the jury verdict appeal is that punitive damages are not available in
a case brought under Section 798.41 of the California Mobilehome Residency Law
("MRL") since the MRL contains its own penalty provisions. The court of appeal
granted the Company's request for judicial notice of the legislative history of
the applicable MRL sections, which indicates to the Company that the court of
appeal is receptive to this argument. Although no assurances can be given, the
Company believes the appeals will be successful.

     Subsequently, in June 1999 the DeAnza Santa Cruz Homeowners Association
filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Cruz (No.
135991) against the Company, MHC Acquisition One, L.L.C. and Starland Vistas,
Inc. The new lawsuit seeks damages, including punitive damages, for alleged
violations of California Civil Code Sections 798.31 and 798.41 arising from
implementation of utility rates previously approved by the CPUC. The Company
demurred to (filed a motion to dismiss) the complaint on the grounds that the
Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the subject matter of the complaint given that
the CPUC has exclusive jurisdiction over utility rates and charges at the
Property. The California Superior Court denied the motion to dismiss and the
court of appeal denied the Company's request to review the denial of the
demurrer. The California Superior Court has also denied the Company's motion for
summary judgement. The Company intends to vigorously defend the matter,
including by filing a motion for summary judgement. The matter is expected to go
to trial in March 2000.

UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

     On September 29, 1995, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
("USEPA") issued its Findings of Violations and Order for Compliance with
respect to the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") Permit
governing the operation of the onsite waste water treatment plant at one of the
Properties. On October 6, 1995, the USEPA issued its Findings of Violation and
Order for Compliance with respect to NPDES Permit governing the operation of the
onsite wastewater treatment plant at another of the Properties. The Company and
the USEPA have reached a tentative agreement to resolve the matter in which the
operation of the remaining waste water treatment plant would be subject to a
consent decree that would provide for fines and penalties in the event of future
violations and the Company would contribute monies to a supplemental
environmental project and pay a fine. The tentative agreement has not yet been
reduced to writing and therefore remains subject to change. The Company does not
believe the impact of the settlement will be material and the Company believes
it has established adequate reserves for any amounts that may be paid.

ELLENBURG COMMUNITIES

     In connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities (as
hereinafter defined) and pursuant to orders of the California Superior Court
("Court"), approximately $30 million of the amounts paid by the Company have
been deposited with the court appointed winding up agents (the "Winding Up
Agents"). The deposited amounts relate to claims (the "Karno Claims") of Norton
S. Karno (and related entities) who at various times has been a creditor,
advisor, lawyer and shareholder of certain of the entities related to the
Ellenburg Communities. The Winding Up Agents have disputed the claims and have
filed a complaint against Mr. Karno (and related entities) requesting that the
court determine that the claims be reduced or eliminated.

     On October 30, 1998, the Company received notice of a lawsuit filed against
the Company and certain executive officers of the Company in the Los Angeles
County Superior Court alleging, among other causes of action, that the Company
breached certain agreements in connection with the Ellenburg acquisition and
claiming damages in excess of $50 million plus punitive damages. The Company
believes most of the claim relates to the disputed Karno Claims discussed above.
The Company believes the claims are without merit, intends to vigorously defend
the defendants in this matter and does not believe the impact of this matter
will be material.

     In connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities, Mr. Karno
and others have appealed various court orders on which the Company has relied.
Mr. Karno has also sought before both the California Superior Court and Court of
Appeals to take control of ECC (as hereinafter defined), but to date none of his
attempts have been successful.


                                       14
<PAGE>   15


     On September 8, 1999, Ellenburg Fund 20 ("Fund 20") filed a cross complaint
in the dissolution proceeding against the Company and certain of its affiliates
alleging causes of action for fraud and other claims in connection with the
Ellenburg acquisition. By stipulation, the Company has not yet had to respond to
the complaint, which the Company believes to be completely without merit. The
Company's defense to the claims include documents and letters signed by the
court-appointed Winding Up Agents supporting the Company's position.

     Mr. Karno, the Company and certain other parties have entered into a global
settlement agreement which was filed with the Court in February 2000. The Court
will hold a hearing on the motion to approve the settlement agreement in March
2000. Although the Company can provide no assurances that the settlement will be
approved, should the Court approve the settlement agreement, substantially all
of the litigation and appeals involving the Ellenburg acquisition would be
settled or dismissed. At this time, the global settlement agreement does not
dispose of the Fund 20 lawsuit against the Company. However, the Company
believes that there is a substantial likelihood that settlement with Fund 20
will be reached or, if not, that the Company will ultimately successfully defend
itself against the lawsuit.

CANDLELIGHT PROPERTIES, L.L.C

     In 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Lending Partnership made a loan to Candlelight
Properties, L.L.C. ("Borrower") in the principal amount of $8,050,000. The loan
is secured by a mortgage on Candlelight Village ("Candlelight"), a property in
Columbus, Indiana. The Company accounts for the loan as an investment in real
estate and, accordingly, Candlelight's results of operations are consolidated
with the Company's for financial reporting purposes. Concurrently with the
funding of the loan, Borrower granted the Operating Partnership the option to
acquire Candlelight upon the maturity of the loan. The Operating Partnership
notified Borrower that it was exercising its option to acquire Candlelight in
March 1999, and the loan subsequently matured on May 3, 1999. However, Borrower
failed to repay the loan and refused to convey Candlelight to the Operating
Partnership.

     Borrower filed suit in the Circuit Court of Bartholomew County, Indiana
("Court") on May 5, 1999, seeking declaratory judgment on the validity of the
exercise of the option. The Lending Partnership filed suit in the Court the next
day, seeking to foreclose its mortgage, and the suits were consolidated by the
Court. The Court issued an Order on December 1, 1999, finding, among other
things, that the Operating Partnership had validly exercised the option. Both
parties have filed motions to correct errors in the Order, which motions are
currently pending before the Court. The Court has not yet ruled on the
foreclosure complaint; however, given the Court's finding in the Order, the
Lending Partnership believes that Borrower has no valid defense in the
foreclosure action. The Operating Partnership and the Lending Partnership intend
to continue vigorously pursuing this matter and believe that, while no assurance
can be given, such efforts will be successful.

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. All proceedings herein described or referred to,
taken together, are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the
Company.

</TABLE>

(1)       See the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included
          elsewhere herein.

(2)       The Company believes that the book value of the Properties, which
          reflects the historical costs of such real estate assets less
          accumulated depreciation, is less than the current market value of the
          Properties.

(3)       The Company generally considers Funds From Operations ("FFO") to be an
          appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO was
          defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
          ("NAREIT") in March 1995 as net income (computed in accordance with
          generally accepted accounting principles ["GAAP"]), before allocation
          to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of
          property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for
          significant non-recurring items, if any. In the first quarter of 1996,
          the Company adopted this new definition of FFO which is effective for
          periods ending after December 31, 1995. For purposes of presenting
          FFO, the revised definition of FFO has been given retroactive
          treatment. Prior to this adoption, FFO was defined as income before
          allocation to minority interests plus certain non-cash items,
          primarily depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that FFO
          is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity
          REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities,
          financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors
          an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service
          debt and to make capital expenditures. The Company computes FFO in
          accordance with the NAREIT definition which may differ from the
          methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and,
          accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs computation.
          FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated from operating
          activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be
          considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the
          Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities
          as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily
          indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

(4)       During the year ended December 31, 1995, two Properties were sold; net
          operating income attributable to such Properties was approximately
          $235,000, which included approximately $83,000 of depreciation and
          amortization expense. During the year ended December 31, 1996, four
          Properties were acquired; net operating income attributable to such
          Properties was approximately $1.8 million, which included
          approximately $371,000 of depreciation and amortization expense.
          During the year ended December 31, 1997, 39 Properties were acquired;
          net operating income attributable to such Properties was approximately
          $3.8 million, which included approximately $1.7 million of
          depreciation and amortization expense. During the year ended December
          31, 1998, 41 Properties were acquired; net operating income
          attributable to such Properties was approximately $7.6 million, which
          included approximately $3.9 million of depreciation and amortization
          expense. During the year ended December 31, 1999, two Properties were
          acquired; net operating income attributable to such Properties was
          approximately $87,000, which included approximately $104,000 of
          depreciation expense.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     The following discussion should be read in conjunction with "Selected
Financial Data" and the historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes
thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following discussion may
contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which reflect management's current
views with respect to future events and financial performance. Such
forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties,
including, but not limited to, the effects of future events on the Company's
financial performance; the adverse impact of external factors such as inflation
and consumer confidence; and the risks associated with real estate ownership.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998

     Since December 31, 1997, the gross investment in real estate has increased
from $936 million to $1,264 million as of December 31, 1999 due to the
acquisition of the following Properties (collectively, the "1998 & 1999
Acquisition Properties"):
          (i)    The Ellenburg Communities acquired throughout 1998
          (ii)   Quail Meadows on January 8, 1998
          (iii)  Sherwood Forest RV Resort on April 30, 1998
          (iv)   Casa Del Sol Resort III on May 14, 1998
          (v)    The College Heights Communities (a portfolio of eighteen
                 Properties) on June 4, 1998
          (vi)   Sunset Oaks on August 13, 1998
          (vii)  The Meadows on April 1, 1999
          (viii) Coquina Crossing on July 23, 1999
The total number of sites owned and controlled has increased from 44,108 as of
December 31, 1997 to 54,007 as of December 31, 1999.

     The following table summarizes certain weighted average statistics for the
years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998. "Core Portfolio" represents an analysis
of properties owned as of the beginning of both periods of comparison.

</TABLE>

     Base rental income ($181.7 million) increased $16.3 million or 9.9%. For
the Core Portfolio, base rental income increased approximately $4.8 million or
3.8%, due to increased base rental rates. The remaining $11.5 million increase
in base rental income was attributed to the 1998 & 1999 Acquisition Properties.

     Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 3.3%,
reflecting a 3.7% increase in monthly base rent per site for the Core Portfolio,
partially offset by the acquisition of Properties with average base rents lower
than the Core Portfolio. Average monthly base rent per site for the 1998 & 1999
Acquisition Properties was $314.69 for the year ended December 31, 1999.

     Weighted average occupied sites increased by 2,690 sites while occupancy
percentage decreased 0.3% due to the addition of the 1998 & 1999 Acquisition
Properties to the portfolio with lower occupancy percentages. Occupied sites at
the Core Portfolio remained stable.

     RV base rental income ($9.5 million) increased $2.4 million or 33.2%
primarily due to the addition of four RV Properties in 1998.

     Utility and other income ($20.1 million) increased $1.9 million or 10.3%
attributed to the 1998 & 1999 Acquisition Properties.

ITEM 7.   MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
          RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

     Interest income ($1.7 million) decreased $1.4 million or 45.2%, primarily
due to the conversion of some notes receivable to fee simple interests in The
Meadows and certain Ellenburg Communities. Short-term investments had average
balances for the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 of approximately $2.8
million and $6.9 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an
effective rate of 6.3% and 5.4% per annum, respectively.

     Property operating and maintenance expenses ($58.0 million) increased $5.0
million or 9.4%. Expenses related to the 1998 & 1999 Acquisition Properties were
approximately $4.6 million. Expenses at the Core Portfolio increased slightly as
increases in repairs and maintenance, payroll and utility expenses were
partially offset by decreased property general and administrative expenses and
insurance and other expenses. Property operating and maintenance expenses
represented 27.0% of total revenues in 1999 and 27.2% in 1998.

     Real estate taxes ($16.5 million) increased $2.0 million or 13.8%, of which
approximately $1.3 million was attributed to the 1998 & 1999 Acquisition
Properties and $668,000 relates to slightly increased rates at the Core
Portfolio. Real estate taxes represented 7.7% of total revenues in 1999 and 7.4%
in 1998.

     Property management expenses ($8.3 million) increased $1.2 million or
16.9%. The increase was primarily due to the addition of senior management
personnel in the areas of operations, human resources and accounting and the
incremental expenses related to management of the 1998 & 1999 Acquisition
Properties. Property management expenses represented 3.9% of total revenues in
1999 and 3.6% in 1998.

     General and Administrative ("G&A") expenses ($6.1 million) increased
$682,000 or 12.6%. The increase was primarily due to increased payroll resulting
from salary increases and increased public company related expenses. G&A expense
represented 2.8% of total revenues in both 1999 and 1998.

     Interest and related amortization ($53.8 million) increased $4.1 million or
8.2%. The increase was due to higher weighted average outstanding debt balances
during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the year
ended December 31, 1999 and 1998 were $738.1 million and $696.0 million,
respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.2% per annum in both 1999 and
1998. Interest and related amortization represented 25.0% of total revenues in
1999 and 25.5% in 1998.

     Depreciation on corporate assets ($1.0 million) increased $10,000 or 1.0%
due to fixed asset additions related to information and communication systems.
Depreciation on corporate assets represented 0.5% of total revenues in both 1999
and 1998.

     Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs ($34.5 million)
increased $6.1 million or 21.3% as a result of the addition of the 1998 & 1999
Acquisition Properties. Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs
represented 16.0% of total revenues in 1999 and 14.6% in 1998.

</TABLE>

     Base rental income ($165 million) increased $56.3 million or 51.7%. For the
Core Portfolio, base rental income increased approximately $4.1 million or 4.1%,
reflecting an increase in base rental rates. The remaining $52.2 million
increase in base rental income was attributed to the 1997 & 1998 Acquisition
Properties.

     Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 1.5%,
reflecting a 4.4% increase in monthly base rent per site for the Core Portfolio
offset by lower monthly base rents for the 1997 & 1998 Acquisition Properties.
Average monthly base rent per site for the 1997 & 1998 Acquisition Properties
was $329 for the year ended December 31, 1998.

     Weighted average occupancy decreased 0.4% due to the addition of the 1997 &
1998 Acquisition Properties to the portfolio with lower occupancy percentages,
partially offset by increased occupancy at the Core Portfolio The 0.2% increase
at the Core Portfolio reflects a 0.4% decrease attributed to lower occupancy at
four family properties and lower occupancy at two Properties where the Company
has implemented a program to upgrade the resident profile and housing stock.
Excluding these Properties, occupancy at the Core Portfolio increased 0.6%.

     Utility and other income ($25.4 million) increased $13.6 million or 115.3%,
due to an increase of $13.1 million attributed to the 1997 & 1998 Acquisition
Properties, including $7.2 million of RV income. The remaining $500,000 increase
reflected increased utility income, real estate tax pass-ons and other
miscellaneous income at the Core Portfolio.

     Interest income ($3.0 million) increased $1.1 million or 57.0%, primarily
due to the issuance of $14.6 million of notes receivable and an increase in
interest earned on short-term investments. Short-term investments had average
balances for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 of approximately $6.9
million and $4.7 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an
effective rate of 5.4% per annum in both years.

     Property operating and maintenance expenses ($53.0 million) increased $20.7
million or 64.1%. Of this increase $19.4 million is attributed to the 1997 &
1998 Acquisition Properties. The remaining $1.3 million increase includes
approximately $300,000 of one-time expenses associated with water main breaks,
storm damage and legal costs at the Core Portfolio. The Core Portfolio also
experienced increases in property payroll, property general and administrative
expenses and insurance and other expenses. Property operating and maintenance
expenses represented 27.2% of total revenues in 1998 and 26.2% in 1997.

     Real estate taxes ($14.5 million) increased $6.1 million or 73.3% due to
the impact of the 1997 & 1998 Acquisition Properties. Real estate taxes
represented 7.4% of total revenues in 1998 and 6.8% in 1997.

     Property management expenses ($7.1 million) increased $2.0 million or
39.9%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in management company
payroll and incremental costs associated with self management of the 1997 & 1998
Acquisition Properties. Property management expenses represented 3.6% of total
revenues in 1998 and 4.1% of total revenues in 1997.

     G&A ($5.4 million) increased $851,000 or 18.7%. The increase was primarily
due to increased payroll. G&A expenses represented 2.8% of total revenues in
1998 and 3.7% in 1997.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

     Interest and related amortization ($49.7 million) increased $27.9 million
or 128.4%. The increase was due to higher weighted average outstanding debt
balances during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for
the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 were $696 million and $301.3 million,
respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.2% in 1998 and 7.1% in 1997.
Interest and related amortization represented 25.5% of total revenues in 1998
and 17.6% in 1997.

     Depreciation on corporate assets ($995,000) increased $405,000 or 68.8% due
to fixed asset additions in 1997 and 1998 associated with the Company's upgrade
of certain computer systems infrastructure and the wide area network.
Depreciation on corporate assets represented 0.5% of total revenues in both 1998
and 1997.

     Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs ($28.4 million)
increased $11.1 million or 63.7% as a result of 1997 & 1998 Acquisition
Properties. Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs represented 14.6%
of total revenues in 1998 and 14.1% in 1997.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999

     Net cash provided by operating activities increased $608,000 to
approximately $72.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $72.0
million for the year ended December 31, 1998. Net cash provided by operating
activities reflected a $4.4 million increase in funds from operations ("FFO"),
as discussed below, offset by slower growth in accounts payable and rents
received in advance due to the 1998 & 1999 Acquisition Properties.

     Net cash used in investing activities decreased $224.9 million to $37.9
million for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $262.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998. This was primarily due to the acquisition of Quail
Meadows, Sherwood Forest RV Resort, Casa Del Sol Resort III, the College Heights
Communities, acquisition advances related to the Ellenberg Communities, the
purchase of short-term investments, the funding of The Meadows Loan (as
hereinafter defined), and the investment in Plantation on the Lake and Trails
West in 1998, partially offset by the investment in The Meadows and the
acquisition of Coquina Crossing in 1999.

     On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3 million loan (the "Meadows
Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan was collateralized by The
Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. On
April 1, 1999, the Company effectively exchanged The Meadows Loan for an equity
and debt interest in the partnership that owns The Meadows. The Company accounts
for The Meadows as an acquisition and consolidates the Property and related
results of operations and therefor no interest income was recognized on the
Meadows Loan after the exchange.

     On July 23, 1999, the Company acquired Coquina Crossing, located in St.
Augustine, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $10.4 million. The
acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.
Coquina Crossing is a 748-site senior community with 269 developed sites and
zoned expansion potential of 479 sites. In addition, RSI purchased the model
home inventory at the community for approximately $1.1 million.

     Capital expenditures for improvements were approximately $14.4 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999 compared to $14.2 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998. Of the $14.4 million, approximately $8.6 million represented
improvements to existing sites. The Company anticipates spending approximately
$7.0 million on improvements to existing sites during 2000. The Company believes
these improvements are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy
levels and maintain competitive market rents for new and renewing residents. The
remaining $5.8 million represented costs to develop expansion sites at certain
of the Company's Properties and other corporate headquarter costs.

     Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities decreased $245.2
million to ($41.7 million) for the year ended December 31, 1999 from $203.5
million for the year ended December 31, 1998. This is primarily due to lower net
borrowings on the line of credit compared to the same period in 1998 and
proceeds from issuance of common stock in the year ended December 31, 1998
compared to repurchases of common stock in the year ended December 31, 1999. On
September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125 million private
placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units. The
net proceeds from this placement were used to pay down the line of credit. Also,
during 1999 the Company repurchased over 4 million shares of Common Stock at an
average price of $23.40 per share using proceeds from borrowings on the line of
credit. Net borrowings on the line of credit of $120.1 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998 compare to net repayments on the line of credit of $37.1
million for the year ended December 31, 1999.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

     Distributions to common stockholders and minority interests decreased
approximately $6.0 million. This was due primarily to a change in the timing of
the fourth quarter dividend which, for the fourth quarter of 1998, was paid on
December 30, 1998 and, for the fourth quarter of 1999, was not paid until
January 14, 2000. On April 9, 1999, July 9, 1999, October 8, 1999 and January
14, 1999, the Company paid a $.3875 per share distribution for the quarters
ended March 31, 1999, June 30, 1999, September 30, 1999 and December 31, 1999
respectively, to stockholders of record on March 26, 1999, June 25, 1999,
September 24, 1999 and December 31, 1999 respectively.


FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998

     Net cash provided by operating activities increased $17.4 million from
$54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $72.0 million for the same
period in 1998. This increase reflected a $13.3 million increase in FFO, which
reflected increases in rental income as discussed in "Results of Operations"
above, and an increase in accounts payable and real estate tax accruals and
rents received in advance related to the property acquisitions, partially offset
by increased prepaid expenses.

     Net cash used in investing activities increased $23.3 million from $239.4
million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $262.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998, primarily due to the funding of notes receivable,
improvements made to acquisition properties, and collection of escrow proceeds
related to the acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities, partially offset by the
sale of project related assets in 1997.

     On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase
agreement (as amended by a supplemental agreement on December 17, 1997) to
acquire 38 Communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from partnerships having
Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general partner for a purchase
price in excess of $300 million. From December 17, 1997 through December 31,
1998, the Company closed on the acquisition of thirty-one of the Ellenburg
Communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $278 million and
gained control of an additional five Ellenburg Communities with acquisition
advances of approximately $57 million to the partnerships which own such
Ellenburg Communities. The Company funded the acquisition advances with
borrowings under the Company's line of credit and term bank facilities. In
addition, the Company assumed debt of approximately $32 million and issued OP
Units of approximately $4.9 million in connection with this transaction.

     During 1998, the Company received approximately $14.3 million, including
approximately $365,000 of interest income, which was being held subject to the
completion of due diligence procedures on the Ellenburg Communities. The persons
appointed to windup the affairs of ECC have released the funds and have
presented a status report to the court. The $14.3 million has been recorded as a
liability until certain related issues are finalized at which point the final
liability will be relieved and the purchase price of the Ellenburg Communities
adjusted accordingly.

     On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3 million loan (the "Meadows
Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan is collateralized by The
Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida,
bears interest at a nominal rate of 9%, subject to adjustment based on cash flow
of the property, and matures on April 30, 1999.

     On January 8, 1998, the Company acquired Quail Meadows, located in
Riverbank, California, for a purchase price of approximately $4.7 million. The
acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.
Quail Meadows consists of approximately 146 developed sites.

     On April 30, 1998, the Company acquired Sherwood Forest RV Resort, located
adjacent to one of the Ellenburg Communities in Kissimmee, Florida, for a
purchase price of approximately $7.0 million. The acquisition was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sherwood Forest RV Resort consists
of approximately 512 developed sites and a 33 acre expansion parcel.

     On May 14, 1998, the Company acquired Casa Del Sol Resort III, located
adjacent to one of the Company's communities in Peoria, Arizona, for a purchase
price of approximately $9.8 million. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing
under the Company's line of credit. Casa Del Sol Resort III consists of 238
developed sites.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)

     On June 4, 1998, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with
Wolverine Investors L.L.C. to acquire the College Heights Communities. The
aggregate purchase price for the College Heights Communities was approximately
$89 million. The Company contributed approximately $19 million to the joint
venture, Wolverine Investors L.L.C. contributed approximately $2.0 million to
the joint venture and the remainder of the acquisition was funded with a
borrowing from a financial institution of approximately $68 million. The
Company's $19 million contribution to the joint venture was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Due to the Company's ability to
control the joint venture through its ownership percentage, the joint venture
has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.

     On August 13, 1998, the Company acquired Sunset Oaks, located in Plant
City, Florida, adjacent to one of the Company's existing properties, for a
purchase price of approximately $3.6 million. The acquisition was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sunset Oaks consists of 168
developed sites.

     Capital expenditures for improvements were approximately $14.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to $6.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997. Of the $14.2 million, approximately $8 million represented
improvements to existing sites including $3.5 million related to newly acquired
properties. The remaining $6.2 million represented costs to develop expansion
sites at certain of the Company's Properties and other corporate headquarter
costs.

     Net cash provided by financing activities increased $18.1 million from
$185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $203.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 primarily due to the issuance of common stock in
the second quarter of 1998, partially offset by decreased net proceeds from the
line of credit, term loan and mortgage notes payable.

     On April 23, 1998, the Company completed an offering of 1,048,059 shares of
common stock (the "Unit Trust Offering") and sold the shares to Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Underwriter"). The offering price per
share was $25.4375, the closing price for shares of the Company's common stock
on April 23, 1998, resulting in gross offering proceeds of approximately $26.7
million. Net of the Underwriter's discount and offering expenses, the Company
received approximately $25 million. The Underwriter deposited the shares of
common stock with the trustee of the Equity Investor Fund Cohen & Steers Realty
Majors Portfolio, a unit investment trust (the "Trust"), in exchange for units
in the Trust.

     For the year ended December 31, 1999, the Company declared and paid
quarterly distributions totaling $1.55 per share. For the year ended December
31, 1998, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.45
per share. Return of capital on a GAAP basis was $0.49, $0.33 and $0.17 for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or
annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve
increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of
leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the Company.

     The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements,
including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash
provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of
credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements
such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital
improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings
including borrowings under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt
securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to
working capital.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement No. 133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities", which is required to be adopted in years beginning after
June 15, 1999. SFAS No. 133 permits early adoption as of the beginning of any
fiscal quarter after its issuance. In June 1999, the FASB issued Statement No.
137 which deferred the effective date of SFAS No. 133 to all fiscal quarters for
fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The Company has not yet determined
the date at which it will adopt SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 will require the
Company to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income.
If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in
the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair
value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or
recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The Company has not yet determined what the effect of SFAS No. 133
will be on the earnings and financial position of the Company, when implemented.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

     FFO was defined by NAREIT in March 1995 as net income (computed in
accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains
(or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after
adjustments for significant non-recurring items, if any. In the first quarter of
1996, the Company adopted this new definition of FFO which was effective for
periods ending after December 31, 1995. The Company computes FFO in accordance
with the NAREIT definition which may differ from the methodology for calculating
FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to
such other REITs computation. Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is
defined as FFO less non-revenue producing capital expenditures. The Company
believes that FFO and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the
performance of an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating
activities, financing activities and investing activities, they provide
investors an understanding of the ability of the Company to incur and service
debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not
represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and
therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication
of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as
determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative
of cash available to fund cash needs.

     The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years
ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 (amounts in thousands):

YEAR 2000

     In prior years, the Company discussed the nature and progress of its plans
to become year 2000 ready. In late 1999, the Company completed its remediation
and testing of systems. As a result of those planning and implementation
efforts, the Company experienced no significant disruptions in mission critical
information technology and non-information technology systems and believes those
systems successfully responded to the Year 2000 date change. The Company will
continue to monitor its mission critical computer applications and those of its
suppliers and vendors throughout the year 2000 to ensure that any latent Year
2000 matters that may arise are addressed promptly.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company's earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a
portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on
LIBOR. The Company's $175 million line of credit ($107.9 million outstanding at
December 31, 1999) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% and the Company's $100
million Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0%. If LIBOR
increased/decreased by 1.0% during 1999, interest expense would have
increased/decreased by approximately $1.0 million based on the average balance
outstanding under the Company's line of credit for the year ended December 31,
1998.

     In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
"1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at
6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only
of legal costs that were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap was
impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been
entered into on December 31, 1999, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have
been approximately 6.57%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap
rate for the 1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus
its current value by approximately $28,000. The Company accounted for the 1998
Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap were accounted for as
an adjustment to interest expense. On January 10, 2000, the Company unwound the
1998 SWAP and received $1.0 million of proceeds which will be amortized into
interest expense through March 2003.

                         Report of Independent Auditors





To the Board of Directors of
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc.


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1999. We have also audited the related financial statement schedules listed in
the accompanying index. These financial statements and schedules are the
responsibility of the management of Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Manufactured
Home Communities, Inc. at December 31, 1999 and 1998, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, the "Company"), formed in March 1993, is a Maryland corporation
which has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The
Company owns or has a controlling interest in 157 manufactured home communities
(the "Properties") located in 26 states, consisting of 54,007 sites. The Company
generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it distributes
its REIT taxable income to its stockholders.

     The operations of the Company are conducted through certain entities that
are owned or controlled by the Company. MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership") is the entity through which the Company conducts
substantially all of its operations. The Company contributed the proceeds from
its initial public offering to the Operating Partnership for a general
partnership interest. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership (the
"Common OP Unitholders") receive an allocation of net income which is based on
their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership which is
shown on the Consolidated Financial Statements as Minority Interest - Common OP
Units. As of December 31, 1999, the Minority Interests - Common OP Units
represented 5,633,183 units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") which
are convertible into an equivalent number of shares of the Company's stock. The
issuance of additional shares of common stock or common OP Units changes the
respective ownership of the Operating Partnership for both the Minority
Interests and the Company.

     Sub-partnerships of the Operating Partnership were created to (i)
facilitate mortgage financing (the "Financing Partnerships"); (ii) facilitate
the Company's ability to provide financing to Communities ("Lending
Partnership"); (iii) own the management operations of the Company ("Management
Partnerships"); and (iv) own the assets and operations of certain utility
companies which service the Company's properties ("MHC Systems").

     The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated financial
information of the Company and its subsidiaries. Due to the Company's ability as
general partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating
Partnership, the Financing Partnerships, the Lending Partnerships, the
Management Partnerships and MHC Systems, each such subsidiary has been
consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.

     In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"
("SFAS No. 131") which was effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1997. SFAS No. 131 superseded Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise". SFAS No.
131 establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report
information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires
that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in
interim financial reports. SFAS No. 131 also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers.
The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not affect results of operations or financial
position of the Company. The Company has one reportable segment which is the
operation of manufactured home communities. The Company has concentrations of
Properties within the following states: Florida (48 Properties), California (25
Properties), Arizona (19 Properties), Michigan (11 Properties) and Colorado (10
Properties). These concentrations of Properties accounted for 35%, 17%, 9%, 4%,
and 9%, respectively, of the Company's total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 1999. The Company also has Properties located in the following
areas of the United States: Northeast, Northwest, Midwest, and Nevada/Utah/New
Mexico. The Company's largest Property, Bay Indies, located in Venice, Florida,
accounted for 3% of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31,
1999. The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects
the Company's belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the
portfolio from regional economic influences. The Company intends to target new
acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located and will also
consider acquisitions of properties outside such markets.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     (a) Use of Estimates

         The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
     make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
     and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
     date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
     expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
     those estimates.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (b) Real Estate

         Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. The
     Company evaluates rental properties for impairment when conditions exist
     which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash
     flows (undiscounted) from a property is less than its carrying value. Upon
     determination that a permanent impairment has occurred, rental properties
     are reduced to fair value. For the year(s) ended December 31, 1999 and
     1998, permanent impairment conditions did not exist at any of the Company's
     properties.

         Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated
     useful lives of the assets. The Company uses a 30-year estimated life for
     buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen
     year estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven year
     estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for
     ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and
     significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend
     the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful
     life. Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred. Total
     depreciation expense was $35.5 million, $29.1 million and $18.0 million for
     the year(s) ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     (c) Cash and Cash Equivalents

         The Company considers all demand and money market accounts and
     certificates of deposit with a maturity when purchased of three months or
     less, to be cash equivalents.

     (d) Notes Receivable

         Notes receivable generally are stated at their outstanding unpaid
     principal balances net of any deferred fees or costs on originated loans,
     or unamortized discounts. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid
     principal balance. Discounts are amortized to income using the interest
     method.

     (e) Fair Value of Financial Instruments

         Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About
     Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires disclosures about the fair
     value of financial instruments whether or not such instruments are
     recognized in the balance sheet. The Company's financial instruments
     include short-term investments, notes receivable, accounts receivable,
     accounts payable, other accrued expenses, mortgage notes payable and
     interest rate hedge arrangements. The fair value of all financial
     instruments, including notes receivable, were not materially different from
     their carrying values at December 31, 1999 and 1998, except the fair market
     value of certain derivatives related to mortgage debt (see Note 10).

     (f) Deferred Financing Costs

         Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain
     long-term financing. The costs are being amortized over the terms of the
     respective loans on a level yield basis. Unamortized deferred financing
     fees are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date.
     Accumulated amortization for such costs was $1.8 million and $1.2 million
     at December 31, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

     (g) Revenue Recognition

         Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when earned from
     tenants.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (h) Minority Interests

         Net income is allocated to Common OP Unitholders based on their
     respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. An ownership
     percentage is represented by dividing the number of OP Units held by the
     Common OP Unitholders (5,633,183 and 5,976,820 at December 31, 1999 and
     1998, respectively) by OP Units and common stock outstanding. Issuance of
     additional shares of common stock or common OP Units changes the percentage
     ownership of both the Minority Interests and the Company. Due in part to
     the exchange rights, such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are
     treated as capital transactions and result in an allocation between
     stockholders' equity and Minority Interests to account for the change in
     the respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the
     Operating Partnership.

         On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125
     million private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
     Units ("POP Units") to two institutional investors. The POP Units, which
     are callable by the Company after five years, have no stated maturity or
     mandatory redemption, have no voting rights and are not convertible into OP
     Units or Common Stock. Income is allocated to the POP Units at a preferred
     rate per annum of 9.0% on the original capital contribution of $125
     million. Costs related to the placement of $3.1 million were recorded as a
     reduction to additional paid-in capital.

     (i) Income Taxes

         Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT, the results of
     operations contain no provision for Federal income taxes. However, the
     Company may be subject to certain state and local income, excise or
     franchise taxes. The Company paid state and local taxes of approximately
     $85,000 and $78,000 during the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998. As
     of December 31, 1999, net investment in real estate and notes receivable
     had a federal tax basis of approximately $794 million and $59 million,
     respectively.

     (j) Reclassifications

         Certain 1998 and 1997 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
     1999 financial presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on the
     operations or equity as originally presented.

NOTE 3 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

   Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each year. In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128"). SFAS No.
128 replaces the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share
with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share,
basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and
convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
previously reported fully diluted earnings per share. All earnings per share
amounts for all periods have been presented, and where appropriate, restated to
conform to the SFAS No. 128 requirements. The conversion of OP Units has been
excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation. The conversion of an OP
Unit to common stock will have no material effect on earnings per common share.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share (amounts in thousands):

NOTE 4 - COMMON STOCK AND OTHER EQUITY RELATED TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     In March 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a common stock
repurchase plan whereby the Company was authorized to repurchase and retire up
to 1,000,000 shares of its common stock. The Company's Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of additional shares on May 11, 1999, September 30,
1999, October 4, 1999 and November 29, 1999 of 1,000,000 shares each for a total
authorized repurchase of up to 5,000,000 shares. Shares of common stock
repurchased and retired under the plan for the years ended December 31, 1999,
1998 and 1997 were 4,028,600, 21,800 and 330,300 respectively.

     On August 29, 1997, the Company, as general partner of the Operating
Partnership, approved the addition of new limited partners (the "MPW Limited
Partners") to the Operating Partnership in connection with the acquisition of
properties from limited partners and joint ventures affiliated with Mobileparks
West, a California limited partnership. The MPW Limited Partners received
3,018,926 OP Units which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for shares of
the Company's common stock.

     During 1998, the Company, as general partner of the Operating Partnership,
approved the admission of new limited partners (the "1998 Acquisition Partners")
to the Operating Partnership in connection with certain acquisitions of real
estate and investments in joint ventures (see Notes 5 and 6). The 1998
Acquisition Partners received 342,438 OP Units which are exchangeable on a
one-for-one basis for shares of the Company's common stock.

     On April 23, 1998, the Company completed an offering of 1,048,059 shares of
common stock (the "Unit Trust Offering") and sold the shares to Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Underwriter"). The offering price per
share was $25.4375, the closing price for shares of the Company's common stock
on April 23, 1998, resulting in gross offering proceeds of approximately $26.7
million. Net of the Underwriter's discount and offering expenses, the Company
received approximately $25 million. The Underwriter deposited the shares of
common stock with the trustee of the Equity Investor Fund Cohen & Steers Realty
Majors Portfolio, a unit investment trust (the "Trust"), in exchange for units
in the Trust.

     On March 26, 1999, the Operating Partnership repurchased and cancelled
200,000 OP Units from a limited partner of the Operating Partnership.

     On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125 million
private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Units ("POP
Units") to two institutional investors. The POP Units, which are callable by the
Company after five years, have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption. Net
proceeds from the offering of $121 million were used to repay amounts
outstanding under the Company's credit facility and for other corporate
purposes.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). Pursuant to the ESPP, certain employees
and directors of the Company may each annually acquire up to $100,000 of common
stock of the Company. The aggregate number of shares of common stock available
under the ESPP shall not exceed 1,000,000, subject to adjustment by the Board of
Directors. The common stock may be purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85%
of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last day of such
month; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share on the first
day of such month, and (ii) the average closing price for a share for all the
business days in the month. Shares of common stock issued through the ESPP for
the years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 were 59,060, 44,804 and 27,608,
respectively.

NOTE 5 - REAL ESTATE (CONTINUED)

     During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company acquired twenty-two
communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $156.4 million.
These acquisitions were funded with approximately $60.6 million in borrowings
under the Company's line of credit, issuance of approximately $64 million of OP
Units, assumption of approximately $13 million in debt, approximately $7.4
million of existing available cash, issuance of installment notes totaling
approximately $6 million and entry into a lease, accounted for as a capital
lease, valued at approximately $2.4 million. In connection with the acquisition
of one of the communities, the Company issued an additional $1.1 million of OP
units in 1998.

     On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase
agreement (as amended by a supplemental agreement on December 17, 1997) to
acquire 37 manufactured home communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from
partnerships having Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general partner
for a purchase price in excess of $300 million. During 1997 and 1998, the
Company closed on the acquisition of thirty-one of the Ellenburg Communities for
an aggregate purchase price of approximately $278 million and gained control of
an additional five Ellenburg Communities with acquisition advances of
approximately $57 million to the partnerships which own such Ellenburg
Communities. The Company funded the acquisition advances with borrowings under
the Company's line of credit and term bank facilities. In addition, the Company
assumed debt of approximately $32 million and issued OP Units of approximately
$4.9 million in connection with this transaction.

     In connection with the supplemental agreement entered into in December
1997, on February 12, 1998, the Company exercised its right of first refusal to
purchase five of the Ellenburg Communities. A third party, backed by one of the
Company's competitors upon denial of a stay of the sale, has appealed certain
orders of the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles,
related to the Company's acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities, including the
order approving the supplemental agreement. The Company does not expect the
appeals to be successful, or if successful, to have a material impact on the
Company's acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities.

     During 1998, the Company received approximately $14.3 million, including
approximately $365,000 of interest income, which was being held subject to the
completion of due diligence procedures on the Ellenburg Communities. The persons
appointed to windup the affairs of ECC have released the funds and have
presented a status report to the court. The $14.3 million was initially recorded
as a liability until certain related issues were finalized. The Company
believes, at this time, a settlement of these issues is substantially complete
and has accordingly, in a non-cash transaction, relieved the liability and
adjusted the purchase price of the Ellenburg Communities.

     On January 8, 1998, the Company acquired Quail Meadows, located in
Riverbank, California, for a purchase price of approximately $4.7 million. The
acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.
Quail Meadows consists of approximately 146 developed sites.

     On April 30, 1998, the Company acquired Sherwood Forest RV Resort, located
adjacent to one of the Ellenburg Communities in Kissimmee, Florida, for a
purchase price of approximately $7.0 million. The acquisition was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sherwood Forest RV Resort consists
of approximately 512 developed sites and a 33 acre expansion parcel.

     On May 14, 1998, the Company acquired Casa Del Sol Resort III, located
adjacent to one of the Company's communities in Peoria, Arizona, for a purchase
price of approximately $9.8 million. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing
under the Company's line of credit. Casa Del Sol Resort III consists of 238
developed sites.

     On June 4, 1998, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with
Wolverine Investors L.L.C. to acquire eighteen manufactured home communities
(the "College Heights Communities"). The aggregate purchase price for the
College Heights Communities was approximately $89 million. The Company
contributed approximately $19 million to the joint venture, Wolverine Investors
L.L.C. contributed approximately $2.0 million to the joint venture and the
remainder of the acquisition was funded with a borrowing from a financial
institution of approximately $68 million. The Company's $19 million contribution
to the joint venture was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of
credit. Due to the Company's ability to control the joint venture through its
approximate 95% interest, the joint venture properties and related operations
have been consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

     On August 13, 1998, the Company acquired Sunset Oaks, located in Plant
City, Florida, adjacent to one of the Company's existing properties, for a
purchase price of approximately $3.6 million. The acquisition was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sunset Oaks consists of 168
developed sites.

NOTE 5 - REAL ESTATE (CONTINUED)

     On July 23, 1999, the Company acquired Coquina Crossing, located in St.
Augustine, Florida, for a purchase price of approximately $10.4 million. The
acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.
Coquina Crossing is a 748-site senior community with 269 developed sites and
zoned expansion potential of 479 sites. In addition, Realty Systems, Inc., an
affiliate of the Company, purchased the model home inventory at the community
for approximately $1.1 million.

     The acquisitions have been accounted for utilizing the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired assets are
included in the statement of operations from the dates of acquisitions. The
Company acquired all of the communities from unaffiliated third parties.

     The Company is actively seeking to acquire additional communities and
currently is engaged in negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of a
number of communities. At any time these negotiations are at varying stages
which may include contracts outstanding to acquire certain manufactured home
communities which are subject to satisfactory completion of the Company's due
diligence review.

NOTE 6 - INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE

     On March 18, 1998, the Company joined Plantation Company, LLC and Trails
Associates, LLC, two 49% joint venture investments with Meadows Management
Company to own two manufactured home communities known as "Plantation on the
Lake" and "Trails West", for approximately $6.5 million. Plantation on the Lake
is located in Riverside, California and consists of 385 developed sites and 122
expansion sites. Trails West is located in Tucson, Arizona and consists of 488
developed sites and 294 expansion sites. The Company's investments were funded
with a $3.9 million borrowing under the Company's line of credit and with the
issuance of approximately $2.6 million in OP Units. Due to the Company's
inability to control the joint ventures, the Company accounts for its investment
in the joint ventures on the equity method.

31, 1999 and 1998, the carrying value of such properties was approximately $638
million and $634 million, respectively.

     The outstanding mortgage indebtedness consists in part of a $265.0 million
mortgage note (the "Mortgage Debt") collateralized by 29 properties beneficially
owned by MHC Financing Limited Partnership. The Mortgage Debt has a maturity
date of January 2, 2028 and pays interest at 7.015%. There is no principal
amortization until February 1, 2008, after which principal and interest are paid
from available cash flow and the interest rate is reset at a rate equal to the
then 10-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.0%.

     In connection with the acquisition of the College Heights Communities, the
joint venture formed by the Company and Wolverine Investors L.L.C. borrowed
approximately $68 million (the "College Heights Debt") at an interest rate of
7.19%, maturing July 1, 2008. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the principal
balance on this debt was $67.1 million and $67.6 million, respectively.

     As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company also had outstanding debt on
25 and 23 properties in the aggregate amounts of approximately $182 million and
$169 million, respectively. The related discount or premium is amortized over
the life of the loan using the effective interest rate. In addition, the Company
recorded a $2.4 million loan in connection with a direct financing lease entered
into in May 1997. Scheduled maturities for the outstanding indebtedness,
excluding the Mortgage Debt and College Heights Debt, are at various dates
through November 30, 2020, and fixed interest rates range from 7.25% to 9.05%.

     The Company has a $175 million unsecured line of credit with a group of
banks (the "Credit Agreement") bearing interest at the London Interbank Offered
Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.125%. The Credit Agreement matures on August 17, 2000, at
which time the Company may extend the maturity date to August 17, 2002 and the
Credit Agreement would be converted to a term loan. The Company pays a fee on
the average unused amount of such credit equal to 0.15% of such amount. As of
December 31, 1999 and 1998, $107.9 million and $145 million was outstanding
under the Credit Agreement, respectively.

     The Company has a $100 million term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of
banks with interest only payable monthly at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%. The Term
Loan matures on April 3, 2000 and may be extended to April 3, 2002. The
Company's only obligation for extension is to provide the creditor with adequate
notice. The Company expects to provide such notice and extend the maturity in
accordance with the loan agreement.

     The Company has installment notes payable, secured by a letter of credit,
with interest rates of 7.5%, maturing September 1, 2002. Approximately $2.9

1999 and 1998, approximately $4.2 million and $5.3 million was outstanding on
the installment notes, respectively.

NOTE 10 - LONG-TERM BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)

     In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
"1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at
6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only
of legal costs which were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap was
impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been
entered into on December 31, 1999, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have
been approximately 6.57%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap
rate for the 1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus
its current value by approximately $28,000. The Company accounts for the 1998
Swap as a hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap were accounted for as
an adjustment to interest expense. On January 10, 2000, the Company terminated
the 1998 Swap and received $1.0 million of proceeds which will be amortized as
an adjustment to interest expense through March 2003.

     Aggregate payments of principal on long-term borrowings for each of the
next five years and thereafter are as follows (amounts in thousands):

NOTE 11 - LEASE AGREEMENTS

     The leases entered into between the tenant and the Company for the rental
of a site are month-to-month or for a period of one to ten years, renewable upon
the consent of the parties or, in some instances, as provided by statute.
Non-cancelable long-term leases, with remaining terms up to eleven years, are in
effect at certain sites within nineteen of the Properties. Rental rate increases
at these properties are primarily a function of increases in the Consumer Price
Index taking into consideration certain floors and ceilings. Additionally,
periodic market rate adjustments are made as deemed necessary. Future minimum
rents are scheduled to be received under noncancelable tenant leases at December
31, 1999 as follows (amounts in thousands):

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN AND STOCK GRANTS

     A Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") was adopted by the Company in December
1992. Pursuant to the Plan, certain officers, directors, employees and
consultants of the Company may be offered the opportunity to acquire shares of
common stock through the grant of stock options ("Options"), including
non-qualified stock options and, for key employees, incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. The Compensation Committee will
determine the vesting schedule, if any, of each Option and the term, which term
shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. As to the Options that have
been granted through December 31, 1999, generally, one-third are exercisable one
year after the initial grant, one-third are exercisable two years following the
date such Options were granted and the remaining one-third are exercisable three
years following the date such Options were granted. The Plan allows for 10,000
Options to be granted annually to each director. The common stock with respect
to which the Options may be granted during any calendar year to any grantee
shall not exceed 250,000 shares. In addition, the Plan provides for the granting
of stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and restricted stock grants ("Stock
Grants"). A maximum of 4,000,000 shares of common stock was available for grant
under the Plan as of December 31, 1999.

     In 1999, 1998 and 1997, the Company issued 14,666, 18,238 and 14,777 shares
related to Stock Grants, respectively, which represented a portion of certain
employee's bonuses. The shares related to the Stock Grants shall be restricted
for a period of two years from the date of grant. The fair market value of these
Stock Grants of approximately $351,984, $445,000 and $394,361 at the date of
grant was recorded as compensation expense by the Company in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively.

     In 1997, the Company awarded 77,750 Stock Grants to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Grants vest over three years and
are dependent upon certain performance benchmarks tied to total returns to
shareholders being met. The fair market value of these Stock Grants of
approximately $2.1 million as of the date of grant was treated in 1997 as
deferred compensation. The Company amortized approximately $519,000, $519,000
and $1.0 million related to these Stock Grants in 1999, 1998 and 1997
respectively.

     In 1998, the Company awarded 233,500 Stock Grants to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Grants vest over five years, but
may be restricted for a period of up to ten years depending upon certain
performance benchmarks tied to increases in funds from operations being met. The
fair market value of these Stock Grants of approximately $5.7 million as of the
date of grant was treated in 1998 as deferred compensation. The Company
amortized approximately $569,000 related to these Stock Grants in 1999.

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN (CONTINUED)

     In 1999, the Company awarded 32,500 Stock Grants to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Grants vest over three years with
one-half vesting in 1999 and are dependent upon certain performance benchmarks
tied to total returns to shareholders being met. The fair market value of these
Stock Grants of approximately $770,000 as of the date of grant was treated in
1999 as deferred compensation. The Company amortized approximately $385,000
related to these Stock Grants in 1999.

     In 1999, the Plan was amended to provide a Stock Grant of 2,000 shares
vesting over three years in lieu of the 10,000 Options granted after the
amendment to each director, if the director so elects. The Company recognized
approximately $129,000 of expense and recorded approximately $257,000 of
deferred compensation related to these Stock Grants in 1999.

     The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related
Interpretations in accounting for its Options and Stock Grants because, as
discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under FASB
Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No. 123")
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
Company's Options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Additionally, the amount
recognized as expense for the Stock Grants during any given year of the
performance period is dependent on certain performance benchmarks being met.

     Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its Options and Stock Grants under the fair value method of that
Statement. The fair value for the Options was estimated at the date of grant
using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively: risk-free interest rates of
6.3%, 5.7% and 6.3%; dividend yields of 6.3%, 5.8% and 5.5%; volatility factors
of the expected market price of the Company's common stock of .21, .23 and .24;
and a weighted-average expected life of the Options of 5 years. The fair value
of the Stock Grants granted in 1997, 1998 and 1999 has been estimated at
approximately 30% below the calculated fair market value on the date of grant
because these Stock Grants may remain restricted even after they become fully
vested.

     The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company's Options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its Options.

     For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
Options is amortized to expense over the Options' vesting period and the
estimated fair value of the Stock Grants are amortized to expense over the same
period. The pro forma effect of SFAS No. 123 on the Company's net income for the
years ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997 was ($138,000) ($0 per share),
$225,000 ($0.01 per share) and $0 ($0 per share), respectively.

NOTE 15 - PREFERRED STOCK

     The Company's Board of Directors is authorized under the Company's charter,
without further stockholder approval, to issue, from time to time, in one or
more series, 10,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock (the "Preferred
Stock"), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board may
determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to
the rights of holders of the Company's common stock. However, under certain

eligible employees of the Company and those of any Subsidiary to defer a portion
of their compensation up to 16% of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax
basis subject to certain maximum amounts. In addition, the Company will match
dollar-for-dollar the participant's contribution up to 4% of the participant's
eligible compensation.

     In addition, amounts contributed by the Company will vest, on a prorated
basis, according to the participant's vesting schedule. After five years of
employment with the Company, the participants will be 100% vested for all
amounts contributed by the Company. Additionally, a discretionary profit sharing
component of the 401(k) Plan provides for a contribution to be made annually for
each participant in an amount, if any, as determined by the Company. All
employee contributions are 100% vested. The Company's contribution to the 401(k)
Plan was approximately $385,000, $256,000 and $262,000, for the years ended
December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Company's anticipated plan
contribution for the profit sharing component of the 401(k) Plan is
approximately $165,000 for the year ended December 31, 1999.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES


DEANZA SANTA CRUZ MOBILE ESTATES

     The residents of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a property located in
Santa Cruz, California (the "City") previously brought several actions opposing
certain fees and charges in connection with water service at the Property. The
trial of the ongoing utility charge dispute with the residents of this Property
concluded on January 22, 1999. This summary provides the history and reasoning
underlying the Company's defense of the residents' claims and explains the
Company's decision to continue to defend its position, which the Company
believes is fair and accurate.

     DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates is a 198 site community overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. It is subject to the City's rent control ordinance which limits
annual rent increases to 75% of CPI. The Company purchased this Property in
August 1994 from certain unaffiliated DeAnza entities ("DeAnza"). Prior to the
Company's purchase in 1994, DeAnza made the decision to submeter the Property
for both water and sewer in 1993 in the face of the City's rapidly rising
utility costs.

     Under California Civil Code Section 798.41, DeAnza was required to reduce
rent by an amount equal to the average cost of usage over the preceding 12
months. This was done. With respect to water, not looking to submit to
jurisdiction of the California Public Utility Commission ("CPUC"), DeAnza relied
on California Public Utilities Code Section 2705.5 ("CPUC Section 2705.5") to
determine what rates would be charged for water on an ongoing basis without
becoming a public utility. This statute provides that in a submetered mobilehome
park, the property owner is not subject to regulation and control of the CPUC so
long as the users are charged what they would be charged by the utility company
if users received their water directly from the utility company. In Santa Cruz,
customers receiving their water directly from the city's water utility were
charged a certain lifeline rate for the first 400 ccfs of water and a greater
rate for usage over 400 ccfs of water, a readiness to serve charge of $7.80 per
month and tax on the total. In reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5, DeAnza
implemented its billings on this schedule notwithstanding that it did not
receive the discount for the first 400 ccfs of water because it was a commercial
and not a residential customer.

     A dispute with the residents ensued over the readiness to serve charge and
tax thereon. The residents argued that California Civil Code Section 798.41
required that the park owner could only pass through its actual costs of water
(and that the excess charges over the amount of the rent rollback were an
improper rent increase) and that CPUC Section 2705.5 was not applicable. DeAnza
unbundled the utility charges from rent consistent with California Civil Code
Section 798.41 and it has generally been undisputed that the rent rollback was
accurately calculated.

     In August 1994, when the Company acquired the Property, the Company
reviewed the respective legal positions of the Santa Cruz Homeowners Association
("HOA") and DeAnza and concurred with DeAnza. Their reliance on CPUC Section
2705.5 made both legal and practical sense in that residents paid only what they
would pay if they lived in a residential neighborhood within the city of Santa
Cruz and permitted DeAnza to recoup part of the expenses of operating a
submetered system through the readiness to serve charge.

     Over a period of 18 months from 1993 into May of 1995, a series of
complaints were filed by the HOA and Herbert Rossman, a resident, against
DeAnza, and later, the Company. DeAnza and the Company demurred to each of these
complaints on the grounds that the CPUC had exclusive jurisdiction over the
setting of water rates and that residents under rent control had to first
exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding in a civil action. At
one point, the case was dismissed (with leave to amend) on the basis that
jurisdiction was with the CPUC and, at another point, Mr. Rossman was dismissed
from the case because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies.

     On June 29, 1995, a hearing was held before a Santa Cruz rent control
officer on the submetering of both water and sewer. The Company and DeAnza
prevailed on all issues related to sewer and the rent rollback related to water,
but the hearing officer determined that the Company could only pass through its
actual cost of water, i.e., a prorated readiness to serve charge and tax
thereon. The hearing officer did not deal with the subsidy being given to
residents through the quantity charge and ordered a rebate in a fixed amount per
resident. The Company and DeAnza requested reconsideration on this issue, among
others, which reconsideration was denied by the hearing officer.

     The Company then took a writ of mandate (an appeal from an administrative
order) to the Superior Court and, pending this appeal, the residents, the
Company and the City agreed to stay the effect of the hearing officer's decision
until the Court rendered judgment.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

     In July 1996, the Superior Court affirmed the hearing officer's decision
without addressing concerns about the failure to take the subsidy on the
quantity charge into account.

     The Company requested that the City and the HOA agree to a further stay
pending appeal to the court of appeals, but they refused and the appeals court
denied the Company's request for a stay in late November 1996. Therefore, on
January 1, 1997, the Company reduced its water charges at this Property to
reflect a pass-through of only the readiness to serve charge and tax at the
master meter (approximately $0.73) and to eliminate the subsidy on the water
charges. On their March 1, 1997 rent billings, residents were credited for
amounts previously "overcharged" for readiness to serve charge and tax. The
amount of the rebate given by the Company was $36,400. In calculating the
rebate, the Company and DeAnza took into account the previous subsidy on water
usage although this issue had not yet been decided by the court of appeals. The
Company and DeAnza felt legally safe in so doing based on language in the
hearing officer's decision that actual costs could be passed through.

     On March 12, 1997, the Company also filed an application with the CPUC to
dedicate the water system at this Property to public use and have the CPUC set
cost based rates for water usage. The Company believed it was obligated to take
this action because of its consistent reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5 as a safe
harbor from CPUC jurisdiction. That is, when the Company could no longer charge
for water as the local serving utility would charge, it was no longer exempt
from the CPUC's jurisdiction and control under CPUC Section 2705.5.

     On March 20, 1997, the court of appeals issued the writ of mandate
requested by the Company on the grounds that the hearing officer had improperly
calculated the amount of the rebate (meaning the Company had correctly
calculated the rent credits), but also ruling that the hearing officer was
correct when he found that the readiness to serve charge and tax thereon as
charged by DeAnza and the Company were an inappropriate rent increase. The court
of appeals further agreed with the Company that the city's hearing officer did
not have the authority under California Civil Code Section 798.41 to establish
rates that could be charged in the future.

     Following this decision, the CPUC granted the Company its certificate of
convenience and necessity on December 17, 1998 and approved cost based rates and
charges for water that exceed what residents were paying under the Company's
reliance on CPUC Section 2705.5. Concurrently, the CPUC also issued an Order
Instituting Investigation ("OII") confirming its exclusive jurisdiction over the
issue of water rates in a submetered system and commencing an investigation into
the confusion and turmoil over billings in submetered properties. Specifically,
the OII states: "The Commission has exclusive and primary jurisdiction over the
establishment of rates for water and sewer services provided by private
entities."

     Specifically, the CPUC ruling regarding the Company's application stated:
"The ultimate question of what fees and charges may or may not be assessed,
beyond external supplier pass-through charges, for in-park facilities when a
mobile home park does not adhere to the provisions of CPUC Section 2705.5, must
be decided by the Commission."

     After the court of appeals decision, the HOA brought all of its members
back into the underlying civil action for the purpose of determining damages,
including punitive damages, against the Company. The trial was continued from
July 1998 to January 1999 to give the CPUC time to act on the Company's
application. Notwithstanding the action taken by the CPUC in issuing the OII in
December 1998, the trial court denied the Company's motion to dismiss on
jurisdictional grounds and trial commenced before a jury on January 11, 1999.

     Not only did the trial court not consider the Company's motion to dismiss,
the trial court refused to allow evidence of the OII or the Company's CPUC
approval to go before the jury. Notwithstanding the Company's strenuous
objections, the judge also allowed evidence of the Company's and DeAnza's
litigation tactics to be used as evidence of bad faith and oppressive actions
(including evidence of the application to the CPUC requesting a $22.00 readiness
to serve charge). The Company's motion for a mistrial based upon these
evidentiary rulings was denied. On January 22, 1999, the jury returned a verdict
awarding $6.0 million of punitive damages against the Company and DeAnza. The
Company had previously agreed to indemnify DeAnza on the matter.

     The Company has bonded the judgment pending appeal in accordance with
California procedural rules, which require a bond equal to 150% of the amount of
the judgment. Post-judgment interest will accrue at the statutory rate of 10.0%
per annum.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

     On April 19, 1999, the trial court denied all of the Company's and DeAnza's
post-trial motions for judgement notwithstanding the verdict, new trial and
remittitur. The trial court also awarded $700,000 of attorneys' fees to
plaintiffs. The Company has appealed the jury verdict and attorneys' fees award
and the Company has filed its opening brief in the jury verdict case. The
Company also has filed two related appeals challenging the result of related
litigation and a resulting attorneys' fee award. The two related appeals are
based on a preemption argument. The Company asserts the superior courts' ability
to enter an attorneys' fee award in an earlier case and take certain other
actions which were preempted by the exercise of exclusive jurisdiction by the
CPUC over the issue of how to set rates for water in a submetered mobilehome
park. The Company is awaiting notice from the court of appeal setting oral
argument in these two appeals. The jury verdict appeal also raises the
jurisdictional argument as well as several other arguments for reversal of the
punitive damage award or for a new trial. One of the arguments raised by the
Company in the jury verdict appeal is that punitive damages are not available in
a case brought under Section 798.41 of the California Mobilehome Residency Law
("MRL") since the MRL contains its own penalty provisions. The court of appeal
granted the Company's request for judicial notice of the legislative history of
the applicable MRL sections, which indicates to the Company that the court of
appeal is receptive to this argument. Although no assurances can be given, the
Company believes the appeals will be successful.

     Subsequently, in June 1999 the DeAnza Santa Cruz Homeowners Association
filed a complaint in the Superior Court of California, County of Santa Cruz (No.
135991) against the Company, MHC Acquisition One, L.L.C. and Starland Vistas,
Inc. The new lawsuit seeks damages, including punitive damages, for alleged
violations of California Civil Code Sections 798.31 and 798.41 arising from
implementation of utility rates previously approved by the CPUC. The Company
demurred to (filed a motion to dismiss) the complaint on the grounds that the
Court lacks jurisdiction to hear the subject matter of the complaint given that
the CPUC has exclusive jurisdiction over utility rates and charges at the
Property. The California Superior Court denied the motion to dismiss and the
court of appeal denied the Company's request to review the denial of the
demurrer. The California Superior Court has also denied the Company's motion for
summary judgement. The Company intends to vigorously defend the matter,
including by filing a motion for summary judgement. The matter is expected to go
to trial in March 2000.

UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY

     On September 29, 1995, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
("USEPA") issued its Findings of Violations and Order for Compliance with
respect to the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") Permit
governing the operation of the onsite waste water treatment plant at one of the
Properties. On October 6, 1995, the USEPA issued its Findings of Violation and
Order for Compliance with respect to NPDES Permit governing the operation of the
onsite wastewater treatment plant at another of the Properties. The Company and
the USEPA have reached a tentative agreement to resolve the matter in which the
operation of the remaining waste water treatment plant would be subject to a
consent decree that would provide for fines and penalties in the event of future
violations and the Company would contribute monies to a supplemental
environmental project and pay a fine. The tentative agreement has not yet been
reduced to writing and therefore remains subject to change. The Company does not
believe the impact of the settlement will be material and the Company believes
it has established adequate reserves for any amounts that may be paid.

ELLENBURG COMMUNITIES

     In connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities (as
hereinafter defined) and pursuant to orders of the California Superior Court
("Court"), approximately $30 million of the amounts paid by the Company have
been deposited with the court appointed winding up agents (the "Winding Up
Agents"). The deposited amounts relate to claims (the "Karno Claims") of Norton
S. Karno (and related entities) who at various times has been a creditor,
advisor, lawyer and shareholder of certain of the entities related to the
Ellenburg Communities. The Winding Up Agents have disputed the claims and have
filed a complaint against Mr. Karno (and related entities) requesting that the
court determine that the claims be reduced or eliminated.

     On October 30, 1998, the Company received notice of a lawsuit filed against
the Company and certain executive officers of the Company in the Los Angeles
County Superior Court alleging, among other causes of action, that the Company
breached certain agreements in connection with the Ellenburg acquisition and
claiming damages in excess of $50 million plus punitive damages. The Company
believes most of the claim relates to the disputed Karno Claims discussed above.
The Company believes the claims are without merit, intends to vigorously defend
the defendants in this matter and does not believe the impact of this matter
will be material.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

     In connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities, Mr. Karno
and others have appealed various court orders on which the Company has relied.
Mr. Karno has also sought before both the California Superior Court and Court of
Appeals to take control of ECC (as hereinafter defined), but to date none of his
attempts have been successful.

     On September 8, 1999, Ellenburg Fund 20 ("Fund 20") filed a cross complaint
in the dissolution proceeding against the Company and certain of its affiliates
alleging causes of action for fraud and other claims in connection with the
Ellenburg acquisition. By stipulation, the Company has not yet had to respond to
the complaint, which the Company believes to be completely without merit. The
Company's defense to the claims include documents and letters signed by the
court-appointed Winding Up Agents supporting the Company's position.

     Mr. Karno, the Company and certain other parties have entered into a global
settlement agreement which was filed with the Court in February 2000. The Court
will hold a hearing on the motion to approve the settlement agreement in March
2000. Although the Company can provide no assurances that the settlement will be
approved, should the Court approve the settlement agreement, substantially all
of the litigation and appeals involving the Ellenburg acquisition would be
settled or dismissed. At this time, the global settlement agreement does not
dispose of the Fund 20 lawsuit against the Company. However, the Company
believes that there is a substantial likelihood that settlement with Fund 20
will be reached or, if not, that the Company will ultimately successfully defend
itself against the lawsuit.

CANDLELIGHT PROPERTIES, L.L.C

     In 1996, 1997 and 1998, the Lending Partnership made a loan to Candlelight
Properties, L.L.C. ("Borrower") in the principal amount of $8,050,000. The loan
is secured by a mortgage on Candlelight Village ("Candlelight"), a property in
Columbus, Indiana. The Company accounts for the loan as an investment in real
estate and, accordingly, Candlelight's results of operations are consolidated
with the Company's for financial reporting purposes. Concurrently with the
funding of the loan, Borrower granted the Operating Partnership the option to
acquire Candlelight upon the maturity of the loan. The Operating Partnership
notified Borrower that it was exercising its option to acquire Candlelight in
March 1999, and the loan subsequently matured on May 3, 1999. However, Borrower
failed to repay the loan and refused to convey Candlelight to the Operating
Partnership.

     Borrower filed suit in the Circuit Court of Bartholomew County, Indiana
("Court") on May 5, 1999, seeking declaratory judgment on the validity of the
exercise of the option. The Lending Partnership filed suit in the Court the next
day, seeking to foreclose its mortgage, and the suits were consolidated by the
Court. The Court issued an Order on December 1, 1999, finding, among other
things, that the Operating Partnership had validly exercised the option. Both
parties have filed motions to correct errors in the Order, which motions are
currently pending before the Court. The Court has not yet ruled on the
foreclosure complaint; however, given the Court's finding in the Order, the
Lending Partnership believes that Borrower has no valid defense in the
foreclosure action. The Operating Partnership and the Lending Partnership intend
to continue vigorously pursuing this matter and believe that, while no assurance
can be given, such efforts will be successful.

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. Management believes that all proceedings herein
described or referred to, taken together, are not expected to have a material
adverse impact on the Company.
