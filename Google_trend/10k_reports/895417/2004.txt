ITEM 1. BUSINESS

                                  THE COMPANY

GENERAL

     Manufactured Home Communities, Inc., together with MHC Operating Limited
Partnership (the "Operating Partnership") and other consolidated subsidiaries
("Subsidiaries"), are referred to herein as the "Company", "MHC", "we", "us",
and "our". The Company is a fully integrated company that owns and operates
manufactured home communities ("Communities") and park model communities
("Resorts") (collectively known as "Properties"). The Company was formed to
continue the property operations, business objectives and acquisition strategies
of an entity that had owned and operated Communities since 1969. As of December
31, 2003, we owned or had an ownership interest in a portfolio of 142
Communities and Resorts located throughout the United States containing 51,715
residential sites. These Properties are located in 19 states (with the number of
Properties in each state shown parenthetically) - Florida (52), California (25),
Arizona (21), Colorado (10), Delaware (7), Nevada (5), Oregon (4), Indiana (3),
Illinois (2), Iowa (2), New York (1), Texas (2), Utah (2), Pennsylvania (1),
Montana (1), New Mexico (1), Michigan (1), Virginia (1), and Washington (1).

     Communities are residential developments designed and improved for the
placement of detached, single-family manufactured homes that are produced
off-site and installed and set on residential sites ("Site Set") within the
Community. The owner of each home leases the site on which it is located. Modern
Communities are similar to typical residential subdivisions, containing
centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs and gutters and parkways. In
addition, these Communities often provide a clubhouse for social activities and
recreation and other amenities, which may include swimming pools, shuffleboard
courts, tennis courts, laundry facilities and cable television service. In some
cases, utilities are provided or arranged for by the owner of the Community;
otherwise, the resident contracts for the utility directly. Some Communities
provide water and sewer service through municipal or regulated utilities, while
others provide these services to residents from on-site facilities. Each
Community is generally designed to attract, and is marketed to, one of two types
of residents - 1) retirees and empty-nesters or 2) families and first-time
homeowners. We believe both types of Communities are attractive investments and
focus on owning Communities in or near large metropolitan markets and retirement
destinations.

     Resorts are similar to Communities in their overall design and the
amenities they provide. Our Resorts typically include sites designed to
accommodate Site Set homes, park model homes, luxury motor-coaches and a variety
of recreational vehicles. A park model, sometimes referred to as a vacation
cottage, is a factory built detached single-family structure generally with
approximately 400 square feet. Owners often add sunrooms, porches and/or decks
after the home is placed on site. Our Resorts are marketed to attract residents
seeking a second home or vacation home as well as those seeking a long-term or
full season recreational vehicle site. A majority of our Resort residents own
homes in the Resort and/or lease the site annually or for a full season.

     We have approximately 1,000 full-time employees dedicated to carrying out
our operating philosophy and strategies of value enhancement and service to
residents. The operations of each Property are coordinated by an on-site team of
employees that typically includes a manager or two-person management team,
clerical and maintenance workers, each of whom work to provide maintenance and
care of the Properties. Direct supervision of on-site management is the
responsibility of our regional vice presidents and regional and district
managers. These individuals have significant experience in addressing the needs
of residents and in finding or creating innovative approaches to maximize value
and increase cash flow from property operations. Complementing this field
management staff are approximately 60 corporate employees who assist on-site
management in all property functions.


FORMATION OF THE COMPANY

     We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a real estate investment
trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended
December 31, 1993. We plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as
a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical and complex.
We cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the
future as a REIT. The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of
various factual matters that may not be totally within our control and we cannot
provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") will agree with
our analysis. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross
income must come from sources that are itemized in the REIT tax laws. We are
also required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable
income excluding capital gains. The fact that we hold our assets through MHC
Operating Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the
application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or inadvertent mistake
could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and the IRS might make
changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the

                                       3
<PAGE>
courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for
us to remain qualified as a REIT. We do not believe, however, that any pending
or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

     If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax
at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain
statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years
following the year we first failed to qualify. Even if the Company qualifies for
taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on
its income and property and Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed
income.

     The operations of the Company are conducted primarily through the Operating
Partnership. The Company contributed the proceeds from its initial public
offering and subsequent offerings to the Operating Partnership for a general
partnership interest. The financial results of the Operating Partnership and the
Subsidiaries are consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial
statements. In addition, since certain activities, if performed by the Company,
may not be qualifying REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), the Company has formed taxable REIT subsidiaries as
defined in the Code to engage in such activities. Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI")
is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that, doing business as Carefree
Sales, is engaged in the business of purchasing, selling and leasing
manufactured homes that are located or will be located in Properties owned and
managed by the Company. Carefree Sales also provides brokerage services to
residents at such Properties. Typically, residents move from a Community but do
not relocate their homes. Carefree Sales may provide brokerage services, in
competition with other local brokers, by seeking buyers for the homes. Carefree
Sales also leases inventory homes to prospective residents with the expectation
that the tenant eventually will purchase the home. Subsidiaries of RSI lease
from the Operating Partnership certain real property within or adjacent to
certain Properties consisting of golf courses, pro shops, stores and
restaurants.


BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND OPERATING STRATEGIES

     Our strategy seeks to maximize both current income and long-term growth in
income. We focus on Properties that have strong cash flow and we expect to hold
such Properties for long-term investment and capital appreciation. In
determining cash flow potential, we evaluate our ability to attract and retain
high quality residents in our Properties who take pride in their Property and in
their home. These business objectives and their implementation are determined by
our Board of Directors and may be changed at any time. Our investment and
operating approach includes:

     o    Providing consistently high levels of services and amenities in
          attractive surroundings to foster a strong sense of community and
          pride of home ownership;

     o    Efficiently managing the Properties to increase operating margins by
          controlling expenses, increasing occupancy and maintaining competitive
          market rents;

     o    Increasing income and property values by continuing the strategic
          expansion and, where appropriate, renovation of the Properties;

     o    Utilizing management information systems to evaluate potential
          acquisitions, identify and track competing properties and monitor
          resident satisfaction; and

     o    Selectively acquiring Properties that have potential for long-term
          cash flow growth and to create property concentrations in and around
          major metropolitan areas and retirement destinations to capitalize on
          operating synergies and incremental efficiencies.

     We are committed to enhancing our reputation as the most respected brand
name in the industry. Our strategy is to own and operate the highest quality
Properties in sought-after locations near both urban areas and retirement
destinations across the United States. The focus is on creating an attractive
residential environment for homeowners by providing a well-maintained,
comfortable Property with a variety of organized recreational and social
activities and superior amenities. In addition, we regularly conduct evaluations
of the cost of housing in the marketplaces in which our Properties are located
and survey rental rates of competing Communities and Resorts. From time to time
we also conduct satisfaction surveys of our residents to determine the factors
they consider most important in choosing a Property.

                                       4

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS

     Over the last eight years our portfolio of Properties has grown by 73
Properties. We continually review the Properties in our portfolio to ensure that
they fit our business objectives. Over the last four years, through the
acquisition or sale of 50 Properties, we have redeployed capital to markets we
believe have greater long-term potential. We believe that opportunities for
Property acquisitions are still available and in general consolidation within
the industry will continue (see - The Industry - Industry Consolidation).
Increasing acceptability of and demand for Site Set homes and vacation cottages
and continued constraints on development of new Properties continue to add to
their attractiveness as an investment. We believe we have a competitive
advantage in the acquisition of additional Properties due to our experienced
management, significant presence in major real estate markets and substantial
capital resources. We are actively seeking to acquire additional Communities and
Resorts and are engaged in various stages of negotiations relating to the
possible acquisition of a number of Properties.

     We anticipate that newly acquired Properties will be located in the United
States. We utilize market information systems to identify and evaluate
acquisition opportunities, including a market database to review the primary
economic indicators of the various locations in which we expect to expand our
operations. Acquisitions will be financed from the most appropriate sources of
capital, which may include undistributed funds from operations, issuance of
additional equity securities, sales of investments, collateralized and
uncollateralized borrowings and issuance of debt securities. In addition, the
Operating Partnership may issue units of limited partnership interest ("OP
Units") to finance acquisitions. We believe that an ownership structure which
includes the Operating Partnership will permit us to acquire additional
Communities and Resorts in transactions that may defer all or a portion of the
sellers' tax consequences.

When evaluating potential acquisitions, we will consider such factors as:
     o    the replacement cost of the Property,
     o    the geographic area and type of Property,
     o    the location, construction quality, condition and design of the
          Property,
     o    the current and projected cash flow of the Property and the ability to
          increase cash flow,
     o    the potential for capital appreciation of the Property,
     o    the terms of tenant leases, including the potential for rent
          increases,
     o    the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory
          environment of the community in which the Property is located,
     o    the potential for expansion of the physical layout of the Property and
          the number of sites,
     o    the occupancy and demand by residents for Properties of a similar type
          in the vicinity and the residents' profile,
     o    the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of
          the Property, and
     o    the competition from existing Properties and the potential for the
          construction of new Properties in the area.

We expect to purchase Properties with physical and market characteristics
similar to the Properties in our current portfolio. When investing capital we
consider all potential uses of the capital including returning capital to our
stockholders. As a result, during 1999 and 2000 we implemented our stock
repurchase program, and our Board of Directors continues to review the
conditions under which we will repurchase our stock. These conditions include,
but are not limited to, market price, balance sheet flexibility, other
opportunities and capital requirements.


PROPERTY EXPANSIONS

     Several of our Properties have available land for expanding the number of
sites available to be leased to residents. Development of these sites
("Expansion Sites") is predicated by local market conditions and permitted by
zoning and other applicable laws. When justified, development of Expansion Sites
allows us to leverage existing facilities and amenities to increase the income
generated from the Properties. Where appropriate, facilities and amenities may
be upgraded or added to certain Properties to make those Properties more
attractive in their markets. Our acquisition philosophy has included the desire
to own Properties with potential Expansion Site development, and we have been
successful in acquiring a number of such Properties. Several examples of these
Properties include the 1993 acquisition of The Heritage with potential
development of approximately 288 Expansion Sites, the 1994 acquisition of Bulow
Plantation with potential development of approximately 725 Expansion Sites, the
1997 acquisition of Golf Vista Estates with potential development of
approximately 88 Expansion Sites, the 1999 acquisition of Coquina Crossing with
potential development of approximately 393 Expansion Sites, and the 2001
acquisitions of Grand Island and The Lakes at Countrywood with combined
potential development of 224 Expansion Sites.

     Of our 142 Properties, ten may be expanded consistent with existing zoning
regulations. In 2004, we expect to develop an additional 205 Expansion Sites
within three of these Properties. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately
713 Expansion Sites available for occupancy in 22 of the Properties. We filled
136 Expansion Sites in 2003 and expect to fill an additional 150 to 200
Expansion Sites in 2004.

                                       5
<PAGE>
LEASES

     At our Communities, a typical lease entered into between the resident and
the Company for the rental of a site is for a month-to-month or year-to-year
term, renewable upon the consent of both parties or, in some instances, as
provided by statute. These leases are cancelable, depending on applicable law,
for non-payment of rent, violation of Community rules and regulations or other
specified defaults. Non-cancelable long-term leases, with remaining terms
ranging up to ten years, are in effect at certain sites within 25 of the
Communities. Some of these leases are subject to rental rate increases based on
the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), in some instances taking into consideration
certain floors and ceilings and allowing for pass-throughs of certain items such
as real estate taxes, utility expenses and capital expenditures. Generally,
market rate adjustments are made on an annual basis.


REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE

     General. Our Properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and
regulations, including regulations relating to recreational facilities such as
swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas. We believe that each Property
has the necessary permits and approvals to operate.

     Rent Control Legislation. At certain of our Communities, state and local
rent control laws, principally in California, limit our ability to increase
rents and to recover increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital
improvements. Enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time in
other jurisdictions. We presently expect to continue to maintain Communities,
and may purchase additional Communities, in markets that are either subject to
rent control or in which rent-limiting legislation exists or may be enacted. For
example, Florida has enacted a law that generally provides that rental increases
must be reasonable. Also, certain jurisdictions in California in which we own
Communities limit rent increases to changes in the CPI or some percentage
thereof. As part of our effort to realize the value of our Properties subject to
restrictive regulation, we have initiated lawsuits against several
municipalities imposing such regulation in an attempt to balance the interests
of our shareholders with the interests of our residents

     Insurance. We believe that the Properties are covered by adequate fire,
flood, property, earthquake and business interruption insurance (where
appropriate) provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable
deductibles and limits. Due to the lack of available commercially reasonable
coverage, we are self-insured for terrorist incidents, except at certain
Properties where terrorist insurance coverage is required by debt covenants. We
believe our insurance coverage is adequate based on our assessment of the risks
to be insured, the probability of loss and the relative cost of available
coverage. We have obtained title insurance insuring title to the Properties in
an aggregate amount which we believe to be adequate.


                                    INDUSTRY

THE INDUSTRY

     We believe that modern Properties similar to ours provide an opportunity
for increased cash flows and appreciation in value. These may be achieved
through increases in occupancy rates and rents, as well as expense controls,
expansion of existing Properties and opportunistic acquisitions, for the
following industry-specific reasons:

     o    Barriers to Entry: We believe that the supply of new Properties will
          be constrained due to barriers to entry into the industry. The most
          significant barrier has been the difficulty in securing zoning from
          local authorities. This has been the result of (i) the public's
          historically poor perception of the industry, and (ii) the fact that
          Properties generate less tax revenue because the homes are treated as
          personal property (a benefit to the home owner) rather than real
          property. Another factor that creates substantial barriers to entry is
          the length of time between investment in a Property's development and
          the attainment of stabilized occupancy and the generation of revenues.
          The initial development of the infrastructure may take up to two or
          three years. Once the Property is ready for occupancy, it may be
          difficult to attract customers to an empty Property. Substantial
          occupancy levels may take several years to achieve.

     o    Industry Consolidation: According to an industry analyst's industry
          report, there are approximately 50,000 Communities in the United
          States, and approximately 6.5% or 3,250 of the Communities have more
          than 200 sites and would be considered "investment-grade" properties.
          The four public REITs that own Communities own approximately 328 or
          about 10% of the "investment-grade" Communities. In addition, based on
          a report prepared by one analyst, the top 150 owners of Communities
          own approximately 69% of the "investment-grade" assets. We believe
          that this relatively high degree of fragmentation in the industry
          provides us, as a national organization with experienced management
          and substantial financial resources, the opportunity to purchase
          additional Communities.

     o    Stable Tenant Base: We believe that Properties tend to achieve and
          maintain a stable rate of occupancy due to the following factors: (i)
          residents own their own homes, (ii) Properties tend to foster a sense
          of community as a result of amenities such as clubhouses, recreational
          and social activities and (iii) since moving a Site Set home or
          vacation cottage from one Property to another involves substantial
          cost and effort, residents often sell their home in-place (similar to
          site-built residential housing) with no interruption of rental
          payments.


SITE SET HOUSING AND VACATION COTTAGES

     Based on the current growth in the number of individuals living in Site Set
homes and vacation cottages, we believe that these homes are increasingly viewed
by the public as an attractive and economical form of housing.

     We believe that the growing popularity of these homes is primarily the
result of the following factors:

     o    Importance of Home Ownership. According to the Fannie Mae 2001
          National Housing Survey ("FNMA Survey"), renters' desire to own a home
          continues to be a top priority.

     o    Affordability. For a significant number of people, these homes
          represent the only means of achieving home ownership. In addition, the
          total cost of housing in a Property (home cost, site rent and related
          occupancy costs) is competitive with and often lower than the total
          cost of alternative housing, such as apartments and condominiums, and
          generally substantially lower than "stick-built" residential
          alternatives.

     o    Lifestyle Choice. As the average age of the United States population
          has increased, this housing choice has become an increasingly popular
          housing alternative for retirement and "empty-nest" living. According
          to the FNMA Survey, the baby-boom generation - the 80 million people
          born between 1945 and 1964 - will constitute 18% of the U.S.
          population within the next 30 years and more than 32 million people
          will reach age 55 within the next ten years. Among those individuals
          who are nearing retirement (age 40 to 54), approximately 33% plan on
          moving upon retirement. We believe that this housing choice is
          especially attractive to such individuals when located within a
          Property that offers an appealing amenity package, close proximity to
          local services, social activities, low maintenance and a secure
          environment.

     o    Construction Quality. Since 1976, all Site Set housing has been
          required to meet stringent Federal standards, resulting in significant
          increases in the quality of the industry's product. The Department of
          Housing and Urban Development's standards for Site Set housing
          construction quality are the only Federally regulated standards
          governing housing quality of any type in the United States. Site Set
          homes produced since 1976 have received a "red and silver" government
          seal certifying that they were built in compliance with the Federal
          code. The code regulates Site Set home design and construction,
          strength and durability, fire resistance and energy efficiency, and
          the installation and performance of heating, plumbing, air
          conditioning, thermal and electrical systems. In newer homes, top
          grade lumber and dry wall materials are common. Also, manufacturers
          are required to follow the same fire codes as builders of site-built
          structures. In addition, although vacation cottages do not come under
          the same regulation, many of the manufacturers of Site Set homes also
          produce vacation cottages with many of the same quality standards.

     o    Comparability to Site-Built Homes. The Site Set housing industry has
          experienced a trend towards multi-section homes. Many modern Site Set
          homes are longer (up to 80 feet, compared to 50 feet in the 1960's)
          and wider than earlier models. Many such homes have vaulted ceilings,
          fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms, and closely resemble single
          family ranch style site-built homes.

     o    Second home demographics. Over the past ten years there has been a
          significant increase in the second home market. According to a
          November 2002 study by the National Association of Realtors ("NAR"),
          sales of second homes have risen almost 36% in ten years. Six percent
          of all home sales each year are second homes. The NAR study found that
          48% of people who own a second home own either a cabin, cottage or
          manufactured home. According to the US Census Bureau, there were 9.2
          million homes held by owners in addition to their primary residence.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     Our Properties provide attractive amenities and common facilities that
create a comfortable and attractive home for our residents, with most offering a
clubhouse, a swimming pool, laundry facilities and cable television service.
Many also offer additional amenities such as sauna/whirlpool spas, golf courses,
tennis, shuffleboard and basketball courts and exercise rooms. Since residents
in our Properties own their homes, it is their responsibility to maintain their
homes and the surrounding area. It is our role to ensure that residents comply
with our Property policies and to provide maintenance of the common areas,
facilities and amenities. We hold periodic meetings with our Property management
personnel for training and implementation of our strategies. The Properties
historically have had, and we believe they will continue to have, low turnover
and high occupancy rates.

     The distribution of our Properties throughout the United States reflects
our belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio from
regional economic influences. We intend to target new acquisitions in or near
markets where our Properties are located and will also consider acquisitions of
Properties outside such markets. The following table identifies our five largest
markets and provides information regarding our Properties, including Communities
owned in joint ventures.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

DEANZA SANTA CRUZ

     The residents of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a Property located in
Santa Cruz, California, brought several actions opposing fees and charges in
connection with water service at the Property. As a result of one action, the
Company rebated approximately $36,000 to the residents. The DeAnza Santa Cruz
Homeowners Association ("HOA") then proceeded to a jury trial alleging these
"overcharges" entitled them to an award of punitive damages. In January 1999, a
jury awarded the HOA $6.0 million in punitive damages. On December 21, 2001 the
California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District reversed the $6.0 million
punitive damage award, the related award of attorneys' fees, and, as a result,
all post-judgment interest thereon, on the basis that punitive damages are not
available as a remedy for a statutory violation of the California Mobilehome
Residency Law ("MRL"). The decision of the appellate court left the HOA, the
plaintiff in this matter, with the right to seek a new trial in which it must
prove its entitlement to either the statutory penalty and attorneys' fees
available under the MRL or punitive damages based on causes of action for fraud,
misrepresentation or other tort. In order to resolve this matter, the Company
accrued for and agreed to pay $201,000 to the HOA. This payment resolved the
punitive damage claim. The HOA's attorney has made a motion asking for an award
of attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of approximately $1.5 million as a
result of this resolution of the litigation. On April 2, 2003 the court awarded
attorney's fees to the HOA's attorney in the amount of $593,000 and court costs
of approximately $20,000. The Company has appealed this award and has not
accrued for the amount in its consolidated financial statements.


OTHER CALIFORNIA RENT CONTROL LITIGATION

     As part of the Company's effort to realize the value of its Properties
subject to rent control, the Company has initiated lawsuits against several
municipalities in California. The Company's goal is to achieve a level of
regulatory fairness in California's rent control jurisdictions, and in
particular those jurisdictions that prohibit increasing rents to market upon
turnover. This regulatory feature, called vacancy control, allows tenants to
sell their homes for a premium representing the value of the future discounted
rent-controlled rents. In the Company's view, such regulation results in a
transfer of the value of the Company's shareholders' land, which would otherwise
be reflected in market rents, to tenants upon the sales of their homes in the
form of an inflated purchase price that cannot be attributed to the value of the
home being sold. As a result, in the Company's view, the Company loses the value
of its asset and the selling tenant leaves the Community with a windfall
premium. The Company has discovered through the litigation process that certain
municipalities considered condemning the Company's Communities at values well
below the value of the underlying land. In the Company's view, a failure to
articulate market rents for sites governed by restrictive rent control would put
the Company at risk for condemnation or eminent domain proceedings based on
artificially reduced rents. Such a physical taking, should it occur, could
represent substantial lost value to shareholders. The Company is cognizant of
the need for affordable housing in the jurisdictions, but asserts that
restrictive rent regulation with vacancy control does not promote this purpose
because the benefits of such regulation are fully capitalized into the prices of
the homes sold. The Company estimates that the annual rent subsidy to tenants in
these jurisdictions is approximately $15 million. In a more well-balanced
regulatory environment, the Company would receive market rents that would
eliminate the subsidy and homes would trade at or near their intrinsic value.

     In connection with such efforts, the Company recently announced it has
entered into a settlement agreement with the City of Santa Cruz, California and
that, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the City amended its rent control
ordinance to exempt the Company's property from rent control as long as the
Company offers a long term lease which gives the Company the ability to increase
rents to market upon turnover and bases annual rent increases on the CPI. The
settlement agreement benefits the Company's shareholders by allowing them to
receive the value of their investment in this Community through vacancy
decontrol while preserving annual CPI based rent increases in this age
restricted Property.

     The Company's efforts to achieve a balanced regulatory environment
incentivize tenant groups to file lawsuits against the Company seeking large
damage awards. The homeowners association at Contempo Marin ("CMHOA"), a 396
site Property in San Rafael, California, sued the Company in December 2000 over
a prior settlement agreement on a capital pass-through after the Company sued
the City of San Rafael in October 2000 alleging its rent control ordinance is
unconstitutional. In the Contempo Marin case, the CMHOA prevailed on a motion
for summary judgment on an issue that permits the Company to collect only $3.72
out of a monthly pass-through amount of $7.50 that the Company believes had been
agreed to by the CMHOA in a settlement agreement. The Company intends to
vigorously defend this matter, which has been stayed pending a related state
court appeal by the Company of an order dismissing its claims against the City
of San Rafael. The Company believes that such lawsuits will be a consequence of
the Company's efforts to change rent control since tenant groups actively desire
to preserve the premium value of their homes in addition to the discounted rents
provided by rent control. The Company has determined that its efforts to
rebalance the regulatory environment despite the risk of litigation from tenant
groups are necessary not only because of the $15 million annual subsidy to
tenants, but also because of the condemnation risk.

ELLENBURG COMMUNITIES

     The Company and certain other parties entered into a settlement agreement
(the "Settlement"), which was approved by the Los Angeles County Superior Court
in April 2000. The Settlement resolved substantially all of the litigation and
appeals involving the Ellenburg Properties, and transactions arising out of the
Settlement closed on May 22, 2000. Only the appeal of one entity remained, the
outcome of which was not expected to materially affect the Company.

     In connection with the Ellenburg Acquisition, on September 8, 1999,
Ellenburg Fund 20 ("Fund 20") filed a cross complaint in the Ellenburg
dissolution proceeding against the Company and certain of its affiliates
alleging causes of action for fraud and other claims in connection with the
Ellenburg Acquisition. The Company subsequently successfully had the cross
complaint against the Company and its affiliates dismissed with prejudice by the
California Superior Court. However, Fund 20 appealed. Although this appeal was
one not resolved by the Settlement, the California Court of Appeal dismissed
Fund 20's substantive appeals on March 13, 2003 as moot. Fund 20 petitioned the
California Supreme Court to review this decision which review was denied.

     In October 2001, Fund 20 sued the Company and certain of its affiliates
again, this time in Alameda County, California making substantially the same
allegations. The Company obtained an injunction preventing the case from
proceeding until the Fund 20 appeal is decided and other related proceedings in
Arizona (from which the Company has already been dismissed with prejudice) are
concluded. The Company obtained a court order enjoining Fund 20 from proceeding
with its Alameda County action.

     In February, 2004, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with
Fund 20 resolving all remaining matters at no cost to the Company and with
mutual releases.


COUNTRYSIDE AT VERO BEACH

     The Company has received letters dated June 17, 2002 and August 26, 2002
from Indian River County ("County"), claiming that the Company currently owes
sewer impact fees in the amount of approximately $518,000 with respect to the
Property known as Countryside at Vero Beach, located in Vero Beach, Florida,
purportedly under the terms of an agreement between the County and a prior owner
of the Property. In response, the Company has advised the County that these fees
are no longer due and owing as a result of a 1996 settlement agreement between
the County and the prior owner of the Property, providing for the payment of
$150,000 to the County to discharge any further obligation for the payment of
impact or connection fees for sewer service at the Property. The Company paid
this settlement amount (with interest) to the County in connection with the
Company's acquisition of the Property. Accordingly, the Company believes that
the County's claims are without merit.


DELAWARE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION

     In April 2002, the Company entered into a Stipulation and Consent Order to
Cease and Desist (the "Consent Order") with the State of Delaware (the "State").
The Consent Order resolved various issues raised by the State concerning the
terms of a new lease form used or proposed for use by the Company at certain of
its Properties in Delaware. Among other provisions, the Consent Order
contemplated that the Company would work with the State to develop and implement
a new lease form for use in Delaware. The Consent Order expressly provided that
nothing contained therein would preclude the Company from seeking declaratory
relief from a court as to the legality or enforceability of any provisions which
the Company might wish to incorporate in future leases.

     Throughout the summer of 2002, the Company's Delaware legal counsel engaged
in dialogue with representatives of the State concerning various matters,
including the lease provisions to which the State had objected but which the
Company wished to incorporate in future leases. Through this process, it became
apparent that the parties could not reach agreement as to the legality or
enforceability of the proposed lease provisions, and that the Company would need
to seek declaratory relief from a court in order to resolve the matter, as
contemplated by the Consent Order. Accordingly, on August 29, 2002, the Company
filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Other Relief (as amended, the
"Petition") in Sussex County, Delaware Superior Court (the "Court").

     In response to the filing of the Petition, on October 1, 2002, the State
filed its Answer to Petition for Declaratory and Other Relief, and Counterclaims
for Civil Enforcement and Contempt (as amended, "Answer and Counterclaim") with
the Court. In the Answer and Counterclaim, the State sought, inter alia,
restitution, statutory penalties, investigative costs and attorneys' fees under
the Delaware Mobile Home Lots and Leases Act, the Consumer Fraud Act, the
Uniform Deceptive

                                       15
<PAGE>
Trade Practices Act and the Delaware Consumer Contracts law, and separately
sought a finding of contempt and related contempt penalties for alleged
violations of the Consent Order.

     The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss Respondents' Counterclaims with the
Court on October 29, 2002, and the State filed a Motion for Summary Judgment
with the Court on November 15, 2002. On December 30, 2002, the Company filed a
First Amended Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Other Relief with the Court,
and on January 31, 2003, the State filed an Amended Answer and Counterclaim with
the Court.

     On August 29, 2003, the Court issued its decision disposing of all pending
claims in the litigation except one. Specifically, the Court held, inter alia,
that (i) the Company may eliminate the rent cap formula from existing leases at
certain of its Delaware Properties as the leases come up for renewal, (ii)
certain lease provisions proposed by the Company may not be implemented or
enforced under applicable state law, (iii) the change in water supplier at one
of the Properties did not violate the leases at such Property, (iv) the Company
did not violate the Consent Order by filing the Petition, and (v) the Company
did not violate any state statutes as alleged by the State.

     The August 29, 2003 decision left open the issue of whether the Company had
violated the Consent Order by continuing to use the disputed lease form (but not
enforce the provisions at issue) at one of its Properties following entry of the
Consent Order (the Company believed that it had no choice but to continue to use
this lease form until the State had approved a new form for use at the Property
as contemplated by the Consent Order). On October 3, 2003, the Court issued its
final order, finding that continued use of the disputed lease form, as to new
tenants but not as to renewal tenants, following entry of the Consent Order
constituted a violation thereof, and assessing a civil penalty in the amount of
$5,000.

     On November 3, 2003, the State filed a Notice of Appeal with the Supreme
Court of the State of Delaware, appealing a portion of the Court's order denying
the State's Motion for Summary Judgment. The State's appeal is limited to the
single issue of whether the Company has the right to eliminate "rent cap"
provisions contained in certain existing leases upon automatic renewal of the
leases in accordance with Delaware law. The appeal has been fully briefed, and
oral argument in the matter is scheduled for March 16, 2004.

     On November 14, 2003, the State filed a motion for Stay Pending Appeal with
the Court, and on December 3, 2003, the Company filed its response opposing the
motion. On December 16, 2003, the Court issued its order on the motion, holding
that the Company may proceed to issue notices of default to tenants who fail to
pay the full amount of their current rental obligations, but may not initiate
eviction proceedings against such tenants until April 1, 2004, and may not
enforce any such eviction order until the Supreme Court rules on the appeal.

(1)  See the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company included elsewhere
     herein. Certain 2002, 2001, 2000, and 1999 amounts have been reclassified
     to conform to the 2003 financial presentation. Such reclassifications have
     no effect on the operations or equity as originally presented.

(2)  On October 17, 2003, we closed 49 mortgage loans collateralized by 51
     Properties (the "Recap") providing total proceeds of approximately $501
     million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.84% and with a weighted
     average maturity of approximately 9 years. Approximately $170 million of
     the proceeds were used to repay amounts outstanding on the Company's line
     of credit and term loan. Approximately $225 million was used to pay a
     special distribution of $8.00 per share on January 16, 2004. The remaining
     funds are being held in short-term investments and will be used for
     investment purposes in 2004. The Recap resulted in increased interest and
     amortization expense and the special distribution resulted in decreased
     stockholder's equity.

(3)  We believe that the book value of the Properties, which reflects the
     historical costs of such real estate assets less accumulated depreciation,
     is less than the current market value of the Properties.

(4)  We generally consider Funds From Operations ("FFO") to be an appropriate
     measure of the non-GAAP performance of an equity Real Estate Investment
     Trust ("REIT"). FFO was redefined by the National Association of Real
     Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") in April 2002, as net income (computed
     in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ["GAAP"]),
     before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from
     sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for
     unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. For purposes of presenting
     FFO, the revised definition of FFO has been given retroactive treatment. We
     believe that FFO is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of
     an equity REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities,
     financing activities and investing activities, it provides investors an
     understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and to make capital
     expenditures. We compute FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition which
     may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other
     equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs'
     computations. FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated from
     operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be
     considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance
     or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a
     measure of liquidity and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to
     fund cash needs.

TRENDS

     Occupancy in our Properties as well as our ability to increase rental rates
directly affect revenues. In 2003, occupancy in our Core Portfolio decreased
1.9%. Also during 2003, average monthly base rental rates for the Core Portfolio
increased approximately 5.1%. We project continued growth during 2004 in our
Core Portfolio performance. Core Portfolio base rental-rate growth is expected
to be approximately 4%. These projections would result in growth of
approximately 2.5% in Core Portfolio income from operations (also referred to as
net operating income or "NOI").


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

     Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us
to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosures. We believe that
the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more
significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements.

     We periodically evaluate our long-lived assets, including our investments
in real estate, for impairment indicators. Our judgments regarding the existence
of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance,
market conditions and legal factors. Future events could occur which would cause
us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is
warranted.

     Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation
is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings acquired and structural
and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year estimated life for building
upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated life for furniture, fixtures and
equipment. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to
operations as incurred and significant renovations and improvements that improve
the asset and extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their
estimated useful life. However, the useful lives, salvage value, and customary
depreciation method used for land improvements and other significant assets may
significantly and materially overstate the depreciation of the underlying assets
and therefore understate the net income of the Company. In addition, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") is currently reviewing the methods
of depreciation and cost capitalization for all industries and in June 2001
issued FASB Exposure Draft, "Accounting in Interim and Annual Financial
Statements for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and
Equipment", the implementation of which, if issued, could also have a material
effect on the Company's results of operations.

     The valuation of financial instruments under Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial
Instruments" ("SFAS No. 107") and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS
No. 133") requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value
of the instruments. Where possible, we base the fair values of our financial
instruments, including our derivative instruments, on listed market prices and
third party quotes. Where these are not available, we base our estimates on
other factors relevant to the financial instrument.

     Certain costs, primarily legal costs, relative to our efforts to
effectively change the use and operations of several Properties subject to rent
control (see Note 17) are currently classified in other assets. These costs, to
the extent these efforts are successful, are capitalized to the extent of the
established value of the revised project and included in the net investment in
real estate for the appropriate Properties (see Note 5). To the extent these
efforts are not successful, these costs will be expensed. In addition, we
capitalize certain costs, primarily legal costs, related to entering into lease
agreements which govern the terms under which we may enter into leases with
individual tenants and which are expensed over the term of the lease agreement.
In 2003, due to the successful settlement of litigation related to one Property,
DeAnza Santa Cruz, we reclassified approximately $5.3 million of these costs to
land improvements and will depreciate these costs over 30 years

     In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities" ("FIN 46"). The objective of FIN 46 is to provide
guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and determine
when the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of
operations of a VIE need to be included in the company's consolidated financial
statements. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to
consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the VIE's expected
losses or receive a majority of the entity's expected residual returns if they
occur, or both.

                                       23
<PAGE>
     The provisions of FIN 46 apply to the Company upon initial involvement with
the respective entity for transactions created after January 31, 2003. The
adoption of FIN 46 in 2003 had no effect on the Company in 2003. The provisions
of FIN 46 and related revised interpretations apply no later than the end of the
first interim reporting period ending March 15, 2004 (March 31, 2004) for
entities created before February 1, 2003. The Company is currently evaluating
and assessing the impact of FIN 46 and the related revised interpretations on
entities created before February 1, 2003.


     CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

     Prior to January 1, 2003 we accounted for our stock compensation in
accordance with APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", based
upon the intrinsic value method. This method results in no compensation expense
for options issued with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value
of the Common Shares on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, we elected
to account for our stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and
its amendment (SFAS No. 148), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", which
will result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of
the stock options and other equity awards issued. SFAS 148 provides three
possible transition methods for changing to the fair value method. We have
elected to use the modified-prospective method. This method requires that we
recognize stock-based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the
fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair
value method had been used to account for all employee awards granted, or
settled, in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. The following table
illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the fair value
method was applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period
presented (amounts in thousands, except per share data):

(1)  Site and occupancy information excludes Resort sites and Properties owned
     through unconsolidated joint ventures as well as the sites of Properties
     acquired or sold during 2002 and 2003.


Property Operating Revenues

     The 3.2% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio
reflects a 5.1% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 1.9%
decrease in average occupied sites. The increase in utility and other income for
the Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in utility income, which
resulted from higher expenses for these items.

Property Operating Expenses

     The 3.7% increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the
Core Portfolio is due primarily to increases in insurance and other expenses,
utility expense, repair and maintenance expense, administrative expense and
payroll expense. The 5.8% increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes is
generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property
management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the
Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating
revenues, increased by 1.5% due to increases in payroll costs and computer
expenses.

     New home sales gross profit reflects a 9.0% increase in sales volume
coupled with a 6.1% decrease in the gross margin. The average selling price of
new homes remained steady year over year. Used home sales gross profit reflects
a decrease in gross margin on used home sales, partially offset by an increase
in volume. Brokered resale revenues reflects increased resale volumes. The 4.0%
decrease in home selling expenses primarily reflects reductions in advertising
expenses.

Other Income and Expenses

     In October, 2003, we received approximately $501 million from the Recap.
The cash received from the Recap was used to pay down our Line of Credit and pay
off our Term Loan, with the remainder placed in short-term investments to be
used for payment of a special distribution in January, 2004 and for future
acquisitions. As a result, interest income increased reflecting additional
interest earned on short-term investments with an average balance of $273
million. The increase in other corporate income reflects increased income from
unconsolidated joint ventures. The decrease in general and administrative
expense is due to decreased professional fees and public company costs,
partially offset by increased payroll costs and banking expenses. Interest and
related amortization increased due to the Recap and the payment of approximately
$3 million to unwind the 2001 Swap, partially offset by decreased interest rates
during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 were approximately $800 million and $731.8
million, respectively. The effective interest rate was 6.4% and 6.8% per annum
for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001

     Since December 31, 2000, the gross investment in real estate increased from
$1,218 million to $1,296 million as of December 31, 2002, due primarily to the
aforementioned acquisitions and dispositions of Properties during the period.
The total number of sites owned or controlled increased from 51,304 as of
December 31, 2000 to 51,582 as of December 31, 2002.

     The following table summarizes certain financial and statistical data for

</TABLE>

(1)  Site and occupancy information excludes Resort sites and Properties owned
     through unconsolidated joint ventures as well as the sites of Properties
     sold during 2002.

Property Operating Revenues

     The 4.1% increase in Community base rental income for the Core Portfolio
reflects a 5.3% increase in monthly base rent per site coupled with a 1.2%
decrease in average occupied sites. The decrease in utility and other income for
the Core Portfolio is due primarily to decreases in utility income, which
resulted from lower expenses for these items.

Property Operating Expenses

     The increase in property operating and maintenance expense for the Core
Portfolio is due primarily to increases in property payroll, insurance and other
expenses, repair and maintenance and administrative expenses, partially offset
by decreased utility expense. The increase in Core Portfolio real estate taxes
is generally due to higher property assessments on certain Properties. Property
management expense for the Core Portfolio, which reflects costs of managing the
Properties and is estimated based on a percentage of Property operating
revenues, increased by 3.8% due to increases in payroll costs and office
expenses.

</TABLE>

     Prior to January 1, 2002, the results of operations of RSI were accounted
for using the equity method and reported on a single line item called Equity in
Income of Affiliates. As a result of the acquisition of RSI (see Note 7), the
Company owns and controls RSI and consolidates the financial results of RSI with
those of the Company. The pro forma presentation of detailed 2001 amounts is for
comparison purposes and has no effect on previously reported net income. For the
year ended December 31, 2001, equity in income of affiliates was approximately
$1.8 million and included the $2.3 million of income from home sales operations
presented above as well as $539,000 of interest income, $15,000 of corporate
expenses and $1.0 million of interest expense.

     New home sales gross profit reflects a 13.4% decrease in sales volume
coupled with a 1.1% decrease in the gross margin. The average selling price of
new homes increased $6,000 or 8.7% compared to 2001. Used home sales gross
profit reflects a decrease in both volume and gross margin on used home sales.
Brokered resale revenues reflects decreased resale volumes. The 6.9% decrease in
home selling expenses primarily reflects reductions in payroll and advertising
expenses.


Other Income and Expenses

     The increase in interest income reflects a decrease in notes receivable
offset by an increase in chattel notes receivable acquired through the
acquisition of RSI. The decrease in other corporate income primarily reflects
decreased income from unconsolidated joint ventures. The increase in general and
administrative expense is due to increases in costs related to operating a
public company, increased payroll costs and increased consulting and legal
costs. Interest and related amortization decreased due to lower interest rates
during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years
ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 were $731.8 million and $713.2 million,
respectively. The effective interest rate was 6.8% and 7.0% per annum for the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

LIQUIDITY

     As of December 31, 2003, we had $325.7 million in cash and cash equivalents
and $110.0 million available on our Line of Credit. We expect to meet our
short-term liquidity requirements, including distributions, generally through
our working capital, net cash provided by operating activities and availability
under the Line of Credit. We expect to meet certain long-term liquidity
requirements such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and
capital improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings
including borrowings under our Line of Credit and the issuance of debt
securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to
working capital.


INFLATION

     Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or
annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve
increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures. Such types of
leases generally minimize our risks of inflation.


FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

     Funds From Operations ("FFO"), a non-GAAP financial performance measure,
was redefined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts
("NAREIT") in April 2002, as net income (computed in accordance with GAAP),
before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains (or losses) from sales
of property, plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for
unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The Company computes FFO in
accordance with the NAREIT definition, which may differ from the methodology for
calculating FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be
comparable to such other REITs' computations. The Company believes that FFO is
useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT because,
along with cash flows from operating activities, financing activities and
investing activities, FFO provides investors an understanding of the ability of
the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital expenditures. FFO does
not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP
and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income as an
indication of the Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating
activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

     The following table presents a calculation of FFO for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (amounts in thousands):

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

     During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired two Florida Properties
for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $17.3 million and completed the
sale of seven properties in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, for a total sale
price of approximately $17.4 million. Also during 2001, we finalized a
settlement agreement whereby we received $10.8 million in proceeds related to
the sale of a Property in Indiana.

     During the year ended December 31, 2002, we acquired the eleven Properties
listed in the table below. The acquisitions were funded with borrowings on our
Line of Credit and the assumption of $47.9 million of mortgage debt, which
includes a $3.0 million mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we purchased
adjacent land and land improvements for several Properties for approximately
$559,000.

     During the year ended 2002, we effectively sold 17 Properties as part of a
restructuring of the College Heights Joint Venture discussed hereinafter. In
addition, we sold Camelot Acres, a 319 site Property in Burnsville, Minnesota,
for approximately $14.2 million.

     During the year ended December 31, 2003, we sold the three Properties

the Company's Line of Credit. Also during the same period, we acquired a parcel
of land adjacent to one of our Properties for approximately $97,000.

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES

     Effective September 1, 2002, the Company restructured its investment in
Wolverine Property Investment Limited Partnership (the "College Heights Joint
Venture" or the "Venture"), a joint venture with Wolverine Investors, LLP. The
Venture included 18 Properties with 3,581 sites. The results of operations of
the College Heights Joint Venture prior to restructuring were included with the
results of the Company due to the Company's voting equity interest and control
over the Venture. Pursuant to the restructuring, the Company sold its general
partnership interest, sold all of the Company's voting equity interest and
reduced the Company's total investment in the College Heights Joint Venture. As
consideration for the sale, the Company retained sole ownership of Down Yonder,
a 361 site community in Clearwater, Florida, received cash of approximately $5.2
million and retained preferred limited partnership interests of approximately
$10.3 million, recorded net of a $2.4 million reserve. The continuing preferred
limited partnership interests are accounted for using the equity method and
reported as an investment in a joint venture.


ACQUISITION OF REALTY SYSTEMS, INC.

     On January 1, 2002, the Company purchased all of the common stock of Realty
Systems, Inc. ("RSI"). The Company previously owned the non-voting preferred
stock of RSI and had notes receivable from RSI which were recorded as an
investment in affiliate. The Company purchased the common stock of RSI from
Equity Group Investments, Inc., controlled by Samuel Zell, Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Company, for approximately $675,000. As a result of this
acquisition, the Company owns and controls RSI and consolidates the financial
results of RSI with those of the Company including $839,000 of cash from the
acquisition on January 1, 2002.


CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

     Capital expenditures for improvements are identified by the Company as
recurring capital expenditures ("Recurring CapEx"), site development costs and
corporate costs. Recurring CapEx was approximately $11.9 million and $13.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Of these
expenditures, the Company believes that approximately $8.0 million or $155 per
site for 2003 and $7.6 million or $147 per site for 2002 are non-revenue
producing improvements which are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain
occupancy levels and maintain competitive market rents for new and renewing
residents. Site development costs were approximately $9.0 million and $10.4
million for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and
represent costs to develop expansion sites at certain of the Company's
Properties and costs for improvements to sites when a smaller used home is
replaced with a larger new home.


EQUITY TRANSACTIONS

     In order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the Company
must distribute 90% or more of its taxable income (excluding capital gains) to
its stockholders. The following distributions have been declared and/or paid to
common stockholders and minority interests since January 1, 2001.

     On December 12, 2003, we declared a one-time special distribution of $8.00
per share payable to stockholders of record on January 8, 2004. We used proceeds
from the $501 million borrowing in October, 2003 to pay the special distribution
on January 16, 2004. The special cash dividend will be reflected on
stockholders' 2004 1099-DIV to be issued in January 2005.

EQUITY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)

     The Operating Partnership paid distributions of 9.0% per annum on the $125
million of Series D Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Units ("Preferred
Units"). Distributions on the Preferred Units were paid annually on the last
calendar day of each quarter beginning December 31, 1999. The Company expects to
continue to make regular annual distributions and has set its 2004 distribution
to common stockholders at $0.05 per share per annum.


MORTGAGES AND CREDIT FACILITIES

     On October 17, 2003, we closed 49 mortgage loans collateralized by 51
Properties (the "Recap") providing total proceeds of approximately $501 million
at a weighted average interest rate of 5.84% and with a weighted average
maturity of approximately 9 years. Approximately $170 million of the proceeds
were used to repay amounts outstanding on the Company's Line of Credit and Term
Loan. Approximately $225 million was used to pay a special dividend of $8.00 per
share on January 16, 2004. The remaining funds are being held in short-term
investments and will be used primarily for investments in 2004.

     We have an unsecured Line of Credit with a group of banks (the "Line of
Credit") with a total facility of $110 million, bearing interest at the London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.65% that matures on August 9, 2006. We
pay a quarterly fee on the average unused amount of the total facility equal to
0.15% of such amount. In October, 2003, all amounts outstanding on the Line of
Credit were repaid with proceeds from the Recap. As of December 31, 2003, $110
million was available under the Line of Credit. The Line of Credit had a total
facility of $150 million prior to amendment in December, 2003.

     We had a $100 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of
banks with interest only payable monthly at LIBOR plus 1.375%. In October, 2003,
we paid off the Term Loan with proceeds from the Recap.

     On October 29, 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
"2001 Swap"), effectively fixing LIBOR on $100 million of our floating rate debt
at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004.
The terms of the 2001 Swap required monthly settlements on the same dates
interest payments were due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the
2001 Swap was reflected at market value. In October, 2003, we unwound the 2001
Swap at a cost of approximately $3 million, which is included in interest and
related amortization in 2003 in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

     On April 17, 2003, we entered into an agreement to refinance and increase
the Bay Indies Mortgage from approximately $21.9 million to $45 million. Under
the new agreement, the Bay Indies Mortgage bears interest at 5.69% per annum,
amortizes over 25 years and matures April 17, 2013. The net proceeds were used
to pay down the Company's Line of Credit in April, 2003. Also during the year
ended December 31, 2003, mortgage notes payable on four other Properties were
repaid totaling approximately $23.5 million using proceeds from borrowings on
the Company's Line of Credit.

     During the year ended December 31, 2002, as part of the purchase of RSI, in
a non-cash transaction, we assumed a $12.5 million note payable ("Conseco
Financing Note"), collateralized by manufactured home inventory. The Conseco
Financing Note was repaid at a discount during 2002 using proceeds from our Line
of Credit. In addition, we repaid a maturing mortgage note in the amount of $1.1
million and $2.1 million of other unsecured notes payable using proceeds from
our Line of Credit.

     During the year ended December 31, 2001, we repaid three maturing mortgages
in the aggregate amount of $12.1 million using proceeds from our Line of Credit.
In addition, we entered into a $50.0 million mortgage note (the "Stagecoach
Mortgage") collateralized by 7 Properties beneficially owned by MHC Stagecoach,
L.L.C. The Stagecoach Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 6.98% per annum,
amortizes beginning September 1, 2001 over 10 years and matures August 31, 2011.
Proceeds from the financing were used to reduce borrowings on the Line of Credit
by $37.9 million.

     Certain of our mortgage and credit agreements contain covenants and
restrictions including restrictions as to the ratio of secured or unsecured debt
versus encumbered or unencumbered assets, the ratio of fixed charges-to-earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), limitations on
certain holdings and other restrictions.

     In addition, the Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases
at certain of the Properties expiring in various years from 2022 to 2031 with
terms which require twelve equal payments per year plus additional rents
calculated as a percentage of gross revenues. For the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, ground lease rent was approximately $1.6 million per year.
Minimum future rental payments under the ground leases are approximately $1.6
million for each of the next five years and approximately $26.3 million
thereafter.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

     Since December 31, 2003, we invested in 30 Properties as listed in the

</TABLE>

(a)  Property was purchased from O'Connell's Holding Corp. and O'Connell's, Inc.
(b)  Property was purchased from Spring Gulch, Inc.
(c)  Property was purchased from PRVR Limited Partnership.
(d)  Property was purchased from Twin Lakes Land, LLC and Twin Lakes Camping
     Resort, LLC.
(e)  Property was purchased from Don-Bar Family Limited Partnership.
(f)  The portfolio was acquired for a total purchase price of $62 million and
     $20.4 million of net equity. The transaction was funded partially through
     loans obtained on the individual properties as shown in the table.
(g)  On February 3, 2004, the Company invested approximately $29.7 million in
     preferred equity in six entities controlled by Diversified Investments,
     Inc. ("Diversified"). In addition, the Company has invested approximately
     $1.4 million in the Diversified entities managing these properties.
(h)  The Company invested approximately $1.4 million with Diversified in four
     separate entities, each controlling a Property.

     In addition, on February 17, 2004, we tendered payment of $69 million cash
to acquire a 93% equity interest in entities that own and operate 28 vacation
resort properties, containing 11,357 sites. Twenty of the properties are located
in Florida, six in Texas, and two in California. The acquisition was funded with
monies held in short-term investments and $50 million drawn from the Company's
line of credit.

     Beginning in 1996, a series of partnerships were formed between "NHC"
entities and "PAMI" entities. The PAMI entities have sued for specific
performance in Chancery Court in Delaware seeking to acquire the NHC entities'
interests. The NHC entities have filed a counter-suit, and have asked the judge
to schedule a hearing to address the matter within thirty days. Under the terms
and conditions of the partnership agreements, $69 million was paid to acquire
the PAMI entities' interests. Principals of the NHC entities will continue to
operate the properties and maintain an equity position in the new entity. The
existing dispute is related to the PAMI entities' desire to liquidate their
investments. While the possibility of additional litigation and its attendant
risks remain, we believe that providing liquidity to the NHC entities to acquire
the PAMI interests may assist in resolving the dispute.

ITEM 7a. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF MARKET RISK

     Our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates, since a portion of
our outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on LIBOR. Our Line of
Credit ($110 million outstanding at December 31, 2003) bears interest at LIBOR
plus 1.65%, per annum. If LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0% during the year
ended December 31, 2003, interest expense would have increased/decreased by
approximately $1.3 million based on the average balance outstanding under the
Company's Line of Credit during the period.

     On October 29, 2001, we entered into the 2001 Swap, effectively fixing the
LIBOR rate on $100 million of our floating rate debt at approximately 3.7% per
annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004. The terms of the 2001
Swap required monthly settlements on the same dates interest payments were due
on the debt. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we unwound the 2001 Swap for a cost
of approximately $3 million. Effective January 1, 2001, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS No. 133") and its amendments, SFAS
No. 137 and SFAS No. 138. In accordance with SFAS No. 133, the interest rate
swap was reflected at market value. We believed the 2001 Swap was a perfectly
effective cash flow hedge, under SFAS No. 133, and there would be no effect on
net income as a result of the mark-to-market adjustment. Mark-to-market changes
in the value of the 2001 Swap prior to its payoff were included in other
comprehensive income.

                         Report of Independent Auditors



To the Board of Directors of
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc.


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, other comprehensive income,
changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003. We have also audited the related financial
statement schedules listed in the index at Item 15(a). These financial
statements and schedules are the responsibility of the management of
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements and schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally
accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Manufactured
Home Communities, Inc. at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related
financial statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all
material respects the information set forth therein.

     As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2003
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. changed its method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation. In addition, in 2002 Manufactured Home
Communities, Inc. changed its method of accounting for discontinued operations.

("Subsidiaries"), are referred to herein as the "Company", "MHC", "we", "us",
and "our". We believe that we have qualified for taxation as a real estate
investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year
ended December 31, 1993. We plan to continue to meet the requirements for
taxation as a REIT. Many of these requirements, however, are highly technical
and complex. We cannot, therefore, guarantee that we have qualified or will
qualify in the future as a REIT. The determination that we are a REIT requires
an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our
control and we cannot provide any assurance that the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") will agree with our analysis. For example, to qualify as a REIT, at
least 95% of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized in the
REIT tax laws. We are also required to distribute to stockholders at least 90%
of our REIT taxable income excluding capital gains. The fact that we hold our
assets through MHC Operating Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries further
complicates the application of the REIT requirements. Even a technical or
inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our REIT status. Furthermore, Congress and
the IRS might make changes to the tax laws and regulations, and the courts might
issue new rulings that make it more difficult, or impossible, for us to remain
qualified as a REIT. We do not believe, however, that any pending or proposed
tax law changes would jeopardize our REIT status.

     If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we would be subject to federal income tax
at regular corporate rates. Also, unless the IRS granted us relief under certain
statutory provisions, we would remain disqualified as a REIT for four years
following the year we first failed to qualify. Even if the Company qualifies for
taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and local taxes on
its income and property and Federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed
income.

     We are a fully integrated company that owns and operates manufactured home
communities ("Communities") and park model communities ("Resorts"). The Company
was formed to continue the property operations, business objectives and
acquisition strategies of an entity that had owned and operated Communities
since 1969. As of December 31, 2003, we owned or had an ownership interest in a
portfolio of 142 Communities and Resorts (the "Properties") located throughout
the United States containing 51,715 residential sites.

     The operations of the Company are conducted primarily through the Operating
Partnership. The Company contributed the proceeds from its initial public
offering to the Operating Partnership for a general partnership interest. The
financial results of the Operating Partnership and the Subsidiaries are
consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial statements. In addition,
since certain activities, if performed by the Company, may not have been
qualifying REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), the Company has formed certain taxable REIT subsidiaries, as
defined in the Code, to engage in such activities. Realty Systems, Inc. ("RSI")
is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that, doing business as Carefree
Sales, is engaged in the business of purchasing, selling and leasing
manufactured homes that are located or will be located in Properties owned and
managed by the Company. Carefree Sales also provides brokerage services to
residents at such Properties. Typically, residents move from a Community but do
not relocate their homes. Carefree Sales may provide brokerage services, in
competition with other local brokers, by seeking buyers for the homes. Carefree
Sales also leases homes to prospective residents with the expectation that the
tenant eventually will purchase the home. Subsidiaries of RSI lease from the
Operating Partnership certain real property within or adjacent to certain of the
Properties consisting of golf courses, pro shops, stores and restaurants.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION (CONTINUED)

     The limited partners of the Operating Partnership (the "Common OP
Unitholders") receive an allocation of net income which is based on their
respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership which is shown on
the Consolidated Financial Statements as Minority Interests - Common OP Units.
As of December 31, 2003, the Minority Interests - Common OP Units represented
5,312,387 units of limited partnership interest ("OP Units") which are
convertible into an equivalent number of shares of the Company's common stock.
The issuance of additional shares of common stock or common OP Units changes the
respective ownership of the Operating Partnership for both the Minority
Interests and the Company.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     (a)  Basis of Consolidation

          The Company consolidates its majority owned subsidiaries in which it
     has the ability to control the operations of the subsidiaries. The Company
     does not consolidate entities with respect to which it does not have sole
     control over the major decisions. All inter-company transactions have been
     eliminated in consolidation. The Company's acquisitions were all accounted
     for as purchases in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
     16 "Business Combinations" for those transactions initiated before June 30,
     2001 and in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
     141 ("SFAS No. 141") "Business Combinations" for those transactions
     completed after June 30, 2001.

          In accordance with SFAS 141, the Company allocates the purchase price
     of real estate to land, land improvements, building and, if determined to
     be material, intangibles, such as the value of above, below and at-market
     leases and origination costs associated with the in-place leases. We
     depreciate the amount allocated to land improvements, building and other
     intangible assets over their estimated useful lives, which generally range
     from three to thirty years. The values of the above and below market leases
     are amortized and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below
     market leases) or a decrease (in the case of above market leases) to rental
     income over the remaining term of the associated lease. The value
     associated with in-place leases is amortized over the expected term, which
     includes an estimated probability of lease renewal.

          In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
     issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities
     ("FIN 46"). The objective of this Interpretation is to provide guidance on
     how to identify a variable interest entity ("VIE") and determine when the
     assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests, and results of operations
     of a VIE need to be included in the company's consolidated financial
     statements. A company that holds variable interests in an entity will need
     to consolidate such entity if the company absorbs a majority of the VIE's
     expected losses or receives a majority of the entity's expected residual
     returns if they occur, or both.

          The provisions of FIN 46 apply to the Company upon initial involvement
     with the respective entity for transactions created after January 31, 2003.
     The adoption of FIN 46 in 2003 had no effect on the Company in 2003. The
     provisions of FIN 46 and related revised interpretations apply no later
     than the end of the first interim reporting period ending March 15, 2004
     (March 31, 2004) for entities created before February 1, 2003. The Company
     is currently evaluating and assessing the impact of FIN 46 and the related
     revised interpretations on entities created before February 1, 2003.

     (b)  Use of Estimates

          The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
     principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to
     make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
     and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
     date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
     expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
     those estimates.

     (c)  Segments

          We manage all our operations on a property by property basis. Since
     each property has similar economic and operational characteristics, the
     Company has one reportable segment, which is the operation of manufactured
     home communities. The following table identifies our five largest markets
     and provides information regarding our Communities and Resorts including
     Communities owned in joint ventures.

</TABLE>

          Our largest Property, Bay Indies, located in Venice, Florida,
     accounted for approximately 3.0% of our total property operating revenues
     for the year ended December 31, 2003. The operation of manufactured home
     communities segment comprised approximately 97%, 97.8% and 97.2% of total
     property operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
     2001, respectively. The operation of manufactured home communities segment
     comprised approximately 93.5% and 92.2% of total assets at December 31,
     2003 and 2002, respectively. The distribution of the Properties throughout
     the United States reflects our belief that geographic diversification helps
     insulate the portfolio from regional economic influences. We intend to
     target new acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located
     and will also consider acquisitions of properties outside such markets.

     (d)  Inventory

          Inventory consists of new and used manufactured homes, is stated at
     the lower of cost or market after consideration of the N.A.D.A. (National
     Automobile Dealers Association) Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide and
     the current market value of each home included in the manufactured home
     inventory. Inventory sales revenues and resale revenues are recognized when
     the home sale is closed. Resale revenues are stated net of commissions paid
     to employees of $893,000 for the year ended December 31, 2003.

     (e)  Real Estate

          Real estate is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation.
     Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated
     useful lives of the assets. We use a 30-year estimated life for buildings
     acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen-year
     estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven-year estimated
     life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for ordinary
     maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and
     significant renovations and improvements that improve the asset and extend
     the useful life of the asset are capitalized and then expensed over their
     estimated useful life.

          In addition, the FASB is currently reviewing the methods of
     depreciation and cost capitalization for all industries and in June 2001
     issued FASB Exposure Draft, "Accounting in Interim and Annual Financial
     Statements for Certain Costs and Activities Related to Property, Plant and
     Equipment", the implementation of which, if issued, could also have a
     material effect on the Company's results of operations. Total depreciation
     expense was $39.4 million, $37.3 million and $36.0 million for the years
     ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (e)  Real Estate (continued)

          We evaluate our Properties for impairment when conditions exist which
     may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash flows
     (undiscounted) from a Property over the anticipated holding period is less
     than its carrying value. Upon determination that a permanent impairment has
     occurred, the applicable Property is reduced to fair value. For the year
     ended December 31, 2003, permanent impairment conditions did not exist at
     any of our Properties. For properties to be disposed of, an impairment loss
     is recognized when the fair value of the property, less the estimated cost
     to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the property measured at the
     time the Company has a commitment to sell the property and/or is actively
     marketing the property for sale. A property to be disposed of is reported
     at the lower of its carrying amount or its estimated fair value, less costs
     to sell. Subsequent to the date that a property is held for disposition,
     depreciation expense is not recorded. In August 2001, the FASB issued
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144 ("SFAS No. 144"),
     "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets" which is
     effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The Company
     adopted SFAS No. 144 during 2002 and we have shown separately as
     discontinued operations in all periods presented the results of operations
     for all assets sold during 2003 and 2002 or assets classified as real
     estate held for disposition as of December 31, 2003 and 2002. The gain on
     sale of discontinued operations for 2003 and 2002 is included in the gain
     on sale of properties and other.

          Certain costs, primarily legal costs, relative to our efforts to
     effectively change the use and operations of several Properties subject to
     rent control (see Note 17) are currently classified in other assets. These
     costs, to the extent these efforts are successful, are capitalized to the
     extent of the established value of the revised project and included in the
     net investment in real estate for the appropriate Properties (see Note 5).
     To the extent these efforts are not successful, these costs will be
     expensed. In addition, we capitalize certain costs, primarily legal costs,
     related to entering into lease agreements which govern the terms under
     which we may enter into leases with individual tenants and which are
     expensed over the term of the lease agreement.

     (f)  Cash and Cash Equivalents

          We consider all demand and money market accounts and certificates of
     deposit with a maturity, when purchased, of three months or less to be cash
     equivalents.

     (g)  Notes Receivable

          Notes receivable generally are stated at their outstanding unpaid
     principal balances net of any deferred fees or costs on originated loans,
     or unamortized discounts or premiums net of a valuation allowance. Interest
     income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Discounts or premiums
     are amortized to income using the interest method. In certain cases we
     finance the sale of homes to our residents (referred to as "Chattel Loans")
     which loans are secured by the homes. The valuation allowance for the
     Chattel Loans is calculated based a comparison of the outstanding principal
     balance of each note compared to the N.A.D.A. value and the current market
     value of the underlying manufactured home collateral.

     (h)  Investments in Joint Ventures

          Investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for using
     the equity method of accounting because we do not have control over the
     activities of the investees. Our net equity investment is reflected on the
     consolidated balance sheets, and the consolidated statements of operations
     include our share of net income or loss from the unconsolidated joint
     ventures. Any difference between the carrying amount of these investments
     on our consolidated balance sheet and the historical cost of the underlying
     equity is depreciated as an adjustment to income from unconsolidated joint
     ventures generally over 30 years.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (i)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments

          The Company's financial instruments include short-term investments,
     notes receivable, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other accrued
     expenses, mortgage notes payable and interest rate hedge arrangements. The
     fair values of all financial instruments, including notes receivable, were
     not materially different from their carrying values at December 31, 2003
     and 2002.

     (j)  Deferred Financing Costs

          Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain
     long-term financing. The costs are being amortized over the terms of the
     respective loans on a level yield basis. Unamortized deferred financing
     fees are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date. Upon
     amendment of the Line of Credit, unamortized deferred financing fees are
     accounted for in accordance with EITF No. 98-14, "Debtor's Accounting for
     Changes in Line-of-Credit or Revolving-Debt Arrangements." Accumulated
     amortization for such costs was $2.7 million and $2.4 million at December
     31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     (k)  Revenue Recognition

          Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when earned from
     tenants. We will reserve for receivables when we believe the ultimate
     collection is less than probable. Our provision for uncollectable rents
     receivable was $827,000 as of December 31, 2003 and $700,000 as of December
     31, 2002. Income from home sales is recognized when the earnings process is
     complete. The earnings process is complete when the home has been
     delivered, the purchaser has accepted the home and title has transferred.

     (l)  Minority Interests

          Net income is allocated to Common OP Unitholders based on their
     respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. An ownership
     percentage is represented by dividing the number of Common OP Units held by
     the Common OP Unitholders (5,312,387 and 5,359,927 at December 31, 2003 and
     2002, respectively) by OP Units and shares of Common Stock outstanding.
     Issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or Common OP Units changes
     the percentage ownership of both the Minority Interests and the Company.
     Due in part to the exchange rights (which provide for the conversion of
     Common OP Units into shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis), such
     transactions and the proceeds therefrom are treated as capital transactions
     and result in an allocation between stockholders' equity and Minority
     Interests to account for the change in the respective percentage ownership
     of the underlying equity of the Operating Partnership.

          On September 30, 1999, the Operating Partnership completed a $125
     million private placement of 9.0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Preferred
     Units ("POP Units") with two institutional investors. The POP Units, which
     are callable by the Company after five years, have no stated maturity or
     mandatory redemption, have no voting rights and are not convertible into OP
     Units or Common Stock. Income is allocated to the POP Units at a preferred
     rate per annum of 9.0% on the original capital contribution of $125
     million. Costs related to the placement of $3.1 million were recorded as a
     reduction to additional paid-in capital.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (m)  Income Taxes

          Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT, the results of
     operations contain no provision for Federal income taxes. However, the
     Company may be subject to certain state and local income, excise or
     franchise taxes. We paid state and local taxes of approximately $56,000,
     $20,000 and $50,000 during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
     2001, respectively. In addition, taxable income from non-REIT activities
     managed through taxable REIT subsidiaries is subject to federal, state and
     local income taxes. As of December 31, 2003, net investment in real estate
     and notes receivable had a Federal tax basis of approximately $743.3
     million and $27.6 million, respectively.

     (n)  Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

          We recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
     Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through
     income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge,
     changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the
     change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments
     through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the
     hedged item is recognized in earnings.

     (o)  Reclassifications

          Certain 2002 and 2001 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
     2003 financial presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on the
     operations or equity as originally presented.

     (p)  Stock Compensation

          Prior to January 1, 2003, we accounted for our stock compensation in
     accordance with APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees",
     based upon the intrinsic value method. This method results in no
     compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to or
     exceeding the market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant.
     Effective January 1, 2003, we elected to account for our stock compensation
     in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment (SFAS No. 148),
     "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", which resulted in compensation
     expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock options and
     other equity awards issued (see Note 14).

NOTE 3 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

     Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of
common shares outstanding during each year. Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128") defines the calculation
of basic and fully diluted earnings per share. Basic and fully diluted earnings
per share are based on the weighted average shares outstanding during each year
and basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants
and convertible securities. The conversion of OP Units has been excluded from
the basic earnings per share calculation. The conversion of an OP Unit to a
share of Common Stock has no material effect on earnings per common share.

     On December 12, 2003, we declared a one-time special distribution of $8.00
per share payable to stockholders of record on January 8, 2004. We used proceeds
from the $501 million borrowing in October, 2003 to pay the special distribution
on January 16, 2004. The special cash dividend will be reflected on
stockholders' 2004 1099-DIV to be issued in January 2005.

     The Company adopted, effective July 1, 1997, the 1997 Non-Qualified
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). Pursuant to the ESPP, certain employees
and directors of the Company may each annually acquire up to $250,000 of Common
Stock of the Company. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock available
under the ESPP shall not exceed 1,000,000, subject to adjustment by the
Company's Board of Directors. The Common Stock may be purchased monthly at a
price equal to 85% of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share of Common
Stock on the last day of the offering period; and (b) the closing price for a
share of Common Stock on the first day of the offering period. Shares of Common
Stock issued through the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001 were 82,943, 71,107 and 96,485, respectively.

     Land improvements consist primarily of improvements such as grading,
landscaping and infrastructure items such as streets, sidewalks or water mains.
Depreciable property consists of permanent buildings in the Properties such as
clubhouses, laundry facilities, maintenance storage facilities, and furniture,
fixtures and equipment.

     During the year ended December 31, 2001, we acquired two Florida
Properties, totaling 730 sites, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately
$17.3 million and completed the sale of seven Properties, totaling 1,281 sites,
in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma, for a total sale price of approximately $17.4
million. A gain of $8.1 million was recorded on the sale. In addition, we
terminated a lease to a third-party operator for the campground and RV resort
facilities at the Property known as Bulow Plantation in Flagler Beach, Florida,
and assumed operation of these facilities directly. Also during 2001, we
finalized a settlement agreement whereby we received $10.8 million in proceeds
related to the sale of a Property in Indiana.

     During the year ended December 31, 2002, we acquired the eleven Properties
listed in the table below. The acquisitions were funded with borrowings on our
Line of Credit and the assumption of $47.9 million of mortgage debt, which
includes a $3.0 million discount mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we
purchased adjacent land and land improvements for several Properties for
approximately $559,000.

     In December, 2003, we acquired three Resort Properties listed in the table

The acquisitions included the assumption of liabilities of approximately

</TABLE>

     All acquisitions have been accounted for utilizing the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired assets are
included in the statements of operations from the dates of acquisition. We
acquired all of these Properties from unaffiliated third parties.

     During the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, we capitalized
approximately $1.5 million and $5.7 million of costs, respectively, primarily
legal costs, relative to our efforts to effectively change the use and
operations of several Properties which are currently recorded in other assets.
These costs will be expensed if management determines these efforts will not be
successful. Due to the successful settlement of litigation related to one
Property, DeAnza Santa Cruz, we reclassified approximately $5.3 million of these
costs to land improvements and will depreciate these costs over 30 years (see
Note 17).

     We actively seek to acquire additional Properties and currently are engaged
in negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of a number of Properties.

NOTE 6 - INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURES

     The Company recorded approximately $2.1 million, $1.3 million, and $971,000
of net income from joint ventures in the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively; and received approximately $1.5 million and $607,000 in
distributions from joint ventures in the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. Due to the Company's inability to control the joint ventures, the
Company accounts for its investment in the joint ventures using the equity
method of accounting.

     The following is a summary of the Company's investments in unconsolidated

NOTE 6 - INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE (CONTINUED)

     Effective September 1, 2002, the Company restructured its investment in
Wolverine Property Investment Limited Partnership (the "College Heights Joint
Venture" or the "Venture"), a joint venture with Wolverine Investors, LLP. The
Venture included 18 Properties with 3,581 sites. The results of operations of
the College Heights Joint Venture prior to restructuring were included with the
results of the Company due to the Company's voting equity interest and control
over the Venture. Pursuant to the restructuring, the Company sold its general
partnership interest, sold all of the Company's voting equity interest and
reduced the Company's total investment in the College Heights Joint Venture. As
consideration for the sale, the Company retained sole ownership of Down Yonder,
a 361 site Community in Clearwater, Florida, received cash of approximately $5.2
million and retained preferred limited partnership interests of approximately
$10.3 million, recorded net of a $2.4 million reserve. The continuing preferred
limited partnership interests will be accounted for using the equity method and
reported as an investment in a joint venture.

NOTE 7 - ACQUISITION OF REALTY SYSTEMS, INC.

     On January 1, 2002, the Company purchased all of the common stock of Realty
Systems, Inc. ("RSI"). The Company previously owned the non-voting preferred
stock of RSI and had notes receivable from RSI which were recorded as an
investment in affiliate. The Company purchased the common stock of RSI from
Equity Group Investments, Inc., controlled by Samuel Zell, Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Company, for approximately $675,000. As a result of this
acquisition, the Company owns and controls RSI and consolidates the financial
results of RSI with those of the Company. Prior to the purchase of the common
stock of RSI, we accounted for our investment in RSI using the equity method and
classified the investment as investment in and advances to affiliates.

NOTE 8 - NOTES RECEIVABLE

     At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had approximately $11.6 million
and $10.0 million in notes receivable, respectively. On December 28, 2000, the
Company, in connection with the Voyager Joint Venture, entered into an agreement
to loan $3.0 million to certain principals of Meadows Management Company. The
notes are collateralized with a combination of Common OP Units and partnership
interests in this and other joint ventures. The notes bear interest at prime
plus 0.5% per annum, require quarterly interest only payments and mature on
December 31, 2011. The outstanding balance on these notes as of December 31,

     The Company has approximately $9.9 million in Chattel Loans receivable,
which yield interest at a per annum average rate of approximately 9.9%, have an
average term and amortization of 5 to 15 years, require monthly principal and
interest payments and are collateralized by manufactured homes at certain of the
Properties.

NOTE 9 - EMPLOYEE NOTES RECEIVABLE

     As of December 31, 2002, the Company had employee notes receivable of
approximately $2.7 million which were repaid in 2003. These notes were
collateralized by shares of the Company's Common Stock and are presented as a
reduction of Stockholders' Equity.

NOTE 10 - LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

     As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding
mortgage indebtedness of approximately $1,076 million and $575.4 million,
respectively, encumbering 114 and 66 of the Company's Properties, respectively.
As of December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, the carrying value of such
Properties was approximately $1,124 million and $720 million, respectively.

     The outstanding mortgage indebtedness as of December 31, 2003 consists of:

- -    Approximately $501.4 million of mortgage debt ("Mortgage Debt") consisting
     of 49 loans collateralized by 51 Properties, beneficially owned by separate
     legal entities that are subsidiaries of the Company, which we closed on
     October 17, 2003 (the "Recap"). Of this Mortgage Debt, $177.9 million bears
     interest at 5.35% per annum and matures November 1, 2008; $71.1 million
     bears interest at 5.72% per annum and matures November 1, 2010; $79.1
     million bears interest at 6.02% per annum and matures November 1, 2013; and
     $173.3 million bears interest at 6.33% per annum and matures November 1,
     2015. The Mortgage Debt amortizes over 30 years.

- -    A $265.0 million mortgage note (the "$265 Million Mortgage") collateralized
     by 28 Properties beneficially owned by MHC Financing Limited Partnership.
     The $265 Million Mortgage has a maturity date of January 2, 2028 and bears
     interest at 7.015% per annum. There is no principal amortization until
     February 1, 2008, after which principal and interest are to be paid from
     available cash flow and the interest rate will be reset at a rate equal to
     the then 10-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.0%. The $265 Million
     Mortgage is presented net of a settled hedge of $3.0 million (net of
     accumulated amortization of $357,000) which is being amortized into
     interest expense over the life of the loan.

- -    A $91.4 million mortgage note (the "DeAnza Mortgage") collateralized by 6
     Properties beneficially owned by MHC-DeAnza Financing Limited Partnership.
     The DeAnza Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 7.82% per annum, amortizes
     beginning August 1, 2000 over 30 years and matures July 1, 2010.

- -    A $48.9 million mortgage note (the "Stagecoach Mortgage") collateralized by
     7 Properties beneficially owed by MHC Stagecoach L.L.C. The Stagecoach
     Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 6.98% per annum, amortizes beginning
     September 1, 2001 over 10 years and matures September 1, 2011.

- -    A $44.5 million mortgage note (the "Bay Indies Mortgage") collateralized by
     one Property beneficially owned by MHC Bay Indies, L.L.C. On April 17,
     2003, we entered into an agreement to refinance and increase the Bay Indies
     Mortgage from approximately $21.9 million to $45 million. Under the new
     agreement, the Bay Indies Mortgage bears interest at 5.69% per annum,
     amortizes over 25 years and matures April 17, 2013.

NOTE 10 - LONG-TERM BORROWINGS (CONTINUED)

     -    A $15.3 million mortgage note (the "Date Palm Mortgage")
          collateralized by one Property beneficially owned by MHC Date Palm,
          L.L.C. The Date Palm Mortgage bears interest at a rate of 7.96% per
          annum, amortizes beginning August 1, 2000 over 30 years and matures
          July 1, 2010.

     -    Approximately $112.2 million of mortgage debt on 20 other various
          Properties, which was recorded at fair market value with the related
          discount or premium being amortized over the life of the loan using
          the effective interest rate. Scheduled maturities for the outstanding
          indebtedness are at various dates through November 30, 2020, and fixed
          interest rates range from 6.5% to 9.3% per annum. Included in this
          debt, the Company has a $2.4 million loan recorded to account for a
          direct financing lease entered into in May 1997. In addition, $4.6
          million of this debt was assumed in the acquisition of three
          Properties in December, 2003 (see Note 5).

     We have an unsecured Line of Credit with a group of banks (the "Line of
Credit") with a total facility of $110 million, bearing interest at the London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.65% that matures on August 9, 2006. We
pay a quarterly fee on the average unused amount of the total facility equal to
0.15% of such amount. In October, 2003, all amounts outstanding on the Line of
Credit were repaid with proceeds from the Recap. As of December 31, 2003, $110
million was available under the Credit Agreement. The Line of Credit had a total
facility of $150 million prior to amendment in December, 2003.

     We had a $100 million unsecured term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of
banks with interest only payable monthly at LIBOR plus 1.375%. In October, 2003,
we paid off the Term Loan with proceeds from the Recap.

     On October 29, 2001, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
"2001 Swap"), effectively fixing LIBOR on $100 million of our floating rate debt
at approximately 3.7% per annum for the period October 2001 through August 2004.
The terms of the 2001 Swap required monthly settlements on the same dates
interest payments were due on the debt. In accordance with SFAS No. 133 as
herein defined, the 2001 Swap was reflected at market value. In November, 2003,
we unwound the 2001 Swap at a cost of approximately $3 million, which is
included in interest and related amortization in 2003 in the accompanying
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

next five years and thereafter are as follows (amounts in thousands):

NOTE 11 - LEASE AGREEMENTS

     The leases entered into between the tenant and the Company for the rental
of a site are generally month-to-month or for a period of one to ten years,
renewable upon the consent of the parties or, in some instances, as provided by
statute. Non-cancelable long-term leases are in effect at certain sites within
approximately 25 of the Properties. Rental rate increases at these Properties
are primarily a function of increases in the Consumer Price Index, taking into
consideration certain floors and ceilings. Additionally, periodic market rate
adjustments are made as deemed necessary. Future minimum rents are scheduled to
be received under non-cancelable tenant leases at December 31, 2003 as follows

NOTE 12 - GROUND LEASES

     The Company leases land under non-cancelable operating leases at certain of
the Properties expiring in various years from 2022 to 2031 with terms which
require twelve equal payments per year plus additional rents calculated as a
percentage of gross revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001, ground lease rent was approximately $1.6 million per year. Minimum future
rental payments under the ground leases are approximately $1.6 million for each
of the next five years and approximately $26.3 million thereafter.

NOTE 13 - TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

     Equity Group Investments, Inc. ("EGI"), an entity controlled by Mr. Samuel
Zell, Chairman of the Company's Board of Directors, and certain of its
affiliates have provided services such as administrative support and investor
relations. Fees paid to EGI and its affiliates amounted to approximately $300,
$1,000 and $2,000 for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively. There were no significant amounts due to these affiliates as of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

     Certain related entities, affiliated with Mr. Zell, have provided services
to the Company. These entities include, but are not limited to, The Riverside

Plaza Joint Venture Limited Partnership from which the Company leases office
space. Fees paid to these entities amounted to approximately $404,000, $645,000

$25,000 to J. Green & Co., L.L.C. for services provided by Mr. Berman, the
Company's current Chief Financial Officer, prior to his employment by the
Company.

     Related party agreements or fee arrangements are generally for a term of

Directors.

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN AND STOCK GRANTS

     The Company's Stock Option and Stock Award Plan (the "Plan") was adopted in
December 1992 and amended and restated from time to time, most recently
effective March 23, 2001. Pursuant to the Plan, officers, directors, employees
and consultants of the Company are offered the opportunity (i) to acquire shares
of Common Stock through the grant of stock options ("Options"), including
non-qualified stock options and, for key employees, incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code; and (ii) to be
awarded shares of Common Stock ("Restricted Stock Grants"), subject to
conditions and restrictions determined by the Compensation, Nominating, and
Corporate Governance Committee of the Board (the "Compensation Committee"). The
Compensation Committee will determine the vesting schedule, if any, of each
Option and the term, which term shall not exceed ten years from the date of
grant. As to the Options that have been granted through December 31, 2003 to
officers, employees and consultants, generally, one-third are exercisable one
year after

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN AND STOCK GRANTS (CONTINUED)

the initial grant, one-third are exercisable two years following the date such
Options were granted and the remaining one-third are exercisable three years
following the date such Options were granted. A maximum of 6,000,000 shares of
Common Stock are available for grant under the Plan and no more than 250,000
shares may be subject to grants to any one individual in any calendar year.

     Grants under the Plan are made by the Compensation Committee, which
determines the individuals eligible to receive awards, the types of awards, and
the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to any award. In addition, the
terms of two specific types of awards are contemplated under the Plan:

     -    The first type of award is a grant of Options or Restricted Stock
          Grants of Common Stock made to each member of the Board at the meeting
          held immediately after each annual meeting of the Company's
          stockholders. Generally, if the director elects to receive Options,
          the grant will cover 10,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
          price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant. If the
          director elects to receive a Restricted Stock Grant of Common Stock,
          he or she will receive an award of 2,000 shares. Exercisability or
          vesting with respect to either type of award will be with respect to
          one-third of the award after six months, two-thirds of the award after
          one year, and the full award after two years.

     -    The second type of award is a grant of Common Stock in lieu of 50% of
          their bonus otherwise payable to individuals with a title of Vice
          President or above. A recipient can request that the Compensation
          Committee pay a greater or lesser portion of the bonus in shares of
          Common Stock.

     Prior to 2003, we accounted for our stock compensation in accordance with
APB No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees", based upon the intrinsic
value method. This method results in no compensation expense for Options issued
with an exercise price equal to or exceeding the market value of the Common
Stock on the date of grant. Effective January 1, 2003, we elected to account for
our stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS No. 123 and its amendment
(SFAS No. 148), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation", which will result in
compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the Options and
other equity awards issued. SFAS No. 148 provides three possible transition
methods for changing to the fair value method. We have elected to use the
modified-prospective method. This method requires that we recognize stock-based
employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the
recognition provisions are first applied as if the fair value method had been
used to account for all employee awards granted, or settled in fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994. The following table illustrates the effect on
net income and earnings per share as if the fair value method was applied to all
outstanding and unvested awards in each period presented (amounts in thousands,
except per share data):

NOTE 15 - PREFERRED STOCK

     The Company's Board of Directors is authorized under the Company's charter,
without further stockholder approval, to issue, from time to time, in one or
more series, 10,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock (the "Preferred
Stock"), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board may
determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to
the rights of holders of the Company's Common Stock. However, under certain
circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock may require stockholder approval
pursuant to the rules and regulations of The New York Stock Exchange. As of
December 31, 2003 and 2002, no Preferred Stock was issued by the Company.

NOTE 16 - SAVINGS PLAN

     The Company has a qualified retirement plan, with a salary deferral feature
designed to qualify under Section 401 of the Code (the "401(k) Plan"), to cover
its employees and those of its Subsidiaries, if any. The 401(k) Plan permits
eligible employees of the Company and those of any Subsidiary to defer up to 19%
of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis subject to certain maximum
amounts. In addition, the Company will match dollar-for-dollar the participant's
contribution up to 4% of the participant's eligible compensation.

     In addition, amounts contributed by the Company will vest, on a prorated
basis, according to the participant's vesting schedule. After five years of
employment with the Company, the participants will be 100% vested for all
amounts contributed by the Company. Additionally, a discretionary profit sharing
component of the 401(k) Plan provides for a contribution to be made annually for
each participant in an amount, if any, as determined by the Company. All
employee contributions are 100% vested. The Company's contribution to the 401(k)
Plan was approximately $240,000, $248,000, and $353,000, for the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

     The Company has established a supplemental executive retirement plan (the
"SERP") to provide certain officers and directors an opportunity to defer a
portion of their eligible compensation in order to save for retirement and for
the education of their children. The SERP is restricted to investments in
Company common shares, certain marketable securities that have been specifically
approved, or cash equivalents. In accordance with EITF 97-14 "Accounting for
Deferred Compensation Arrangements Where Amounts Earned Are Held in a Rabbi
Trust and Invested", the deferred compensation liability represented in the SERP
and the securities issued to fund such deferred compensation liability are
consolidated by the Company on the balance sheet. Assets held in the SERP are
included in other assets and are classified as trading securities and reported
at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings. Company
shares held in the SERP are classified in stockholders equity due to the
inability of the Company to repurchase these shares.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

DEANZA SANTA CRUZ

     The residents of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a Property located in
Santa Cruz, California, brought several actions opposing fees and charges in
connection with water service at the Property. As a result of one action, the
Company rebated approximately $36,000 to the residents. The DeAnza Santa Cruz
Homeowners Association ("HOA") then proceeded to a jury trial alleging these
"overcharges" entitled them to an award of punitive damages. In January 1999, a
jury awarded the HOA $6.0 million in punitive damages. On December 21, 2001 the
California Court of Appeal for the Sixth District reversed the $6.0 million
punitive damage award, the related award of attorneys' fees, and, as a result,
all post-judgment interest thereon, on the basis that punitive damages are not
available as a remedy for a statutory violation of the California Mobilehome
Residency Law ("MRL"). The decision of the appellate court left the HOA, the
plaintiff in this matter, with the right to seek a new trial in which it must
prove its entitlement to either the statutory penalty and attorneys' fees
available under the MRL or punitive damages based on causes of action for fraud,
misrepresentation or other tort. In order to resolve this matter, the Company
accrued for and agreed to pay $201,000 to the HOA. This payment resolved the
punitive damage claim. The HOA's attorney has made a motion asking for an award
of attorneys' fees and costs in the amount of approximately $1.5 million as a
result of this resolution of the litigation. On April 2, 2003 the court awarded
attorney's fees to the HOA's attorney in the amount of $593,000 and court costs
of approximately $20,000. The Company has appealed this award and has not
accrued for the amount in its consolidated financial statements.

OTHER CALIFORNIA RENT CONTROL LITIGATION

     As part of the Company's effort to realize the value of its Properties
subject to rent control, the Company has initiated lawsuits against several
municipalities in California. The Company's goal is to achieve a level of
regulatory fairness in California's rent control jurisdictions, and in
particular those jurisdictions that prohibit increasing rents to market upon
turnover. This regulatory feature, called vacancy control, allows tenants to
sell their homes for a premium representing the value of the future discounted
rent-controlled rents. In the Company's view, such regulation results in a
transfer of the value of the Company's shareholders' land, which would otherwise
be reflected in market rents, to tenants upon the sales of their homes in the
form of an inflated purchase price that cannot be attributed to the value of the
home being sold. As a result, in the Company's view, the Company loses the value
of its asset and the selling tenant leaves the Community with a windfall
premium. The Company has discovered through the litigation process that certain
municipalities considered condemning the Company's Communities at values well
below the value of the underlying land. In the Company's view, a failure to
articulate market rents for sites governed by restrictive rent control would put
the Company at risk for condemnation or eminent domain proceedings based on
artificially reduced rents. Such a physical taking, should it occur, could
represent substantial lost value to shareholders. The Company is cognizant of
the need for affordable housing in the jurisdictions, but asserts that
restrictive rent regulation with vacancy control does not promote this purpose
because the benefits of such regulation are fully capitalized into the prices of
the homes sold. The Company estimates that the annual rent subsidy to tenants in
these jurisdictions is approximately $15 million. In a more well-balanced
regulatory environment, the Company would receive market rents that would
eliminate the subsidy and homes would trade at or near their intrinsic value.

     In connection with such efforts, the Company recently announced it has
entered into a settlement agreement with the City of Santa Cruz, California and
that, pursuant to the settlement agreement, the City amended its rent control
ordinance to exempt the Company's property from rent control as long as the
Company offers a long term lease which gives the Company the ability to increase
rents to market upon turnover and bases annual rent increases on the Consumer
Price Index ("CPI"). The settlement agreement benefits the Company's
shareholders by allowing them to receive the value of their investment in this
Community through vacancy decontrol while preserving annual CPI based rent
increases in this age restricted Property.

     The Company's efforts to achieve a balanced regulatory environment
incentivize tenant groups to file lawsuits against the Company seeking large
damage awards. The homeowners association at Contempo Marin ("CMHOA"), a 396
site Property in San Rafael, California, sued the Company in December 2000 over
a prior settlement agreement on a capital pass-through after the Company sued
the City of San Rafael in October 2000 alleging its rent control ordinance is
unconstitutional. In the Contempo Marin case, the CMHOA prevailed on a motion
for summary judgment on an issue that permits the Company to collect only $3.72
out of a monthly pass-through amount of $7.50 that the Company believes had been
agreed to by the CMHOA in a settlement agreement. The Company intends to
vigorously defend this matter, which has been stayed pending a related state
court appeal by the Company of an order dismissing its claims against the City
of San Rafael. The Company believes that such lawsuits will be a consequence of
the Company's efforts to change rent control since tenant groups actively desire
to preserve the premium value of their homes in addition to the discounted rents
provided by rent control. The Company has determined that its efforts to
rebalance the regulatory environment despite the risk of litigation from tenant
groups are necessary not only because of the $15 million annual subsidy to
tenants, but also because of the condemnation risk.

ELLENBURG COMMUNITIES

     The Company and certain other parties entered into a settlement agreement
(the "Settlement"), which was approved by the Los Angeles County Superior Court
in April 2000. The Settlement resolved substantially all of the litigation and
appeals involving the Ellenburg Properties, and transactions arising out of the
Settlement closed on May 22, 2000. Only the appeal of one entity remained, the
outcome of which was not expected to materially affect the Company.

ELLENBURG COMMUNITIES (CONTINUED)

     In connection with the Ellenburg Acquisition, on September 8, 1999,
Ellenburg Fund 20 ("Fund 20") filed a cross complaint in the Ellenburg
dissolution proceeding against the Company and certain of its affiliates
alleging causes of action for fraud and other claims in connection with the
Ellenburg Acquisition. The Company subsequently successfully had the cross
complaint against the Company and its affiliates dismissed with prejudice by the
California Superior Court. However, Fund 20 appealed. Although this appeal was
one not resolved by the Settlement, the California Court of Appeal dismissed
Fund 20's substantive appeals on March 13, 2003 as moot. Fund 20 petitioned the
California Supreme Court to review this decision which review was denied.

     In October 2001, Fund 20 sued the Company and certain of its affiliates
again, this time in Alameda County, California making substantially the same
allegations. The Company obtained an injunction preventing the case from
proceeding until the Fund 20 appeal is decided and other related proceedings in
Arizona (from which the Company has already been dismissed with prejudice) are
concluded. The Company obtained a court order enjoining Fund 20 from proceeding
with its Alameda County action.

     In February, 2004, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with
Fund 20 resolving all remaining matters at no cost to the Company and with
mutual releases.

COUNTRYSIDE AT VERO BEACH

     The Company has received letters dated June 17, 2002 and August 26, 2002
from Indian River County ("County"), claiming that the Company currently owes
sewer impact fees in the amount of approximately $518,000 with respect to the
Property known as Countryside at Vero Beach, located in Vero Beach, Florida,
purportedly under the terms of an agreement between the County and a prior owner
of the Property. In response, the Company has advised the County that these fees
are no longer due and owing as a result of a 1996 settlement agreement between
the County and the prior owner of the Property, providing for the payment of
$150,000 to the County to discharge any further obligation for the payment of
impact or connection fees for sewer service at the Property. The Company paid
this settlement amount (with interest) to the County in connection with the
Company's acquisition of the Property. Accordingly, the Company believes that
the County's claims are without merit.

DELAWARE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION

     In April 2002, the Company entered into a Stipulation and Consent Order to
Cease and Desist (the "Consent Order") with the State of Delaware (the "State").
The Consent Order resolved various issues raised by the State concerning the
terms of a new lease form used or proposed for use by the Company at certain of
its Properties in Delaware. Among other provisions, the Consent Order
contemplated that the Company would work with the State to develop and implement
a new lease form for use in Delaware. The Consent Order expressly provided that
nothing contained therein would preclude the Company from seeking declaratory
relief from a court as to the legality or enforceability of any provisions which
the Company might wish to incorporate in future leases.

     Throughout the summer of 2002, the Company's Delaware legal counsel engaged
in dialogue with representatives of the State concerning various matters,
including the lease provisions to which the State had objected but which the
Company wished to incorporate in future leases. Through this process, it became
apparent that the parties could not reach agreement as to the legality or
enforceability of the proposed lease provisions, and that the Company would need
to seek declaratory relief from a court in order to resolve the matter, as
contemplated by the Consent Order. Accordingly, on August 29, 2002, the Company
filed a Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Other Relief (as amended, the
"Petition") in Sussex County, Delaware Superior Court (the "Court").

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

DELAWARE DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION (CONTINUED)

     In response to the filing of the Petition, on October 1, 2002, the State
filed its Answer to Petition for Declaratory and Other Relief, and Counterclaims
for Civil Enforcement and Contempt (as amended, "Answer and Counterclaim") with
the Court. In the Answer and Counterclaim, the State sought, inter alia,
restitution, statutory penalties, investigative costs and attorneys' fees under
the Delaware Mobile Home Lots and Leases Act, the Consumer Fraud Act, the
Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act and the Delaware Consumer Contracts law,
and separately sought a finding of contempt and related contempt penalties for
alleged violations of the Consent Order.

     The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss Respondents' Counterclaims with the
Court on October 29, 2002, and the State filed a Motion for Summary Judgment
with the Court on November 15, 2002. On December 30, 2002, the Company filed a
First Amended Petition for Declaratory Judgment and Other Relief with the Court,
and on January 31, 2003, the State filed an Amended Answer and Counterclaim with
the Court.

     On August 29, 2003, the Court issued its decision disposing of all pending
claims in the litigation except one. Specifically, the Court held, inter alia,
that (i) the Company may eliminate the rent cap formula from existing leases at
certain of its Delaware Properties as the leases come up for renewal, (ii)
certain lease provisions proposed by the Company may not be implemented or
enforced under applicable state law, (iii) the change in water supplier at one
of the Properties did not violate the leases at such Property, (iv) the Company
did not violate the Consent Order by filing the Petition, and (v) the Company
did not violate any state statutes as alleged by the State.

     The August 29, 2003 decision left open the issue of whether the Company had
violated the Consent Order by continuing to use the disputed lease form (but not
enforce the provisions at issue) at one of its Properties following entry of the
Consent Order (the Company believed that it had no choice but to continue to use
this lease form until the State had approved a new form for use at the Property
as contemplated by the Consent Order). On October 3, 2003, the Court issued its
final order, finding that continued use of the disputed lease form, as to new
tenants but not as to renewal tenants, following entry of the Consent Order
constituted a violation thereof, and assessing a civil penalty in the amount of
$5,000.

     On November 3, 2003, the State filed a Notice of Appeal with the Supreme
Court of the State of Delaware, appealing a portion of the Court's order denying
the State's Motion for Summary Judgment. The State's appeal is limited to the
single issue of whether the Company has the right to eliminate "rent cap"
provisions contained in certain existing leases upon automatic renewal of the
leases in accordance with Delaware law. The appeal has been fully briefed, and
oral argument in the matter is scheduled for March 16, 2004.

     On November 14, 2003, the State filed a motion for Stay Pending Appeal with
the Court, and on December 3, 2003, the Company filed its response opposing the
motion. On December 16, 2003, the Court issued its order on the motion, holding
that the Company may proceed to issue notices of default to tenants who fail to
pay the full amount of their current rental obligations, but may not initiate
eviction proceedings against such tenants until April 1, 2004, and may not
enforce any such eviction order until the Supreme Court rules on the appeal.

OTHER

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the

                  2.01     Loan Advances and Repayment.

                  (a)      Loan Availability.

                  (i)      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
         Agreement, Lenders hereby agree to make Loans (other than Swingline
         Loans) to Borrower from time to time during the period from the Closing
         Date to the first Business Day preceding the Maturity Date; provided,
         that the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding Loans
         (including Swingline Loans) plus the aggregate face amount of all
         outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed Loan Availability; and
         provided, further, that if a Base Rate Loan is being made pursuant to
         Section 2.09(e) hereof to reimburse Issuing Lender for a drawn Letter
         of Credit, to avoid a duplicative reduction in the amount of Loan
         Availability, the drawn Letter of Credit shall not be considered
         outstanding. All Loans (other than Swingline Loans) under this
         Agreement shall be made by Lenders simultaneously and proportionately
         to their respective Pro Rata Shares, it being understood that no Lender
         shall be responsible for any failure by any other Lender to perform its
         obligation to make a Loan hereunder and that the Commitment of any
         Lender shall not be increased or decreased as a result of the failure
         by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make a Loan. The Loans
         (other than Swingline Loans) will be evidenced by the Loan Notes. The
         Swingline Loans will be evidenced by the Swingline Note.

                                       24

<PAGE>

                  (ii)     Loans (including, without limitation, Swingline
         Loans) may be voluntarily prepaid pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and,
         subject to the provisions of this Agreement (including, without
         limitation, the provisions of Section 2.11 hereof), any amounts so
         prepaid may be reborrowed, up to the amount available under Section
         2.01(a)(i) at the time of such Borrowing, until the Business Day next
         preceding the Termination Date. The principal balance of the Loans
         shall be payable in full on the Termination Date. During the term of
         this Agreement and prior to the termination of the Commitments,
         Borrower shall pay to Agent, within one (1) Business Day after
         Borrower's receipt of a demand in writing from Agent for the benefit of
         Lenders, such principal amounts as are necessary so that the sum of the
         aggregate principal amounts of all outstanding Loans (including
         Swingline Loans) plus the aggregate face amount of all outstanding
         Letters of Credit at any time does not exceed Loan Availability at such
         time.

                  (b)      Notice of Borrowing. Whenever Borrower desires to
borrow under this Section 2.01, Borrower shall give Agent, at Wells Fargo Real
Estate Group Disbursement Center, 2120 East Park Place, Suite 100, El Segundo,
California 90245, with a copy to: Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 123 North Wacker
Drive, Suite 1900, Chicago, Illinois 60606, Attn: Account Officer, or such other
address as Agent shall designate, an original or facsimile Notice of Borrowing
no later than 10:00 A.M. (California time), not less than three (3) nor more
than five (5) Business Days prior to the proposed Funding Date of each Loan.
Each Notice of Borrowing shall specify (i) the Funding Date (which shall be a
Business Day) in respect of the Loan, (ii) the amount of the proposed Loan,
provided that the aggregate amount of such proposed Loan shall equal (A) in the
case of Base Rate Loans, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or integral multiples
of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in excess thereof, or (B) in the case
of LIBOR Loans, One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or integral multiples of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in excess thereof, and (iii) whether the
Loan to be made thereunder will be a Base Rate Loan or a LIBOR Loan and, if a
LIBOR Loan, the Interest Period. Any Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this
Section 2.01(b) shall be irrevocable. Each such Notice of Borrowing shall be
accompanied by all reports or documents required to be delivered by Borrower to
Agent or any Lender under this Agreement. Borrower may elect (A) so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to convert Base Rate Loans or
any portion thereof into LIBOR Loans, (B) to convert LIBOR Loans or any portion
thereof into Base Rate Loans, or (C) so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, to continue any LIBOR Loans or any portion thereof for an
additional Interest Period, provided, however, that the aggregate amount of
Loans being continued as or converted into LIBOR Loans shall, in the aggregate,
equal One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or an integral multiple of One Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in excess thereof. The applicable Interest Period
for the continuation of any LIBOR Loan shall commence on the day on which the
next preceding Interest Period expires. Each such election shall be made by
giving Agent, at 2120 E. Park Place, Suite 100, El Segundo, California 90245,
Attn: Elizabeth MacDonald, a Notice of Continuation/Conversion by 10:00 A.M.
(California time) on the date of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan, or by 10:00
A.M. (California time) not less than three (3) nor more than five (5) Business
Days prior to the date of a conversion to or continuation of a LIBOR Loan,
specifying, in each case (1) whether a conversion or continuation is to occur,
(2) the amount of the conversion or continuation, (3) the Interest Period
therefor, in the case of a conversion to or continuation of a LIBOR Loan, and
(4) the date of the conversion or continuation (which date shall be a Business
Day). Agent shall promptly notify each Lender, but in any event within one (1)
Business Day after receipt of such notice, of its receipt of each such notice
and the contents

                                       25

<PAGE>

thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein and subject
to the default interest provisions contained in Section 2.03, if an Event of
Default occurs and as a result thereof the Commitments are terminated, all LIBOR
Loans will convert to Base Rate Loans upon the expiration of the applicable
Interest Periods therefor or the date all Loans become due, whichever occurs
first. Except as provided above, the conversion of a LIBOR Loan to a Base Rate
Loan shall only occur on the last Business Day of the Interest Period relating
to such LIBOR Loan. In the absence of an effective election by Borrower of a
LIBOR Loan and Interest Period in accordance with the above procedures prior to
the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the expiration of the then current
Interest Period with respect to any LIBOR Loan, interest on such LIBOR Loan
shall accrue at the interest rate then applicable to a LIBOR Loan for an
Interest Period of thirty (30) days, effective immediately upon the expiration
of the then-current Interest Period, without prejudice, however, to the right of
Borrower to elect a Base Rate Loan or a different Interest Period in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that if such
continuation shall cause the number of LIBOR Loan tranches to exceed six (6),
such LIBOR Loan shall be converted to a Base Rate Loan.

                  (c)      Making of Loans. Subject to Section 11.03, Agent
shall make the proceeds of Loans (other than Swingline Loans) available to
Borrower in El Segundo, California on such Funding Date and shall disburse such
funds in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later than 1:00 P.M.
Chicago time to Borrower's account, at Bank of America, Account Number
73-66901095 in Chicago, Illinois, or such other account specified in the Notice
of Borrowing acceptable to Agent, with a confirming telephone call to Quantaze
Watts at (312) 279-1408 or Michael Berman at (312) 279-1496.

                  (d)      Term; Principal Payment. The outstanding balance of
the Loans (other than Swingline Loans, which by their terms shall mature
earlier) shall be payable in full on the earlier to occur of (A) the Maturity
Date, and (B) the acceleration of the Loans pursuant to Section 10.02(a) (the
"Termination Date").

                  2.02     Authorization to Obtain Loans and Letters of Credit.
Borrower shall provide Agent with documentation reasonably satisfactory to Agent
indicating the names of those employees or agents of Borrower authorized by
Borrower to sign Notices of Borrowing, to request Letters of Credit and to
receive callback confirmations, and Agent and Lenders shall be entitled to rely
on such documentation until notified in writing by Borrower of any change(s) of
the persons so authorized. Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender shall be
entitled to act in good faith on the instructions of anyone identifying himself
as one of the Persons authorized to request Loans or Letters of Credit, and
Borrower shall be bound thereby in the same manner as if such Person were
actually so authorized. Borrower agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Lenders,
Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities and Costs which may arise or be created by the acceptance of
instructions for making Loans, and issuing Letters of Credit.

                  2.03     Interest on the Loans

                  (a)      Base Rate Loans. Subject to Section 2.03(d), all Base
Rate Loans shall bear interest on the average daily unpaid principal amount
thereof from the date made until paid in full at a fluctuating rate per annum
equal to the Base Rate. Base Rate Loans shall be made in

                                       26

<PAGE>

minimum amounts of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or an integral multiple of
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) in excess thereof.

                  (b)      LIBOR Loans. Subject to Section 2.03(d), all LIBOR
Loans shall bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof during the
Interest Period applicable thereto at a rate per annum equal to the sum of LIBOR
for such Interest Period plus the Applicable Margin. Upon receipt of a Notice of
Borrowing requesting LIBOR Loans, Agent shall determine LIBOR applicable to the
Interest Period for such LIBOR Loans, and shall give notice thereof to Borrower
and Lenders; provided, however, that failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such rate. Each determination by Agent of LIBOR shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto in the absence of demonstrable
error. LIBOR Loans shall be in tranches of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) or
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) increments in excess thereof. No more
than six (6) LIBOR Loan tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.

                  (c)      Interest Payments. Subject to Section 2.03(d),
interest accrued on all Loans shall be payable by Borrower in arrears on the
first Business Day of the first calendar month following the Closing Date, and
the first Business Day of each succeeding calendar month thereafter, and on the
Termination Date.

                  (d)      Default Interest. Notwithstanding the rates of
interest specified in Sections 2.03(a) and 2.03(b) and the payment dates
specified in Section 2.03(c), effective immediately upon demand by Agent after
the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuance of any Event of
Default, the principal balance of all Loans then outstanding and, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, any interest payments on the Loans not paid when
due shall bear interest payable upon demand at a rate which is five percent (5%)
per annum in excess of the rate or rates of interest otherwise payable under
this Agreement. All other amounts due Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or
Lenders (whether directly or for reimbursement) under this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents if not paid when due, or if no time period is
expressed, if not paid within fifteen (15) days after written demand to
Borrower, shall bear interest from and after demand at the rate which is five
percent (5%) per annum in excess of the lowest rate or rates of interest
otherwise payable under this Agreement, or, if no Loans are then outstanding, at
the rate which is five percent (5%) per annum in excess of the rate of interest
applicable to Base Rate Loans.

                  (e)      Late Fee. Borrower acknowledges that late payment
hereunder will cause Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders to
incur costs not contemplated by this Agreement. Such costs include without
limitation processing and accounting charges. Therefore, if Borrower fails
timely to pay any sum due and payable hereunder through the Termination Date
(other than payments of principal), unless waived by Agent pursuant to Section
12.05(e), a late charge of four cents ($.04) for each dollar of any interest
payment due hereon and which is not paid within ten (10) days after such payment
is due or of any other amount due hereon (other than payments of principal) and
which is not paid within thirty (30) days after such payment is due, shall be
charged by Agent (for the benefit of Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and
Lenders, as applicable) and paid by Borrower for the purpose of defraying the
expense incident to handling such delinquent payment; provided, however, that no
late charges shall be assessed with respect to any amount for which Borrower is
obligated to pay interest at the rate specified in Section 2.03(d), provided,
further, that in no event shall Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or
Lenders be required to refund any late fees paid by Borrower, notwithstanding
the preceding proviso. Borrower, Agent,

                                       27

<PAGE>

Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender, and Lenders agree that this late charge
represents a reasonable sum considering all of the circumstances existing on the
date hereof and represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the costs that
Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders will incur by reason of late
payment. Borrower, Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders further
agree that proof of actual damages would be costly and inconvenient. Acceptance
of any late charge shall not constitute a waiver of the default with respect to
the overdue installment, and shall not prevent Agent from exercising any of the
other rights available hereunder or any other Loan Document. Such late charge
shall be paid without prejudice to any other rights of Agent.

                  (f)      Computation of Interest. Interest and fees shall be
computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed in the period during
which interest or fees accrue and a year of three hundred sixty (360) days. In
computing interest on any Loan, the date of the making of the Loan shall be
included and the date of payment shall be excluded; provided, however, that if a
Loan is repaid on the same day on which it is made, one (1) day's interest shall
be paid on that Loan. Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), (d) and (e) above,
interest in respect of any Loan shall not exceed the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law.

                  (g)      Changes; Legal Restrictions. In the event that after
the Closing Date (A) the adoption of or any change in any law, treaty, rule,
regulation, guideline or determination of a court or Governmental Authority or
any change in the interpretation or application thereof by a court or
Governmental Authority, or (B) compliance by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing
Lender or any Lender with any request or directive made or issued after the
Closing Date (whether or not having the force of law and whether or not the
failure to comply therewith would be unlawful) from any central bank or other
Governmental Authority or quasi-governmental authority:

                  (i)      subjects Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or
         any Lender to any tax, duty or other charge of any kind with respect to
         the Facility, this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or the
         Loans or the Letters of Credit or changes the basis of taxation of
         payments to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender of
         principal, fees, interest or any other amount payable hereunder, except
         for net income, gross receipts, gross profits or franchise taxes
         imposed by any jurisdiction and not specifically based upon loan
         transactions (all such non-excepted taxes, duties and other charges
         being hereinafter referred to as "Lender Taxes");

                  (ii)     imposes, modifies or holds applicable, in the
         determination of Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender,
         any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, FDIC insurance, capital
         allocation or similar requirement against assets held by, or deposits
         or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or loans by, or
         other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of funds by, Agent,
         Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender or any applicable
         lending office (except to the extent that the reserve and FDIC
         insurance requirements are reflected in the "Base Rate" or "LIBOR
         Rate"); or

                                       28

<PAGE>

                  (iii)    imposes on Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or
         any Lender any other condition materially more burdensome in nature,
         extent or consequence than those in existence as of the Closing Date;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to (X) increase the cost to Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender of making, renewing, maintaining
or participating in the Loans or issuing or participating in the Letters of
Credit or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder or thereunder or (Y) to
require Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender or any applicable
lending office to make any payment calculated by reference to the amount of the
Loan held or interest received by it; then, in any such case, Borrower shall
promptly pay to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, as
applicable, upon demand, such amount or amounts (based upon a reasonable
allocation thereof by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender to
the financing transactions contemplated by this Agreement and affected by this
Section 2.03(g)) as may be necessary to compensate Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or such Lender for any such additional cost incurred, reduced
amounts received or additional payments made to the extent Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender generally imposes such additional costs,
losses and payments on other borrowers in similar circumstances. Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender shall deliver to Borrower and in
the case of a delivery by a Lender, such Lender shall also deliver to Agent, a
written statement in reasonable detail of the claimed additional costs incurred,
reduced amounts received or additional payments made and the basis therefor as
soon as reasonably practicable after Agent or such Lender, as applicable,
obtains knowledge thereof.

                  (h)      Certain Provisions Regarding LIBOR Loans

                  (i)      LIBOR Lending Unlawful. If any Lender shall determine
         in good faith that the introduction of or any change in or in the
         interpretation of any law makes it unlawful, or any central bank or
         other governmental authority asserts that it is unlawful, for such
         Lender to make or maintain any Loan as a LIBOR Loan, (A) the
         obligations of the Lenders to make or maintain any Loans as LIBOR Loans
         shall, upon such determination, forthwith be suspended until such
         Lender shall notify Agent that the circumstances causing such
         suspension no longer exist, and (B) if required by law or such
         assertion, all LIBOR Loans shall automatically convert into Base Rate
         Loans.

                  (ii)     Deposits Unavailable. If Agent shall have determined
         in good faith that adequate means do not exist for ascertaining the
         interest rate applicable hereunder to LIBOR Loans, then, upon notice
         from Agent to Borrower the obligations of all Lenders to make or
         maintain Loans as LIBOR Loans shall forthwith be suspended until Agent
         shall notify Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no
         longer exist. Agent will give such notice when it determines, in good
         faith, that such circumstances no longer exist; provided, however, that
         Agent shall not have any liability to any Person with respect to any
         delay in giving such notice.

                  (iii)    Funding Losses. In the event any Lender shall incur
         any loss or expense (including any loss or expense incurred by reason
         of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired
         by such Lender to make or maintain any portion of any Loan as a LIBOR
         Loan) as a result of:

                                       29

<PAGE>

                           (A)      any continuance, conversion, repayment or
                  prepayment of the principal amount of any LIBOR Loans for any
                  reason whatsoever on a date other than the scheduled last day
                  of the Interest Period applicable thereto; or

                           (B)      any Loans not being made as LIBOR Loans in
                  accordance with the Notice of Borrowing therefor, other than
                  as a result of such Lender's breach of its obligation to fund
                  such Loans in accordance with the terms hereof;

         then, within fifteen (15) Business Days after Borrower's receipt of the
         written notice of such Lender to Borrower with a copy to Agent,
         Borrower shall reimburse such Lender for such loss or expense;
         provided, however, that each Lender will use reasonable efforts to
         minimize such loss or expense. Such written notice (which shall include
         calculations in reasonable detail) shall, in the absence of
         demonstrable error, be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

                  (i)      Withholding Tax Exemption. Each Lender that is not
created or organized under the laws of the United States of America or a
political subdivision thereof shall deliver to Borrower and Agent no later than
the Closing Date (or, in the case of a Lender which becomes a Lender pursuant to
Section 11.13, the date upon which such Lender becomes a party hereto) a true
and accurate certificate executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of
such Lender, in a form satisfactory to Borrower and Agent, to the effect that
such Lender is capable, under the provisions of an applicable treaty concluded
by the United States of America (in which case the certificate shall be
accompanied by three (3) accurate and complete duly executed originals of Form
W-8BEN of the Internal Revenue Service) or under Section 1442 of the Internal
Revenue Code (in which case the certificate shall be accompanied by three (3)
accurate and complete duly executed originals of Form W-8ECI of the Internal
Revenue Service), of receiving payments of principal, interest and fees
hereunder without deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.
Further, if at any time a Lender changes its applicable lending office or
selects an additional applicable lending office, it shall, at the same time or
promptly thereafter, but only to the extent the certificate and forms previously
delivered by it hereunder are no longer applicable or effective, deliver to
Borrower and Agent in replacement for, or in addition to, the certificate and
forms previously delivered by it hereunder, a true and accurate certificate
executed in duplicate by a duly authorized officer of such Lender accompanied by
three (3) accurate and complete duly executed originals of either Form W-8BEN of
the Internal Revenue Service or Form W-8ECI of the Internal Revenue Service,
whichever is applicable, indicating that such Lender is entitled to receive
payments of principal, interest and fees for the account of such changed or
additional applicable lending office under this Agreement without deduction or
withholding of United States federal tax. Each Lender further agrees to deliver
to Borrower and Agent a true and accurate certificate executed in duplicate by a
duly authorized officer of such Lender accompanied by three (3) accurate and
complete duly executed originals of either Form W-8BEN of the Internal Revenue
Service or Form W-8ECI of the Internal Revenue Service, whichever is
appropriate, substantially in a form satisfactory to Borrower and Agent, before
or promptly upon the occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most
recent certificate or Internal Revenue Service form previously delivered by it
to Borrower and Agent pursuant to this Section 2.03(j). Further, each Lender
which delivers a certificate accompanied by Form W-8BEN of the Internal Revenue
Service covenants and agrees to deliver to Borrower and Agent within fifteen
(15) days prior to January 1, 2003, and every third (3rd) anniversary of such
date thereafter, on which this Agreement is still in effect, another such
certificate and three (3)

                                       30

<PAGE>

accurate and complete original signed copies of Form W-8BEN (or any successor
form or forms required under the Internal Revenue Code or the applicable
regulations promulgated thereunder), and each Lender that delivers a certificate
accompanied by Form W-8ECI of the Internal Revenue Service covenants and agrees
to deliver to Borrower and Agent within fifteen (15) days prior to the beginning
of each subsequent taxable year of such Lender during which this Agreement is
still in effect, another such certificate and three (3) accurate and complete
original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI (or any successor
form or forms required under the Internal Revenue Code or the applicable
regulations promulgated hereunder). If (i) any Lender is required under this
Section 2.03(j) to provide a certificate or other evidence described above and
fails to deliver to Borrower and Agent such certificate or other evidence or
(ii) any Lender delivers a certificate to the effect that, as a result of the
adoption of or any change in any law, treaty, rule, regulation, guideline or
determination of a Governmental Authority after the date such Lender became a
party hereto, such Lender is not capable of receiving payments of interest
hereunder without deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax
as specified therein and that it is not capable of recovering the full amount of
the same from a source other than Borrower, then, to the extent required by law,
as the sole consequence of such Lender's failure to deliver the certificate
described in (i) above or such Lender's delivery of the certificate described in
(ii) above, Borrower shall be entitled to deduct or withhold taxes from the
payments owed to such Lender.

                  2.04     Fees.

                  (a)      Intentionally Deleted.

                  (b)      Unused Facility Fee. Until the Obligations are paid
in full and this Agreement is terminated or, if sooner, the date the Commitments
terminate, and subject to Section 11.04(b), Borrower shall pay to Agent, for the
account of each Lender, an Unused Facility Fee accruing from and after the
Closing Date at the rate described below upon the amount during each calendar
quarter of (i) the Facility, minus (ii) the sum of (A) the average daily
aggregate principal balance of all Loans then outstanding other than Swingline
Loans and (B) the average daily aggregate face amount of all outstanding Letters
of Credit (the "Unused Amount"). The Unused Facility Fee will be calculated and
will accrue at the rate per annum of fifteen one-hundredths of one percent
(.15%). Subject to Section 11.04(b), each Lender shall be entitled to receive
its Pro Rata Share of such Unused Facility Fee. All such Unused Facility Fees
payable under this paragraph shall be payable in arrears on the fifth Business
Day in each calendar quarter beginning with the first calendar quarter after the
Closing Date.

                  (c)      Arrangement and Administrative Agency Fees. Borrower
shall pay Agent such fees as are provided for in the separate fee agreement
between Agent and Borrower, as in existence from time to time.

                  (d)      Letter of Credit Fee. With respect to each Letter of
Credit, Borrower agrees to pay to Agent (i) a letter of credit fee equal to the
Applicable Margin on the face amount of such Letter of Credit for the term of
such Letter of Credit to be distributed by Agent to each Lender according to its
Pro Rata Share payable in arrears on the fifth Business Day in each calendar
quarter beginning with the first calendar quarter after the Closing Date and
ending on the date of the expiration, return or termination of such Letter of
Credit if such date is a date

                                       31

<PAGE>

other than the first Business Day of a calendar month and (ii) a non-refundable
issuing fee of $500.00 solely for the account of Issuing Lender, payable in full
on the date of issuance thereof.

                  (e)      Payment of Fees. The fees described in this Section
2.04 represent compensation for services rendered and to be rendered separate
and apart from the lending of money or the provision of credit and do not
constitute compensation for the use, detention or forbearance of money, and the
obligation of Borrower to pay the fees described herein shall be in addition to,
and not in lieu of, the obligation of Borrower to pay interest, other fees and
expenses otherwise described in this Agreement. All fees shall be payable when
due in California in immediately available funds and shall be non-refundable
when paid. If Borrower fails to make any payment of fees or expenses specified
or referred to in this Agreement due to Agent or Lenders, including without
limitation those referred to in this Section 2.04 or otherwise under this
Agreement or any separate fee agreement between Borrower and Agent relating to
this Agreement, when due, the amount due shall bear interest until paid at the
Base Rate and, after five (5) days at the rate specified in Section 2.03(d) (but
not to exceed the maximum rate permitted by applicable law) and shall constitute
part of the Obligations. All fees described in this Section 2.04 which are
expressed as a per annum charge shall be calculated on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in a three hundred sixty (360) day year.

                  2.05     Payments.

                  (a)      Voluntary Prepayments. Borrower may, upon not less
than three (3) Business Days prior written notice (or with written notice not
later than 1:00 P.M. (California time) on the same Business Day in the case of a
Swingline Loan), at any time and from time to time, prepay any Loans, without
premium or penalty (other than as set forth in Section 2.03(h)(iii)), in whole
or in part in amounts not less than One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) or
integral multiples of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) in excess of One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000). Any notice of prepayment given to Agent
under this Section 2.05(a) shall specify the date of prepayment and the
aggregate principal amount of the prepayment. All prepayments of principal shall
be accompanied by a payment of all accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

                  (b)      Manner and Time of Payment. All payments of
principal, interest and fees hereunder payable to Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or the Lenders shall be made without condition or reservation of
right and free of set-off or counterclaim, in Dollars and by (i) wire transfer
(pursuant to Agent's written wire transfer instructions) of immediately
available funds, delivered to Agent not later than 11:00 A.M. (California time)
(or 2:00 P.M. (California time) in the case of a Swingline Loan) on the date
due; and funds received by Agent after that time and date shall be deemed to
have been paid on the next succeeding Business Day or (ii) by check (pursuant to
Agent's written check payment instructions) delivered to Agent, such check and
the payment intended to be covered thereby to be deemed to have been paid on the
date Agent receives immediately available funds therefor. All payments of
principal, interest and fees hereunder shall be made by (i) wire transfer of
immediately available funds to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (ABA number 121000248) for
credit to account number AC2963507207, reference MHC Operating Limited
Partnership, loan number 6023AMC with telephonic notice to Elizabeth MacDonald
at (310) 335-9525 or (ii) check payable to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and delivered
to Agent at 2120 E. Park Place, Suite 100, El Segundo, California 90245, Attn:
Elizabeth

                                       32

MacDonald, or to such other bank, account or address as Agent may specify in a
written notice to Borrower.

                  (c)      Payments on Non-Business Days. Whenever any payment
to be made by Borrower hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not
a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day and
such extension of time shall be included in the computation of the payment of
interest hereunder and of any of the fees specified in Section 2.04, as the case
may be.

                  2.06     Increased Capital. If either (i) the introduction of
or any change in or in the interpretation of any law or regulation or (ii)
compliance by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply
therewith would be unlawful) made or issued after the Closing Date affects or
would affect the amount of capital required or expected to be maintained by
Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender or any corporation
controlling Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, and Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender determines that the amount of
such capital is increased by or based upon the existence of the obligations of
Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, then, upon demand by
Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, Borrower shall
immediately pay to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender, from
time to time as specified by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such
Lender, additional amounts sufficient to compensate Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or such Lender in light of such circumstances, to the extent that
Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender reasonably determines
such increase in capital to be allocable to the existence of the obligations of
Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender hereunder and to the
extent Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender generally imposes
such amounts on other borrowers in similar circumstances. A certificate as to
such amounts submitted to Borrower by Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or
such Lender shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding
for all purposes.

                  2.07     Notice of Increased Costs. Each of Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender and the Lenders agrees that, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after it becomes aware of the occurrence of an event or the
existence of a condition which would cause it to be affected by any of the
events or conditions described in Section 2.03(g) or (h), or Section 2.06, it
will notify Borrower and provide in such notice a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount due from Borrower, and provide a copy of such notice
to Agent, of such event and the possible effects thereof. If Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or the affected Lender shall fail to notify Borrower of
the occurrence of any such event or the existence of any such condition within
ninety (90) days following the end of the month during which such event occurred
or such condition arose, then Borrower's liability for any amounts described in
said Sections 2.03(g) and (h) and 2.06 incurred by Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or such affected Lender as a result of such event or condition
shall be limited to those attributable to the period occurring subsequent to the
ninetieth (90th) day prior to the date upon which Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or such affected Lender actually notified Borrower of such event
or condition.

                  2.08     Option to Replace Lenders.

                                       33

<PAGE>

                  (a)      Lenders. If any Lender shall make any demand for
payment or reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.03(g), Section 2.03(h) or Section
2.06, then, provided that (a) there does not then exist any Unmatured Event of
Default or Event of Default and (b) the circumstances resulting in such demand
for payment or reimbursement are not applicable to all Lenders, Borrower may
terminate the Commitment of such Lender, in whole but not in part, by (i) giving
such Lender and Agent not less than three (3) Business Days prior written notice
thereof, which notice shall be irrevocable and effective only upon receipt
thereof by such Lender and Agent and shall specify the effective date of such
termination, (ii) paying to such Lender (and there shall become due and payable)
on such date the outstanding principal amount of all Loans made by such Lender,
all interest thereon, and all other Obligations owed to such Lender, including,
without limitation, amounts owing under Sections 2.03(g), 2.03(h)(iii), 2.04 and
2.06, if any, and (iii) pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.13, proposing
the introduction of a replacement Lender reasonably satisfactory to Agent, or
obtaining the agreement of one or more existing Lenders, to assume the entire
amount of the Commitment of the Lender whose Commitment is being terminated, on
the effective date of such termination. Upon the satisfaction of all of the
foregoing conditions, such Lender which is being terminated pursuant to this
Section 2.08 shall cease to be a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement
provided that Borrower shall continue to be obligated to such Lender under
Sections 12.01 and 12.02 (and any other indemnifications contained herein or in
any other Loan Document) with respect to or on account of unpaid, unliquidated,
unknown or similar claims or liabilities accruing prior to such Lender ceasing
to be a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (b)      Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender. If Agent,
Swingline Lender or Issuing Lender shall make any demand for payment or
reimbursement pursuant to Section 2.03(g), Section 2.03(h) or Section 2.06,
then, provided that (a) there does not then exist any Unmatured Event of Default
or Event of Default and (b) the circumstances resulting in such demand for
payment or reimbursement are not applicable to all Lenders, Borrower may remove
Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender by (i) giving the Lenders and Agent
not less than thirty (30) Business Days prior written notice thereof, and (ii)
paying to Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing Lender (and there shall become due
and payable) on such date all other Obligations owed to Agent, Swingline Lender
and Issuing Lender, including, without limitation, amounts owing under Sections
2.03(g), 2.03(h), 2.04 and 2.06, if any. Agent, Swingline Lender and Issuing
Lender shall be replaced in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.09
hereof.

                  2.09     Letters of Credit.

                  (a)      Letter of Credit Availability. Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, at any time and from time to time
through the date that is thirty (30) days prior to the Maturity Date, Issuing
Lender shall issue such Letters of Credit for the account of Borrower as
Borrower may request in accordance with this Section 2.09; provided that (i)
upon issuance of such Letters of Credit, the sum of the aggregate principal
amount of all outstanding Loans (including Swingline Loans) plus the aggregate
face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed Loan
Availability, provided, that if a Base Rate Loan is being made pursuant to
Section 2.09(e) hereof to reimburse Issuing Lender for a drawn Letter of Credit,
to avoid a duplicative reduction in the amount of Loan Availability, the drawn
Letter of Credit shall not be considered outstanding; (ii) the aggregate face
amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit shall not exceed Thirty Million
Dollars ($30,000,000); and (iii) unless all Lenders otherwise consent in
writing, the term of any Letter of Credit shall not extend or be extended beyond
the

                                       34

<PAGE>

date which is ten (10) days prior to the Maturity Date and no Letter of Credit
shall contain an automatic extension or renewal clause. Use of funds drawn under
Letters of Credit shall be subject to the same conditions as those for use of
Loan proceeds set forth in Section 7.01(i) hereof.

                  (b)      Request for Letter of Credit. Borrower shall deliver
to Agent and Issuing Lender a duly executed letter of credit application
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit H hereto (a "Letter of Credit
Application") not later than 10:00 A.M., (California time), at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date upon which a requested Letter of Credit is to be
issued. Borrower shall further deliver to Agent and Issuing Lender such
additional instruments and documents as Issuing Lender may reasonably require,
in conformity with customary and commercially reasonable practices or law, in
connection with the issuance of such Letter of Credit.

                  (c)      Issuance of Letters of Credit. Subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Issuing Lender shall issue the Letter of
Credit on or before 5:00 P.M. (California time), on or before the day which is
five (5) Business Days following receipt of the documents last due pursuant to
Section 2.09(b) hereof in respect thereof. Upon issuance of a Letter of Credit,
Issuing Lender shall promptly notify Lenders of the amount and terms thereof.
Issuing Lender shall provide copies of each Letter of Credit to Lenders promptly
following issuance thereof and shall notify Lenders promptly of all payments,
reimbursements, expirations, negotiations, transfers and other activity with
respect to outstanding Letters of Credit.

                  (d)      Participations. Each Lender, upon issuance by Issuing
Lender of a Letter of Credit in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, shall be deemed to have purchased without recourse a risk
participation from Issuing Lender in such Letter of Credit and the obligations
arising thereunder, in each case in an amount equal to its Pro Rata Share of the
obligations under such Letter of Credit, and shall absolutely, unconditionally
and irrevocably assume, as primary obligor and not as surety, and be obligated
to pay to Issuing Lender therefor and discharge when due, its Pro Rata Share of
the obligations arising under such Letter of Credit.

                  (e)      Reimbursement. In the event of any drawing or request
for drawing under any Letter of Credit, Issuing Lender will promptly notify
Borrower and Agent thereof. Unless Borrower shall notify Issuing Lender of its
intent to otherwise reimburse Issuing Lender immediately upon receipt of notice
from Issuing Lender of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, Borrower shall be
deemed to have requested Base Rate Loans in the amount of the drawing as
provided in subsection (f) hereof, the proceeds of which will be used to satisfy
the reimbursement obligations. Borrower shall reimburse Issuing Lender on the
day of drawing under any Letter of Credit (either with the proceeds of a Loan
obtained hereunder or otherwise) in same day funds as provided herein. If
Borrower shall fail to reimburse Issuing Lender as provided hereinabove, the
unreimbursed amount of such drawing shall bear interest at a per annum rate
equal to the Base Rate plus two percent (2%). Borrower's reimbursement
obligations hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under all
circumstances irrespective of any rights of set-off, counterclaim or defense to
payment Borrower may claim or have against Issuing Lender, Agent, the Lenders,
the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit drawn upon or any other Person,
including, without limitation, any defense based on any failure of Borrower to
receive consideration or the legality, validity, regularity or unenforceability
of the Letter of Credit; provided, however, that (i) the Borrower shall not be
obligated to reimburse Issuing

                                       35

<PAGE>

Lender and (ii) Lenders shall not be obligated to fund Loans or purchase
participations hereunder in reimbursement of Issuing Lender, for any wrongful
payment made by Issuing Lender under a Letter of Credit as a result of acts or
omissions constituting bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence on the
part of Issuing Lender. The Letter of Credit Obligations will be evidenced by
the Letter of Credit Note.

                  (f)      Repayment with Loans. On any day on which Borrower
shall have requested, or been deemed to have requested, Base Rate Loans to
reimburse a drawing under a Letter of Credit, Agent shall give notice to the
Lenders that such Loans have been requested or deemed requested in connection
with a drawing under a Letter of Credit, in which case such Loans (collectively,
a "Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing") shall be immediately made by all
Lenders (without giving effect to any termination of the Commitments pursuant to
Section 10.02 hereof) pro rata based on each Lender's Pro Rata Share and the
proceeds thereof shall be paid directly to Issuing Lender for application to the
respective Letter of Credit Obligations. Each Lender hereby irrevocably agrees
to make such Loans promptly upon any such request or deemed request in the
amount and in the manner specified in the preceding sentence and on the same
such date (or the next Business Day if such notice is received after 10:00 A.M.
(California time)) notwithstanding (i) the amount of the Letter of Credit
Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with the minimum amount for Borrowings
otherwise required hereunder, (ii) whether any conditions specified in Section
4.02 are then satisfied, (iii) whether an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
Default then exists, (iv) failure of any such request or deemed request for a
Borrowing to be made by the time otherwise required in Section 2.01 hereof, (v)
the date of such Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing (provided that such date
must be a Business Day), or (vi) any termination of the Commitments immediately
prior to such Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing or contemporaneously
therewith. In the event that any Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing cannot for
any reason occur in respect of a Letter of Credit on the date otherwise required
above (including, without limitation, as a result of the commencement of a
proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect to Borrower), then each Lender
hereby agrees that it shall forthwith fund (as of the date the Letter of Credit
Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payments
received from Borrower on or after such date and prior to such funding) its
participation interest in the outstanding obligations arising in connection with
such Letter of Credit, provided that (A) all interest payable on Borrower's
reimbursement obligation with respect to such Letter of Credit shall be for the
account of Issuing Lender until but excluding the day upon which the Letter of
Credit Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and (B) in the event
of a delay between the day upon which the Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing
would otherwise have occurred and the time any funding of a participation
pursuant to this sentence is actually made, the funding Lender shall be required
to pay to the Issuing Lender interest on the principal amount of such
participation for each day from and including the day upon which the Letter of
Credit Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but excluding the
date of funding of such participation, at the rate equal to the Federal Funds
Rate, for the two (2) Business Days after the date the Letter of Credit
Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and thereafter at a rate
equal to the Base Rate.

                  (g)      Modification, Extension. The issuance of any
supplement, modification, amendment, renewal, or extension to any Letter of
Credit shall, for purposes hereof, be treated in all respects the same as if it
were the issuance of a new Letter of Credit hereunder.

                                       36

                  (h)      Uniform Customs and Practices. Issuing Lender may
have the Letters of Credit be subject to The Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits, as published as of the date of issue by the International
Chamber of Commerce (the "UCP"), in which case the UCP may be incorporated
therein and deemed in all respects to be a part thereof.

                  (i)      Collateralization at Termination Date. Upon the
occurrence of the Termination Date prior to the expiration of all Letters of
Credit, Borrower shall provide to Issuing Lender a standby letter of credit
issued by a bank with a rating of its senior unsecured debt obligations of not
less than A by Moody's, in form and substance satisfactory to Issuing Lender, in
favor of Issuing Lender in a face amount equal to the outstanding Letters of
Credit on that date, or shall make other provisions satisfactory to Issuing
Lender and Agent for the full collateralization, by cash or cash equivalent, of
such outstanding Letters of Credit. In the event of failure of Borrower to
comply with the requirement of this Section 2.09(i), such portion of the face
amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit as to which Borrower has failed to
comply shall be deemed to be immediately due and payable.

                  (j)      Limitation of Liability. Borrower assumes all risks
of the acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee of any Letter of
Credit with respect to its use of such Letter of Credit absent the bad faith,
gross negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Lender. Neither Issuing
Lender, Agent, any Lender nor any of their respective officers, directors,
employees or agents shall be liable or responsible for, nor shall Borrower's
obligations hereunder in respect of such Letters of Credit be impaired as a
result of any of the following absent the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Issuing Lender:

                  (i)      any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter
         of Credit or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto (such
         Letter of Credit and any other agreement or instrument relating thereto
         being, collectively, the "Letter of Credit Documents");

                  (ii)     the use that may be made of any Letter of Credit or
         any acts or omissions of any beneficiary or transferee in connection
         therewith;

                  (iii)    any statement or any other document presented under a
         Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
         insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
         inaccurate in any respect;

                  (iv)     the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
         right that Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or any
         transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Persons for whom any such
         beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), Issuing Lender or
         any other Person, whether in connection with the transactions
         contemplated by the Letter of Credit Documents or any unrelated
         transaction;

                  (v)      failure of any documents to bear any reference or
         adequate reference to the Letter of Credit; or

                  (vi)     any other circumstances whatsoever in making or
         failing to make payment under any Letter of Credit.

In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Issuing Lender may accept
documents that appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for
further investigation, regardless of

                                       37

<PAGE>

any notice or information to the contrary, absent the bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Issuing Lender.

                  (k)      Lenders. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by
Issuing Lender under or in connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or
omitted in the absence of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct,
shall not put Issuing Lender under any resulting liability to any Lender or
relieve that Lender of its obligations hereunder to Issuing Lender. In
determining whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, Issuing Lender shall have
no obligations to Lenders other than to confirm that any documents required to
be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that
they appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of
Credit.

                  (l)      Indemnification. Borrower shall indemnify and hold
harmless Issuing Lender, Agent and Lenders from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, reasonable costs and expenses of any kind
whatsoever, including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys that such
indemnified Person may incur, together with all reasonable costs and expenses
resulting from the compromise or defense of any claims or liabilities
hereinafter described, by reason of or in connection with (i) the execution and
delivery or transfer of, or payment or failure to pay under, any Letter of
Credit, (ii) any suit, action or proceeding brought by any Person to require or
present payment under any Letter of Credit, or (iii) any breach by Borrower of
any warranty, covenant, term or condition in, or the occurrence of any default
under, any Letter of Credit or any related contract; provided, however, that
Borrower shall not be required to indemnify Issuing Lender, Agent or any Lender
for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent,
but only to the extent, caused by the willful misconduct, gross negligence, bad
faith or fraud of such indemnified Person; and provided, further, that Issuing
Lender will be liable to Borrower for any damages suffered by Borrower as a
result of Issuing Lender's grossly negligent or willful failure to pay under any
Letter of Credit after the presentment to it of documentation in strict
compliance with the terms and conditions of the Letter of Credit and absent any
challenge by any Person (other than Issuing Lender or any of its affiliates) to
the making of such payment.

                  2.10     Swingline Loans

                  (a)      Swingline Availability. Subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Swingline Lender agrees to make certain
revolving loans to Borrower (each a "Swingline Loan" and, collectively, the
"Swingline Loans") from time to time during the period from the Closing Date to
the fifth day preceding the Maturity Date; provided, however, that the aggregate
amount of Swingline Loans outstanding at any time shall not exceed the lesser of
(i) THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS ($30,000,000), and (ii) the excess of Loan
Availability over the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all outstanding
Loans (excluding Swingline Loans) plus the aggregate face amount of all
outstanding Letters of Credit, provided, that if a Base Rate Loan is being made
pursuant to Section 2.09(e) hereof to reimburse Issuing Lender for a drawn
Letter of Credit, to avoid a duplicative reduction in the amount of Loan
availability, the drawn Letter of Credit shall not be considered outstanding.
Subject to the limitations set forth herein, any amounts repaid in respect of
Swingline Loans may be reborrowed.

                  (b)      Swingline Borrowings.

                                       38

<PAGE>

                  (i)      Notice of Borrowing. Whenever Borrower desires to
         borrow under this Section 2.10, Borrower shall give Swingline Lender
         and Agent at Wells Fargo Real Estate Group Disbursement Center, 2120
         East Park Place, Suite 100, El Segundo, California 90245, with a copy
         to Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 123 North Wacker Drive, Suite 1900, Chicago,
         Illinois 60606, Attn: Account Officer, or such other address as Agent
         shall designate, an original or facsimile Notice of Borrowing no later
         than 11:00 A.M. (California time) on the proposed date of such
         borrowing (and confirmed by telephone by such time), specifying (A)
         that a Swingline Loan is being requested, (B) the amount of such
         Swingline Loan, (C) the proposed date of such Swingline Loan, which
         shall be a Business Day, and (D) stating that no Event of Default or
         Unmatured Event of Default has occurred and is continuing both before
         and after giving effect to such Swingline Loan. Such notice shall be
         irrevocable.

                  (ii)     Minimum Amounts; Frequency of Swingline Loans. Each
         Swingline Loan shall be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000,000, or
         an integral multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Swingline Loans
         shall be available no more frequently than six (6) times in any month.

                  (iii)    Making of Swingline Loans. Swingline Lender shall
         make the proceeds of each Swingline Loan available to Borrower in El
         Segundo, California on the applicable Funding Date in Dollars and in
         immediately available funds not later than 1:00 P.M. (California time)
         on such Funding Date to Borrower's account, at Bank of America, Account
         Number 75-01943 in Chicago, Illinois or such other account specified in
         the Notice of Borrowing and acceptable to Agent.

                  (iv)     Repayment of Swingline Loans. Each Swingline Loan
         shall be due and payable on the earliest of (A) five (5) days from the
         date of the applicable Funding Date for such Swingline Loan, (B) the
         date of the next Borrowing under Section 2.01 hereof (other than a
         Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing) or (C) the Termination Date. If,
         and to the extent, any Swingline Loans shall be outstanding on the date
         of any Borrowing under Section 2.01 hereof (other than a Letter of
         Credit Mandatory Borrowing), such Swingline Loans shall first be repaid
         from the proceeds of such Borrowing prior to the disbursement of the
         same to Borrower. If, and to the extent, a Borrowing under Section 2.01
         hereof (other than a Letter of Credit Mandatory Borrowing) is not
         requested prior to the Termination Date or the end of the five (5) day
         period after a Swingline Loan is made, Borrower shall be deemed to have
         requested Base Rate Loans in the amount of the applicable Swingline
         Loan then outstanding, the proceeds of which shall be used to repay
         such Swingline Loan to the Swingline Lender. In addition, the Swingline
         Lender may, at any time, in its sole discretion, by written notice to
         Borrower and Agent, demand repayment of its Swingline Loans by way of
         Base Rate Loans, in which case Borrower shall be deemed to have
         requested Base Rate Loans in the amount of such Swingline Loans then
         outstanding, the proceeds of which shall be used to repay such
         Swingline Loans to the Swingline Lender. Any Borrowing which is deemed
         requested by Borrower in accordance with this Section 2.10(b)(iv) is
         hereinafter referred to as a "Swingline Mandatory Borrowing". Each
         Lender hereby irrevocably agrees to make Base Rate Loans in accordance
         with its Pro Rata Share promptly upon receipt of notice from the
         Swingline Lender of any such deemed request for a Swingline Mandatory
         Borrowing in the amount and in the manner specified in the preceding
         sentences and on the date such

                                       39

<PAGE>

         notice is received by such Lender (or the next Business Day if such
         notice is received after 10:00 A.M. (California time)) notwithstanding
         (I) the amount of the Swingline Mandatory Borrowing may not comply with
         the minimum amount for Borrowings otherwise required hereunder, (II)
         whether any conditions specified in Section 4.02 hereof are then
         satisfied, (III) whether an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
         Default then exists, (IV) failure of any such deemed request for a
         Borrowing to be made by the time otherwise required in Section 2.01
         hereof, (V) the date of such Swingline Mandatory Borrowing (provided
         that such date must be a Business Day), or (VI) any termination of the
         Commitments immediately prior to such Swingline Mandatory Borrowing or
         contemporaneously therewith; provided, however, that no Lender shall be
         obligated to make any Loans under this Section 2.10(b)(iv) if an Event
         of Default or Unmatured Event of Default then exists and the applicable
         Swingline Loan was made by the Swingline Lender without receipt of a
         written Notice of Borrowing in the form specified in subclause (i)
         above or after Agent had delivered a notice of an Event of Default or
         Unmatured Event of Default which had not been rescinded.

                  (v)      Purchase of Participations. In the event that any
         Swingline Mandatory Borrowing cannot for any reason occur on the date
         otherwise required above (including, without limitation, as a result of
         the commencement of a proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code with respect
         to Borrower), then each Lender hereby agrees that it shall forthwith
         purchase (as of the date the Swingline Mandatory Borrowing would
         otherwise have occurred, but adjusted for any payment received from
         Borrower on or after such date and prior to such purchase) from the
         Swingline Lender such participations in the outstanding Swingline Loans
         as shall be necessary to cause each such Lender to share in such
         Swingline Loans ratably based upon its Pro Rata Share, provided that
         (A) all interest payable on the Swingline Loans with respect to any
         participation shall be for the account of the Swingline Lender until
         but excluding the day upon which the Swingline Mandatory Borrowing
         would otherwise have occurred, and (B) in the event of a delay between
         the day upon which the Swingline Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise
         have occurred and the time any purchase of a participation pursuant to
         this sentence is actually made, the purchasing Lender shall be required
         to pay to the Swingline Lender interest on the principal amount of such
         participation for each day from and including the day upon which the
         Swingline Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred to but
         excluding the date of payment for such participation, at the rate equal
         to the Federal Funds Rate, for the two (2) Business Days after the date
         the Swingline Mandatory Borrowing would otherwise have occurred, and
         thereafter at a rate equal to the Base Rate. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, no Bank shall be obligated to purchase a participation in
         any Swingline Loan if an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default
         then exists and such Swingline Loan was made by the Swingline Lender
         without receipt of a written Notice of Borrowing in the form specified
         in subclause (i) above or after Agent had delivered a notice of an
         Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default which had not been
         rescinded.

                  (c)      Interest Rate. Each Swingline Loan shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate minus 1.5% per annum.

Loan Documents, and has made, or caused to be made under his supervision, a
review in reasonable detail of the transactions and condition of Borrower, the
REIT, the Subsidiaries, and the Agreement Parties, and that (A) such review has
not disclosed the existence as of the date of such Officer's Certificate, and
that the signer does not have knowledge of the existence as of the date of such
Officer's Certificate, of any condition or event which constitutes an Event of

                  (d)      on or before the Initial Maturity Date, Agent shall
have received, on behalf of Agent and Lenders, an extension fee in the amount of
one-fourth of one percent (0.25%) of the amount of the Facility.

                  (b)      Additional Matters. As of the Funding Date for any
Loan or the issuance date of any Letter of Credit and after giving effect to the
Loans and/or Letters of Credit being requested:

                  (i)      Representations and Warranties. All of the
         representations and warranties of Borrower and the REIT contained in
         this Agreement and in any other Loan Document (other than
         representations and warranties which expressly speak only as of a
         different date) shall be true and correct in all material respects on
         and as of such Funding Date or issuance date, as though made on and as
         of such date;

                  (ii)     No Default. No Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
         Default shall have occurred and be continuing or would result from the
         making of the requested Loan or issuance for the requested Letter of

                  (iii)    No Material Adverse Change. No change shall have

Each submission by Borrower to Agent of a Notice of Borrowing with respect to a
Loan or a request for a Letter of Credit and the acceptance by Borrower of the
proceeds of each such Loan made hereunder or the issuance of such Letter of
Credit hereunder shall constitute a representation and warranty by Borrower as
of the Funding Date in respect of such Loan or the date such Letter of Credit is
issued that all the conditions contained in this Section 4.02 have been
satisfied.

                                   ARTICLE V.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

                  5.01     Representations and Warranties as to Borrower.
Borrower hereby represents and warrants to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing
Lender and Lenders as follows:

                  (a)      Organization; Partnership Powers. Borrower (i) is a
limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation, (ii) is duly qualified to do
business as a foreign limited partnership and in good standing under the laws of
each jurisdiction in which the nature of its business requires it to be so
qualified, except for those jurisdictions where failure to so qualify and be in
good standing would not have a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) has all
requisite partnership power and authority to own, operate and encumber its
property and assets and to conduct its business as presently conducted and as
proposed to be conducted in connection with and following the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

                  (b)      Authority. Borrower has the requisite partnership
power and authority to execute, deliver and perform each of the Loan Documents
to which it is or will be a party. The execution, delivery and performance
thereof, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby, have
been duly approved by the general partner of Borrower, and no other partnership
proceedings or authorizations on the part of Borrower or its general or limited
partners are necessary to consummate such transactions. Each of the Loan
Documents to which Borrower is a party has been duly executed and delivered by
Borrower and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to

                                       42

<PAGE>

bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws affecting creditors' rights generally and
general equitable principles.

                  (c)      Ownership of Borrower. Schedule 5.01(c) sets forth
the general partners of Borrower and their respective ownership percentages as
of the date hereof. Except as set forth in the partnership agreement of
Borrower, no partnership interests (or any securities, instruments, warrants,
option or purchase rights, conversion or exchange rights, calls, commitments or
claims of any character convertible into or exercisable for partnership
interests) of Borrower are subject to issuance under any security, instrument,
warrant, option or purchase rights, conversion or exchange rights, call,
commitment or claim of any right, title or interest therein or thereto. To
Borrower's knowledge, all of the partnership interests in Borrower have been
issued in compliance with all applicable Requirements of Law.

                  (d)      No Conflict. The execution, delivery and performance
by Borrower of the Loan Documents to which it is or will be a party, and each of
the transactions contemplated thereby, do not and will not (i) conflict with or
violate Borrower's limited partnership agreement or Certificate of Limited
Partnership or other organizational documents, as the case may be, or the
organizational documents of any Subsidiary of Borrower or (ii) conflict with,
result in a breach of or constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) a default under any Requirement of Law, Contractual Obligation or Court
Order of or binding upon Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or require
termination of any such Contractual Obligation, the consequences of which
conflict or breach or default or termination would have a Material Adverse
Effect, or result in or require the creation or imposition of any Lien
whatsoever upon any Property (except as contemplated herein).

                  (e)      Consents and Authorizations. Borrower has obtained
all consents and authorizations required pursuant to its Contractual Obligations
with any other Person, the failure of which to obtain would have a Material
Adverse Effect, and has obtained all consents and authorizations of, and
effected all notices to and filings with, any Governmental Authority necessary
to allow Borrower to lawfully execute, deliver and perform its obligations under
the Loan Documents to which Borrower is a party.

                  (f)      Governmental Regulation. Borrower is not subject to
regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Federal
Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940 or
any other federal or state statute or regulation such that its ability to incur
indebtedness is limited or its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents is materially impaired.

                  (g)      Prior Financials. The Consolidated and Combined
Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2003, the Consolidated and Combined Statement
of Operations for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2003, and the Consolidated and
Combined Statement of Cash Flows for the Quarter Ended September 30, 2003 of the
REIT contained in the Form 10-Q Quarterly Report of the REIT as of September 30,
2003 (the "Pre-Closing Financials") delivered to Agent prior to the date hereof
were prepared in accordance with GAAP in effect on the date such Pre-Closing
Financials were prepared and fairly present the assets, liabilities and
financial condition of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, at such date and the
results of its operations and its cash flows, on a consolidated basis, for the
period then ended.

fairly present, or will fairly present, as applicable, the financial condition
of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, at the dates thereof (and, if applicable,
subject to normal year-end adjustments) and the results of its operations and
cash flows, on a consolidated basis, for the period then ended. Each of the

         Governmental Authority, pending, or to the best of Borrower's
         knowledge, threatened against Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or
         any of their respective Properties, in which there is a reasonable
         possibility of an adverse decision that could have a Material Adverse
         Effect; and

                  (ii)     Neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is (A)
         in violation of any Requirement of Law, which violation has a Material

filed by Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely filed, and all
taxes, assessments, fees and other governmental charges shown on such returns
have been paid when due and payable, except such taxes, if any, as are reserved
against in accordance with GAAP, such taxes as are being contested in good faith
by appropriate proceedings or such taxes, the failure to make payment of which

Borrower has no knowledge of any proposed tax assessment against Borrower or any

actively contested in good faith by such Person.

                  (l)      Material Adverse Agreements. Neither Borrower nor any

Contractual Obligation in each case, except where the consequences, direct or
indirect, of such default or defaults, if any, will not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (n)      Federal Reserve Regulations. No part of the proceeds
of the Loan hereunder will be used to purchase or carry any "margin security" as
defined in Regulation U or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any
indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry any margin
security or for any other purpose which might constitute this transaction a
"purpose credit" within the meaning of said Regulation U. Borrower is not
engaged primarily in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as defined in Regulation U. Borrower
is not engaged primarily in the business of extending credit for the purpose of
purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as defined in Regulation U. No part of
the proceeds of the Loans will be used for any purpose that violates, or which
is inconsistent with, the provisions of Regulation X or any other regulation of
the Federal Reserve Board.

                  (o)      Disclosure. Borrower has not intentionally or
knowingly withheld any material fact from Agent in regard to any matter raised
in the Loan Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any
projections of Borrower's future performance such representations and warranties
are made in good faith and to the best judgment of Borrower at the time such
projections were made.

                  (p)      Requirements of Law. To Borrower's knowledge,
Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance with all Requirements of
Law (including without limitation the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act, and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder, state securities law
and "Blue Sky" laws) applicable to them and their respective businesses, in each
case, where the failure to so comply will have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (q)      Patents, Trademarks, Permits, Etc. Borrower and each
of its Subsidiaries owns, is licensed or otherwise has the lawful right to use,
or has all permits and other governmental approvals, patents, trademarks, trade
names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes used in or necessary for
the conduct of Borrower's or such Subsidiary's business as currently conducted,
the absence of which would have a Material Adverse Effect. To Borrower's
knowledge, the use of such permits and other governmental approvals, patents,
trademarks, trade names, copyrights, technology, know-how and processes by
Borrower or such Subsidiary does not infringe on the rights of any Person,
subject to such claims and infringements as do not, in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (r)      Environmental Matters. To the knowledge of Borrower,
except as would not have a Material Adverse Effect and except as set forth on
Schedule 5.01(r), (i) the Property and operations of Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries comply in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
Laws; (ii) none of the Property or operations of Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries are subject to any Remedial Action or other Liabilities and Costs
arising from the Release or threatened Release of a Contaminant into the
environment or from the violation of any Environmental Laws, which Remedial
Action or other Liabilities and Costs would have a Material Adverse Effect;
(iii) neither Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has filed any notice under
applicable Environmental Laws reporting a Release of a Contaminant into the
environment in violation of any Environmental Laws, except as the same may have
been heretofore remedied; (iv) there is not now, nor to Borrower's knowledge has
there ever been, on or in the Property of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
(except in compliance in all material respects with all applicable Environmental
Laws): (A) any underground storage tanks, (B) any asbestos-containing material,
(C) any polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB's) used in hydraulic oils,

                                       45

<PAGE>

electrical transformers or other equipment, (D) any petroleum hydrocarbons or
(E) any chlorinated or halogenated solvents; and (v) neither Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim to the effect that it is or
may be liable to any Person as a result of the Release or threatened Release of
a Contaminant into the environment.

                  (s)      ERISA. None of the REIT, Borrower or any Agreement
Party is an "employee pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA,
an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Sections 4001(a)(3) or 3(37) of ERISA or a
"plan" as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. Except for
a prohibited transaction arising solely because of a Lender's breach of the
covenant set forth in Section 11.23, none of the Obligations, any of the Loan
Documents or the exercise of any of the Agent's or Lenders' rights in connection
therewith constitutes a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code (which is not exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA
and the taxes and penalties imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code
and Section 502(i) of ERISA) or otherwise results in a Lender, the Agent or the
Lenders being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or will by itself result in a Lender, Agent or
the Lenders being a fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a
"disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue
Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code. No assets of the REIT, Borrower or any Agreement Party
constitute "assets" (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 or any
successor regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code.

                  Each Borrower Plan is in compliance with ERISA and the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code in all respects except where
the failure to comply would not have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no
claims (other than claims for benefits in the normal course), actions or
lawsuits asserted or instituted against, and none of Borrower, the REIT, any of
the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has knowledge of any
threatened litigation or claims against the assets of any Borrower Plan or
against any fiduciary of such Borrower Plan with respect to the operation of
such Borrower Plan which could have a Material Adverse Effect. No liability to
the PBGC has been, or is likely to be, incurred by Borrower, the REIT, any of
the Subsidiaries or their ERISA Affiliates other than such liabilities which, in
the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect. None of Borrower, the
REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates is now
contributing to or has ever contributed to or been obligated to contribute to
any Multiemployer Plan, no employees or former employees of Borrower, the REIT,
any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates have been covered by
any Multiemployer Plan in respect of their employment by Borrower or such
Subsidiary or such ERISA Affiliate. None of Borrower, the REIT, any of the
Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue
Code or in a transaction subject to the prohibitions of Section 406 of ERISA, in
connection with any Benefit Plan or Welfare Plan which would subject Borrower,
the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates (after giving
effect to any exemption) to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code, Section 502 of ERISA or
any other liability under ERISA which tax, penalty or other liability would have
a Material Adverse Effect. None of the Benefit Plans subject to Title IV of
ERISA has any material Unfunded Pension Liability as to which Borrower,

                                       46

<PAGE>

the REIT, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their ERISA Affiliates is or may be
liable, which liability would have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (t)      Solvency. Borrower is and will be Solvent after
giving effect to the disbursements of the Loans and the payment and accrual of
all fees then payable hereunder.

                  (u)      Title to Assets; No Liens. Borrower has good,
indefeasible and merchantable title to the Property owned or leased by it, and
all such Property is free and clear of all Liens, except Permitted Liens and
Liens permitted by Section 8.01(b).

                  (v)      Use of Proceeds. Borrower's use of the proceeds of
the Loans are, and will continue to be, legal and proper uses (and to the extent
necessary, duly authorized by Borrower's partners) and such uses are consistent
with all applicable laws and statutes and Section 7.01(i).

                  (w)      Subsidiaries and Investment Affiliates. Each
Subsidiary and Investment Affiliate as of the date hereof is set forth on
Schedule 5.01(w). Schedule 5.01(w) sets forth the ownership of each such
Subsidiary and Investment Affiliate and the material Property owned by such
Person as of the date hereof.

                  (x)      Tax Shelter Representation. Neither Borrower, the
REIT nor any Affiliate of either of the foregoing intends to treat the Loans or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as
being a "reportable transaction" (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.6011-4). If Borrower, or any other party to the Loans determines to
take any action inconsistent with such intention, Borrower will promptly notify
Lenders thereof. If Borrower so notifies Lenders, Borrower acknowledges that
Lenders may treat the Loans as part of a transaction that is subject to Treasury
Regulation Section 301.6112-1, and Lenders will maintain the lists and other
records, including the identity of the applicable party to the Loans as required
by such Treasury Regulation.

obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject to

the consequences of which conflict or breach or default or termination will have
a Material Adverse Effect, or result in or require the creation or imposition of
any Lien whatsoever upon any of its Property, or (iii) require any approval of
the stockholders of the REIT.

                  (d)      Consents and Authorizations. The REIT has obtained

         investigation or arbitration, at law or in equity, or before or by any
         Governmental Authority, pending, or to best of the REIT's knowledge,
         threatened against the REIT, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
         respective Properties in which there is a reasonable possibility of an
         adverse decision that could have a Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (ii)     Neither the REIT nor any of its Subsidiaries is (A)

completed Fiscal Quarter (or, if such statement of income is unavailable, a pro
forma financial statement setting forth the Net Operating Income with respect to

the requirements set forth in the definition of "Qualifying Unencumbered
Properties" and the Agent fails to deliver written notice to Borrower stating
that the Requisite Lenders have disapproved the designation of such Property as
a Qualifying Unencumbered Property (it being understood that such notice shall
provide Borrower with information regarding why such designation was disapproved
by the Requisite Lenders and that the Requisite Lenders will not unreasonably
disapprove such designation) within twenty (20) days after receipt of such
information by Agent, such Property shall become a Qualifying Unencumbered

hereof, until payment in full of all of the Obligations, the expiration of the
Commitments and termination of this Agreement:

                  (a)      Existence. Borrower shall, and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to, at all times maintain its and their respective partnership,
limited liability company, trust or corporate existence, as applicable, and
preserve and keep in full force and effect its and their respective rights and
franchises unless the failure to maintain such rights and franchises does not
have a Material Adverse Effect. Borrower shall maintain its status as a limited
partnership.

                  (b)      Qualification. Borrower shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, qualify and remain qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its and their businesses require them to be
so qualified except for those jurisdictions where failure to so qualify does not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (c)      Compliance with Laws, Etc. Borrower shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) comply with all Requirements of Law and
Contractual Obligations, and all restrictive covenants affecting Borrower and
its Subsidiaries or their respective properties, performance, assets or
operations, and (ii) obtain as needed all Permits necessary for its and their
respective operations and maintain such in good standing, except in each of the
foregoing cases where the failure to do so will not have a Material Adverse
Effect or expose Agent or Lenders to any material liability therefor.

                  (d)      Payment of Taxes and Claims. (a) Borrower shall, and
shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, pay (i) all taxes, assessments and
other governmental charges imposed upon it or them or on any of its or their
respective properties or assets or in respect of any of its or their respective
franchises, business, income or property before any penalty or interest accrues
thereon, the failure to make payment of which in such time periods would have a
Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) all claims (including, without limitation,
claims for labor, services, materials and supplies) which have become due and
payable and which by law have or may become a Lien (other than a Permitted Lien)
upon any of its or their respective properties or

                                       54

<PAGE>

assets, prior to the time when any penalty or fine shall be incurred with
respect thereto, the failure to make payment of which would have a Material
Adverse Effect; provided, however, that no such taxes, assessments, and
governmental charges referred to in clause (i) above or claims referred to in
clause (ii) above need be paid if being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings promptly instituted and diligently conducted and if adequate
reserves shall have been set aside therefor in accordance with GAAP.

                  (e)      Maintenance of Properties; Insurance. Borrower shall,
and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in good repair, working
order and condition, excepting ordinary wear and tear, all of its and their
respective Property (personal and real) and will make or cause to be made all
appropriate repairs, renewals and replacements thereof, in each case where the
failure to so maintain, repair, renew or replace would have a Material Adverse
Effect. Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain
with insurance companies that have a Best Rating of "A- VII" or higher or other
insurance companies reasonably acceptable to Agent that have similar financial
resources and stability, which companies shall be qualified to do business in
the states where such Property is located, the insurance policies and programs
reasonably acceptable to Agent insuring all property and assets material to the
operations of Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries against loss or damage by
fire, theft, burglary, pilferage and loss in transit and business interruption,
together with such other hazards as is reasonably consistent with prudent
industry practice, and maintain liability insurance consistent with prudent
industry practice with financially sound insurance companies qualified to do
business in the states where such Property is located. The insurance policies
shall provide that they cannot be terminated or materially modified unless Agent
receives thirty (30) days prior written notice of said termination or
modification. At Agent's reasonable request, Borrower shall furnish evidence of
replacement costs, without cost to Agent, such as are regularly and ordinarily
made by insurance companies to determine the then replacement cost of the
improvements on any Property of Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. In the
event Borrower fails to cause insurance to be carried as aforesaid, Agent shall
have the right (but not the obligation), with the consent of Requisite Lenders,
to place and maintain insurance required to be maintained hereunder and treat
the amounts expended therefor as additional Obligations, payable on demand;
provided however, that Agent shall give Borrower five (5) days' prior notice of
Agent's intent to place or maintain such insurance during which time Borrower
shall have the opportunity to obtain such insurance. All of the insurance
policies required hereunder shall be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Agent. Agent hereby agrees that Borrower may use blanket
policies to satisfy the requirements of this Section 7.01(e), approves the
issuer, form and content of all insurance policies currently carried by Borrower
and agrees that such insurance satisfies the requirements of this Section
7.01(e). Furthermore, Agent agrees that it will not be unreasonable in
exercising any right hereunder to require Borrower to modify, alter or
supplement its insurance policies or coverage or in exercising any right it may
have hereunder to approve any changes Borrower may hereafter make with respect
to its insurance.

                  (f)      Inspection of Property; Books and Records. Borrower
shall permit and shall cause each of the REIT, each Subsidiary, and each

its properties including inspection of financial and accounting records and
leases, and to make copies and take extracts therefrom, all at such times during
normal business hours and as often as Agent may reasonably request. In
connection therewith, Borrower shall pay all reasonable expenses of the types
described in Section 12.01. Borrower shall keep,

                                       55

keep proper books of record and account in conformity with GAAP, as modified and
as otherwise required by this Agreement and applicable Requirements of Law.

                  (g)      Maintenance of Licenses, Permits, Etc. Borrower
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, maintain in full force and
effect all licenses, permits, governmental approvals, franchises, patents,
trademarks, trade names, copyrights, authorizations or other rights necessary
for the operation of their respective businesses, except where the failure to
obtain any of the foregoing would not have a Material Adverse Effect; and notify
Agent in writing, promptly after learning thereof, of the suspension,
cancellation, revocation or discontinuance of or of any pending or threatened
action or proceeding seeking to suspend, cancel, revoke or discontinue any such
material license, permit, patent, trademark, trade name, copyright, governmental
approval, franchise authorization or right, except where the suspension,
cancellation, revocation or discontinuance would not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (h)      Conduct of Business. Except for Permitted Holdings
and other investments permitted under Section 8.01(c), Borrower shall engage
only in the business of owning, operating, managing and developing manufactured
home communities, whether directly or through its Subsidiaries.

                  (i)      Use of Proceeds. Borrower shall use the proceeds of
each Loan only for general partnership purposes in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, no Swingline Loan shall be used more than once for

                  (j)      Further Assurance. Borrower shall take and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and each Agreement Party to take all such further actions
and execute all such further documents and instruments as Agent may at any time
reasonably determine to be necessary or advisable to (i) correct any technical
defect or technical error that may be discovered in any Loan Document or in the
execution, acknowledgment or recordation thereof, and (ii) cause the execution,
delivery and performance of the Loan Documents to be duly authorized.

contribution of any of Borrower's general partnership interests to Newco REIT,

Loan Obligations in substantially the same form as the REIT Guaranty, (b)
provide to Agent copies of Newco REIT's organizational documents, certified as
true, correct and complete, and good standing certificates, (c) provide Agent

requested by Agent and (d) provide Agent with such other certificates and
documentation relating to Newco REIT as Agent may reasonably request, including,

         all or substantially all of the business, property or assets of, or

                  (iv)     Terminate, or permit an ERISA Affiliate of the REIT,
         Borrower or any Subsidiary to terminate, any Benefit Plan which would

<PAGE>

         or a Subsidiary or an ERISA Affiliate of the REIT, Borrower or any

                  (v)      Fail, or permit any Subsidiary or ERISA Affiliate to
         fail to pay any required installment under section (m) of Section 412
         of the Internal Revenue Code or any other payment required under
         Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code on or before the due date for
         such installment or other payment, if such failure could result in the
         imposition of a Lien or otherwise would have a Material Adverse Effect;

         withdrawal (within the meaning of ERISA Section 4201) from any
         Multiemployer Plan so as to result in liability to Borrower, a
         Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate of the REIT, Borrower or any
         Subsidiary which would have a Material Adverse Effect; or

                  (viii)   Permit the total Unfunded Pension Liabilities (using
         the actuarial assumptions utilized by the PBGC) for all Benefit Plans
         (other than Benefit Plans which have no Unfunded Pension Liabilities)
         to have a Material Adverse Effect.

None of the REIT, Borrower nor any Agreement Party shall use any "assets"
(within the meaning of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code,
including but not limited to 29 C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 or any successor
regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the
Internal Revenue Code to repay or secure the Obligations if the use of such
assets may result in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code (which is not exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code and the taxes and penalties
imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 502(i) of
ERISA) or in a Lender, Agent or the Lenders being deemed in violation of Section
404 or 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise by
itself results in or will result in a Lender, Agent or the Lenders being a
fiduciary or party in interest under ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined
in Section 4975 (e) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code with respect to an
"employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan"
within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. Without
limitation of any other provision of this Agreement, none of the REIT, Borrower
or any Agreement Party shall assign, sell, pledge, encumber, transfer,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of their respective interests or rights (direct
or indirect) in any Loan Document, or attempt to do any of the foregoing or
suffer any of the foregoing, or permit any party with a direct or indirect
interest or right in any Loan Document to do any of the foregoing, nor shall the
REIT or Borrower assign, sell, pledge, encumber, transfer, hypothecate or
otherwise dispose of any of their respective rights or interests (direct or
indirect) in any Agreement Party, Borrower or the REIT, as applicable, or
attempt to do any of the foregoing or suffer any of the foregoing, if such
action would cause the Obligations, or the exercise of any of the Agent's or
Lenders' rights in connection therewith, to constitute a prohibited transaction
under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code (unless Borrower furnishes to Agent a
legal opinion reasonably satisfactory to Agent that the transaction is exempt
from the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and the Internal Revenue
Code (for this purpose, Agent and the Lenders agree to supply Borrower all
relevant

                                       61
<PAGE>

non-confidential factual information reasonably necessary to such legal
opinion and reasonably requested by Borrower)) or otherwise results in a Lender,
Agent or the Lenders being deemed in violation of Sections 404 or 406 of ERISA
or Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise by itself would result
in a Lender, Agent or the Lenders being a fiduciary or party in interest under
ERISA or a "disqualified person" as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the
Internal Revenue Code with respect to an "employee benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section
4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code.

                  (g)      Environmental Liabilities. Borrower shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, become subject to any Liabilities
and Costs which would have a Material Adverse Effect arising out of or related
to (i) the Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant into the
environment, or any Remedial Action in response thereto, or (ii) any violation
of any Environmental Laws. Notwithstanding the foregoing provision, Borrower and
its Subsidiaries shall have the right to contest in good faith any claim of
violation of an Environmental Law by appropriate legal proceedings and shall be
entitled to postpone compliance with the obligation being contested as long as
(i) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, (ii) Borrower
shall have given Agent prior written notice of the commencement of such contest,
(iii) noncompliance with such Environmental Law shall not subject Borrower or
such Subsidiary to any criminal penalty or subject Agent to pay any civil
penalty or to prosecution for a crime, and (iv) no portion of any Property
material to Borrower or its condition or prospects shall be in imminent danger
of being sold, forfeited or lost, by reason of such contest or the continued
existence of the matter being contested.

                  (h)      Amendment of Constituent Documents. Borrower shall
not permit any amendment of its limited partnership agreement, certificate of
limited partnership or by-laws, if any, which would materially and adversely
affect Agent or Lenders or their respective rights and remedies under the Loan
Documents.

                  (i)      Disposal of Interests. Borrower will not directly or
indirectly convey, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber or
dispose of any material portion of its partnership interests, stock or other
ownership interests in any Subsidiary or other Person in which it has an
interest unless Borrower has delivered to Agent a Compliance Certificate showing
on a pro forma basis (calculated in a manner reasonably acceptable to Agent)
that there would be no breach of any of the financial covenants contained in
Articles VIII and XI after giving effect to such conveyance, sale, transfer,
assignment, pledge, or other encumbrance or disposition.

                  (j)      Margin Regulations. No portion of the proceeds of any
credit extended under this Agreement shall be used in any manner which might
cause the extension of credit or the application of such proceeds to violate
Regulation U or Regulation X or any other regulation of the Federal Reserve
Board or to violate the Securities Exchange Act or the Securities Act, in each
case as in effect on the date or dates of Borrowings and such use of proceeds.

                  (k)      Transactions with Affiliates. Borrower shall not and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any transaction or
series of related transactions with any Affiliate of Borrower, other than
transactions in the ordinary course of business which are on terms and
conditions substantially as favorable to Borrower or such Subsidiary as would be
obtainable by Borrower or such Subsidiary in an arms-length transaction with a
Person other than an Affiliate.

share of the full budgeted cost thereof based upon its percentage of equity
ownership, or (B) Borrower's pro rata share of the full budgeted cost thereof
based upon Borrower's economic interest in the project (as determined by
Borrower in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Agent).

                                       68

Borrower, any Subsidiary, or any Agreement Party adopts any resolution or
otherwise authorizes any action to approve any of the foregoing.

(other than a money judgment covered by insurance but only if the insurer has
admitted liability with respect to such money judgment), writs or warrants of
attachment, or similar processes involving an aggregate amount in excess of
$5,000,000 shall be entered or filed against the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary,
or any Agreement Party or their respective assets and shall remain undischarged,

involuntary dissolution or split up and such order shall remain undischarged and

                  (k)      Loan Documents; Failure of Security or Subordination.

deny liability under such guaranty in writing.

                  (l)      ERISA Plan Assets. Any assets of Borrower, the REIT

(ii) the plan administrator of any Benefit Plan applies for approval under
Section 412(d) of the Internal Revenue Code for a waiver of the minimum funding

request was based

                                       69
<PAGE>

will or would reasonably be anticipated to subject Borrower, the REIT, any
Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them
to a liability which Agent reasonably determines will have a Material Adverse
Effect; (iii) any Benefit Plan shall incur an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(as defined in Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 302 of ERISA)
for which a waiver shall not have been obtained in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or ERISA which "accumulated

the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or
any of them to a liability which the Agent reasonably determines will have a
Material Adverse Effect; (iv) Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement
Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them shall have engaged in a

or Section 406 of ERISA which will or would reasonably be anticipated to result

liability on Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any
ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them which the Agent reasonably determines
will have a Material Adverse Effect; (vi) a condition shall exist by reason of
which the PBGC would be entitled to obtain a decree adjudicating that a Benefit
Plan must be terminated or have a trustee appointed to administer such Plan

imposition of a liability on Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement
Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them which the Agent reasonably
determines will have a Material Adverse Effect; (vii) a Lien shall be imposed on
any assets of Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any

Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate
thereof or any of them shall suffer a partial or complete withdrawal from a
Multiemployer Plan or shall be in "default" (as defined in Section 4219(c)(5) of
ERISA) with respect to payments to a Multiemployer Plan resulting from a
complete or partial withdrawal (as described in Section 4203 or 4205 of ERISA)

result in the imposition of a liability on Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary,
any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate thereof or any of them which the
Agent reasonably determines will have a Material Adverse Effect; or (ix) a
proceeding shall be instituted by a fiduciary of any Multiemployer Plan against

reasonably be anticipated to result in the imposition of a liability on
Borrower, the REIT, any Subsidiary, any Agreement Party, or any ERISA Affiliate
thereof or any of them which the Agent reasonably determines will have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                  (o)      Solvency. Borrower, any Agreement Party or the REIT

                  An Event of Default shall be deemed "continuing" until cured
or waived in writing in accordance with Section 12.05.

                  10.02    Rights and Remedies.

                  (a)      Acceleration. Upon the occurrence of any Event of
Default with respect to Borrower described in the foregoing Section 10.01(g) or
10.01(h), the Commitments (including the obligations of Swingline Lender and
Issuing Lender) shall automatically and immediately terminate and the unpaid
principal amount of and any and all accrued interest on the Loans and all of the
other Obligations shall automatically become immediately due and payable, with
all additional interest from time to time accrued thereon and without
presentment, demand or protest or other requirements of any kind (including
without limitation valuation and appraisement, diligence, presentment, notice of
intent to demand or accelerate or notice of acceleration), all of which are
hereby expressly waived by Borrower, and the obligations of Lenders to make any
Loans hereunder shall thereupon terminate; and upon the occurrence and during
the continuance of any other Event of Default, Agent shall, at the request of,
or may, with the consent of, Requisite Lenders, by written notice to Borrower,
(i) declare that the Commitments (including the obligations of Swingline Lender
and Issuing Lender) are terminated, whereupon the Commitments and the obligation
of Lenders to make any Loans hereunder shall immediately terminate, and/or (ii)
declare the unpaid principal amount of and any and all accrued and unpaid
interest on the Loans and all of the other Obligations to be, and the same shall
thereupon be, immediately due and payable with all additional interest from time
to time accrued thereon and without presentment, demand, or protest or other
requirements of any kind (including without limitation, valuation and
appraisement, diligence, presentment, notice of intent to demand or accelerate
and of acceleration), all of which are hereby expressly waived by Borrower. Upon
the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default, no
Agreement Party shall be permitted to make any distributions or dividends
without the prior written consent of Agent. Upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default or an acceleration of the Obligations, Agent and Lenders may exercise
all or any portion of the rights and remedies set forth in the Loan Documents.

                  (b)      Access to Information. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in the Loan Documents, upon the occurrence of and during
the continuance of an Event of Default, Agent shall be entitled to request and
receive, by or through Borrower or appropriate legal process, any and all
information concerning the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary of Borrower, any
Investment Affiliate, any Agreement Party, or any property of any of them, which
is reasonably available to or obtainable by Borrower.

                  (c)      Waiver of Demand. Demand, presentment, protest and
notice of nonpayment are hereby waived by Borrower.

                  (d)      Waivers, Amendments and Remedies. No delay or
omission of Agent or Lenders to exercise any right under any Loan Document shall
impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of any Event of Default or an
acquiescence therein, and any single or partial exercise of any such right shall
not preclude other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, and no waiver, amendment or other variation of the terms, conditions or
provisions of the Loan Documents whatsoever shall be valid unless in a writing
signed by Agent after obtaining written approval thereof or the signature
thereon of those Lenders required to

                                       71
<PAGE>




approve such waiver, amendment or other variation, and then only to the extent
in such writing specifically set forth. All remedies contained in the Loan
Documents or by law afforded shall be cumulative and all shall be available to
Agent and Lenders until the Obligations have been paid in full, the Commitments
have expired or terminated and this Agreement has been terminated.

                  10.03    Rescission. If at any time after acceleration of the
maturity of the Loans, Borrower shall pay all arrears of interest and all
payments on account of principal of the Loans which shall have become due
otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on principal and, to the extent
permitted by law, on overdue interest, at the rates specified in this Agreement)
and all Events of Default and Unmatured Events of Default (other than nonpayment
of principal of and accrued interest on the Loans due and payable solely by
virtue of acceleration) shall be remedied or waived pursuant to Section 12.05,
then by written notice to Borrower, Requisite Lenders may elect, in the sole
discretion of Requisite Lenders to rescind and annul the acceleration and its
consequences; but such action shall not affect any subsequent Event of Default
or Unmatured Event of Default or impair any right or remedy in connection
therewith. The provisions of the preceding sentence are intended merely to bind
Lenders to a decision which may be made at the election of Requisite Lenders;
they are not intended to benefit Borrower and do not give Borrower the right to
require Lenders to rescind or annul any acceleration hereunder, even if the
conditions set forth herein are met.

                  10.04    Suspension of Lending. At any time during which an
Unmatured Event of Default exists pursuant to Section 10.01(c) or Section
10.01(d) and is not cured (by improvement in the applicable financial measure by
compliance with the applicable financial covenant in such 40-day period or as
provided in Section 10.01(d)), Borrower shall have no right to receive any
additional Loans.

                                  ARTICLE XI.
                               AGENCY PROVISIONS

                  11.01    Appointment

                  (a)      Each Lender hereby designates and appoints Wells
Fargo as Agent of such Lender under this Agreement and the Loan Documents, and
each Lender hereby irrevocably authorizes Agent to take such action on its
behalf under the provisions of this Agreement and the Loan Documents and to
exercise such powers as are set forth herein or therein, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Agent agrees to act as such
on the express conditions contained in this Article XI.

                  (b)      The provisions of this Article XI are solely for the
benefit of Agent and Lenders, and Borrower shall not have any rights to rely on
or enforce any of the provisions hereof. In performing its functions and duties
under this Agreement, Agent shall act solely as Agent of Lenders and does not
assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or
relationship of agency or trust with or for Borrower.

                  11.02    Nature of Duties. Agent shall not have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this Agreement or in the
Loan Documents. The duties of Agent shall be administrative in nature. Subject
to the provisions of Sections 11.05 and 11.07, Agent shall administer the Loans
in the same manner as it administers its own loans. Agent shall

                                       72
<PAGE>

not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any
Lender. Nothing in this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents, expressed or
implied, is intended or shall be construed to impose upon Agent any obligation
in respect of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents except as expressly
set forth herein or therein. Each Lender shall make its own independent
investigation of the financial condition and affairs of the REIT, Borrower, the
Subsidiaries, the Investment Affiliates, and each Agreement Party in connection
with the making and the continuance of the Loans hereunder and shall make its
own assessment of the creditworthiness of the REIT, Borrower, the Subsidiaries,
the Investment Affiliates, and each Agreement Party, and, except as specifically
provided herein, Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility, either
initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or
other information with respect thereto, whether coming into its possession
before the Closing Date or at any time or times thereafter.

                  11.03    Loan Disbursements

                  (a)      Promptly after receipt of a Notice of Borrowing for a
Loan to be made pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, but in no event later than one
(1) Business Day prior to the proposed Funding Date for a Base Rate Loan or two
(2) Business Days prior to the proposed Funding Date for a LIBOR Loan, Agent
shall notify each Lender of the proposed Borrowing and the Funding Date set
forth therein. Each Lender shall make available to Agent (or the funding bank or
entity designated by Agent), the amount of such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
Borrowing in immediately available funds not later than the times designated in
Section 11.03(b). Unless Agent shall have been notified by any Lender prior to
such time for funding in respect of any Borrowing that such Lender does not
intend to make available to Agent such Lender's Pro Rata Share of such
Borrowing, Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to
Agent and Agent, in its sole discretion, may, but shall not be obligated to,
make available to Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount
is not in fact made available to Agent by such Lender on or prior to a Funding
Date, such Lender agrees to pay to Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to Borrower until the date such amount is paid or repaid to
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay to Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so paid shall constitute such Lender's Pro
Rata Share of such Borrowing. If such Lender shall not pay to Agent such
corresponding amount after reasonable attempts are made by Agent to collect such
amounts from such Lender, Borrower agrees to repay to Agent forthwith on demand
such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the
date such amount is made available to Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to Agent, at the interest rate applicable thereto.

                  (b)      Requests by Agent for funding by Lenders of Loans
will be made by telecopy. Each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan
available to Agent in Dollars and in immediately available funds, to such bank
and account, in El Segundo, California as Agent may designate, not later than
10:00 A.M. (California time) on the Funding Date designated in the Notice of
Borrowing with respect to such Loan. Nothing in this Section 11.03(b) shall be
deemed to relieve any Lender of its obligation hereunder to make its Pro Rata
Share of Loans on any Funding Date, nor shall any Lender be responsible for the
failure of any other Lender to perform its obligations to make any Loan
hereunder, and the Commitment of any Lender shall not be increased or decreased
as a result of the failure by any other Lender to perform its obligation to make
a Loan.

                  11.04    Distribution and Apportionment of Payments

                  (a)      Subject to Section 11.04(b), payments actually
received by Agent for the account of Lenders shall be paid to them promptly
after receipt thereof by Agent, but in any event prior to 3:00 P.M. (California
time) on the day of receipt (if received by 11:00 A.M. (California time) on such
day), or within one (1) Business Day thereafter (if received after 11:00 A.M.
(California time) on the day of receipt), provided that Agent shall pay to such
Lenders interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate from the Business Day on
which such funds are required to be paid to Lenders by Agent until such funds
are actually paid in immediately available funds to such Lenders. All payments
of principal and interest in respect of outstanding Loans (other than Swingline
Loans), all payments of the fees described in this Agreement (other than agency
and arrangement fees described in Section 2.04(c)), and all payments in respect
of any other Obligations shall be allocated among such of Lenders as are
entitled thereto, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares or otherwise
as provided herein. Agent shall promptly, but in any event within two (2)
Business Days (with interest thereon, if required pursuant to this Section
11.04(a)), distribute to each Lender at its primary address set forth on the
appropriate counterpart signature page hereof or on the Assignment and
Assumption, or at such other address as a Lender may request in writing, such
funds as it may be entitled to receive, provided that Agent shall in any event
not be bound to inquire into or determine the validity, scope or priority of any
interest or entitlement of any Lender and may suspend all payments and seek
appropriate relief (including without limitation instructions from Requisite
Lenders, or all Lenders, as applicable, or an action in the nature of
interpleader) in the event of any doubt or dispute as to any apportionment or
distribution contemplated hereby. The order of priority herein is set forth
solely to determine the rights and priorities of Lenders as among themselves and
may at any time or from time to time be changed by Lenders as they may elect, in
writing in accordance with Section 12.05, without necessity of notice to or
consent of or approval by Borrower or any other Person.

                  (b)      Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the contrary,
until such time as a Defaulting Lender has funded its Pro Rata Share of a Loan
(other than a Swingline Loan but including a Mandatory Borrowing) or draw on a
Letter of Credit which was previously a Non Pro Rata Loan, or all other Lenders
have received payment in full (whether by repayment or prepayment) of the
principal and interest due in respect of such Non Pro Rata Loan, all of the
Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender hereunder shall be subordinated in
right of payment, as provided in the following sentence, to the prior payment in
full of all principal, interest and fees in respect of all Non Pro Rata Loans in
which the Defaulting Lender has not funded its Pro Rata Share (such principal,
interest and fees being referred to as "Senior Loans"). All amounts paid by
Borrower and otherwise due to be applied to the Obligations owing to the
Defaulting Lender pursuant to the terms hereof shall be distributed by Agent to
the other Lenders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares
(recalculated for purposes hereof to exclude the Defaulting Lender's
Commitment), until all Senior Loans have been paid in full. This provision
governs only the relationship among Agent, each Defaulting Lender, and the other
Lenders; nothing hereunder shall limit the obligation of Borrower to repay all
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. The provisions of this
section shall apply and be effective regardless of whether an Event of Default
occurs and is then continuing, and notwithstanding (i) any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, (ii) any instruction of Borrower as to its
desired application of payments or (iii) the suspension of such Defaulting
Lender's right to vote on matters which are subject to the consent or approval
of Requisite

                                       74
<PAGE>

Lenders, Supermajority Lenders, or all Lenders. No Unused Facility Fee shall
accrue in favor of, or be payable to, such Defaulting Lender from the date of
any failure to fund Loans (other than Swingline Loans but including Loans made
pursuant to Mandatory Borrowings) or draws on Letters of Credit or reimburse
Agent for any Liabilities and Costs as herein provided until such failure has
been cured and, without limitation of other provisions set forth in this
Agreement, Agent shall be entitled to (i) collect interest from such Lender for
the period from the date on which the payment was due until the date on which
the payment is made at the Federal Funds Rate for each day during such period,
(ii) withhold or set off, and to apply to the payment of the defaulted amount
and any related interest, any amounts to be paid to such Defaulting Lender under
this Agreement, and (iii) bring an action or suit against such Defaulting Lender
in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the defaulted amount and any
related interest. In addition, the Defaulting Lender shall indemnify, defend and
hold Agent and each of the other Lenders harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities and Costs plus interest thereon at the default rate set forth in the
Loan Documents for funds advanced by Agent or any other Lender on account of the
Defaulting Lender which they may sustain or incur by reason of or as a direct
consequence of the Defaulting Lender's failure or refusal to abide by its
obligations under this Agreement.

                  11.05    Rights, Exculpation, Etc. Neither Agent, any
Affiliate of Agent, nor any of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, attorneys or consultants, shall be liable to any Lender for any action
taken or omitted by them hereunder or under any of the Loan Documents, or in
connection herewith or therewith, except that Agent shall be liable for its
gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its express
obligations hereunder. In the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct,
Agent shall not be liable for any apportionment or distribution of payments made
by it in good faith pursuant to Section 11.04. Agent shall not be responsible to
any Lender for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties herein or
for the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability,
collectibility or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any of the other Loan
Documents, or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; or for
the financial condition of the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment
Affiliate, or any Agreement Party. Agent shall not be required to make any
inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms,
provisions or conditions of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents or the
financial condition of the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment
Affiliate, or any Agreement Party, or the existence or possible existence of any
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default. Agent may at any time request
instructions from Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which, by the
terms of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents, Agent is permitted or
required to take or to grant without instructions from any Lenders, and if such
instructions are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to
refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be
under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from taking any
action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it
shall have received such instructions from Requisite Lenders or Supermajority
Lenders, as the case may be. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall
have any right of action whatsoever against Agent as a result of Agent acting or
refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
in accordance with the instructions of Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders
or, where applicable, all Lenders. Agent shall promptly notify each Lender at
any time that the Requisite Lenders or Supermajority Lenders, as the case may
be, have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting pursuant hereto.

                                       75
<PAGE>

                  11.06    Reliance. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any
written notices, statements, certificates, orders or other documents, telecopies
or any telephone message believed by it in good faith to be genuine and correct
and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person, and with respect to
all matters pertaining to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and its
duties hereunder or thereunder, upon advice of legal counsel (including counsel
for Borrower), independent public accountant and other experts selected by it.

                  11.07    Indemnification. To the extent that Agent or Issuing
Lender is not reimbursed and indemnified by Borrower, Lenders will reimburse,
within ten (10) days after notice from Agent, and indemnify Agent and Issuing
Lender for and against any and all Liabilities and Costs which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against it (in its capacity as Agent or Issuing
Lender) in any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents or any action taken or omitted by Agent or Issuing Lender
(in its capacity as Agent or Issuing Lender) under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, in proportion to each Lender's Pro Rata Share, provided
that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such Liabilities and Costs
resulting from Agent's or Issuing Lender's gross negligence or willful
misconduct, bad faith or fraud. The obligations of Lenders under this Section
11.07 shall survive the payment in full of all Obligations and the termination
of this Agreement. In the event that after payment and distribution of any
amount by Agent to Lenders, any Lender or third party, including Borrower, any
creditor of Borrower or a trustee in bankruptcy, recovers from Agent any amount
found to have been wrongfully paid to Agent or disbursed by Agent to Lenders,
then Lenders, in proportion to their respective Pro Rata Shares, shall reimburse
Agent for all such amounts. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Agent shall not be
obligated to advance Liabilities and Costs and may require the deposit by each
Lender of its Pro Rata Share of any material Liabilities and Costs anticipated
by Agent before they are incurred or made payable.

                  11.08    Agent Individually. With respect to its Pro Rata
Share of the Commitments hereunder and the Loans made by it, Agent shall have
and may exercise the same rights and powers hereunder and is subject to the same
obligations and liabilities as and to the extent set forth herein for any other
Lender. The terms "Lenders", "Requisite Lenders", "Supermajority Lenders", or
any similar terms may include Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender, one
of the Requisite Lenders or one of the Supermajority Lenders, but Requisite
Lenders and Supermajority Lenders shall not include Agent solely in its capacity
as Agent. Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and
generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other business with Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates as if it were not acting as Agent
pursuant hereto.

                  11.09    Successor Agent; Resignation of Agent; Removal of
Agent

                  (a)      Agent may resign from the performance of all its
functions and duties hereunder at any time by giving at least thirty (30)
Business Days prior written notice to Lenders and Borrower. For good cause, by a
determination of all the Lenders (excluding for such determination the Agent in
its capacity as a Lender), the Agent may be removed at any time by giving at
least thirty (30) Business Days prior written notice to Agent and Borrower. Such
resignation or removal shall take effect upon the acceptance by a successor
Agent of appointment pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise
provided below.

                                       76
<PAGE>

                  (b)      Upon any such notice of resignation by or removal of
Agent, Requisite Lenders shall appoint a successor Agent with the consent of
Borrower, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and approval from
Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
an Event of Default). Any successor Agent must be a bank (i) the senior debt
obligations of which (or such Bank's parent's senior debt obligations) are rated
not less than Baa-1 by Moody's Inc. or a comparable rating by a rating agency
acceptable to Requisite Lenders, (ii) which has total assets in excess of Ten
Billion Dollars ($10,000,000,000) and (iii) which is a Lender as of the date of
such succession holding a Commitment without participants equal to at least ten
percent (10%) of the Facility. Agent hereby agrees to remit to any successor
Agent, a pro rata portion of any annual agent's fee received by Agent, in
advance, for the one-year period covered by such agent's fee based upon the
portion of such year then remaining.

                  (c)      If a successor Agent shall not have been so appointed
within said thirty (30) Business Day period, the retiring or removed Agent, with
the consent of Borrower, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and
which approval from Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default), shall then appoint a successor
Agent who shall meet the requirements described in subsection (b) above and who
shall serve as Agent until such time, if any, as Requisite Lenders, with the
consent of Borrower, which may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and
which approval from Borrower shall not be required upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default), appoint a successor Agent as
provided above.

                  (d)      Any Person succeeding Wells Fargo (or any successor
to Wells Fargo) as Agent hereunder shall also serve as Issuing Lender and
Swingline Lender; provided, however, that the issuer of any Letter of Credit
outstanding at the time of such succession shall retain all of the rights and
protections of Issuing Lender hereunder with respect to such Letter of Credit.

                  11.10    Consents and Approvals

                  (a)      Each Lender authorizes and directs Agent to enter
into the Loan Documents other than this Agreement for the benefit of Lenders.
Each Lender agrees that any action taken by Agent at the direction or with the
consent of Requisite Lenders or the Supermajority Lenders and any action taken
by Agent not requiring consent by Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders, or
all Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan
Document, and the exercise by Agent at the direction or with the consent of
Requisite Lenders or the Supermajority Lenders of the powers set forth herein or
therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto,
shall be authorized and binding upon all Lenders, except for actions
specifically requiring the approval of all Lenders. All communications from
Agent to Lenders requesting Lenders' determination, consent, approval or
disapproval (i) shall be given in the form of a written notice to each Lender,
(ii) shall be accompanied by a description of the matter or item as to which
such determination, approval, consent or disapproval is requested, or shall
advise each Lender where such matter or item may be inspected, or shall
otherwise describe the matter or issue to be resolved, (iii) shall include, if
reasonably requested by a Lender and to the extent not previously provided to
such Lender, written materials and a summary of all oral information provided to
Agent by Borrower in respect of the matter or issue to be resolved, and (iv)
shall include Agent's recommended course of action or determination in respect
thereof. Each Lender shall reply promptly, but in any event

                                       77
<PAGE>

within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of the request therefor from
Agent (the "Lender Reply Period"). Unless a Lender shall give written notice to
Agent that it objects to the recommendation or determination of Agent (together
with a written explanation of the reasons behind such objection) within the
Lender Reply Period, such Lender shall be deemed to have approved of or
consented to such recommendation or determination. With respect to decisions
requiring the approval of Requisite Lenders, Supermajority Lenders or all
Lenders, Agent shall submit its recommendation or determination for approval of
or consent to such recommendation or determination to all Lenders and upon
receiving the required approval or consent shall follow the course of action or
determination recommended to Lenders by Agent or such other course of action
recommended by Requisite Lenders or Supermajority Lenders, as the case may be,
and each non-responding Lender shall be deemed to have concurred with such
recommended course of action. The following amendments, modifications or waivers
shall require the consent of the Requisite Lenders:

                  (i)      Waiver of Sections 8.01(h) or 8.02(f);

                  (ii)     Acceleration following an Event of Default pursuant
         to Section 10.02(a) (except for any Event of Default pursuant to
         Sections 10.01(g) or 10.01(h)) or rescission of such acceleration
         pursuant to Section 10.03;

                  (iii)    Approval of the exercise of remedies requiring the
         consent of the Requisite Lenders under Section 10.02(a);

                  (iv)     Appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with
         Sections 11.09(b) and (c);

                  (v)      Disapproval of any Property as a Qualifying
         Unencumbered Property.

                  (b)      Except for amendments, modifications and waivers
requiring the consent of all Lenders pursuant to Section 12.05(b) hereof, the
consent of the Supermajority Lenders shall be required to amend or modify
Sections 9.01, 9.02, 9.03, 9.04, 9.05 or 10.01(a) or to waive any requirement
thereof or to amend or modify this Section 11.10(b).

                  (c)      In addition to the required consents or approvals
referred to in Section 12.05, Agent may at any time request instructions from
Requisite Lenders with respect to any actions or approvals which, by the terms
of this Agreement or of any of the Loan Documents, Agent is permitted or
required to take or to grant without instructions from any Lenders, and if such
instructions are promptly requested, Agent shall be absolutely entitled to
refrain from taking any action or to withhold any approval and shall not be
under any liability whatsoever to any Person for refraining from taking any
action or withholding any approval under any of the Loan Documents until it
shall have received such instructions from Requisite Lenders. Without limiting
the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against Agent
as a result of Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement, any
of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of Requisite
Lenders or, where applicable, Supermajority Lenders or all Lenders. Agent shall
promptly notify each Lender at any time that the Requisite Lenders or
Supermajority Lenders have instructed Agent to act or refrain from acting
pursuant hereto.

                  11.11    [Intentionally Omitted]

                  11.12    [Intentionally Omitted]

                  11.13    Assignments and Participations

                  (a)      Subject to the provisions of Section 11.13(j), after
first obtaining the approval of Agent and Borrower, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld (and which approval from Borrower shall not be required
upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), each
Lender may assign to one or more Eligible Assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of
this Section (including without limitation all or a portion of its Commitment
and the Loans owing to it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment
shall be of a constant, and not a varying, percentage of the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the assignment shall cover the
same percentage of such Lender's Commitment and Loans, (ii) unless Agent and
Borrower otherwise consent (which consent of Borrower shall not be required upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default), the aggregate
amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender being assigned to an Eligible
Assignee that is not already a Lender hereunder (provided such Lender was also a
Lender on the Closing Date) pursuant to each such assignment shall in no event
be less than Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) and shall be an integral multiple
of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), (iii) the parties to each such assignment
shall execute and deliver to Agent, for its approval and acceptance, an
Assignment and Assumption and (iv) Agent shall receive from the assignor or
assignors for its sole account a processing fee of Three Thousand Dollars
($3,000). Upon such execution, delivery, approval and acceptance, and upon the
effective date specified in the applicable Assignment and Assumption, (A) the
assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that rights and
obligations hereunder have been validly and effectively assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (B) the Lender-assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been validly and effectively assigned by
it pursuant to such Assignment and Assumption, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under this Agreement.

                  (b)      By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Assumption, the Lender-assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm
to and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other
than as provided in such Assignment and Assumption, such assigning Lender makes
no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document or the execution, legality, validity,
enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto;
(ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to the financial condition of the REIT, Borrower,
any Subsidiary, any Investment Affiliate, or any Agreement Party or the
performance or observance by the REIT, Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment
Affiliate, or any Agreement Party of any of their respective obligations under
any Loan Document or any other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto;
(iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement,
together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Article VI or
delivered pursuant to Article VI to the date of such assignment and such other
Loan Documents and other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate
to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such Assignment and
Assumption; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without reliance upon
Agent, such

                                       79
<PAGE>

assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on such documents and information
as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit
decisions in taking or not taking action under this Agreement; (v) such assignee
appoints and authorizes Agent to take such action as Agent on its behalf and to
exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are
delegated to Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees that it will
perform in accordance with their terms all of the obligations which by the terms
of this Agreement are required to be performed by it as a Lender.

                  (c)      Agent shall maintain at its address referred to on
the counterpart signature pages hereof a copy of each Assignment and Assumption
delivered to and accepted by it and shall record the names and addresses of each
Lender and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, such
Lender from time to time. Borrower, Agent and Lenders may treat each Person
whose name is so recorded as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement.

                  (d)      Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Assumption
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, Agent shall, if such Assignment
and Assumption has been properly completed and is in substantially the form of
Exhibit A, (i) accept such Assignment and Assumption, (ii) record the
information contained therein and (iii) give prompt notice thereof to Borrower.
Upon request, Borrower will execute and deliver to Agent an appropriate
replacement promissory note or replacement promissory notes in favor of each
assignee (and assignor, if such assignor is retaining a portion of its
Commitment and Loans) reflecting such assignee's (and assignor's) Pro Rata
Share(s) of the Facility. Upon execution and delivery of such replacement
promissory notes, the original promissory note or notes evidencing all or a
portion of the Commitments and Loans being assigned shall be canceled and
returned to Borrower.

                  (e)      Each Lender may sell participations to one or more
banks, finance companies, insurance or other entities in or to all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including without limitation
all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it); provided,
however, that (i) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement (including
without limitation its Commitment to Borrower hereunder) shall remain unchanged,
(ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for
the performance of such obligations, (iii) Borrower, Agent and the other Lenders
shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with
such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement and with regard to any
and all payments to be made under this Agreement and (iv) the holder of any such
participation shall not be entitled to voting rights under this Agreement except
that such Participant may have the contractual right in the applicable
participation agreement to prevent (A) increases in the Facility, (B) extensions
of the Maturity Date (except pursuant to Article III hereof), (C) decreases in
the interest rates described in this Agreement, and (D) a release of the REIT
Guaranty.

                  (f)      Borrower will use reasonable efforts to cooperate
with Agent and Lenders in connection with the assignment of interests under this
Agreement or the sale of participations herein.

                  (g)      Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, and without the need to comply with any of the formal or
procedural requirements of this Agreement,

                                       80
<PAGE>

including Section 11.13, any Lender may at any time and from time to time pledge
and assign all or any portion of its rights under all or any of the Loan
Documents to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment
shall release such Lender from its obligations thereunder. To facilitate any
such pledge or assignment, Agent shall, at the request of such Lender, enter
into a letter agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank in, or substantially in,
the form of the exhibit to Appendix C to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
Operating Circular No 12.

                  (h)      Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Lender may assign all or any portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement to a Lender Affiliate of such Lender without
first obtaining the approval of Agent and Borrower, provided that (i) at the
time of such assignment such Lender is not a Defaulting Lender, (ii) such Lender
gives Agent and Borrower at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice of any
such assignment; (iii) the parties to each such assignment execute and deliver
to Agent an Assignment and Assumption, and (iv) Agent receives from assignor for
its sole account a processing fee of Three Thousand Dollars ($3,000).

                  (i)      No Lender shall be permitted to assign, or sell a
participation interest in, all or any portion of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement to Borrower or any Affiliate of Borrower.

                  (j)      Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, no Lender shall be permitted to enter into an assignment of its
rights and obligations hereunder which would result in such Lender holding a
Commitment of less than Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000). In the event Agent
ceases to hold a Commitment of less than ten percent (10%) of the Facility,
Agent shall resign from the performance of all of its functions and duties
hereunder; provided, however, that no such resignation shall be required during
the continuance of an Event of Default.

                  11.14    Ratable Sharing. Subject to Sections 11.03 and 11.04,
Lenders agree among themselves that (i) with respect to all amounts received by
them which are applicable to the payment of the Obligations, equitable
adjustment will be made so that, in effect, all such amounts will be shared
among them ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, whether received by
voluntary payment, by the exercise of the right of set-off or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action or by the enforcement of any or all of the
Obligations, (ii) if any of them shall by voluntary payment or by the exercise
of any right of counterclaim, set-off, banker's lien or otherwise, receive
payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of the Obligations held by it
which is greater than its Pro Rata Share of the payments on account of the
Obligations, the one receiving such excess payment shall purchase, without
recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and participation (which it shall be
deemed to have done simultaneously upon the receipt of such payment) in such
Obligations owed to the others so that all such recoveries with respect to such
Obligations shall be applied ratably in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares;
provided, that if all or part of such excess payment received by the purchasing
party is thereafter recovered from it, those purchases shall be rescinded and
the purchase prices paid for such participations shall be returned to that party
to the extent necessary to adjust for such recovery, but without interest except
to the extent the purchasing party is required to pay interest in connection
with such recovery. Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing a
participation from another Lender pursuant to this Section 11.14 may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law,

                                       81
<PAGE>

exercise all its rights of payment (including, subject to Section 12.04, the
right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender
were the direct creditor of Borrower in the amount of such participation.

                  11.15    Delivery of Documents. Agent shall as soon as
reasonably practicable distribute to each Lender at its primary address set
forth on the appropriate counterpart signature page hereof or at such other
address as a Lender may request in writing, (i) all documents to which such
Lender is a party or of which such Lender is a beneficiary and (ii) all
documents of which Agent receives copies from Borrower for distribution to
Lenders pursuant to Sections 6.01 and 12.07. In addition, within ten (10)
Business Days after receipt of a request in writing from a Lender for written
information or documents provided by or prepared by Borrower, the REIT or any
Agreement Party, Agent shall deliver such written information or documents to
such requesting Lender if Agent has possession of such written information or
documents in its capacity as Agent or as a Lender.

                  11.16    Notice of Events of Default. Except as expressly
provided in this Section 11.16, Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of any Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default
(other than nonpayment of principal of or interest on the Loans) unless Agent
has received notice in writing from a Lender or Borrower referring to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, describing such event or condition and
expressly stating that such notice is a notice of an Unmatured Event of Default
or Event of Default. Should Agent receive such notice of the occurrence of an
Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default, or should Agent send Borrower a
notice of Unmatured Event of Default or Event of Default, Agent shall promptly
give notice thereof to each Lender.

                                  ARTICLE XII.
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

                  12.01    Expenses

                  (a)      Generally. Borrower agrees, within thirty (30) days
after receipt of a written notice from the Agent, to pay or reimburse Agent for
all of Agent's reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Agent at any time
(whether prior to, on or after the date of this Agreement) in connection with:
(A) the negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents and any amendments or waivers with respect hereto requested by
Borrower, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, expenses and
disbursements of Agent's outside counsel incurred in connection therewith; (B)
the making of the Loans and (C) the collection or enforcement by Agent of any of
the Obligations, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
costs incurred in connection therewith.

                  (b)      After Event of Default. Borrower further agrees to
pay, or reimburse Agent and Lenders, for all reasonable costs and expenses,
including without limitation reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements
incurred by Agent or Lenders after the occurrence of an Event of Default (i) in
enforcing any Obligation or exercising or enforcing any other right or remedy
available by reason of such Event of Default; (ii) in connection with any
refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this
Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or in any insolvency or bankruptcy
proceeding; (iii) in commencing, defending or intervening in any litigation or
in filing a petition, complaint, answer, motion or other pleadings

<PAGE>

in any legal proceeding relating to Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party
and related to or arising out of the transactions contemplated hereby; (iv) in
taking any other action in or with respect to any suit or proceeding (whether in
bankruptcy or otherwise); (v) in protecting, preserving, collecting, leasing,
selling, taking possession of, or liquidating any such collateral; or (vi)
attempting to enforce or enforcing any rights under the Loan Documents;
provided, however, that the attorneys' fees and disbursements for which Borrower
is obligated under this subsection (b) shall be limited to the reasonable
non-duplicative fees and disbursements of counsel for Agent and counsel for all
Lenders as a group. For purposes of this Section 12.01(b), (i) counsel for Agent
shall mean a single outside law firm representing Agent plus any additional law
firms providing special local law representation in connection with the
enforcement of the Loan Documents, and (ii) counsel for all Lenders as a group
shall mean a single outside law firm representing such Lenders as a group.

                  12.02    Indemnity

                  (a)      Generally. Borrower shall indemnify and defend Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and each Lender and their respective
affiliates, participants, officers, directors, employees and agents (each an
"Indemnitee") against, and shall hold each such Indemnitee harmless from, any
and all losses, damages (whether general, punitive or otherwise), liabilities,
claims, causes of action (whether legal, equitable or administrative),
judgments, court costs and legal or other expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) which such Indemnitee may suffer or incur: (i) in connection
with claims made by third parties against such Indemnitee for losses or damages
suffered by such third party as a result of (A) such Indemnitee's performance of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, including without limitation
such Indemnitee's exercise or failure to exercise any rights, remedies or powers
in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or (B) the
failure by Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party to perform any of their
respective obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
as and when required hereby or thereby, including without limitation any failure
of any representation or warranty of Borrower, the REIT or any Agreement Party
to be true and correct; (ii) in connection with any claim or cause of action of
any kind by any Person to the effect that such Indemnitee is in any way
responsible or liable for any act or omission by Borrower, the REIT or any
Agreement Party, whether on account of any theory of derivative liability or
otherwise, (iii) in connection with the past, present or future environmental
condition of any Property owned by Borrower, the REIT, Subsidiary or any
Agreement Party, the presence of asbestos-containing materials at any such
Property, the presence of Contaminants in groundwater at any such Property, or
the Release or threatened Release of any Contaminant into the environment from
any such Property; or (iv) in connection with any claim or cause of action of
any kind by any Person which would have the effect of denying such Indemnitee
the full benefit or protection of any provision of this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents.

                  (b)      ERISA. Without limitation of the provisions of
subsection (a) above, Borrower shall indemnify and hold each Indemnitee free and
harmless from and against all loss, costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses), expenses, taxes, and damages (including consequential damages)
such Indemnitee may suffer or incur by reason of the investigation, defense and
settlement of claims and in obtaining any prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code necessary in such Indemnitee's reasonable
judgment by reason of the inaccuracy of the representations and warranties set
forth

                                       83
<PAGE>

in the first paragraph of Section 5.01(s) or a breach of the provisions set
forth in the last paragraph of Section 8.01(f).

                  (c)      Exceptions; Limitations. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Section 12.02, Borrower shall have no obligation
to any Indemnitee hereunder with respect to (i) any intentional tort, fraud or
act of gross negligence or bad faith which any Indemnitee is personally
determined by the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction (sustained on
appeal, if any) to have committed, (ii) any liability of such Indemnitee to any
third party based upon contractual obligations of such Indemnitee owing to such
third party which are not expressly set forth in the Loan Documents or (iii)
violations of Environmental Laws relating to a Property which are caused by the
act or omission of such Indemnitee after such Indemnitee takes possession of
such Property and which would not have occurred if such Indemnitee had exercised
reasonable care under the circumstances. In addition, the indemnification set
forth in this Section 12.02 in favor of any officer, director, partner, employee
or agent of Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing or any Lender shall be solely in
their respective capacities as such officer, director, partner, employee or
agent. Such indemnification in favor of any affiliate of Agent, Swingline
Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender shall be solely in its capacity as the
provider of services to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender
in connection with this Agreement, and such indemnification in favor of any
participant of Agent or any Lender shall be solely in its capacity as a
participant in the Commitments and the Loans.

                  (d)      Payment; Survival. Borrower shall pay any amount
owing under this Section 12.02 within thirty (30) days after written demand
therefor by the applicable Indemnitee together with reasonable supporting
documentation therefor. The indemnity set forth in this Section 12.02 shall
survive the payment of all amounts payable pursuant to, and secured by, this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Payment by any Indemnitee shall not be a
condition precedent to the obligations of Borrower under this Section 12.02. To
the extent that any indemnification obligation set forth in this Section 12.02
may be unenforceable because it is violative of any law or public policy,
Borrower shall contribute the maximum portion which it is permitted to pay and
satisfy under applicable law, to the payment and satisfaction of the applicable
indemnified matter.

                  12.03    Change in Accounting Principles. Except as otherwise
provided herein, if any changes in accounting principles from those used in the
preparation of the most recent financial statements delivered to Agent pursuant
to the terms hereof are hereafter required or permitted by the rules,
regulations, pronouncements and opinions of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board or the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (or successors
thereto or agencies with similar functions) and are adopted by the REIT,
Borrower, any Subsidiary, any Investment Affiliate, or any Agreement Party with
the agreement of its independent certified public accountants and such changes
result in a change in the method of calculation of any of the financial
covenants, standards or terms found herein, the parties hereto agree to enter
into negotiations in order to amend such provisions so as to equitably reflect
such changes with the desired result that the criteria for evaluating the
financial condition of the REIT, on a consolidated basis, shall be the same
after such changes as if such changes had not been made; provided, however, that
no change in GAAP that would affect the method of calculation of any of the
financial covenants, standards or terms shall be given effect in such
calculations until such provisions are amended, in a manner satisfactory to
Agent and all Lenders, to so reflect such change in accounting principles.

                                       84
<PAGE>

                  12.04    Setoff. In addition to any Liens granted to Agent and
any rights now or hereafter granted under applicable law and not by way of
limitation of any such Lien or rights, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, Agent and each Lender are hereby authorized
by Borrower at any time or from time to time, with concurrent notice to
Borrower, or to any other Person (any such notice being hereby expressly waived)
to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all deposits (general or
special, including, but not limited to, indebtedness evidenced by certificates
of deposit, whether matured or unmatured but not including trust accounts) and
any other indebtedness at any time held or owing by Agent or such Lender solely
to or for the credit or the account of Borrower against and on account of the
Obligations of Borrower to Agent or such Lender including but not limited to all
Loans and all claims of any nature or description arising out of or connected
with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, irrespective of whether
or not (a) Agent or such Lender shall have made any demand hereunder or (b)
Agent shall have declared the principal of and interest on the Loans and other
amounts due hereunder to be due and payable as permitted by Article XI and
although said obligations and liabilities, or any of them, may be contingent or
unmatured.

                  12.05    Amendments and Waivers. No amendment or modification
of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective without the written
agreement of Requisite Lenders (after notice to all Lenders) as provided in
Section 11.10(a) and Borrower provided that the agreement of Requisite Lenders
shall not be required for amendments or modifications that are purely of a
clerical nature or that correct a manifest error and no termination or waiver of
any such provision of this Agreement (including without limitation any waiver of
an Event of Default which does not specifically require the consent of all
Lenders), or consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event
be effective without the written concurrence of Requisite Lenders (after notice
to all Lenders) as provided in Section 11.10(a), which Requisite Lenders shall
have the right to grant or withhold at their sole discretion, except that the
amendments, modifications or waivers specified in Section 11.10(b) shall require
the consent of the Supermajority Lenders and the following amendments,
modifications or waivers shall require the consent of all Lenders (other than
Section 12.05(j) which shall require the consent of all Lenders other than
Agent):

                  (a)      Increasing the Commitments or any Lender's
Commitments (excluding any increase as a result of an assignment of commitments
under Section 11.13);

                  (b)      Changing the principal amount or final maturity of
the Loans;

                  (c)      Reducing or increasing the interest rates applicable
to the Loans (other than Swingline Loans);

                  (d)      Reducing the rates on which fees payable pursuant
hereto are determined;

                  (e)      Forgiving or delaying any amount payable under
Article II (other than late fees);

                  (f)      Changing the definition of "Requisite Lenders," "Loan
Availability," "Supermajority Lenders," or "Pro Rata Shares";

                  (g)      Changing any provision contained in Section 12.05;

                                       85
<PAGE>

                  (h)      Releasing any obligor under any Loan Document, unless
such release is otherwise required by the terms of this Agreement or any other
Loan Document;

                  (a)      Issuing a Letter of Credit for a term extending
beyond the Maturity Date;

                  (i)      Removal of Agent for good cause in accordance with
Section 11.09(a); and

                  (j)      Modifying or waiving any other provision herein which
specifically requires the consent of all Lenders.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Borrower
shall have no right to consent to any amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of Article XI hereof; provided, however, that no
amendment, modification, termination or waiver of Section 11.09(b), 11.09(c),
11.10(a), or 11.13 (except subsection (i) thereof) which has an adverse effect
on Borrower or Borrower's rights hereunder shall be effective without the
written concurrence of Borrower. Agent and Lenders further acknowledge and agree
that the remaining provisions of Article XI are intended to and shall continue
to address only the rights and obligations of Agent and Lenders amongst each
other and do not and shall not impose obligations or restrictions upon Borrower
or result in any way in the loss of any rights, claims or defenses of Borrower.
No amendment, modification, termination or waiver of any provision of Article XI
hereof or any other provision referring to any Agent, Swingline Lender or
Issuing Lender shall be effective without the written concurrence of the Agent,
Swingline Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable. Any waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which it was given. No notice to or demand on Borrower in any case shall entitle
Borrower to any other further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances. Any amendment, modification, termination, waiver or consent
effected in accordance with this Section shall be binding on each assignee,
transferee or recipient of Agent's powers, functions or duties or any Lender's
Commitment under this Agreement or the Loans at the time outstanding.

                  12.06    Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder
shall be given independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is
not permitted by any of such covenants, the fact that it would be permitted by
an exception to, or be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant
shall not avoid the occurrence of an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of
Default if such action is taken or condition exists.

                  12.07    Notices and Delivery. Unless otherwise specifically
provided herein, any consent, notice or other communication herein required or
permitted to be given shall be in writing and may be personally served,
telecopied or sent by courier service or United States mail and shall be deemed
to have been given when delivered in person or by courier service, upon receipt
of a telecopy or if deposited in the United States mail (registered or
certified, with postage prepaid and properly addressed) upon receipt or refusal
to accept delivery. Notices to Agent, Swingline Lender or Issuing Lender
pursuant to Article II shall not be effective until received by Agent, Swingline
Lender or Issuing Lender, as applicable. For the purposes hereof, the addresses
of the parties hereto (until notice of a change thereof is delivered as provided
in this Section 12.07) shall be as set forth below each party's name on the
signature pages hereof, or, as to each party, at such other address as may be
designated by such party in a written notice

                                       86
<PAGE>

to all of the other parties. All deliveries to be made to Agent for distribution
to the Lenders shall be made to Agent at the addresses specified for notice on
the signature page hereto and, in addition, a sufficient number of copies of
each such delivery shall be delivered to Agent for delivery to each Lender at
the address specified for deliveries on the signature page hereto or such other
address as may be designated by Agent or Lenders in a written notice.

                  12.08    Survival of Warranties, Indemnities and Agreements.
All agreements, representations, warranties and indemnities made or given herein
or pursuant hereto shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents and the making and repayment of the Loans hereunder
and such indemnities shall survive termination hereof.

                  12.09    Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver; Remedies
Cumulative. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any
other Loan Document, no failure or delay on the part of Agent, Swingline Lender,
Issuing Lender or any Lender in the exercise of any power, right or privilege
under any of the Loan Documents shall impair such power, right or privilege or
be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence therein nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude other
or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. All
rights and remedies existing under the Loan Documents are cumulative to and not
exclusive of any rights or remedies otherwise available.

                  12.10    Marshalling; Recourse to Security; Payments Set
Aside. Neither any Lender, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender nor Agent shall be
under any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Borrower or any other
party or against or in payment of any or all of the Obligations. Recourse to
security shall not be required at any time. To the extent that Borrower makes a
payment or payments to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or the Lenders or
Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or the Lenders enforce their Liens or
exercise their rights of set off, and such payment or payments or the proceeds
of such enforcement or set off or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated,
declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be
repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any bankruptcy law, state
or federal law, common law or equitable cause, then to the extent of such
recovery, the Obligations or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied,
and all Liens, rights and remedies therefor, shall be revived and continued in
full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such enforcement
or set off had not occurred.

                  12.11    Severability. In case any provision in or obligation
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in
any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

                  12.12    Headings. Section headings in this Agreement are
included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a
part of this Agreement for any other purpose or be given any substantive effect.

                  12.13    Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,
AND SHALL BE CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
ILLINOIS.

                                       87
<PAGE>

                  12.14    Limitation of Liability. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, no claim may be made by Borrower, the REIT, any Lender or any
other Person against Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender, or
the affiliates, directors, officers, employees, attorneys or agents of any of
them, for any punitive damages in respect of any claim for breach of contract or
any other theory of liability arising out of or related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or any act, omission or event occurring in
connection therewith; and Borrower, the REIT, and each Lender hereby waive,
release and agree not to sue upon any claim for any such damages, whether or not
accrued and whether or not known or suspected to exist in its favor.

                  12.15    Successors and Assigns. This Agreement and the other
Loan Documents shall be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and the successors and permitted assigns of Agent and Lenders. The terms
and provisions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of any permitted
assignee or transferee of the Loans and the Commitments of Lenders under this
Agreement, and in the event of such transfer or assignment, the rights and
privileges herein conferred upon Agent and Lenders shall automatically extend to
and be vested in such transferee or assignee, all subject to the terms and
conditions hereof. Borrower's rights or any interest therein hereunder, and
Borrower's duties and obligations hereunder, shall not be assigned (whether
directly, indirectly, by operation of law or otherwise) without the consent of
all Lenders.

                  12.16    Usury Limitation. Each Loan Document is expressly
limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of
error of fact or law, payment, prepayment or advancement of the proceeds of the
Loans, acceleration of maturity of the unpaid principal balance of the Loans, or
otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Lenders for the use,
forbearance, or retention of money, including any fees or charges collected or
made in connection with the Loans which may be treated as interest under
applicable law, if any, exceed the maximum legal limit (if any such limit is
applicable) under United States federal laws or state laws (to the extent not
preempted by federal law, if any), now or hereafter governing the interest
payable under such Loan Documents. If, from any circumstances whatsoever,
fulfillment of any provision hereof or any of the other Loan Documents at the
time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve transcending the
limit of validity (if any) prescribed by law which a court of competent
jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then ipso facto, the obligation to be
fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from any
circumstances Lenders shall ever receive as interest an amount which would
exceed the maximum legal limit (if any such limit is applicable), such amount
which would be excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the
unpaid principal balance due under the Loan Documents and not to the payment of
interest or, if necessary, to Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, this provision shall control
every other provision of all Loan Documents.

                  12.17    Confidentiality. Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing
Lender and Lenders shall use reasonable efforts to assure that any information
about Borrower, the REIT, Subsidiaries and Investment Affiliates (and their
respective Properties) not generally disclosed to the public which is furnished
to Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or Lenders pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents is used only for the
purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and shall not be
divulged to any other

                                       88
<PAGE>

Person other than Agent, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders and their
respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees and agents who are
actively and directly participating in the evaluation, administration or
enforcement of the Obligations; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
affect the disclosure of any such information (i) to the extent required by
statute, rule, regulation or judicial process, (ii) to counsel for Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or Lenders or to their accountants, (iii) to
bank examiners and auditors, (iv) to any transferee or participant or
prospective transferee or participant hereunder who agrees to be bound by this
provision, (v) in connection with the enforcement of the rights of Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Lenders under this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents, or (vi) in connection with any litigation to which Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or any Lender is a party so long as Agent,
Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender or such Lender provides Borrower with prior
written notice of the need for such disclosure and exercises reasonable efforts
to obtain a protective order with respect to such information from the court or
other tribunal before which such litigation is pending.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or
in any other written or oral understanding or agreement to which the parties
hereto are parties or by which they are bound, the parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that (i) any obligations of confidentiality contained herein and
therein do not apply and have not applied from the commencement of discussions
between the parties to the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents (and any related transactions or
arrangements), and (ii) each party (and each of its employees, representatives,
or other agents) may disclose to any and all persons as required, without
limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions
contemplated by the Loan Documents and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such party relating to such
tax treatment and tax structure, all within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
Section 1.6011-4; provided, however, that each party recognizes that the
privilege each has to maintain, in its sole discretion, with regard to the
confidentiality of a communication relating to the transactions contemplated by
the Loan Documents, including a confidential communication with its attorney or
a confidential communication with a federally authorized tax practitioner under
Section 7525 of the Internal Revenue Code, is not intended to be affected by the
foregoing.

                  12.18    Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process;
Waiver of Jury Trial; Waiver Of Permissive Counterclaims. ALL JUDICIAL

SUCH SERVICE BEING HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED BY SUCH PERSON TO BE EFFECTIVE AND

PROCEEDING BY THE MAILING OF COPIES THEREOF BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED MAIL,
POSTAGE PREPAID, TO ITS RESPECTIVE NOTICE ADDRESS SPECIFIED ON THE SIGNATURE

                  12.19    Counterparts; Effectiveness; Inconsistencies. This
Agreement and any amendments, waivers, consents or supplements may be executed
in counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an
original, but all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the
same instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when Borrower, the
initial Lenders, Swingline Lender, Issuing Lender and Agent have duly executed
and delivered counterpart execution pages of this Agreement to each other
(delivery by Borrower and the REIT to Lenders and by any Lender to Borrower, the
REIT and any other Lender being deemed to have been made by delivery to Agent).
This Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents shall be construed to the
extent reasonable to be consistent one with the other, but to the extent that
the terms and conditions of this Agreement are actually and directly
inconsistent with the terms and conditions of any other Loan Document, this
Agreement shall govern.

                  12.20    Construction. The parties acknowledge that each party
and its counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal
rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved
against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this
Agreement or any amendments or exhibits hereto.

                  12.21    Entire Agreement. This Agreement, taken together with
all of the other Loan Documents and all certificates and other documents
delivered by Borrower to Agent in connection herewith, embodies the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements, written and oral, relating to the
subject matter hereof.

                  12.22    Agent's Action for Its Own Protection Only. The
authority herein conferred upon Agent, and any action taken by Agent, to inspect
any Property will be exercised

                                       90

and taken by Agent for its own protection only and may not be relied upon by
Borrower for any purposes whatsoever, and Agent shall not be deemed to have
assumed any responsibility to Borrower with respect to any such action herein
authorized or taken by Agent. Any review, investigation or inspection conducted
by Agent, any consultants retained by Agent or any agent or representative of
Agent in order to verify independently Borrower's satisfaction of any conditions
precedent to the Loans, Borrower's performance of any of the covenants,
agreements and obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, or the validity of
any representations and warranties made by Borrower hereunder (regardless of
whether or not the party conducting such review, investigation or inspection
should have discovered that any of such conditions precedent were not satisfied
or that any such covenants, agreements or obligations were not performed or that
any such representations or warranties were not true), shall not affect (or
constitute a waiver by Agent or Lenders of) (i) any of Borrower's
representations and warranties under this Agreement or Agent's or Lenders'
reliance thereon or (ii) Agent's or Lenders' reliance upon any certifications of
Borrower required under this Agreement or any other facts, information or
reports furnished to Agent and Lenders by Borrower hereunder.

                  12.23    Lenders' ERISA Covenant. Each Lender, by its
signature hereto or on the applicable Assignment and Assumption, hereby agrees
(a) that on the date any Loan is disbursed hereunder no portion of such Lender's
Pro Rata Share of such Loan will constitute "assets" within the meaning of 29
C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101 of an "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of Section 4975(e)(1) of
the Internal Revenue Code, and (b) that following such date such Lender shall
not allocate such Lender's Pro Rata Share of any Loan to an account of such
Lender if such allocation (i) by itself would cause such Pro Rata Share of such
Loan to then constitute "assets" (within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. Section
2510.3-101 or any successor regulation thereto) of an "employee benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or a "plan" within the meaning of
Section 4975(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code and (ii) by itself would cause
such Loan to constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal
Revenue Code (which is not exempt from the restrictions of Section 406 of ERISA
and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code and the taxes and penalties
imposed by Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 502(i) of
ERISA) or any Agent or Lender being deemed in violation of Section 404 of ERISA.

                  12.24    Sole Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent and
Syndication Agent. Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees
that the obligations of Sole Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent and Syndication
Agent hereunder shall be limited to those obligations that are expressly set
forth herein, if any, and Sole Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent and
Syndication Agent shall not be required to take any action or assume any
liability except as may be required in their respective capacities as a Lender
hereunder. Each of the parties to this Agreement agrees that, for purposes of
the indemnifications set forth herein, the term "Agent" shall be deemed to
include Sole Lead Arranger, Documentation Agent and Syndication Agent.

         SECTION 2.1. LOAN COMMITMENT; DISBURSEMENT TO BORROWER

         (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Lender hereby agrees to make and Borrower hereby agrees to accept the Loan on
the Closing Date.

         (b) Borrower may request and receive only one borrowing in respect of
the Loan and any amount borrowed and repaid in respect of the Loan may not be
reborrowed.

         (c) The Loan shall be evidenced by the Note and secured by the Mortgage
and the other Loan Documents.

                                     - 15 -

<PAGE>

         (d) Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan to (i) pay certain
costs in connection with the financing of the Property, (ii) make deposits into
the Reserve Funds on the Closing Date in the amounts provided herein, (iii) pay
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the Loan, as
approved by Lender, (iv) fund any working capital requirements of the Property,
and (v) distribute the balance, if any, to its partners or members, as
applicable.

         SECTION 2.2. LOAN PAYMENTS

         (a) The Loan shall bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to the
Note Rate. Interest shall be computed based on the daily rate produced assuming
a three hundred sixty (360) day year, multiplied by the actual number of days
elapsed. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, interest shall be paid
in arrears.

         (b) Borrower hereby agrees to pay sums due under the Note as follows:
An initial payment of is due on the Closing Date for interest from the Closing
Date through and including October 31, 2003. Thereafter, except as may be
adjusted in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.2(c), (1) consecutive
monthly installments of interest only in an amount calculated in accordance with
Section 2.2(a) above (such amount, the "I/O Monthly Payment Amount") shall be
payable on the first day of each month beginning December 1, 2003 (each such
date through and including the Maturity Date, a "Scheduled Payment Date")
through and including the Scheduled Payment Date occurring in November, 2005 and
(2) thereafter, consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest in an
amount equal to the sum set forth on Schedule 1, attached hereto, shall be
payable pursuant to the terms of Section 2.2(d) (the "Constant Monthly Payment
Amount"; the I/O Monthly Payment Amount and the Constant Monthly Payment Amount
shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the "Monthly Payment Amount")
on each Scheduled Payment Date until the entire indebtedness evidenced hereby is
fully paid, except that any remaining indebtedness, if not sooner paid, shall be
due and payable on the Maturity Date.

         (c) The Constant Monthly Payment Amount shall mean the amount of
interest and principal which would be due in order to fully amortize the
principal amount of the Loan over an amortization term of thirty (30) years
assuming an annual interest rate equal to the Note Rate, computed on the basis
of a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months of
thirty (30) days each. Borrower expressly understands and agrees that such
computation of interest based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting
of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days each is solely for the purpose of
determining the Monthly Payment Amount, and, notwithstanding such computation,
interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal amount of the Loan as
provided in Section 2.2(a) above. Borrower understands and acknowledges that
such interest accrual requirement results in more interest accruing on the Loan
than if either a thirty (30) day month and a three hundred sixty (360) day year
or the actual number of days and a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year were
used to compute the accrual of interest on the Loan. Borrower recognizes that
such interest accrual requirement will not fully amortize the Loan within the
amortization period set forth above. Following any partial prepayment occurring
solely as a result of the application of Insurance Proceeds or Awards pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
adjust the Monthly Payment Amount to give effect to any such partial prepayment,
provided, however, that in no event will any such adjustment result in any such
installment becoming due and payable on any date after the Maturity Date.

                                     - 16 -

<PAGE>

         (d) Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be
payable at the payment address set forth on Schedule 1, attached hereto, or at
such other place as the Lender may designate from time to time in writing, on
the date such payment is due, to Lender by deposit to such account as Lender may
designate by written notice to Borrower. Whenever any payment hereunder or under
the Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the first Business Day preceding such scheduled due
date.

         (e) Prior to the occurrence and following the cure (in accordance with
the terms hereof) of an Event of Default, all monthly payments made as scheduled
under this Agreement and the Note shall be applied first to the payment of
interest computed at the Note Rate, and the balance toward the reduction of the
principal amount of the Note. All voluntary and involuntary prepayments on the
Note shall be applied, to the extent thereof, to accrued but unpaid interest on
the amount prepaid, to the remaining principal amount, and any other sums due
and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan, in such manner and order as
Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited
to, application to principal installments in inverse order of maturity.
Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any
payment made on the Note shall be applied to accrued but unpaid interest, late
charges, accrued fees, the unpaid principal amount of the Note, and any other
sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan, in such manner and
order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion.

         (f) All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under the Note or the
other Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without any deduction
for, any setoff, defense or counterclaims.

         SECTION 2.3. LATE PAYMENT CHARGE

         If any principal or interest payment is not paid by Borrower on or
before the date which is ten (10) calendar days after the same is due, Borrower
shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of four percent
(4%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law in
order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such
delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such
delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable law.

         SECTION 2.4. PREPAYMENT; DEFEASANCE

         Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 2.4, no
voluntary prepayments, whether in whole or in part, of the Loan or any other
amount at any time due and owing under the Note can be made by Borrower or any
other Person without the express written consent of Lender.

         (a) Lockout Period. Borrower has no right to make, and Lender shall
have no obligation to accept, any voluntary prepayment, whether in whole or in
part, of the Loan during the Lockout Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
either (i) Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, accepts a full or
partial voluntary prepayment during the Lockout Period or (ii) there is an
involuntary prepayment during the Lockout Period, then, in either case, Borrower
shall, in

                                     - 17 -

<PAGE>

addition to any portion of the Loan prepaid (together with all interest accrued
and unpaid thereon), pay to Lender a prepayment premium in an amount calculated
in accordance with Section 2.4(d) hereof.

         (b) Total Defeasance.

                  (i)      Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 2.4 to
         the contrary, including, without limitation, subsection (a) of this
         Section 2.4, at any time after the earlier to occur of the (1)
         expiration of the REMIC Prohibition Period or (2) expiration of the
         Substitution/Defeasance Lockout Period, Borrower may cause the release
         of the Property from the lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan
         Documents upon the satisfaction of the following conditions:

                           (A)      no Event of Default shall exist under any of
                  the Loan Documents;

                           (B)      not less than thirty (30) (but not more than
                  ninety (90)) days prior written notice shall be given to
                  Lender specifying a date on which the Defeasance Collateral
                  (as hereinafter defined) is to be delivered (the "RELEASE
                  Date"), such date being on a Scheduled Payment Date; provided,
                  however, that Borrower shall have the right (i) to cancel such
                  notice by providing Lender with notice of cancellation ten
                  (10) days prior to the scheduled Release Date, or (ii) to
                  extend the scheduled Release Date until the next Scheduled
                  Payment Date; provided that in each case, Borrower shall pay
                  all of Lender's reasonable costs and expenses incurred as a
                  result of such cancellation or extension;

                           (C)      all accrued and unpaid interest and all
                  other sums due under the Note, this Agreement and under the
                  other Loan Documents up to the Release Date, including,
                  without limitation, all reasonable fees, costs and expenses
                  incurred by Lender and its agents in connection with such
                  release (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees
                  and expenses for the review and preparation of the Defeasance
                  Security Agreement (as hereinafter defined) and of the other
                  materials described in Section 2.4(b)(i)(D) below and any
                  related documentation, and any servicing fees, Rating Agency
                  fees or other costs related to such release), shall be paid in
                  full on or prior to the Release Date;

                           (D)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender on or prior
                  to the Release Date:

                  (1)      a pledge and security agreement, in form and
substance which would be satisfactory to a prudent institutional mortgage loan
lender, creating a first priority security interest in favor of Lender in the
Defeasance Collateral, as defined herein (the "DEFEASANCE SECURITY AGREEMENT"),
which shall provide, among other things, that any excess amounts received by
Lender from the Defeasance Collateral over the amounts payable by Borrower on a
given Scheduled Payment Date, which excess amounts are not required to cover all
or any portion of amounts payable on a future Scheduled Payment Date, shall be
refunded to Borrower promptly after each such Scheduled Payment Date;

                  (2)      direct non-callable obligations of the United States
of America (or other obligations which are "government securities" within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the

                                     - 18 -

Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent the applicable Rating Agencies
rating the Securities have confirmed in writing will not cause a downgrade,
withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if higher, then applicable
ratings of the Securities), that provide for payments prior and as close as
possible to (but in no event later than) all successive Scheduled Payment Dates
occurring after the Release Date, with each such payment being equal to or
greater than the amount of the corresponding Monthly Payment Amount required to
be paid under this Agreement and the Note (including all amounts due on the
Maturity Date) for the balance of the term hereof (the "DEFEASANCE COLLATERAL"),
each of which shall be duly endorsed by the holder thereof as directed by Lender
or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form and substance which
would be satisfactory to a prudent lender (including, without limitation, such
certificates, documents and instruments as may be required by the depository
institution holding such securities or the issuer thereof, as the case may be,
to effectuate book-entry transfers and pledges through the book-entry facilities
of such institution) in order to perfect upon the delivery of the Defeasance
Security Agreement the first priority security interest therein in favor of
Lender in conformity with all applicable state and federal laws governing
granting of such security interests;

                  (3)      a certificate of Borrower certifying that all of the
requirements set forth in this Section 2.4(b)(i) have been satisfied;

                  (4)      one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower in form
and substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a prudent
lender stating, among other things, that (i) Lender has a perfected first
priority security interest in the Defeasance Collateral and that the Defeasance
Security Agreement is enforceable against Borrower in accordance with its terms,
(ii) the release of the lien of the Mortgage and the pledge of Defeasance
Collateral will not directly or indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust
that then holds the Note to fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and
(iii) the defeasance will not cause any REMIC Trust to be an "investment
company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, at Borrower's cost;

                  (5)      a certificate in form and scope which would be
acceptable to a prudent lender from an Acceptable Accountant certifying that the
Defeasance Collateral will generate amounts sufficient to make all payments of
principal and interest due under the Note (including the scheduled outstanding
principal balance of the Loan due on the Maturity Date); and

                  (6)      such other certificates, documents and instruments as
a prudent institutional lender would require; and

                           (E)      in the event the Loan is held by a REMIC
                  Trust, Lender has received written confirmation from any
                  Rating Agency rating any Securities that substitution of the
                  Defeasance Collateral will not result in a downgrade,
                  withdrawal, or qualification of the ratings then assigned to
                  any of the Securities.

                  (ii)     Upon compliance with the requirements of Section
         2.4(b)(i), the Property shall be released from the lien of the Mortgage
         and the other Loan Documents, and the Defeasance Collateral shall
         constitute collateral which shall secure the Note and all other
         obligations under the Loan Documents. Lender will, at Borrower's
         expense, execute and

                                     - 19 -

<PAGE>

         deliver any agreements reasonably requested by Borrower to release the
         lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents from the Property.

                  (iii)    Upon the release of the Property in accordance with
         this Section 2.4(b), Borrower shall (at Lender's sole and absolute
         discretion) assign all its obligations and rights under the Note,
         together with the pledged Defeasance Collateral, to a successor entity
         designated and approved by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion
         ("SUCCESSOR BORROWER"). Successor Borrower shall execute an assignment
         and assumption agreement in form and substance which would be
         satisfactory to a prudent lender pursuant to which it shall assume
         Borrower's obligations under the Note and the Defeasance Security
         Agreement. As conditions to such assignment and assumption, Borrower
         shall (A) deliver to Lender one or more opinions of counsel in form and
         substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a
         prudent lender stating, among other things, that such assignment and
         assumption agreement is enforceable against Borrower and the Successor
         Borrower in accordance with its terms and that the Note, the Defeasance
         Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as so assigned and
         assumed, are enforceable against the Successor Borrower in accordance
         with their respective terms, and opining to such other matters relating
         to Successor Borrower and its organizational structure as Lender may
         require, and (B) pay all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred
         by Lender or its agents in connection with such assignment and
         assumption (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses and
         for the review of the proposed transferee and the preparation of the
         assignment and assumption agreement and related certificates, documents
         and instruments and any fees payable to any Rating Agencies and their
         counsel in connection with the issuance of the confirmation referred to
         in subsection (b)(i)(E) above). Upon such assignment and assumption,
         Borrower shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder, under the
         Note, under the other Loan Documents and under the Defeasance Security
         Agreement, except as expressly set forth in the assignment and
         assumption agreement.

                  (iv)     For purposes of this Section 2.4, "REMIC PROHIBITION
         PERIOD" means the two-year period commencing with the "startup day"
         within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code of any REMIC Trust
         that holds the Note. In no event shall Lender have any obligation to
         notify Borrower that a REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect with
         respect to the Loan, except that Lender shall notify Borrower if any
         REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect with respect to the Loan after
         receiving any notice described in Section 2.4(b)(i)(B); provided,
         however, that the failure of Lender to so notify Borrower shall not
         impose any liability on Lender or grant Borrower any right to defease
         the Loan during any such REMIC Prohibition Period.

         (c)      Intentionally deleted.

         (d)      Involuntary Prepayment During the Lockout Period. During the
Lockout Period, in the event of any involuntary prepayment of the Loan or any
other amount under the Note, whether in whole or in part, in connection with or
following Lender's acceleration of the Note or otherwise, and whether the
Mortgage is satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of sale or
judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means,
including, without limitation, repayment of the Loan by Borrower or any other
Person pursuant to any statutory or

                                     - 20 -

<PAGE>

common law right of redemption, Borrower shall, in addition to any portion of
the principal balance of the Loan prepaid (together with all interest accrued
and unpaid thereon and in the event the prepayment is made on a date other than
a Scheduled Payment Date, a sum equal to the amount of interest which would have
accrued under the Note on the amount of such prepayment if such prepayment had
occurred on the next Scheduled Payment Date), pay to Lender a prepayment premium
in an amount calculated in accordance with this Section 2.4(d). Such prepayment
premium shall be in an amount equal to the greater of:

                  (i)      1% of the portion of the Loan being prepaid; or

                  (ii)     the product obtained by multiplying:

                           (A)      the portion of the Loan being prepaid,
                  times;

                           (B)      the difference obtained by subtracting (I)
                  the Yield Rate from (II) the Note Rate, times;

                           (C)      the present value factor calculated using
                  the following formula:

                                    1-(1+r)(-n)
                                    ----------
                                        r

                                    r = Yield Rate

                                    n = the number of years and any fraction
                                        thereof, remaining between the date the
                                        prepayment is made and the Maturity Date
                                        of the Note.

         As used herein, "YIELD RATE" means the yield per annum calculated by
Lender by the linear interpolation of the yield of U.S. Treasury Securities
having a maturity date (one longer and one shorter) most nearly approximating
the Maturity Date as reported on the fifth Business Day preceding the Prepayment
Calculation Date. The "PREPAYMENT CALCULATION DATE" shall mean, as applicable,
the date on which (i) Lender applies any partial prepayment to the reduction of
the outstanding principal amount of the Note, in the case of a voluntary partial
prepayment which is accepted by Lender, (ii) Lender accelerates the Loan, in the
case of a prepayment resulting from acceleration, or (iii) Lender applies funds
held under any Reserve Account, in the case of a prepayment resulting from such
an application (other than in connection with acceleration of the Loan).

         (e)      Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds; Excess Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, and provided no
Event of Default exists, Borrower shall not be required to pay any prepayment
premium in connection with any prepayment occurring solely as a result of (i)
the application of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Documents, or (ii) the application of any interest in excess
of the Maximum Legal Rate.

         (f)      After the Lockout Period. Commencing on the day after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, and upon giving Lender at least thirty (30)
days (but not more than ninety (90) days) prior written notice, Borrower may
voluntarily prepay (without premium) the Note in

                                     - 21 -

<PAGE>

whole (but not in part) on a Scheduled Payment Date. Lender shall accept a
prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.4(h) on a day other than a Scheduled
Payment Date provided that, in addition to payment of the full outstanding
principal balance of the Note, Borrower pays to Lender a sum equal to the amount
of interest which would have accrued on the Note if such prepayment occurred on
the next Scheduled Payment Date (the "INTEREST SHORTFALL").

         (g)      Limitation on Partial Prepayments. Except as set forth in
Section 2.4(e), in no event shall Lender have any obligation to accept a partial
prepayment.

         SECTION  2.5. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION  2.6. PAYMENTS AFTER DEFAULT

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect of the Loan,
(a) shall accrue at the Default Rate, and (b) Lender shall be entitled to
receive and Borrower shall pay to Lender all cash flow from the Property in
accordance with the terms of Article X hereof, such amount to be applied by
Lender to the payment of the Debt in such order as Lender shall determine in its
sole discretion, including, without limitation, alternating applications thereof
between interest and principal. Interest at the Default Rate shall be computed
from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the earlier of (i) the actual
receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion thereof that is then due)
and (ii) the cure of such Event of Default. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, interest at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, shall
itself accrue interest at the same rate as the Loan and shall be secured by the
Mortgage. This paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to
extend the date of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right
or remedy accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Event of
Default; the acceptance of any payment from Borrower shall not be deemed to cure
or constitute a waiver of any Event of Default; and Lender retains its rights
under this Agreement to accelerate and to continue to demand payment of the Debt
upon the happening of and during the continuance any Event of Default, despite
any payment by Borrower to Lender.

         SECTION 2.7. USURY SAVINGS

         This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that
at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject Lender to either
civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate. If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower
is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance
due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Note Rate or
the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum
Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and
not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid
to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from

                                     - 22 -

<PAGE>

time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is
outstanding. Borrower hereby agrees to pay an effective rate of interest that is
the sum of the interest rate provided for herein, together with any additional
interest or rate of interest resulting from any other charges of interest or in
the nature of interest paid or to be paid in connection with the Loan,
including, without limitation, any fees to be paid by Borrower pursuant to the
provisions of any and/or all of the Loan Documents. Lender and Borrower agree
that none of the terms and provisions contained herein or in any of the Loan
Documents shall be construed to create a contract for the use, forbearance or
detention of money requiring payment of interest at a rate in excess of the
Maximum Legal Rate.

                                   ARTICLE 3

right thereunder, render the Loan Documents unenforceable, and neither Borrower

after due inquiry, Borrower does not have any contingent liabilities,
liabilities for taxes, unusual forward or long-term commitments or unrealized or

         SECTION 4.23. PHYSICAL CONDITION

         To Borrower's knowledge after due inquiry and except as disclosed in

structural or other material defects or damages in the Property, as a result of
a Casualty or otherwise, and whether latent or otherwise. Borrower has not

         (a) Except as disclosed in the Survey of the Property delivered to
Lender in connection with the closing of the Loan and for which adequate
insurance has been obtained under the Title Insurance Policy, none of the
Improvements which were included in determining the appraised value of the

Property to any material extent, and (b) no improvements on adjoining properties

Property encroach upon any of the Improvements so as to materially affect the
value or marketability of the Property and for which title endorsements that are

         SECTION 4.25. LEASES AND RENT ROLL

         Borrower has delivered to Lender a true, correct and complete rent roll
for the Property (a "RENT ROLL") which includes all Leases affecting the
Property and contains an aging report setting forth past due amounts with
respect to the Tenants; provided, however, that Lender acknowledges that, to the
extent the Property consists of a recreational vehicle resort, written Leases

forth in the Rent Roll (as same has been updated by written notice thereof to
Lender): (a) each Lease is in full force and effect; (b) the premises demised
under any Major Leases have been completed and the Tenants under the Leases have
accepted possession of and are in occupancy of all of their respective demised

due and payable under any Major Leases have been paid and no portion thereof has
been paid for any period more than thirty (30) days in advance; (e) the rent

e-mail or other communication, any notice of a material default under any Lease
and (2) no more than five percent (5%) of Tenants under pad leases have made any
written claims of material defaults from against the landlord which remain
outstanding nor has Borrower or Manager received any written notice of material
defaults from greater than five percent (5%) of the Tenants under such Leases;
(g) to Borrower's knowledge there is no present material default by a Tenant
under any Major Lease; (h) all security deposits under the Leases have been
collected by Borrower; (i) Borrower is the sole owner of the entire landlord's
interest in each Lease; (j) each Lease is the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Borrower and the applicable Tenant thereunder and there are no
agreements with the Tenants

                                     - 33 -

<PAGE>

under any Major Leases other than as expressly set forth in the Leases; (k) no
Person has any possessory interest in, or right to occupy, the Property or any
portion thereof except under the terms of a Lease (or as otherwise provided for
under applicable law); provided, however, that Lender acknowledges that, to the
extent the Property consists of a recreational vehicle resort (and for so long
as either Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal Affiliate is Borrower under
the Loan), written Leases are not used in the ordinary course of the Property's
operation; (l) none of the Leases contains any option or offer to purchase or
right of first refusal to purchase the Property or any part thereof, except to

applicable Legal Requirements; (m) neither the Leases nor the Rents have been
assigned, pledged or hypothecated except to Lender, and no other Person has any
interest therein except the Tenants thereunder; and (n) no conditions exist
which now give any Tenant or party the right to "go dark" pursuant to the
provision of any Major Lease and/or the any REA. In the event there are any
Leases affecting the Property relating to laundry facilities (each, a "LAUNDRY
LEASE"), none of any such Laundry Leases (A) provides that the Tenant under such
Laundry Lease shall be entitled to any proceeds payable in connection with a
Casualty of Condemnation, (B) contains any option or offer to purchase or right
of first refusal or right of first offer to purchase the Property or any part
thereof, (C) comprises a material portion of the Property or (D) imposes any
material obligations upon Borrower.

with its terms by Lender (or any subsequent holder thereof).

         SECTION 4.27. MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT

         The Management Agreement is in full force and effect and there is no
default thereunder by any party thereto and, to Borrower's knowledge, no event
has occurred that, with the passage of time and/or the giving of notice would
constitute a default thereunder. No management fees under the Management
Agreement are accrued and unpaid.

         SECTION 4.28. ILLEGAL ACTIVITY

of any illegal activity, and no part of the proceeds of the Loan will be used in

         SECTION 4.29. CONSTRUCTION EXPENSES

         All costs and expenses of any and all labor, materials, supplies and
equipment used in the construction maintenance or repair of the Improvements

resulted in a Lien against the Property, the Title Insurance Policy provides
Lender satisfactory affirmative insurance with respect to such Lien. To

municipal, and city income, personal property and other tax returns required to

by them. Neither Borrower nor Borrower Principal knows of any basis for any
additional assessment in respect of any such taxes and related liabilities for
prior years.

         SECTION 4.32. PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES

         None of the Permitted Encumbrances, individually or in the aggregate,

the Federal Reserve System or for any other purpose which would be inconsistent
with such Regulation U or any other Regulations of such Board of Governors, or
for any purposes prohibited by Legal Requirements or prohibited by the terms and
conditions of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

remains unmodified and in full force and effect;

         (b)      All easements granted pursuant to any REA which were to have

preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights,
licenses, permits and franchises and comply in all material respects with all
Legal Requirements applicable to it and the Property. Borrower hereby covenants
and agrees not to commit, permit or suffer to exist any act or omission
affording any Governmental Authority the right of forfeiture as against the
Property or any part thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower's
obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

         (b)      After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own

such Taxes or Other Charges) for the payment of the Taxes and the Other Charges
prior to the date the same shall become delinquent (provided, however, that
Borrower is not required to furnish such receipts for payment of Taxes in the
event that such Taxes have been paid by Lender pursuant to Section 9.6 hereof).

other instrument to which Borrower is subject and shall not constitute a default
thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with all
applicable Legal Requirements; (iii) neither the Property nor any part thereof
or interest therein will be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated,
canceled or lost; (iv) Borrower shall promptly upon final determination thereof
pay the amount of any such Taxes or Other Charges, together with all costs,
interest and penalties which may be payable in connection therewith; (v) such

thereon (unless Borrower has paid all of the Taxes or Other Charges under
protest). Lender may pay over any such cash deposit or part thereof held by
Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at any time when, in the judgment of
Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is established or the Property (or part
thereof or interest therein) shall be in danger of being sold, forfeited,
terminated, canceled or lost or there shall be any danger of the Lien of the
Mortgage being primed by any related Lien.

         Lender, promptly upon request, with summaries of the financial
         statements referenced in Section 5.11(c)(ii)(A)-(D) below if, at the

         is expected that the principal amount of the Loan and any Affiliated
         Loans at the time of Securitization may, or if the principal amount of
         the Loan and any Affiliated Loans at any time during which the Loan and
         any Affiliated Loans are included in a Securitization does, equal or
         exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans
         included or expected to be included, as applicable, in a

         "summarized financial information," as defined in Section 210.1-02(bb)
         of Regulation S-X, or such other requirements as may be reasonably
         determined to be necessary or appropriate by Lender.

                  such financial statements are included, interim financial
                  statements of the Property meeting the requirements of Section

                  provided, however, that with respect to a Property (other than
                  properties that are hotels, nursing homes, or other properties
                  that would be deemed to constitute a business and not real
                  estate under Regulation S-X or other legal requirements) that
                  has been acquired by Borrower from an unaffiliated third party
                  (such Property, "Acquired Property"), as to which the other
                  conditions set forth in Section 210.3-14 of Regulation S-X for
                  provision of financial statements

<PAGE>

                  in accordance with such Section have been met, in lieu of the
                  Standard Statements otherwise required by this section,
                  Borrower shall instead provide the financial statements
                  required by such Section 210.3-14 of Regulation S-X ("Acquired
                  Property Statements").

                           (B)      Not later than 30 days after the end of each
                  fiscal quarter following the date hereof, a balance sheet of
                  the Property as of the end of such fiscal quarter, meeting the

                  recent fiscal year, meeting the requirements of Section
                  210.3-02 of Regulation S-X.

                           (C)      Not later than 75 days after the end of each

                  Section 210.3-02 of Regulation S-X.

                           (D)      Within ten Business Days after notice from
                  Lender in connection with the Securitization of this Loan,
                  such additional financial statements, such that, as of the
                  date (each an "Offering Document Date") of each Disclosure
                  Document, Borrower shall have provided Lender with all
                  financial statements as described in subsection (f)(i) above;
                  provided that the fiscal year and interim periods for which
                  such financial statements shall be provided shall be
                  determined as of such Offering Document Date.

                  (iii)    All financial statements provided by Borrower
         hereunder pursuant to Section 5.11(c)(ii) hereof shall be prepared in
         accordance with GAAP, and shall meet the requirements of Regulation S-X
         and other applicable legal requirements. All financial statements
         (audited or unaudited) provided by Borrower under this Section 5.11
         shall be certified by an authorized officer or administrative member of
         Borrower, which certification shall state that such financial
         statements meet the requirements set forth in the first sentence of
         this Section 5.11(c)(iii).

                  (iv)     If requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide
         Lender, promptly upon request, with any other or additional financial
         statements, or financial, statistical or operating information, as
         Lender shall determine to be required pursuant to Regulation S-X or any
         amendment, modification or replacement thereto or other legal
         requirements in connection with any Disclosure Document or any filing
         under or pursuant to the Exchange Act in connection with or relating to
         a Securitization (hereinafter an "Exchange Act Filing") or as shall
         otherwise be reasonably requested by Lender.

                  (v)      In the event Lender determines, in connection with a
         Securitization, that the financial statements required in order to
         comply with Regulation S-X or other legal requirements are other than
         as provided herein, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section
         5.11(c) hereof, Lender may request, and Borrower shall promptly
         provide, such

                                     - 43 -

<PAGE>

         combination of Acquired Property Statement and/or Standard Statements
         or such other financial statements as Lender determines to be necessary
         or appropriate for such compliance.

                  (vi)     Any reports, statements or other information required
         to be delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered in paper form
         and in the event that Lender requires financial statements in
         connection with subsection (c) above because the Loan when combined
         with the principal amount of any Affiliated Loans equal or exceed 20%
         of the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans included in a
         Securitization (defined below), Borrower shall deliver such reports,
         statements and other information (A) on a diskette, and (B) if
         requested by Lender and within the capabilities of Borrower's data
         systems without change or modification thereto, in electronic form and
         prepared using Microsoft Word for Windows or WordPerfect for Windows
         files (which files may be prepared using a spreadsheet program and
         saved as word processing files).

         (d)      Borrower and Borrower Principal shall furnish Lender with such
other additional financial or management information (including state and
federal tax returns) as may, from time to time, be reasonably required by Lender
in form and substance satisfactory to Lender (including, without limitation, any
financial reports required to be delivered by any Tenant or any guarantor of any
Lease pursuant to the terms of such Lease), and shall furnish to Lender and its
agents convenient facilities for the examination and audit of any such books and
records.

         (e)      All items requiring the certification of Borrower shall,
except where Borrower is an individual, require a certificate executed by the
general partner, managing member or authorized/senior officer of Borrower, as
applicable (and the same rules shall apply to any sole shareholder, general
partner or managing member which is not an individual).

         (f)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
no event shall Borrower be required to comply with the financial reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X that would be applicable solely as a result of
the principal amount of the Loan and any Affiliated Loans (at the time of
Securitization) equaling or exceeding 20% of the aggregate principal amount of
all mortgage loans included or expected to be included, as applicable, in a
Securitization.

         SECTION 5.12. ESTOPPEL STATEMENT


         (a)      After request by Lender, Borrower shall within fifteen (15)
Business Days furnish Lender with a statement, duly acknowledged and certified,
setting forth (i) the amount of the original principal amount of the Note, (ii)
the rate of interest on the Note, (iii) the unpaid principal amount of the Note,
(iv) the date installments of interest and/or principal were last paid, (v) any
offsets or defenses to the payment of the Debt, if any, and (vi) that the Note,
this Agreement, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents are valid, legal and
binding obligations and have not been modified or if modified, giving
particulars of such modification.

         (b)      Borrower shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver to
Lender, promptly upon request, but subject to the terms of the applicable Major
Leases that are either Ground Leases or Operating Leases, duly executed estoppel
certificates from any one or more Tenants thereunder

                                     - 44 -

<PAGE>

as required by Lender (but no more frequently than once every twelve (12) months
provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing) attesting to such
facts regarding the related Lease as Lender may reasonably require, including,
but not limited to attestations that each Lease covered thereby is in full force
and effect with no defaults thereunder on the part of any party, that none of
the Rents have been paid more than one month in advance, except as security, and
that the Tenant claims no defense or offset against the full and timely
performance of its obligations under the Lease.

         SECTION 5.13. LEASING MATTERS.


         (a)      Except as otherwise consented to by Lender in writing, all
Leases shall be written on the standard form of lease which shall have been (i)
with respect to pad Leases, delivered to Lender in connection with the closing
of the Loan and (ii) with respect to Operating Leases or Ground Leases, if any,
approved by Lender, provided however that Lender acknowledges that to the extent
any portion of the Property consists of a recreational vehicle resort, Borrower
shall not be required to enter into written Leases with any occupant or tenant
of such portion of the Property and such tenants and/or occupants of such
recreational vehicle resorts shall be deemed month to month tenants or licensees
of Borrower. So long as either Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal
Affiliate is Borrower under the Loan, Borrower may modify its standard form of
pad lease in accordance with sound business practices and Legal Requirements,
provided that the form of such Lease contains covenants and conditions that are
consistent with those contained in comparable leases in the applicable local
market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the majority of owners,
managers and/or operators of comparable recreational vehicle resorts in the
applicable local market enter into written Leases with the occupants of
recreational vehicle resorts, Borrower shall be required to enter into written
Leases with respect to such occupants, and the form of such lease shall contain
terms and conditions that are consistent with those of Leases of comparable
properties in the applicable market or sub-market. Upon request, Borrower (1)
shall furnish Lender with executed copies of all Major Leases and (2) shall make
available to Lender at Borrower's offices (upon reasonable notice to Borrower),
executed copies of all other Leases. No material changes may be made to the
Lender-approved standard form of Operating Lease and Ground Lease, if
applicable, without the prior written consent of Lender. In addition, all
renewals of Leases and all proposed leases shall provide for rental rates and
terms comparable to existing local market rates and terms and, except with
respect to one pad at the Property used for on-site community managers (or other
employees of Manager), shall be arm's-length transactions with bona fide,
independent third party tenants. All proposed Major Leases and renewals of
existing Major Leases shall be subject to the prior approval of Lender and its
counsel, at Borrower's expense. All Leases shall provide that they are
subordinate to the Mortgage and that the tenant agrees to attorn to Lender.

         (b)      Borrower (i) shall observe and perform all the obligations
imposed upon the landlord under the Leases and shall not do or permit to be done
anything to impair the value of the Leases as security for the Debt; (ii) shall
enforce all of the material terms, covenants and conditions contained in the
Leases upon the part of the Tenant thereunder to be observed or performed, short
of termination thereof; provided however, with respect to pad leases, a pad
Lease may be terminated in the event of a default by the tenant thereunder;
(iii) with respect to any Leases (other than Leases relating to mobile home park
pads or recreational vehicle resort pads), shall not collect any of the Rents
more than one (1) month in advance; provided, however,

                                     - 45 -

<PAGE>

that in no event shall Borrower collect any Rents under Leases (or any other
applicable occupancy agreements (written or otherwise)) relating to mobile home
park pads or recreational vehicle resort pads more than one (1) year in advance;
(iv) shall not execute any other assignment of the landlord's interest in the
Leases or the Rents; and (v) shall not consent to any assignment of or
subletting under the Major Leases not in accordance with their terms, without
the prior written consent of Lender.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above,
renewals of existing commercial Leases and proposed Leases for commercial space
shall not be subject to the prior approval of Lender, provided all of the
following conditions are satisfied: (i) the rental income pursuant to the
renewal or proposed Lease is not more than five (5%) percent of the total rental
income for the Property, (ii) the renewal or proposed Lease has a base term of
less than six (6) years including options to renew, (iii) no rent, credits, free
rents or concessions have been granted under the renewal or proposed Lease
(except to the extent consistent with current market conditions), (iv) the
renewal or proposed Lease is subject and subordinate to the Mortgage and the
tenant thereunder shall have agreed to attorn to Lender, (v) the renewal or
proposed Lease is on the standard form of lease approved by Lender, (vi) the
renewal or proposed Lease does not contain any option, offer, right of first
refusal, or other similar right to acquire all or any portion of the Property,
and (vii) the renewal or proposed Lease provides for rental rates and terms
comparable to existing market rates and terms and is an arm's-length transaction
with a bona fide, independent third party tenant. Borrower shall deliver to
Lender copies of all Leases which are entered into pursuant to the preceding
sentence together with Borrower's certification that it has satisfied all of the
conditions of the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after the execution
of the Lease.

         SECTION 5.14. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

         (a)      Borrower shall (i) promptly perform and observe all of the
covenants required to be performed and observed by it under the Management
Agreement and do all things necessary to preserve and to keep unimpaired its
material rights thereunder; (ii) promptly notify Lender of any material default
under the Management Agreement of which it is aware; (iii) promptly deliver to
Lender a copy of any notice of default or other material notice received by
Borrower under the Management Agreement; (iv) promptly give notice to Lender of
any notice or information that Borrower receives which indicates that Manager is
terminating the Management Agreement or that Manager is otherwise discontinuing
its management of the Property; and (v) promptly enforce the performance and
observance of all of the covenants required to be performed and observed by
Manager under the Management Agreement.

         (b)      If at any time, (i) an Event of Default under Section 11.1(a)
hereof has occurred and is continuing; or (ii) Manager is not an Affiliated
Manager and either (A) a default has occurred and is continuing under the
Management Agreement or (B) Manager has become insolvent or a debtor in a
bankruptcy proceeding, Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, terminate the
Management Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior notice to Manager and replace
Manager with a Qualified Manager approved by Lender on terms and conditions
satisfactory to Lender, it being understood and agreed that the management fee
for such replacement manager shall not exceed then prevailing market rates.

         (d)      Any entity Controlled by MHC or MHCOP shall be deemed

Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

otherwise replace Manager or enter into any other management agreement with
respect to the Property; (ii) reduce or consent to the reduction of the term of
the Management Agreement; (iii) increase or consent to the increase of the
amount of any charges under the Management Agreement; or (iv) otherwise modify,
change, supplement, alter or amend, or waive or release any of its rights and
remedies under, the Management Agreement in any material respect, provided,
however, that if Manager is Controlled by MHC or MHCOP, then Borrower shall have
the right to enter into amendments to the Management Agreement (1) which are
consistent with good operating practices, (2) which do not increase any of the
fees or other similar charges payable by Borrower thereunder and (3) which do
not otherwise materially increase any of Borrower's obligations thereunder, and
Borrower shall have the right to enter into a new management agreement with
another entity Controlled by MHC or MHCOP on substantially the same terms and
conditions as those set forth in the Management Agreement approved by Lender in
connection with the closing of the Loan and otherwise in accordance with the
terms permitted hereunder, without the consent of Lender. In the event that
Borrower replaces Manager at any time during the term of Loan pursuant to this
subsection, such Manager shall be a Qualified Manager.

         SECTION 5.15. LIENS

         Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any portion of the Property
or permit any such action to be taken, except Permitted Encumbrances.

         SECTION 5.16. DEBT CANCELLATION

         Borrower shall not cancel or otherwise forgive or release any claim or
debt (other than termination of Leases in accordance herewith) owed to Borrower
by any Person, except for adequate consideration and in the ordinary course of
Borrower's business.

         SECTION 5.17. ZONING

         Borrower shall not initiate or consent to any zoning reclassification
of any portion of the Property or seek any variance under any existing zoning
ordinance or use or permit the use of any portion of the Property in any manner
that could result in such use becoming a non-conforming use under any zoning
ordinance or any other applicable land use law, rule or regulation, without the
prior written consent of Lender.

         SECTION 5.18. ERISA

         (a)      Borrower shall not engage in any transaction which would cause
any obligation, or action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise by

                  Section 2510.3-101(f)(2); or

                           (C)      Borrower qualifies as an "operating company"

         Borrower shall not enter into, terminate or modify (in any material
respects) any REA without Lender's prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Borrower shall enforce,
comply with, and cause each of the parties to the REA to comply with all of the
material economic terms and conditions contained in the REA. Lender acknowledges
that it would be unreasonable to withhold its consent to Borrower entering into

time (including any related alterations, improvements or replacements), are
reasonably anticipated to have a cost in excess of the Alteration Threshold.
Notwithstanding

                                     - 48 -

<PAGE>

the provisions of subsection (b) above and provided that either the Original
Borrower or a Borrower Principal Affiliate is Borrower under the Loan, Lender's
prior approval shall not be required in connection with any alterations in
excess of the Alteration Threshold, provided that Lender shall have received (a)
a current Appraisal of the Property (or a letter update to the Appraisal
delivered in connection with the closing of the Loan), (b) a certificate from
Borrower and (c) such other evidence that would be satisfactory to a prudent
institutional mortgage loan lender each indicating that such alterations will
not impair (as security for the Loan) the fair market value of the real estate
collateral portion of the Property, as determined by a prudent institutional
secondary market lender. If the total unpaid amounts incurred and to be incurred
with respect to such alterations to the Improvements shall at any time exceed
the Alteration Threshold and regardless of whether Lender's consent is required
in connection with any such alterations, Borrower shall promptly deliver to
Lender as security for the payment of such amounts and as additional security
for Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents any of the following: (i)
cash, (ii) direct non-callable obligations of the United States of America or
other obligations which are "government securities" within the meaning of

         existing and in good standing (if applicable) under the applicable

         Debt, (B) trade and operational indebtedness incurred in the ordinary
         course of business with trade creditors, provided such indebtedness is
         (1) unsecured, (2) not evidenced by a note, (3) on commercially

         amount of the Note;

                  (viii)   fail to maintain its records, books of account, bank
         accounts, financial statements, accounting records and other entity
         documents separate and apart from those of any other Person; except
         that Borrower's financial position, assets, liabilities, net worth and
         operating results may be included in the consolidated financial
         statements of an Affiliate, provided that such consolidated financial
         statements indicate that Borrower is a separate legal entity and that
         it maintains separate books and records;

                  (ix)     enter into any contract or agreement with any general

         arm's-length basis with unaffiliated third parties;

                  (xiv)    fail either to hold itself out to the public as a
         legal entity separate and distinct from any other Person or to conduct

                  (xv)     fail to maintain adequate capital for the normal
         obligations reasonably foreseeable in a business of its size and
         character and in light of its contemplated business operations,
         provided, however, that any such failure to maintain adequate capital
         will not constitute a breach of this covenant if cash flow from the
         Property is insufficient for Borrower to maintain adequate capital as
         set forth above;;

                  (xvi)    if it is a partnership or limited liability company,
         without the unanimous written consent of all of its partners or
         members, as applicable, and the written consent of 100% of the managers
         of Borrower (if any), including, without limitation, each Independent
         Director, (a) file or consent to the filing of any petition, either
         voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any Creditors Rights
         Laws, (b) seek or consent to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator
         or any similar official, (c) take any action that might cause such

                  (xvii)   fail to allocate shared expenses (including, without
         limitation, shared office space and services performed by an employee
         of an Affiliate) among the Persons sharing such expenses and to use
         separate stationery, invoices and checks;

                  (xviii)  make any distributions so as to render Borrower
         insolvent or cause Borrower to become unable to pay its own liabilities

         any) from its own funds;

                  (xix)    acquire obligations or securities of its partners,
         members, shareholders or other affiliates, as applicable; or

                  (xx)     violate or cause to be violated the assumptions made
         with respect to Borrower and its principals in any opinion letter
         pertaining to substantive consolidation delivered to Lender in
         connection with the Loan; or

                  (xxi)    If Borrower is a partnership or limited liability
         company, each general partner in the case of a general partnership,
         each general partner in the case of a limited partnership, or the
         managing member in the case of a limited liability company (each an
         "SPE COMPONENT ENTITY") of Borrower, as applicable, shall be a
         corporation or a single member Delaware limited liability company whose
         sole asset is its interest in Borrower. Each SPE Component Entity (i)
         will at all times comply with each of the covenants, terms and
         provisions contained in Section 6.1(a)(iii) - (vi) and (viii) - (xxi),
         as if such representation, warranty or covenant was made directly by
         such SPE Component Entity; (ii) will not engage in any business or
         activity other than owning an interest in Borrower; (iii) will not
         acquire or own any assets other than its partnership, membership, or
         other equity interest in Borrower; (iv) will not incur any debt,
         secured or unsecured, direct or contingent (including guaranteeing any
         obligation); (v) will at all times when the Loan is outstanding own at
         least a one hundredth of one percent (.01%) general partnership or

                                     - 51 -

<PAGE>

         managing membership interest in Borrower; and (vi) will cause Borrower
         to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.1 and Section 6.4.
         Prior to the withdrawal or the disassociation of any SPE Component
         Entity from Borrower, Borrower shall immediately appoint a new general
         partner or managing member whose articles of incorporation or limited
         liability company operating agreement, as applicable, are substantially
         similar to those of such SPE Component Entity and, if an opinion letter
         pertaining to substantive consolidation was required at closing,
         deliver a new opinion letter acceptable to Lender and the Rating
         Agencies with respect to the new SPE Component Entity and its equity
         owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Borrower is a
         single member Delaware limited liability company, so long as Borrower
         maintains such formation status, no SPE Component Entity shall be
         required.

         (b)      In the event Borrower is a single member Delaware limited
liability company, the limited liability company agreement of Borrower (the "LLC
AGREEMENT") shall provide that (i) upon the occurrence of any event that causes
the sole member of Borrower ("MEMBER") to cease to be the member of Borrower
(other than (A) upon an assignment by Member of all of its limited liability
company interest in Borrower and the admission of the transferee in accordance
with the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement, or (B) the resignation of Member
and the admission of an additional member of Borrower in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement), any person acting as
Independent Director of Borrower shall, without any action of any other Person
and simultaneously with the Member ceasing to be the member of Borrower,
automatically be admitted to Borrower ("SPECIAL MEMBER") and shall continue
Borrower without dissolution and (ii) Special Member may not resign from
Borrower or transfer its rights as Special Member unless (A) a successor Special
Member has been admitted to Borrower as Special Member in accordance with
requirements of Delaware law and (B) such successor Special Member has also
accepted its appointment as an Independent Director. The LLC Agreement shall
further provide that (i) Special Member shall automatically cease to be a member
of Borrower upon the admission to Borrower of a substitute Member, (ii) Special
Member shall be a member of Borrower that has no interest in the profits, losses
and capital of Borrower and has no right to receive any distributions of
Borrower assets, (iii) pursuant to Section 18-301 of the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act (the "ACT"), Special Member shall not be required to make
any capital contributions to Borrower and shall not receive a limited liability
company interest in Borrower, (iv) Special Member, in its capacity as Special
Member, may not bind Borrower and (v) except as required by any mandatory
provision of the Act, Special Member, in its capacity as Special Member, shall
have no right to vote on, approve or otherwise consent to any action by, or
matter relating to, Borrower, including, without limitation, the merger,
consolidation or conversion of Borrower; provided, however, such prohibition
shall not limit the obligations of Special Member, in its capacity as
Independent Director, to vote on such matters required by the Loan Documents or
the LLC Agreement. In order to implement the admission to Borrower of Special
Member, Special Member shall execute a counterpart to the LLC Agreement. Prior
to its admission to Borrower as Special Member, Special Member shall not be a
member of Borrower.

         Upon the occurrence of any event that causes the Member to cease to be
a member of Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the personal
representative of Member shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of
the event that terminated the continued membership of Member in Borrower, agree
in writing (i) to continue Borrower and (ii) to the

                                     - 52 -

<PAGE>

admission of the personal representative or its nominee or designee, as the case
may be, as a substitute member of Borrower, effective as of the occurrence of
the event that terminated the continued membership of Member of Borrower in
Borrower. Any action initiated by or brought against Member or Special Member
under any Creditors Rights Laws shall not cause Member or Special Member to
cease to be a member of Borrower and upon the occurrence of such an event, the
business of Borrower shall continue without dissolution. The LLC Agreement shall
provide that each of Member and Special Member waives any right it might have to
agree in writing to dissolve Borrower upon the occurrence of any action
initiated by or brought against Member or Special Member under any Creditors
Rights Laws, or the occurrence of an event that causes Member or Special Member
to cease to be a member of Borrower.

         SECTION 6.2. CHANGE OF NAME, IDENTITY OR STRUCTURE

         Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed (a) Borrower's name,
(b) Borrower's identity (including its trade name or names), (c) Borrower's
principal place of business set forth on the first page of this Agreement, (d)
the corporate, partnership or other organizational structure of Borrower, each
SPE Component Entity (if any), or Borrower Principal, (e) Borrower's state of
organization, or (f) Borrower's organizational identification number, without in
each case notifying Lender of such change in writing at least thirty (30) days
prior to the effective date of such change and, in the case of a change in
Borrower's structure, without first obtaining the prior written consent of
Lender. In addition, Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed any
organizational documents of Borrower or any SPE Component Entity (if any) if
such change would adversely impact the covenants set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section 6.4 hereof. Borrower authorizes Lender to file any financing statement
or financing statement amendment required by Lender to establish or maintain the
validity, perfection and priority of the security interest granted herein. At
the request of Lender, Borrower shall execute a certificate in form satisfactory
to Lender listing the trade names under which Borrower intends to operate the
Property, and representing and warranting that Borrower does business under no
other trade name with respect to the Property. If Borrower does not now have an
organizational identification number and later obtains one, or if the
organizational identification number assigned to Borrower subsequently changes,
Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of such organizational identification
number or change.

         SECTION 6.3. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS


         Borrower will qualify to do business and will remain in good standing
under the laws of the State as and to the extent the same are required for the
ownership, maintenance, management and operation of the Property.

         SECTION 6.4. INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

         (a)      The organizational documents of Borrower or each SPE Component
Entity (if any), as applicable, shall provide that at all times there shall be,
and Borrower shall cause there to be, at least one manager (each an "INDEPENDENT
DIRECTOR") of Borrower or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, reasonably
satisfactory to Lender each of whom are not at the time of such individual's
initial appointment, and shall not have been at any time during the preceding

Entity or any of their respective shareholders, partners, members, subsidiaries
or affiliates; (ii) a customer or creditor of, or supplier to, Borrower or any
of its respective shareholders, partners, members, subsidiaries or affiliates
who derives any of its purchases or revenue from its activities with Borrower or

Controls or is under common Control with any such shareholder, officer,
director, partner, manager, member, employee, supplier, creditor or customer; or
(iv) a member of the immediate family of any such shareholder, officer,

         (b)      The organizational documents of Borrower or each SPE Component
Entity (if any), as the case may be, shall provide that the manager of Borrower
or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, shall not take any action which,
under the terms of any articles of organization or operating agreement, as
applicable, requires an unanimous vote of the members and manager of Borrower or
such SPE Component Entity, as the case may be, unless at the time of such action
there shall be at least one manager who is an Independent Director. Borrower or
such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, will not, without the unanimous
written consent of its members and managers, including each Independent
Director, on behalf of itself or Borrower, (i) file or consent to the filing of
any petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any
applicable Creditors Rights Laws; (ii) seek or consent to the appointment of a
receiver, liquidator or any similar official; (iii) take any action that might
cause such entity to become insolvent; or (iv) make an assignment for the
benefit of creditors.

transfers shall not be deemed to be a Prohibited Transfer: (i) a transfer by
devise or descent or by operation of law upon the death of a member, partner or
shareholder of a Restricted Party; (ii) the Sale or Pledge, in one or a series
of transactions, of not more than forty-nine percent (49%) in the aggregate of
the stock, limited partnership interests or non-managing membership interests
(as the case may be) in Borrower; provided, however, no such transfers shall
result in a change in Control in the Restricted Party or change in control of
the Property, and as a condition to each such transfer, Lender shall receive not
less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of such proposed transfer or
(iii) the sale, transfer or issuance of stock in MHC provided that MHC is listed
on the New York Stock Exchange or such other nationally recognized stock
exchange. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any transfer that results in any Person
owning in excess of forty-nine percent (49%) of the ownership interest in a
Restricted Party shall comply with the requirements of Section 7.4 hereof,
provided however, that with respect to transfers provided for in subsection
(a)(iii) hereof, Borrower shall not be required to deliver a revised substantive
non-consolidation opinion to Lender in connection with any such transfers.

         (b)      In addition to the foregoing and supplementing subsection (a)
above, Lender's prior written consent shall not be required with respect to (i)
direct or indirect transfers of interests in Borrower among MHC, MHCOP and their
Affiliates, (ii) transfers of limited partnership interests in MHCOP, provided
that MHC or an MHC Subsidiary remains the controlling general partner of MHCOP,
(iii) the merger or consolidation of MHC or MHCOP without regard to whether MHC
or MHCOP, as applicable, is the surviving entity or (iv) MHC's contribution of
ownership interests in MHCOP to a MHC Subsidiary, provided that with respect to
the transfers set forth in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, the Property
shall continue to be managed by Manager or a Qualified Manager and Borrower and
any SPE Component Entity shall continue to comply with Article 6 hereof.
Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in Section 7.4 hereof, Borrower shall
not be required to deliver a revised substantive non-consolidation opinion to
Lender in connection with any transfers permitted under this subsection
(b)(ii),(iii) and (iv). "MHC SUBSIDIARY" means an entity (A) in which MHC
directly owns at least a ninety-five percent (95%) interest and (B) that is
under the Control of MHC.

         SECTION 7.4. LENDER'S RIGHTS

         Lender reserves the right to condition the consent to a Prohibited
Transfer requested hereunder upon (a) a modification of the terms hereof and an
assumption of the Note and the other Loan Documents as so modified by the
proposed Prohibited Transfer, (b) receipt of payment of a transfer fee equal to
one percent (1%) of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and all of
Lender's expenses incurred in connection with such Prohibited Transfer, (c)
receipt of written confirmation from the Rating Agencies that the Prohibited
Transfer will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
initial, or if higher, then current ratings issued in connection with a
Securitization, or if a Securitization has not occurred, any ratings to be
assigned in connection with a Securitization, (d) the proposed transferee's
continued compliance with the covenants set forth in this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the covenants in Article 6) and the other Loan Documents,
(e) a new manager for the Property and a new management agreement satisfactory
to Lender, and (f) the satisfaction of such other conditions and/or legal
opinions as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion to be in the interest
of Lender. All expenses incurred by Lender shall be payable by Borrower whether
or not Lender consents to the Prohibited Transfer. Lender shall not be required
to demonstrate any actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of
default hereunder in order to declare the Debt immediately due and payable upon
a Prohibited Transfer made without Lender's consent. This provision shall apply
to each and every Prohibited Transfer, whether or not Lender has consented to
any previous Prohibited Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 7.4, in the event a substantive non-consolidation
opinion was delivered to Lender and the Rating Agencies in connection with the
closing of the Loan, and if any Sale or Pledge permitted under this Article 7
results in any Person and its Affiliates owning in excess of forty-nine percent
(49%) of the ownership interests in a Restricted Party, Borrower shall, prior to
such transfer, and in addition to any other requirement for Lender consent
contained herein, deliver a revised substantive non-consolidation opinion to
Lender reflecting such Prohibited Transfer, which opinion shall be in form,
scope and substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating
Agencies.

         SECTION 7.5. ASSUMPTION


         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 7, Lender
shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a transfer of the Property in its
entirety to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, any Person (a
"TRANSFEREE") and Lender shall release Borrower and Borrower Principal from
their obligations under the Loan (to the extent such obligations arise from
events occurring after the date of the assumption), provided that each of the
following terms and conditions are satisfied:

         (a)      no Default or Event of Default has occurred;

         (b)      Borrower shall have (i) delivered written notice to Lender of
the terms of such prospective transfer not less than sixty (60) days before the
date on which such transfer is scheduled to close and, concurrently therewith,
all such information concerning the proposed Transferee as Lender shall
reasonably require and (ii) paid to Lender a non-refundable processing fee in
the amount of $10,000 (which fee shall be credited against the assumption fee
payable in connection with such assumption). Lender shall have the right to
approve or disapprove the proposed transfer based on its then current
underwriting and credit requirements for similar loans secured by similar
properties which loans are sold in the secondary market, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld. In determining whether to give or withhold its approval
of the proposed transfer, Lender shall consider the experience and track record
of Transferee and its principals in owning and operating facilities similar to
the Property, the financial strength of Transferee and its principals, the
general business standing of Transferee and its principals and Transferee's and
its principals' relationships and experience with contractors, vendors, tenants,
lenders and other business entities; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
Lender's agreement to consider the foregoing factors in determining whether to
give or withhold such approval, such approval shall be given or withheld based
on what Lender determines to be commercially reasonable and, if given, may be
given subject to such conditions as Lender may deem reasonably appropriate;

         (c)      Borrower shall have paid to Lender, concurrently with the
closing of such transfer, (i) a non-refundable assumption fee in an amount equal
to one percent (1.0%) of the then outstanding principal balance of the Note
(subject to credit for any previously paid non-refundable processing fees), and
(ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred by Lender in connection with the transfer;

         (d)      Transferee assumes and agrees to pay the Debt as and when due
subject to the provisions of Article 15 hereof and, prior to or concurrently
with the closing of such transfer, Transferee and its constituent partners,
members or shareholders as Lender may require, shall execute, without any cost
or expense to Lender, such documents and agreements as Lender shall reasonably
require to evidence and effectuate said assumption;

         (e)      Borrower and Transferee, without any cost to Lender, shall
furnish any information requested by Lender for the preparation of, and shall
authorize Lender to file, new financing statements and financing statement
amendments and other documents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, and shall execute any additional documents reasonably requested by Lender;

                                     - 57 -

<PAGE>

         (f)      Borrower shall have delivered to Lender, without any cost or
expense to Lender, such endorsements to Lender's Title Insurance Policy insuring
that fee simple or leasehold title to the Property, as applicable, is vested in
Transferee (subject to Permitted Encumbrances), hazard insurance endorsements or
certificates and other similar materials as Lender may deem necessary at the
time of the transfer, all in form and substance satisfactory to Lender;

         (g)      Transferee shall have furnished to Lender, if Transferee is a
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, all
appropriate papers evidencing Transferee's organization and good standing, and
the qualification of the signers to execute the assumption of the Debt, which
papers shall include certified copies of all documents relating to the
organization and formation of Transferee and of the entities, if any, which are
partners or members of Transferee. Transferee and such constituent partners,
members or shareholders of Transferee (as the case may be), as Lender shall
require, shall comply with the covenants set forth in Article 6 hereof;

         (h)      Transferee shall assume the obligations of Borrower under any
Management Agreement or provide a new management agreement with a new manager
which meets with the requirements of Section 5.14 hereof and assign to Lender as
additional security such new management agreement;

         (i)      Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
Lender and its counsel (A) that Transferee's formation documents provide for the
matters described in subparagraph (g) above, (B) that the assumption of the Debt
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and that the Note, the
Mortgage, this Agreement, the assumption agreement and the other Loan Documents
are valid, binding and enforceable against Transferee in accordance with their
terms, (C) that Transferee and any entity which is a controlling stockholder,
member or general partner of Transferee, have been duly organized, and are in
existence and good standing, and (E) with respect to such other matters as
Lender may reasonably request;

         (j)      if required by Lender, Lender shall have received confirmation
in writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that
the transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

         (k)      Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale pursuant to
which the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject to the
satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Section 7.5; and

         (l)      in the event a substantive non-consolidation opinion was
delivered to Lender in connection with the closing of the Loan, Transferee
shall, prior to such transfer, deliver a new or updated substantive
non-consolidation opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and
substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of the Property in its entirety
to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, a Transferee pursuant to this
Section 7.5 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of Lender to
consent to any subsequent transfer of the Property. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 7.5, prior to a Securitization

                                     - 58 -

<PAGE>

Lender's consent to any transfer of the Property and assumption of the Loan
pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall not be required if the consideration to be
paid to Borrower by the proposed Transferee is less than the appraised value of
the Property as determined by Lender.

         SECTION 7.6. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION 7.7. ASSUMPTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN TRANSFERS TO
AFFILIATES.

by, an Affiliate of Borrower (i) in which Borrower Principal owns, directly or

Affiliate Transferee as Lender shall reasonably require and (ii) paid to Lender
a non-refundable processing fee in the amount of $10,000;

         (c)      Borrower shall have paid to Lender all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred
by Lender in connection with the transfer and assumption;

         (d)      Affiliate Transferee assumes and agrees to pay the Debt as and
when due subject to the provisions of Article 15 hereof and, prior to or
concurrently with the closing of such transfer and assumption, Affiliate
Transferee shall execute, without any cost or expense to Lender, such documents
and agreements as Lender shall reasonably require to evidence and effectuate
such transfer and assumption;

         (e)      Borrower and Affiliate Transferee, without any cost to Lender,

documents relating to the organization and formation of Affiliate Transferee and
of the entities, if any, which are partners or members of Affiliate Transferee.

constituent partners, members or shareholders of Affiliate Transferee (as the
case may be), as Lender shall require, shall comply with the covenants set forth
in Article 6 hereof;

         (g)      Affiliate Transferee shall (i) assume the obligations of
Borrower under any Management Agreement as they relate to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property, provided, however, that in the event the Affiliate
Transfer Portion of the Property is operated solely as a sewage treatment and/or
water treatment facility and operated solely by Affiliate Transferee (and
Manager does not perform any services with respect to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property), Affiliate Transferee shall not be required to assume
the obligations of Borrower under the Management Agreement, and (ii) if
applicable, execute an assignment to Lender of such Management Agreement as
additional security for the Loan;

         (h)      Affiliate Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel
satisfactory to Lender and its counsel (A) that Affiliate Transferee's formation
documents provide for the matters described in subparagraph (f) above, (B) that

other Loan Documents are valid, binding and enforceable against Affiliate
Transferee in accordance with their terms, (C) that Affiliate Transferee and any
entity which is a controlling stockholder, managing or sole member or general
partner of Affiliate Transferee, have been duly organized, and are in existence

         (i)      if required by Lender, Lender shall have received confirmation
in writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that
the transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

         (j)      Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale, if any,
pursuant to which the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject
to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Section 7.7;

         (k)      in the event an Insolvency Opinion was delivered to Lender in
connection with the closing of the Loan, Borrower and Affiliate Transferee
shall, prior to such transfer and assumption, deliver a new or updated
Insolvency Opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and
substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies;

         (l)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence which would be
satisfactory to a prudent lender that (i) the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property has been legally split or subdivided from the remainder of the
Property; (ii) after giving effect to such transfer, each of the Affiliate
Transfer Portion of the Property and the balance of the Property conforms and is
in compliance in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements and
constitutes a separate tax lot and (iii) the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property is not necessary for the Property to comply with any zoning, building,
land use or parking or other Legal Requirements applicable to the Property or
for the then current use of the Property, including, without limitation, for
access, driveways, parking, utilities or drainage or, to the extent that the
Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property is necessary for any such purposes, a
reciprocal easement agreement has been executed and recorded that would allow
the owner of the Property to

                                     - 60 -

<PAGE>

continue to use the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property to the extent
necessary for such purposes;

         (m)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender an endorsement to the Title
Insurance Policy (i) extending the effective date of the Title Insurance Policy
to the effective date of the transfer; (ii) confirming no change in the priority
of the Mortgage on the Property (including the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property) or in the amount of the insurance or the coverage of the Property
under the Title Insurance Policy; and (iii) insuring the rights and benefits
under any new or amended reciprocal easement agreement or such other agreement
required pursuant to subsection 7.7(l)(iii) hereof that has been executed and
recorded, if any. Borrower shall have delivered to Lender, without any cost or
expense to Lender, such endorsements to Lender's Title Insurance Policy insuring
that fee simple or leasehold title to the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property, as applicable, is vested in Affiliate Transferee (subject to Permitted
Encumbrances), hazard insurance endorsements or certificates and other similar
materials as Lender may deem necessary at the time of the transfer, all in form
and substance satisfactory to Lender;

         (n)      not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the
transfer and assumption, Borrower delivers to Lender approvals to the transfer
executed by any entities other than Lender holding Liens encumbering the
Property or the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property (or holding any other
interest therein that would be affected by the transfer), if and to the extent
such approval is required pursuant to the terms of any of the documents
evidencing or securing such Lien or interest;

         (o)      Borrower and Affiliate Transferee have complied with any
requirements applicable to the transfer in any Major Leases, REA's, operating
agreements, parking agreements or other similar agreements affecting the
Property or the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property and the transfer does
not violate any of the provisions of such documents in any respect that would
result in a termination (or give any other party thereto the right to
terminate), extinguishment or other loss of material right of Borrower or in a
material increase in Borrower's obligations under such documents and, to the
extent necessary to comply with such documents, the Affiliate Transferee has
assumed Borrower's obligations, if any, relating to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property under such documents; and

         (p)      if a securitization shall have occurred, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower and Affiliate
Transferee in form and substance and delivered by counsel which would be
satisfactory to a prudent lender stating, among other things, that the transfer
and assumption by Affiliate Transferee pursuant to this Section 7.7 (1) will not
directly or indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust that then holds the
Note to fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and (2) will not cause any
REMIC Trust to be an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of
1940, at Borrower's cost; and

         (q)      Borrower delivers to Lender any other information, approvals
and documents which would be required by a prudent Lender in connection with
such transfer and assumption.

         A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of a portion of the
Property to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, an Affiliate Transferee
pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right
of Lender to consent to any subsequent transfer of the

                                     - 61 -

<PAGE>

Property or assumption of the Loan. Notwithstanding any transfer and assumption
to an Affiliate Transferee pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Property and the
Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property shall be deemed a single Property for
purposes of this Agreement and the Loan.

         SECTION 7.8. ADDITIONAL PERMITTED TRANSFERS.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 7,
Borrower may grant easements, restrictions, covenants, reservations and rights
of way with respect to the Property in the ordinary course of business for water
and sewer lines, telephone and telegraph lines, electric lines and other
utilities or for other similar purposes, provided that such transfers,
conveyances or encumbrances (i) shall not impair the utility and operation of
the Property or materially adversely affect the value of the Property or
adversely affect Borrower's ability to pay the Debt or the Monthly Payment
Amount and (ii) shall be in a form that is reasonably acceptable to Lender.

         Federal Emergency Management Agency, flood hazard insurance in an
         amount equal to the maximum amount of such insurance available under
         the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection
         Act of 1973 or the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each

         for personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring
         upon, in or about the Property, with such insurance (A) to be on the

         than $2,000,000 and a per occurrence limit of not less than $1,000,000;

         conditions making such protection inadequate; and (C) to cover at least
         the following hazards: (1) premises and operations; (2) products and
         completed operations; (3) independent contractors; (4) blanket
         contractual liability; and (5) contractual liability covering the
         indemnities contained in Article 12 and Article 14 hereof to the extent
         the same is available;

                  (iii)    loss of rents insurance or business income insurance,
         as applicable, (A) with loss payable to Lender; (B) covering all risks
         required to be covered by the insurance provided for in subsection (i)
         above; and (C) which provides that after the physical loss to the
         Improvements and Personal Property occurs, the loss of rents or income,
         as applicable, will be insured until completion of Restoration or the
         expiration of twelve (12) months, whichever first occurs, and
         notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such
         period; and (D) which contains an extended period of indemnity
         endorsement which provides that after the physical loss to the
         Improvements and Personal Property has been repaired, the continued
         loss of income will be insured until such income either returns to the
         same level it was at prior to the loss, or the expiration of twelve
         (12) months from the date that the Property is repaired or replaced and
         operations are resumed, whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding
         that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period. The amount
         of such loss of rents or business income insurance, as applicable,
         shall be determined prior to the date hereof and at least once each
         year thereafter based on Borrower's reasonable estimate of the gross
         income from the Property for the succeeding period of coverage required
         above. All proceeds payable to Lender pursuant to this subsection shall
         be held by Lender and shall be applied to the obligations secured by
         the Loan Documents from time to time due and payable hereunder and
         under the Note; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall
         be deemed to relieve Borrower of its obligations to pay the obligations
         secured by the Loan Documents on the respective dates of payment
         provided for in the Note, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
         except to the extent such amounts are actually paid out of the proceeds
         of such loss of rents or business income insurance, as applicable;

                  (iv)     at all times during which structural construction,
         repairs or alterations are being made with respect to the Improvements,
         and only if the Property coverage form does not otherwise apply, (A)
         owner's contingent or protective liability insurance covering claims
         not covered by or under the terms or provisions of the above mentioned
         commercial general liability insurance policy; and (B) the insurance

         Risk Completed Value form (1) on a non-reporting basis, (2) against
         "all risks" insured against pursuant to subsection (i) above, (3)
         including permission to occupy the Property, and (4) with an agreed

                  (v)      workers' compensation, subject to the statutory
         limits of the State, and employer's liability insurance in respect of
         any work or operations on or about the Property, or in connection with
         the Property or its operation (if applicable);

                  (vi)     comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if
         applicable, in amounts as shall be reasonably required by Lender on
         terms consistent with the commercial property insurance policy required
         under subsection (i) above;

                  (vii)    excess liability insurance in an amount not less than
         $50,000,000 per occurrence on terms consistent with the commercial
         general liability insurance required under subsection (ii) above; and

                  (viii)   upon sixty (60) days' written notice, such other
         reasonable insurance and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time
         to time may reasonably request against such other insurable hazards
         which at the time are commonly insured against for property similar to
         the Property located in or around the region in which the Property is
         located.

         (b)      All insurance provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall be obtained
under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or in the
singular, the "POLICY"), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to
insurance companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The
Policies shall be issued by financially sound and responsible insurance
companies authorized to do business in the State and having a claims paying
ability rating of either (1) "AA" or better by at least two Rating Agencies, one
of which must be S&P or such other Rating Agencies approved by Lender or (2) at
least A-/VII by A.M. Best Company, Inc. The Policies described in Section 8.1(a)
shall designate Lender and its successors and assigns as additional insureds,
mortgagees and/or loss payee as deemed appropriate by Lender. To the extent such
Policies are not available as of the Closing Date, Borrower shall deliver
certified copies of all Policies to Lender not later than thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration dates of
the Policies theretofore furnished to Lender, Borrower shall deliver to Lender
certificates evidencing renewal of the Policies (such certificates, the
"INSURANCE CERTIFICATES")accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of
payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "INSURANCE PREMIUMS") and within
sixty (60) days after the expiration date of such Policies, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender renewal Policies

         (c)      Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to
the Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and
shall otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring
only the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(a).

         (d)      All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 8.1(a),
except for the Policy referenced in Section 8.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as
the insured, as its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage,
boiler and machinery, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called
New York standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing
that the loss thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

         (e)      All Policies provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall contain
clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

                                     - 64 -

<PAGE>

                  (i)      no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting
         for Borrower, or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply
         with the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a
         forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way
         affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as
         Lender is concerned;

                  (ii)     the Policies shall not be materially changed (other
         than to increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at
         least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lender and any other
         party named therein as an additional insured;

                  (iii)    the issuers thereof shall give written notice to
         Lender if the Policies have not been renewed thirty (30) days prior to
         its expiration; and

                  (iv)     Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums
         thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

         (f)      If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence
that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall
have the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Property, including, without
limitation, obtaining such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion
deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such
action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the Mortgage
and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

         SECTION 8.2. CASUALTY


         If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part in
any material respect, by fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"), Borrower shall
give prompt notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and
diligently prosecute the Restoration of the Property in accordance with Section
8.4, whether or not Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section
8.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or not such costs
are covered by insurance. Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Borrower shall adjust all claims for
Insurance Proceeds in consultation with, and approval of, Lender; provided,
however, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall
have the exclusive right to participate in the adjustment of all claims for
Insurance Proceeds.

         SECTION 8.3. CONDEMNATION


         Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of the Property of which
Borrower has knowledge and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers
served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or

                                     - 65 -

<PAGE>

otherwise (including but not limited to any transfer made in lieu of or in
anticipation of the exercise of such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the
Debt at the time and in the manner provided for its payment in the Note and in
this Agreement and the Debt shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been
actually received and applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of
collection, to the reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be
limited to the interest paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall
be entitled to receive out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided
herein or in the Note. If the Property or any portion thereof is taken by a
condemning authority, Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute
the Restoration of the Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of
Section 8.4, whether or not Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to
Section 8.4. If the Property is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to
the receipt by Lender of the Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not
a deficiency judgment on the Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied,
to receive the Award, or a portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

         SECTION 8.4. RESTORATION


         The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration
of the Property:

         (a)      If the Net Proceeds shall be less than $250,000 and the costs
of completing the Restoration shall be less than $250,000, the Net Proceeds will
be disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers to
Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily
complete with due diligence the Restoration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

         (b)      If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than $250,000 or
the costs of completing the Restoration are equal to or greater than $250,000,
Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.4. The term "NET PROCEEDS" for purposes of
this Section 8.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds
received by Lender pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (viii) as a
result of a Casualty, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("INSURANCE PROCEEDS"), or (ii) the net amount of the Award as a result
of a Condemnation, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS"), whichever the case may be.

                  (i)      The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower
         for Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                           (A)      no Event of Default shall have occurred and
                  be continuing;

                           (B)      (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are
                  Insurance Proceeds, less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
                  mobile home and/or recreational vehicle pads, as applicable,
                  on the Property shall be rendered unusable for a period in
                  excess of twelve (12) months as a result of a Casualty or (2)
                  in the event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less
                  than fifteen percent (15%) of the rentable area

                                     - 66 -

<PAGE>

                  of the Property and fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market
                  value of the Land constituting the Property is taken, such
                  land is located along the perimeter or periphery of the
                  Property, and no portion of the permanent Improvements is
                  located on such land;

                           (C)      intentionally deleted;

                           (D)      Borrower shall commence the Restoration as
                  soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than
                  sixty (60) days after such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever
                  the case may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same
                  to satisfactory completion;

                           (E)      Lender shall be satisfied that any operating
                  deficits, including all scheduled payments of principal and
                  interest under the Note, which will be incurred with respect
                  to the Property as a result of the occurrence of any such
                  Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will be
                  covered out of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
                  8.1(a)(iii) above;

                           (F)      Lender shall be satisfied that the
                  Restoration will be completed on or before the earliest to
                  occur of (1) six (6) months prior to the Maturity Date, (2)
                  the earliest date required for such completion under the terms
                  of any Major Leases, Ground Leases, if applicable, Operating
                  Leases, if applicable, or material agreements affecting the
                  Property, (3) such time as may be required under applicable
                  zoning law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or (4) the
                  expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
                  8.1(a)(iii);

                           (G)      the Property and the use thereof after the
                  Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under all
                  Legal Requirements;

                           (H)      the Restoration shall be done and completed
                  by Borrower in an expeditious and diligent fashion and in
                  compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements;

                           (I)      such Casualty or Condemnation, as
                  applicable, does not result in the loss of access to the
                  Property or the Improvements;

                           (J)      Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be
                  delivered, to Lender a signed detailed budget approved in
                  writing by Borrower's architect or engineer stating the entire
                  cost of completing the Restoration, which budget shall be
                  reasonably acceptable to Lender; and

                           (K)      the Net Proceeds together with any cash or
                  cash equivalent deposited by Borrower with Lender are
                  sufficient in Lender's reasonable judgment to cover the cost
                  of the Restoration.

                  (ii)     The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender until
         disbursements commence, and, until disbursed in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 8.4, shall constitute additional security
         for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents. The

                                     - 67 -

<PAGE>

         Net Proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by,
         Borrower on a monthly basis during the course of the Restoration in
         accordance with customary construction lending practices, upon receipt
         of evidence satisfactory to Lender that (A) all the conditions
         precedent to such advance, including those set forth in Section
         8.4(b)(i), have been satisfied, (B) all materials installed and work
         and labor performed (except to the extent that they are to be paid for
         out of the requested disbursement) in connection with the related
         Restoration item have been paid for in full, and (C) there exist no
         notices of pendency, stop orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or
         notices of intention to file same, or any other liens or encumbrances
         of any nature whatsoever on the Property which have not either been
         fully bonded to the satisfaction of Lender and discharged of record or
         in the alternative fully insured to the satisfaction of Lender by the
         title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, Insurance Proceeds from the Policies required to be
         maintained by Borrower pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii) shall be
         controlled by Lender at all times, shall not be subject to the
         provisions of this Section 8.4 and shall be used for the payment of all
         of the obligations due and payable under the Loan Documents for the
         entire time period for which any such Insurance Proceeds relate. After
         such application of the Insurance Proceeds, the remaining balance, if
         any, of any such proceeds shall be disbursed and/or applied as follows:
         (A) provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to
         Borrower and (B) upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
         Event of Default, to Operating Expenses.

                  (iii)    All plans and specifications required in connection
         with the Restoration shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in
         all respects by Lender and to the extent the Restoration relates to any
         permanent Improvements on the Property, by an independent consulting
         engineer selected by Lender (the "Restoration Consultant"). Lender
         shall have the use of the plans and specifications and all permits,
         licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with the
         Restoration. To the extent the Restoration relates to any permanent
         Improvements on the Property, the identity of the contractors,
         subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as
         the contracts in excess of $100,000 under which they have been engaged,
         shall be subject to prior review and acceptance by Lender and the
         Restoration Consultant. All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in
         connection with making the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration,
         including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
         disbursements and the Restoration Consultant's fees, shall be paid by
         Borrower.

                  (iv)     In no event shall Lender be obligated to make
         disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the
         costs actually incurred from time to time for work in place as part of
         the Restoration, as certified by the Restoration Consultant, minus the
         Restoration Retainage. The term "Restoration Retainage" shall mean an
         amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for
         work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the
         Restoration Consultant, until the Restoration has been completed. The
         Restoration Retainage shall be reduced to five percent (5%) of the
         costs incurred upon receipt by Lender of satisfactory evidence that
         fifty percent (50%) of the Restoration has been completed. The
         Restoration Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything
         to the contrary set forth above in this Section 8.4(b), be less than
         the amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors,
         subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The
         Restoration Retainage shall not be released

                                     - 68 -

<PAGE>

         until the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender that the
         Restoration has been completed in accordance with the provisions of
         this Section 8.4(b) and that all approvals necessary for the
         re-occupancy and use of the Property have been obtained from all
         appropriate Governmental Authorities, and Lender receives evidence
         satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the Restoration have been paid
         in full or will be paid in full out of the Restoration Retainage;
         provided, however, that Lender will release the portion of the
         Restoration Retainage being held with respect to any contractor,
         subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as of the date
         upon which the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender that the
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily completed
         all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with the
         provisions of the contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's
         contract, the contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the
         lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested
         by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy,
         and Lender receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy
         insuring the continued priority of the lien of the Mortgage and
         evidence of payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. If
         required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Restoration
         Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has
         issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor,
         subcontractor or materialman.

                  (v)      Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements
         of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

                  (vi)     If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed
         balance thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in
         consultation with the Restoration Consultant, as applicable, be
         sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are estimated
         to be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration,
         Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency")
         with Lender before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall
         be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be
         held by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in
         connection with the Restoration on the same conditions applicable to
         the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant
         to this Section 8.4(b) shall constitute additional security for the
         Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (vii)    The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the
         remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited
         with Lender after Borrower and the Restoration Consultant, to the
         extent applicable, certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
         completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b), and
         the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs
         incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full,
         shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default
         shall have occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this
         Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

         (c)      All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 8.4(b)(vii) may (x) be retained and applied by Lender toward the
payment of the Debt whether or not then due and

                                     - 69 -

<PAGE>

payable in such order, priority and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion
shall deem proper, or, (y) at the sole discretion of Lender, the same may be
paid, either in whole or in part, to Borrower for such purposes and upon such
conditions as Lender shall designate.

         (d)      In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage, or other transfer
of title to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt, all
right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies then in force
concerning the Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest
in the purchaser at such foreclosure, Lender or other transferee in the event of
such other transfer of title.

         SECTION  9.1. REQUIRED REPAIRS

         (a)      Borrower shall make the repairs and improvements to the
Property set forth on Schedule 2 and as more particularly described in the
Physical Conditions Report prepared in connection with the closing of the Loan

complete the Required Repairs in a good and workmanlike manner on or before the
date that is twelve (12) months from the date hereof or within such other time
frame for completion specifically set forth on Schedule 2.

         SECTION 9.2. REPLACEMENTS

         (a)      On an ongoing basis throughout the term of the Loan, Borrower

Property in good order and repair and in a good marketable condition or prevent
deterioration of the Property ("REPLACEMENTS"). Borrower shall complete all
Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as soon as commercially reasonable
after commencing to make each such Replacement.

         (b)      Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible
Account with Lender or Lender's agent to fund the Replacements (the "REPLACEMENT
RESERVE ACCOUNT"). In addition, Borrower shall deposit $4.17 monthly per pad
(the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE MONTHLY DEPOSIT") into the Replacement Reserve Account
on each Scheduled Payment Date during any Replacement Reserve Period. Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as "REPLACEMENT RESERVE FUNDS."

         SECTION 9.3. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION 9.4. REQUIRED WORK.

         Borrower shall diligently pursue all Required Repairs and Replacements
(collectively, the "REQUIRED WORK") to completion in accordance with the
following requirements:

         (a)      Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all
contracts or work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors,
contractors or other parties providing labor or materials in connection with the
Required Work to the extent such contracts or work

                                     - 70 -

<PAGE>

orders exceed $100,000. Upon Lender's request, Borrower shall assign any
contract or subcontract to Lender.

         (b)      In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion
that any Required Work is not being or has not been performed in a workmanlike
or timely manner, upon ten (10) days notice to Borrower and Borrower's failure
to commence performance of such Required Work in accordance with this Section
9.4, Lender shall have the option to withhold disbursement for such
unsatisfactory Required Work and to proceed under existing contracts or to
contract with third parties to complete such Required Work and to apply
Replacement Reserve Funds, if any, toward the labor and materials necessary to
complete such Required Work, without providing any prior notice to Borrower and
to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender upon an Event of
Default hereunder.

         (c)      In order to facilitate Lender's completion of the Required
Work, as permitted in subsection 9.4(b) above, Borrower grants Lender the right
to enter onto the Property and perform any and all work and labor necessary to
complete the Required Work and/or employ watchmen to protect the Property from
damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the extent not from the Reserve
Funds, shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower and
secured by the Mortgage. For this purpose Borrower constitutes and appoints
Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to
complete or undertake the Required Work in the name of Borrower upon Borrower's
failure to do so in a workmanlike and timely manner. Such power of attorney
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any of the
Reserve Funds for the purpose of making or completing the Required Work; (ii) to
make such additions, changes and corrections to the Required Work as shall be
reasonably necessary to complete the Required Work; (iii) to employ such
contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as shall be
required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills
and claims which are or may become Liens against the Property, or as may be
reasonably necessary for the completion of the Required Work, or for clearance
of title; (v) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of
Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to
prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Property
or the rehabilitation and repair of the Property; and (vii) to do any and every
act which Borrower would be required to do on its own behalf to fulfill the
terms of this Agreement.

         (d)      Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall: (i) make Lender responsible
for making or completing the Required Work; (ii) require Lender to expend funds
in addition to the Reserve Funds to make or complete any Required Work; (iii)
obligate Lender to proceed with the Required Work; or (iv) obligate Lender to
demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Required Work.

         (e)      Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or
inspector) or third parties performing Required Work pursuant to this Section
9.4 to enter onto the Property during normal business hours (subject to the
rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any Required
Work and all materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all plans
and shop drawings relating to such Required Work which are or may be kept at the
Property, and to

                                     - 71 -

<PAGE>

complete any Required Work made pursuant to this Section 9.4. Borrower shall
cause all contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender and Lender's
representatives or such other persons described above in connection with
inspections described in this Section 9.4 or the completion of Required Work
pursuant to this Section 9.4.

         (f)      Lender may, to the extent any Required Work would reasonably
require an inspection of the Property, inspect the Property at Borrower's
expense prior to making a disbursement of the Reserve Funds in order to verify
completion of the Required Work for which reimbursement is sought. Borrower
shall pay Lender a reasonable inspection fee not exceeding $500 for each such
inspection. Lender may require that such inspection be conducted by an
appropriate independent qualified professional selected by Lender and/or may
require a copy of a certificate of completion by an independent qualified
professional acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of the Reserve
Funds. Borrower shall pay the expense of the inspection as required hereunder,
whether such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified
professional.

         (g)      The Required Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or
any other item comprising a part of any Required Work shall be constructed,
installed or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's,
materialman's or other Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (h)      Before each disbursement of the Reserve Funds, if any, Lender
may require Borrower to provide Lender with a search of title to the Property
effective to the date of the disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's
or materialmen's or other Liens of any nature have been placed against the
Property since the date of recordation of the Mortgage and that title to the
Property is free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (i)      All Required Work shall comply with all Legal Requirements in
all material respects and applicable insurance requirements including, without
limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits, environmental
regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

         (j)      Borrower hereby assigns to Lender all rights and claims
Borrower may have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in connection
with the Required Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such
rights or claims unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

         SECTION 9.5. RELEASE OF RESERVE FUNDS

         (a)      Upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of the
requirements set forth in this Agreement, Lender shall disburse to Borrower
amounts, if any, from the Replacement Reserve Account to the extent necessary to
reimburse Borrower for the actual costs of any approved Replacements.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall Lender be required to
(x) disburse funds from any of the Reserve Accounts if an Event of Default
exists or (y) disburse funds (if any) from the Replacement Reserve Account to
reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine repairs or maintenance to the
Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from funds held in any other
Reserve Account.

                                     - 72 -

<PAGE>

         (b)      Each request for disbursement from any of the Reserve Accounts
shall be on a form provided or approved by Lender and shall (i) include copies
of invoices for all items or materials purchased and all labor or services
provided and (ii) specify (A) the Required Work for which the disbursement is
requested, (B) the quantity and price of each item purchased, if the Required
Work includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (C) the price of
all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any Required Work other than
the purchase or replacement of specific items, and (D) the cost of all
contracted labor or other services applicable to each Required Work for which
such request for disbursement is made. With each request Borrower shall certify
that all Required Work has been performed in accordance with all Legal
Requirements. Except as provided in Section 9.5(d), each request for
disbursement shall be made only after completion of the Replacement (or the
portion thereof completed in accordance with Section 9.5(d)) for which
disbursement is requested. Borrower shall provide Lender evidence satisfactory
to Lender in its reasonable judgment of such completion or performance.

         (c)      Upon Borrower's request, Lender shall disburse funds from the
Replacement Reserve Account to Borrower on a monthly basis, and Borrower shall
use such funds to pay all invoices in connection with the Required Work with
respect to which a disbursement is requested. In addition, as a condition to any
disbursement, Lender may require Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor who receives
payment in an amount equal to or greater than $10,000 for completion of its work
or delivery of its materials. Any lien waiver delivered hereunder shall conform
to all Legal Requirements and shall cover all work performed and materials
supplied (including equipment and fixtures) for the Property by that contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman through the date covered by the
current disbursement request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint check,
the release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by the previous
release of funds request).

         (d)      If (i) the cost of any item of Required Work exceeds $25,000
and (ii) the contractor performing such Required Work requires periodic payments
pursuant to terms of a written contract, a request for disbursement from the
Reserve Accounts may be made after completion of a portion of the work under
such contract, provided (A) such contract requires payment upon completion of
such portion of work, (B) the materials for which the request is made are on
site at the Property and are properly secured or have been installed in the
Property, (C) all other conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been
satisfied, and (D) in the case of a Replacement, funds remaining in the
Replacement Reserve Account are, in Lender's judgment, sufficient to complete
such Replacement and other Replacements when required.

         (e)      Borrower shall not make a request for, nor shall Lender have
any obligation to make, any disbursement from any Reserve Account more
frequently than once in any calendar month and (except in connection with the
final disbursement) in any amount less than the lesser of (i) $10,000 or (ii)
the total cost of the Required Work for which the disbursement is requested.

         (f)      Intentionally deleted.

         (g)      Intentionally deleted.

<PAGE>

         (h)      Lender's disbursement of any Reserve Funds or other
acknowledgment of completion of any Required Work in a manner satisfactory to
Lender shall not be deemed a certification or warranty by Lender to any Person
that the Required Work has been completed in accordance with Legal Requirements.

         (i)      If the funds in any Reserve Account should exceed the amount
of payments actually applied by Lender for the purposes of the account, Lender
in its sole discretion shall either return any excess to Borrower or credit such
excess against future payments to be made to that Reserve Account. In allocating
any such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on Lender's records as
being the owner of the Property.

         (j)      The insufficiency of any balance in any of the Reserve
Accounts shall not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all
preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

         (k)      INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         (l)      Upon termination of the Replacement Reserve Period or payment
in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on deposit, if any, in the
Replacement Reserve Account shall be returned to Borrower or the Person shown on
Lender's records as being the owner of the Property and no other party shall
have any right or claim thereto.

         SECTION 9.6. TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS

         Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent sufficient to discharge Borrower's obligations for the
payment of Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1
hereof (the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Borrower shall deposit into
the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account on each Scheduled Payment Date during any
Tax and Insurance Reserve Period (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender
estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months or such
higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all
such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to the earlier of (i) the date that
the same will become delinquent and (ii) the date that additional charges or
interest will accrue due to the non-payment thereof, and (b) except to the
extent Lender has waived the insurance escrow because the insurance required
hereunder is maintained under a blanket insurance Policy acceptable to Lender in
accordance with Section 8.1(c), one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that
Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months for
the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof
or such higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to
pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called
the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS"). Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance
Reserve Funds to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by
Borrower pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof. In making any
disbursement from the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account, Lender may do so
according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate
public office or tax lien service (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent
(with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such
bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale,
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim

                                     - 74 -

<PAGE>

thereof. If the amount of the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds shall exceed the
amounts due for Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section
8.1 hereof, Lender shall, in its sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower
or credit such excess against future payments to be made to the Tax and
Insurance Reserve Account. In allocating any such excess, Lender may deal with
the person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the Property. Any
amount remaining in the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account after the Debt has
been paid in full shall be returned to Borrower or the person shown on Lender's
records as being the owner of the Property and no other party shall have any
right or claim thereto. If at any time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax
and Insurance Reserve Funds are not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and
Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall
notify Borrower of such determination and Borrower shall pay to Lender any
amount necessary to make up the deficiency within ten (10) days after notice
from Lender to Borrower requesting payment thereof.

         SECTION 9.7. EXCESS CASH

         Borrower shall establish on the date hereof a sub-account of the Cash
Management Account into which Borrower shall deposit all Excess Cash on each
Scheduled Payment Date during any Cash Management Period (the "EXCESS CASH
RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"EXCESS CASH RESERVE FUNDS." Sums from the Excess Cash Reserve Account shall be
disbursed to Borrower's Account upon the discontinuation of a Cash Management
Period.

         SECTION 9.8. TERRORISM RESERVE.

         Upon the occurrence of an Act of Terror (i) Borrower shall establish an
Eligible Account with Lender or Lender's agent (the "TERRORISM RESERVE ACCOUNT")
and (ii) Borrower Principal shall immediately deposit into the Terrorism Reserve
Account an amount equal to the sum of the three (3) Monthly Payment Amounts that
would be payable by Borrower for the three (3) Scheduled Payment Dates
immediately following the occurrence of such Act of Terror. Amounts so deposited
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "TERRORISM RESERVE FUNDS". "ACT OF
TERROR" shall mean any foreign acts of terrorism or similar acts of sabotage
(excluding acts of war or nuclear, chemical and biological acts) in which the
Property is directly affected by such acts. Lender shall apply Terrorism Reserve
Funds, if any, to any amounts due hereunder.

         SECTION 9.9. RESERVE FUNDS GENERALLY

         (a)      Funds on deposit in the Reserve Accounts shall be held by
Lender or any Loan servicer, as applicable, and invested in Permitted
Investments as directed by Lender, and interest shall be credited to Borrower.
All such interest shall be and become part of the applicable Reserve Accounts
and shall be disbursed in accordance with Section 9.5 above, provided, however,
that Lender may, at its election, retain any such interest for its own account
for application to the Debt in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default. Borrower
agrees that it shall include all interest on the applicable Reserve Funds as the
income of Borrower (and, if Borrower is a partnership or other pass-through
entity, the partners, members or beneficiaries of Borrower, as

                                     - 75 -

<PAGE>

the case may be), and shall be the owner of the applicable Reserve Funds for
federal and applicable state and local tax purposes.

         (b)      Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security
interest in, and assigns and pledges to Lender, each of the Reserve Accounts and
any and all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts as
additional security for payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in
accordance herewith, the Reserve Accounts and the Reserve Funds shall constitute
additional security for the Debt. The provisions of this Section 9.9 are
intended to give Lender or any subsequent holder of the Loan "control" of the
Reserve Accounts within the meaning of the UCC.

         (c)      The Reserve Accounts and any and all Reserve Funds now or
hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts shall be subject to the exclusive
dominion and control of Lender, which shall hold the Reserve Accounts and any or
all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Borrower shall have no right of
withdrawal from the Reserve Accounts or any other right or power with respect to
the Reserve Accounts or any or all of the Reserve Funds now or hereafter
deposited in the Reserve Accounts, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement.

         (d)      Lender shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Borrower,
without charge, an annual accounting of each Reserve Account in the normal
format of Lender or its loan servicer, showing credits and debits to such
Reserve Account and the purpose for which each debit to each Reserve Account was
made.

         (e)      As long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Lender shall make disbursements from the Reserve Accounts in accordance with
this Agreement. All such disbursements shall be deemed to have been expressly
pre-authorized by Borrower, and shall not be deemed to constitute the exercise
by Lender of any remedies against Borrower unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and Lender has expressly stated in writing its intent
to proceed to exercise its remedies as a secured party, pledgee or lienholder
with respect to the Reserve Accounts.

         (f)      If any Event of Default occurs, Borrower shall immediately
lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve Accounts until
the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured to
Lender's satisfaction, or (ii) the payment in full of the Debt. In addition, at
Lender's election, Borrower shall lose all of its rights to receive interest on
the Reserve Accounts during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured party,
pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Reserve Accounts. Without limitation
of the foregoing, during the continuance of any Event of Default, Lender may use
and disburse the Reserve Funds (or any portion thereof) for any of the following
purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited to, principal
prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or partial
prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses, fees,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other
Loan Documents;

                                     - 76 -

<PAGE>

(D) payment of any item from any of the Reserve Accounts as required or
permitted under this Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted by applicable
law; provided, however, that any such application of funds shall not cure or be
deemed to cure any Event of Default. Without limiting any other provisions
hereof, each of the remedial actions described in the immediately preceding
sentence shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable exercise of Lender's
rights and remedies as a secured party with respect to the Reserve Funds and
shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a foreclosure of a
statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Lender to
apply all or any portion of the Reserve Funds to effect a cure of any Event of
Default, or to pay the Debt, or in any specific order of priority. The exercise
of any or all of Lender's rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any
of the other Loan Documents shall not in any way prejudice or affect Lender's
right to initiate and complete a foreclosure under the Mortgage.

         (g)      The Reserve Funds shall not constitute escrow or trust funds
and may be commingled with other monies held by Lender. Notwithstanding anything
else herein to the contrary, Lender may commingle in one or more Eligible
Accounts any and all funds controlled by Lender, including, without limitation,
funds pledged in favor of Lender by other borrowers, whether for the same
purposes as the Reserve Accounts or otherwise. Without limiting any other
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Reserve Accounts
may be established and held in such name or names as Lender or its loan
servicer, as agent for Lender, shall deem appropriate, including, without
limitation, in the name of Lender or such loan servicer as agent for Lender. In
the case of any Reserve Account which is held in a commingled account, Lender or
its loan servicer, as applicable, shall maintain records sufficient to enable it
to determine at all times which portion of such account is related to the Loan.
The Reserve Accounts are solely for the protection of Lender. With respect to
the Reserve Accounts, Lender shall have no responsibility beyond the allowance
of due credit for the sums actually received by Lender or beyond the
reimbursement or payment of the costs and expenses for which such accounts were
established in accordance with their terms. Upon assignment of the Loan by
Lender, any Reserve Funds shall be turned over to the assignee and any
responsibility of Lender as assignor shall terminate. The requirements of this
Agreement concerning Reserve Accounts in no way supersede, limit or waive any
other rights or obligations of the parties under any of the Loan Documents or
under applicable law.

         (h)      Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written
consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the
Reserve Accounts or the Reserve Funds deposited therein or permit any Lien to
attach thereto, except for the security interest granted in this Section 9.9, or
any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC Financing Statements, except those
naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

         (i)      Borrower will maintain the security interest created by this
Section 9.9 as a first priority perfected security interest and will defend the
right, title and interest of Lender in and to the Reserve Accounts and the
Reserve Funds against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. At any
time and from time to time, upon the written request of Lender, and at the sole
expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and duly execute and deliver such
further instruments and documents and will take such further actions as Lender
reasonably may request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted.

                                 CASH MANAGEMENT

         SECTION 10.1. LOCKBOX ACCOUNT AND CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT

         (a)      Borrower acknowledges and confirms that Borrower has
established, and Borrower covenants that it shall maintain, (i) pursuant to the
Lockbox Agreement, an Eligible Account into which Borrower shall, and shall
cause Manager to, deposit or cause to be deposited, all Rents and other revenue
from the Property (such account, all funds at any time on deposit therein and
any proceeds, replacements or substitutions of such account or funds therein,
are referred to herein as the "LOCKBOX ACCOUNT"), and (ii) an Eligible Account
with Lender or any Loan servicer, as applicable, into which funds in the Lockbox
Account shall be transferred pursuant to the terms of Section 10.2(b) hereof
(such account, the sub-accounts thereof, all funds at any time on deposit
therein and any proceeds, replacements or substitutions of such account or funds
therein, are referred to herein as the "CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT").

         (b)      The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall each be
in the name of Borrower for the benefit of Lender, as secured party, provided
that Borrower shall be the owner of all funds on deposit in such accounts for
federal and applicable state and local tax purposes. Sums on deposit in the Cash
Management Account shall not be invested except in such Permitted Investments as
determined and directed by Lender and all income earned thereon shall be the
income of Borrower and be applied to and become part of the Cash Management
Account, to be disbursed in accordance with this Article 10. Neither Lockbox
Bank nor Lender shall have any liability for any loss resulting from the
investment of funds in Permitted Investments in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

         (c)      The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall be
subject to the exclusive dominion and control of Lender and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other party
claiming on behalf of, or through, Borrower or Manager, shall have any right of
withdrawal therefrom or any other right or power with respect thereto.

         (d)      Borrower agrees to pay the customary fees and expenses of
Lockbox Bank (incurred in connection with maintaining the Lockbox Account) and
Lender (incurred in connection with maintaining the Cash Management Account) and
any successors thereto in connection therewith, as separately agreed by them
from time to time.

         (e)      Lender shall be responsible for the performance only of such
duties with respect to the Cash Management Account as are specifically set forth
herein, and no duty shall be implied from any provision hereof. Lender shall not
be under any obligation or duty to perform any act which would involve it in
expense or liability or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof, or to
advance any of its own monies. Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender and its
directors, employees, officers and agents harmless from and against any loss,
cost or damage (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by such parties in connection with the Cash Management
Account other than such as result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Lender or intentional nonperformance by Lender of its obligations
under this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.2. DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS

         (a)      Borrower represents, warrants and covenants that:

                  (i)      Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
         Borrower shall notify and advise Manager to deposit directly into the
         Lockbox Account all payments of Rents or any other item payable under
         such Leases pursuant to an instruction letter in the form of Exhibit A
         attached hereto (a "RENT DIRECTION LETTER"). If Borrower fails to
         provide any such notice (and without prejudice to Lender's rights with
         respect to such default), Lender shall have the right, and Borrower
         hereby grants to Lender a power of attorney (which power of attorney
         shall be coupled with an interest and irrevocable so long as any
         portion of the Debt remains outstanding), to sign and deliver a Rent
         Direction Letter;

                  (ii)     Borrower shall, and shall cause Manager to, instruct
         all Persons that maintain open accounts with Borrower or Manager with
         respect to the Property or with whom Borrower or Manager does business
         on an "accounts receivable" basis with respect to the Property to
         deliver all payments due under such accounts to the Lockbox Account.
         Neither Borrower nor Manager shall direct any such Person to make
         payments due under such accounts in any other manner;

                  (iii)    All Rents or other income from the Property shall (A)
         be deemed additional security for payment of the Debt and shall be held
         in trust for the benefit, and as the property, of Lender, (B) not be
         commingled with any other funds or property of Borrower or Manager, and
         (C) if received by Borrower notwithstanding the delivery of a Rent
         Direction Letter, be deposited in the Lockbox Account within one (1)
         Business Day of receipt;

                  (iv)     Without the prior written consent of Lender, so long
         as any portion of the Debt remains outstanding, Borrower shall not
         terminate, amend, revoke or modify any Rent Direction Letter in any
         manner whatsoever or direct or cause Manager to pay any amount in any
         manner other than as provided in the Rent Direction Letter; and

                  (v)      So long as any portion of the Debt remains
         outstanding, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other Person shall open
         or maintain any accounts other than the Lockbox Account into which
         revenues from the ownership and operation of the Property are
         deposited. The foregoing shall not prohibit Borrower from utilizing one
         or more separate accounts for the disbursement or retention of funds
         that have been transferred to Borrower pursuant to the express terms of
         this Agreement.

         (b)      Provided no Event of Default has occurred, at all times other
 than during a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall, on each Business Day,
 withdraw all collected and available funds in excess of $2,500 (funds are not
 available if, in the reasonable determination of Lockbox Bank, such funds are
 subject to a bank hold or freeze (pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements),
 dispute or legal process preventing their withdrawal) held in the Lockbox
 Account and disburse such funds to the Borrower Account. Upon the occurrence
 and during the continuance of a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall (and
 Lender shall instruct Lockbox Bank to), on each Business Day, withdraw all
 collected and available funds (funds are

                                     - 79 -

<PAGE>

 not available if, in the reasonable determination of Lockbox Bank, such funds
 are subject to a bank hold or freeze (pursuant to applicable Legal
 Requirements), dispute or legal process preventing their withdrawal) held in
 the Lockbox Account and transfer by wire transfer or other method of transfer
 mutually agreeable to Lockbox Bank and Lender to the Cash Management Account to
 be held until disbursed by Lender pursuant to Section 10.2(c). Provided no
 Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the earlier to occur of
 (a) payment in full of the Debt or (b) the discontinuation of a Cash Management
 Period, Lockbox Bank shall no longer transfer funds in the Lockbox Account to
 the Cash Management Account in accordance with this subsection (b) and shall
 transfer funds (if any) in the Lockbox Account to the Borrower Account or, upon
 payment in full of the Debt, as otherwise directed by Borrower. In the event a
 Cash Management Period occurs three times during the term of the Loan and if
 required by the Lockbox Bank, Borrower shall not be entitled to any rights to
 the withdrawal of funds from the Lockbox Account during the remaining term of
 the Loan, the Cash Management Period shall continue, and Lender shall continue
 to have the right to the withdrawal of funds from the Lockbox Account until the
 Debt is paid in full.

         (c)      During a Cash Management Period, on each Scheduled Payment
 Date (and if such day is not a Business Day, then the immediately preceding day
 which is a Business Day) commencing the month immediately following the month
 during which the Cash Management Period commences, Borrower hereby irrevocably
 authorizes Lender to withdraw or allocate to the sub-accounts of the Cash
 Management Account, as the case may be, amounts received in the Cash Management
 Account, in each case to the extent that sufficient funds remain therefor and
 Lender may, at its option, withdraw or allocate such funds as follows:

                  (i)      during a Tax and Insurance Reserve Period, funds
         sufficient to pay the monthly deposits to the Tax and Insurance Reserve
         Account shall be allocated to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account to
         be held and disbursed in accordance with Section 9.6;

                  (ii)     funds sufficient to pay the Monthly Payment Amount
         (or an amount up to the entire amount of the Debt upon an acceleration
         of the Loan in accordance with the terms hereof), shall be withdrawn
         and paid to Lender;

                  (iii)    during a Replacement Reserve Period, funds sufficient
         to pay the Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit shall be allocated to
         the Replacement Reserve Account to be held and disbursed in accordance
         with Section 9.5;

                  (iv)     funds sufficient to pay any interest accruing at the
         Default Rate, late payment charges, if any, and any other sums due and
         payable to Lender under any of the Loan Documents, shall be withdrawn
         and paid to Lender and applied against such items;

                  (v)      funds sufficient to pay Lockbox Bank for all costs
         and expenses incurred by Lockbox Bank in connection with the
         maintenance and administration of the Lockbox Account;

                  (vi)     funds sufficient to pay Lender or any Loan servicer,
         as applicable, the customary fees and expenses incurred in connection
         with maintaining the Cash Management Account; and

                                     - 80 -
<PAGE>

                  (vii)    funds in an amount equal to the balance (if any)
         remaining on deposit in the Cash Management Account after the foregoing
         withdrawals and allocations shall be deposited in the Excess Cash
         Reserve Account to be held and disbursed in accordance with Section
         9.7. Upon the discontinuance of a Cash Management Period, funds (if
         any) on deposit in the Excess Cash Reserve Account shall be transferred
         to Borrower's Account.

         (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Borrower
 acknowledges that Borrower is responsible for monitoring the sufficiency of
 funds deposited in the Cash Management Account and that Borrower is liable for
 any deficiency in available funds, irrespective of whether Borrower has
 received any account statement, notice or demand from Lender or Lender's
 servicer. If the amount on deposit in the Cash Management Account is
 insufficient to make all of the withdrawals and allocations described in
 Section 10.2(c)(i) through (vi) above, Borrower shall deposit such deficiency
 into the Cash Management Account within five (5) days (provided that such five
 day period shall not constitute a grace period for any default or Event of
 Default under this Agreement or any other Loan Document based on a failure to
 satisfy any monetary obligation provided in any Loan Document).

         (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
 an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower hereby
 irrevocably authorizes Lender to make any and all withdrawals from the Lockbox
 Account and Cash Management Account and transfers between any of the Reserve
 Accounts as Lender shall determine in Lender's sole and absolute discretion and
 Lender may use all funds contained in any such accounts for any purpose,
 including but not limited to repayment of the Debt in such order, proportion
 and priority as Lender may determine in its sole and absolute discretion.
 Lender's right to withdraw and apply funds as stated herein shall be in
 addition to all other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this
 Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 10.3. SECURITY INTEREST

         (a)      To secure the full and punctual payment of the Debt and
 performance of all obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
 Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a
 first-priority perfected security interest in the Lockbox Account and Cash
 Management Account, all interest, cash, checks, drafts, certificates and
 instruments, if any, from time to time deposited or held therein, any and all
 amounts invested in Permitted Investments, and all "proceeds" (as defined in
 the UCC as in effect in the state in which the Lockbox Account and Cash
 Management Account are located or maintained) of any or all of the foregoing.
 Furthermore, Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of
 Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any of the
 foregoing or permit any Lien to attach thereto or any levy to be made thereon
 or any UCC Financing Statements to be filed with respect thereto. Borrower will
 maintain the security interest created by this Section 10.3(a) as a first
 priority perfected security interest and will defend the right, title and
 interest of Lender in and to the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account
 against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever.

         (b)      Borrower authorizes Lender to file any financing statement or
 statements required by Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection
 and priority of the security interest

                                     - 81 -

<PAGE>

 granted herein in connection with the Lockbox Account and Cash Management
 Account. Borrower agrees that at any time and from time to time, at the expense
 of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and duly execute and deliver all further
 instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be necessary
 or desirable, or that Lender may reasonably request, in order to perfect and
 protect any security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby
 (including, without limitation, any security interest in and to any Permitted
 Investments) or to enable Lender to exercise and enforce its rights and
 remedies hereunder.

         (c)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
 Default, Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured
 party, pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Lockbox Account and Cash
 Management Account. Without limitation of the foregoing, upon any Event of
 Default, Lender may use the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account for any
 of the following purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not
 limited to, principal prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such
 full or partial prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all
 losses, fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable
 legal fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of
 Default; (C) payment of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and
 remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or
 under any of the other Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item as required or
 permitted under this Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted by
 applicable law; provided, however, that any such application of funds shall not
 cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default. Without limiting any other
 provisions hereof, each of the remedial actions described in the immediately
 preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable exercise of
 Lender's rights and remedies as a secured party with respect to the Lockbox
 Account and Cash Management Account and shall not in any event be deemed to
 constitute a setoff or a foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in
 this Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Lockbox
 Account or Cash Management Account to effect a cure of any Event of Default, or
 to pay the Debt, or in any specific order of priority. The exercise of any or
 all of Lender's rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any of the
 other Loan Documents shall not in any way prejudice or affect Lender's right to
 initiate and complete a foreclosure under the Mortgage.

         SECTION 10.4. DEFINITIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, For purposes of this Article 10 only, Business Day shall mean
a day on which Lender and Lockbox Bank are both open for the conduct of
substantially all of their respective banking business at the office in the city
in which the Note is payable, with respect to Lender and at the office in the
city where the Lockbox Account is maintained, with respect to Lockbox Bank (in
both instances, excluding Saturdays and Sundays).

including but not limited to any removal, remedial or corrective action; (iv)
any past, present or threatened non-compliance or violations of any
Environmental Laws (or permits issued pursuant to any Environmental Law) in

         (b)      Upon written request by any Indemnified Party, Borrower and
Borrower Principal shall defend same (if requested by any Indemnified Party, in
the name of the Indemnified Party) by attorneys and other professionals approved
by the Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Indemnified
Parties may, in their reasonable discretion, engage their own attorneys and
other professionals to defend or assist them, and, at the option of Indemnified
Parties, their attorneys shall control the resolution of any claim or

therewith.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, Borrower shall have no

subsection (a) above to the extent that Borrower can conclusively prove both
that such Losses were caused solely by actions, conditions or events that
occurred after the date that Lender (or any purchaser at a foreclosure sale)
actually acquired title to the Property and that such Losses were not caused by
the direct or indirect actions of Borrower, Borrower Principal, or any partner,
member, principal, officer, director, trustee or manager of Borrower or Borrower
Principal or any employee, agent, contractor or Affiliate of Borrower or
Borrower Principal. The obligations and liabilities of Borrower and Borrower
Principal under this Section 12.6 shall fully survive indefinitely
notwithstanding any termination, satisfaction, assignment, entry of a judgment
of foreclosure, exercise of any power of sale, or delivery of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure of the Mortgage, provided however, that in the event (i) the Debt is
paid in full in the ordinary course, (ii) Borrower delivers to Lender a Phase I
environmental site assessment with respect to the Property which concludes that
the Property does not contain any Hazardous Materials and is not subject to any
significant risk of contamination from any off site Hazardous Materials in
violation of the representations, warranties, and covenants set forth in this
Article 12 Agreement, as determined by Lender, (iii) no Event of Default exists
and is continuing, (iv) Lender has not exercised any of its remedies under
Section 11.2 hereof to obtain an entry of a judgment of foreclosure, exercise
any power of sale, or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage,
(v) as of the date of determination, all of the representations and warranties
contained in this Article 12 are true and correct, as determined by Lender and
(vi) there has been no change, between the date hereof and the date the Loan is
paid in full, in any Environmental Law which would impose liability on a
mortgagee or lender with respect to any Environmental Problem notwithstanding
the payment in full of the Loan, Borrower and Borrower Principal shall be
released from its obligations under this Agreement on the third (3rd)
anniversary of the date on which items (i)-(vi) above are satisfied.

                                   ARTICLE 13

         SECTION 13.1. TRANSFER OF LOAN

         Lender may, at any time, sell, transfer or assign the Loan Documents,
or grant participations therein ("PARTICIPATIONS") or syndicate the Loan
("SYNDICATION") or issue mortgage pass-through certificates or other securities
evidencing a beneficial interest in a rated or unrated public offering or
private placement ("SECURITIES") (a Syndication or the issuance of
Participations and/or Securities, a "SECURITIZATION").

         SECTION 13.2. DELEGATION OF SERVICING

         At the option of Lender, the Loan may be serviced by a servicer/trustee
selected by Lender and Lender may delegate all or any portion of its

servicer/trustee.

         SECTION 13.3. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

         Lender may forward to each purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer
of, and each participant, or investor in, the Loan, or any Participations and/or

respective successors (collectively, the "INVESTOR") or any Rating Agency rating

and any organization maintaining databases on the underwriting and performance
of commercial mortgage loans, all documents and information which Lender now has
or may hereafter acquire relating to the Debt and to Borrower, any managing
member or general partner thereof, Borrower Principal, any SPE Component Entity
(if any) and the Property, including financial statements, whether furnished by
Borrower or otherwise, as Lender determines necessary or desirable. Borrower
irrevocably waives any and all rights it may have under applicable Legal
Requirements to prohibit such disclosure, including but not limited to any right

Section 13.3 and paragraph 5 of that certain letter agreement dated as of August

Borrower Principal (the "ADVISORY AGREEMENT") (the provisions of which are set
forth on Schedule 4, attached hereto) relating to, among other things,
confidentiality and the dissemination of certain confidential information, the
provisions of the Advisory Agreement shall control.

         SECTION 13.4. COOPERATION

         At the request of the holder of the Note and, to the extent not already
required to be provided by Borrower under this Agreement, Borrower and Borrower
Principal shall use reasonable efforts to provide updates of the information (i)
delivered by Borrower under Section 3.20 hereof or (ii) required to be delivered
by Borrower under Article 5 hereof, including, without limitation, to:

         (a)      provide updated financial, budget and other information with
respect to the Property, Borrower, Borrower Principal and Manager (all of the
foregoing being referred to as the "PROVIDED INFORMATION");

         (b)      make changes to the organizational documents of Borrower, any
SPE Component Entity and their respective principals;

         (c)      at Borrower's expense, cause counsel to render or update
existing opinion letters as to enforceability and non-consolidation, which may
be relied upon by the holder of the Note, the Rating Agencies and their
respective counsel, which shall be dated as of the closing date of the
Securitization;

         (d)      at Lender's sole cost and expense, permit site inspections in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, appraisals, market studies and
other due diligence investigations of the Property, as may be reasonably
requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or as may be
necessary or appropriate in connection with the Securitization;

         (e)      intentionally deleted;

         (f)      execute such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be
requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or otherwise to
effect the Securitization including, without limitation, bifurcation of the Loan
into two or more components and/or separate notes and/or creating a
senior/subordinate note structure; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be
required to modify or amend any Loan Document if such modification or amendment
would

                                     - 90 -

<PAGE>

(i) change the interest rate, the stated maturity or the amortization of
principal set forth in the Note, except in connection with a bifurcation of the
Loan which may result in varying fixed interest rates and amortization
schedules, but which shall have the same initial weighted average coupon of the
original Note, or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of Borrower, modify or amend
any other material economic term of the Loan, or (iii) in the reasonable
judgment of Borrower, materially increase Borrower's obligations and liabilities
under the Loan Documents;

         (g)      deliver to Lender and/or any Rating Agency one or more
certificates executed by an officer of Borrower certifying as to the accuracy,
as of the closing date of the Securitization, of all representations made by
Borrower in the Loan Documents as of the Closing Date or, if such
representations are no longer accurate, certifying as to what modifications to
the representations would be required to make such representations accurate as
of the closing date of the Securitization;

         (h)      have reasonably appropriate personnel participate in a bank
meeting and/or presentation for the Rating Agencies or Investors;

         (i)      cooperate with and assist Lender in obtaining ratings of the
Securities from two (2) or more of the Rating Agencies; and

         (j)      if required by any Rating Agency, deliver, at Borrower's sole
cost and expense and within fifteen (15) Business Days of Lender's request
therefore, (1) opinions relating to certain aspects of federal and Delaware law
and Borrower's status as a single member Delaware limited liability company
thereunder and (2) an Insolvency Opinion, which such opinions shall be given by
a law firm acceptable to such Rating Agency and shall otherwise be in form and
substance acceptable to such Rating Agency. Lender hereby acknowledges that
Borrower may deliver such opinions in one consolidated opinion that, together
with the Loan, addresses other Loans (made by Lender) relating to Affiliates of
Borrower, provided that such opinion adequately identifies Borrower, the
Property and other applicable matters relating to the Loan. In addition,
Borrower shall make any changes to its organizational documents to the extent
required in connection with the issuance of such opinions, provided that such
changes shall not result in an adverse economic effect to Borrower.

         All reasonable third party costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in
connection with Borrower's complying with requests made under this Section 13.4
shall be paid by Borrower. Lender shall be responsible for all of its
out-of-pocket costs in connection with a securitization.

         In the event that Borrower requests any consent or approval hereunder
and the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Documents require the receipt
of written confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to the rating on
the Securities, or, in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents
relating to a Securitization, such a rating confirmation is required in order
for the consent of Lender to be given, Borrower shall pay all of the costs and
expenses of Lender, Lender's servicer and each Rating Agency in connection
therewith, and, if applicable, shall pay any fees imposed by any Rating Agency
as a condition to the delivery of such confirmation. Lender agrees, upon
request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower and
to facilitate Borrower's efforts to obtain any such rating confirmation as
required hereunder, which cooperation shall include supplying the Rating
Agencies with copies

                                     - 91 -

<PAGE>

of reports, documents and other information and materials provided to Lender by
Borrower, provided however, that in no event shall (1) Lender be required to
incur any costs or expenses (other than de minimus costs or expenses) in
connection with such cooperation or (2) Lender's agreement hereunder to
cooperate with Borrower in obtaining a rating confirmation obligate Lender to
institute (or threaten to institute) or participate in (or threaten to
participate in) any litigation, suits, or proceedings at law or in equity
against any Rating Agency in connection with Borrower's efforts to obtain such
rating confirmation.

         SECTION 13.5. SECURITIZATION INDEMNIFICATION

         (a)      Borrower understands that certain of the Provided Information
may be included in disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization,
including, without limitation, a prospectus, prospectus supplement, offering
memorandum or private placement memorandum (each, a "DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT") and
may also be included in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or provided or made
available to investors or prospective investors in the Securities, the Rating
Agencies, and service providers relating to the Securitization. In the event
that the Disclosure Document is required to be revised prior to the sale of all
Securities, Borrower will cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the
Disclosure Document by providing all current information required to be
delivered by Borrower under Article 5 hereof necessary to keep the Disclosure
Document accurate and complete in all material respects.

         (b)      Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each of (i) a
preliminary and a final offering memorandum or private placement memorandum or
similar document (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or
presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or (ii) a preliminary
and final prospectus or prospectus supplement, as applicable, an indemnification
certificate (A) indemnifying Lender (and for purposes of this Section 13.5,
Lender hereunder shall include its officers and directors) and the Affiliate of
Lender that (i) has filed the registration statement, if any, relating to the
Securitization and/or (ii) which is acting as issuer, depositor, sponsor and/or
a similar capacity with respect to the Securitization (any Person described in
(i) or (ii), an "ISSUER PERSON") and each director and officer of any Issuer
Person, and each Person or entity who controls any Issuer Person within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "ISSUER GROUP") for any Losses to which Lender or the Issuer
Group may become subject insofar as the Losses arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained
in such sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or
presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated in such sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency
"term sheets" or presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or
necessary in order to make the statements in such sections (including any
Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Property and/or the Loan) or in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading (collectively the "SECURITIES LIABILITIES") and (B)
agreeing to reimburse Lender and the Issuer Group for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by Lender and Issuer Group in connection with
investigating or defending the Securities Liabilities; provided, however, that
Borrower will be liable in any such case under clauses (A) or (B) above only to
the extent that any such Securities Liabilities arise out of or is based upon
any such untrue statement or omission made therein in

                                     - 92 -

<PAGE>

reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished to Lender or any
member of the Issuer Group by or on behalf of Borrower in connection with the
Provided Information. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any
liability which Borrower may otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification
provided for in Clauses (A) and (B) above shall be effective in the event an
indemnification certificate certifying that Borrower has carefully examined any
preliminary or a final offering memorandum described above or prospectus or
other document (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or
presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan), as applicable,
including without limitation, the sections entitled "Special Considerations,"
and/or "Risk Factors," and "Certain Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loan," or
similar sections, and all sections relating to Borrower, Borrower Principal,
Manager, their Affiliates, the Loan, the Loan Documents and the Property, and
any risks or special considerations relating thereto, and that, to the best of
Borrower's knowledge, such sections (and any other sections reasonably
requested) do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading has been
requested by Lender and has not been provided by Borrower and shall be
applicable based on information previously provided by Borrower or its
Affiliates if Borrower does not provide such requested indemnification
certificate.

         (c)      In connection with filings under the Exchange Act or any
information provided to holders of Securities on an ongoing basis, Borrower
agrees to indemnify (i) Lender and the Issuer Group for Losses to which Lender
or the Issuer Group may become subject insofar as the Securities Liabilities
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in the
Provided Information a material fact required to be stated in the Provided
Information in order to make the statements in the Provided Information, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading and (ii)
reimburse Lender or the Issuer Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by Lender or the Issuer Group in connection with defending or
investigating the Securities Liabilities.

         (d)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 13.5 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 13.5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying
party may have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that
any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be
entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and,
to the extent that it (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the
indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party
to such indemnified party under this Section 13.5 the indemnifying party shall
be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different
from or additional to those available to the

                                     - 93 -

<PAGE>

indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to
select separate counsel to assert such legal defenses and to otherwise
participate in the defense of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or
parties. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for the expenses of more
than one such separate counsel unless an indemnified party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are different
from or additional to those available to another indemnified party.

         (e)      In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 13.5(c)
or Section 13.5(d) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be
indemnifiable under Section 13.5(c) or Section 13.5(d), the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which
the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered:
(i) the indemnified party's and Borrower's relative knowledge and access to
information concerning the matter with respect to which claim was asserted; (ii)
the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii) any
other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Lender and
Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation.

         (f)      The liabilities and obligations of Borrower, and Lender under
this Section 13.5 shall survive the satisfaction of this Agreement and the
satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

                                INDEMNIFICATIONS

         SECTION 14.1. GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out
of or in any way relating to any one or more of the following: (a) any accident,
injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on
or about the Property or any part thereof or on the adjoining sidewalks, curbs,
adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets or ways; (b) any use,
nonuse or condition in, on or about the Property or any part thereof or on the
adjoining sidewalks, curbs, adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets
or ways; (c) performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
materials or other property in respect of the Property or any part thereof; (d)
any failure of the Property to be in compliance with any Applicable Legal
Requirements; (e) any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be
asserted against Lender by reason of any alleged obligations or undertakings on
its part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants, or agreements
contained in any Lease; (f) the holding or investing of the Reserve

                                     - 94 -

Accounts or the performance of the Required Work, or Additional Replacements, or
(g) the payment of any commission, charge or brokerage fee to anyone which may
be payable in connection with the funding of the Loan (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, however, that Borrower shall not have any
obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities
arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of
Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it
violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum portion that
it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Lender.

         SECTION 14.2. MORTGAGE AND INTANGIBLE TAX INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way
relating to any tax on the making and/or recording of the Mortgage, the Note or
any of the other Loan Documents, but excluding any income, franchise or other
similar taxes.

         SECTION 14.3. ERISA INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of Losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA that may be required, in Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur,
directly or indirectly, as a result of a default under Section 4.8 or Section
5.18 of this Agreement.

         SECTION 14.4. SURVIVAL

         The obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Article 14 shall
fully survive indefinitely notwithstanding any termination, satisfaction,
assignment, entry of a judgment of foreclosure, exercise of any power of sale,
or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage.

                                   EXCULPATION

         SECTION 15.1. EXCULPATION

         (a)      Except as otherwise provided herein or in the other Loan
Documents, Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower or
Borrower Principal, as applicable, to perform and observe the obligations
contained herein or in the other Loan Documents by any action or proceeding
wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower or Borrower Principal,
except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, action for specific
performance or other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to
enforce and realize upon this Agreement, the Note,

                                     - 95 -

<PAGE>

the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, and the interest in the Property, the
Rents and any other collateral given to Lender created by this Agreement, the
Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that any
judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower
only to the extent of Borrower's interest in the Property, in the Rents and in
any other collateral given to Lender. Lender, by accepting this Agreement, the
Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, agrees that it shall not,
except as otherwise provided in this Section 15.1, sue for, seek or demand any
deficiency judgment against Borrower or Borrower Principal in any such action or
proceeding, under or by reason of or under or in connection with this Agreement,
the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents. The provisions of this
Section 15.1 shall not, however, (i) constitute a waiver, release or impairment
of any obligation evidenced or secured by this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage
or the other Loan Documents; (ii) impair the right of Lender to name Borrower or
Borrower Principal as a party defendant in any action or suit for judicial
foreclosure and sale under this Agreement and the Mortgage; (iii) affect the
validity or enforceability of any indemnity (including, without limitation,
those contained in Section 12.6, with respect to Borrower or Borrower Principal,
Section 13.5, with respect to Borrower, and Article 14 of this Agreement, with
respect to Borrower), guaranty, master lease or similar instrument made in
connection with this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan
Documents; (iv) impair the right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a
receiver; (v) impair the enforcement of the assignment of leases provisions
contained in the Mortgage; or (vi) impair the right of Lender to obtain a
deficiency judgment or other judgment on the Note against Borrower or Borrower
Principal if necessary to obtain any Insurance Proceeds or Awards to which
Lender would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement; provided however,
Lender shall only enforce such judgment to the extent of the Insurance Proceeds
and/or Awards.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 15.1 to the

case of any such mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of such Note or
other Loan Document, Borrower will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note or
other Loan Document, dated the date of such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated
Note or other Loan Document in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise
of like tenor.

         SECTION 17.2. RECORDING OF MORTGAGE, ETC.

         Borrower forthwith upon the execution and delivery of the Mortgage and

Documents creating a lien or security interest or evidencing the lien hereof
upon the Property and each instrument of further assurance to be filed,
registered or recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by
any present or future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect and
perfect the lien or security interest hereof upon, and the interest of Lender
in, the Property. Borrower will pay all taxes, filing, registration or recording
fees, and all expenses incident to the preparation, execution, acknowledgment
and/or recording of the Note, the Mortgage, the other Loan Documents, any note,
deed of trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with

         SECTION 17.4. CHANGES IN TAX, DEBT, CREDIT AND DOCUMENTARY STAMP LAWS

         (a)      If any law is enacted or adopted or amended after the date of
this Agreement which deducts the Debt from the value of the Property for the
purpose of taxation or which imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly, on
the Debt or Lender's interest in the Property, Borrower will pay the tax, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any. If Lender is advised by counsel chosen
by it that the payment of tax by Borrower would be unlawful or taxable to Lender
or unenforceable or provide the basis for a defense of usury then Lender shall
have the option by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days
to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without any prepayment premium.

         (b)      Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit
or credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Taxes or Other Charges
assessed against the Property, or any part thereof, and no deduction shall
otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of the Property, or any
part thereof, for real estate tax purposes by reason of the Mortgage or the
Debt. If such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by law, Lender shall
have the option, by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120)
days, to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without any prepayment
premium.

         If at any time the United States of America, any State thereof or any
subdivision of any such State shall require revenue or other stamps to be
affixed to the Note, the Mortgage, or any of the other Loan Documents or impose
any other tax or charge on the same, Borrower will pay for the same, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any.

         SECTION 17.5. EXPENSES

         Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to
reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable, actual attorneys' fees and
disbursements reasonably incurred by Lender in accordance with this Agreement in
connection with (a) the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this

in response to third party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any action
or proceeding or other litigation, in each case against, under or affecting
Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Property, or any other
security given for the Loan; and (h) enforcing any obligations of or collecting
any payments due from Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or
with respect to the Property or in connection with any refinancing or
restructuring of the credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the
nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings; provided,
however, that Borrower shall not be liable for the payment of any such costs and
expenses to the extent the same arise by reason of the gross negligence, illegal
acts, fraud or willful misconduct of Lender.

                                     WAIVERS

         SECTION 18.1. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS

         The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's
rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's
sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power
accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power
or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power
may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A
waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be
construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by
Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

         SECTION 18.2. MODIFICATION, WAIVER IN WRITING

         No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement, or of the Note, or of any other Loan
Document, nor consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which given. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall
entitle Borrower to any other or future notice or demand in the same, similar or
other circumstances.

         SECTION 18.3. DELAY NOT A WAIVER

         Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender in insisting
upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement, or
exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note or
under any other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security
therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of
any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting

                                    - 101 -

<PAGE>

payment after the due date of any amount payable under this Agreement, the Note
or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed to have waived any right
either to require prompt payment when due of all other amounts due under this
Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents, or to declare a default for
failure to effect prompt payment of any such other amount.

         SECTION 18.4. TRIAL BY JURY

         BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES NOT TO ELECT
A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER
ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS
GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER, AND
IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. EACH OF LENDER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND BORROWER IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN
ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND LENDER.

         SECTION 18.5. WAIVER OF NOTICE

         Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

         SECTION 18.6. REMEDIES OF BORROWER

         In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment. Lender
agrees that, in such event, it shall cooperate in expediting any action seeking
injunctive relief or declaratory judgment.

         SECTION 18.7. WAIVER OF MARSHALLING OF ASSETS

         To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Property, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the
marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters
whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan
Documents to a sale of the Property for the collection of the Debt without any
prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in preference to
every other claimant whatsoever.

         SECTION 18.8.  WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

         Borrower hereby expressly waives and releases, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the pleading of any statute of limitations as a defense to
payment of the Debt or performance of its Other Obligations.

         SECTION 18.9. WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM

         Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

                                   ARTICLE 19

         This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract entered into pursuant
to the laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed,
construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New

the Reserve Accounts and the Lockbox Account, the laws of the state where each
such account is located shall apply.

         SECTION 19.2. SEVERABILITY

         Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 19.3. PREFERENCES

         Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or
reverse and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to any portion of the
obligations of Borrower hereunder. To the

                                    - 103 -

or any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or
preferential, set aside or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party under any Creditors Rights Laws, state or federal law, common law or
equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the
obligations hereunder or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived

been received by Lender.

lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture,
partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower
and Lender nor to grant Lender any interest in the Property other than that of
mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

         (b)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and
Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the
obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of
strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

         (c)      The general partners, members, principals and (if Borrower is
a trust) beneficial owners of Borrower are experienced in the ownership and
operation of properties similar to the Property, and Borrower and Lender are
relying solely upon such expertise and business plan in connection with the
ownership and operation of the Property. Borrower is not relying on Lender's
expertise, business acumen or advice in connection with the Property.

         (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Lender is not undertaking the performance of (i) any obligations under the
Leases; or (ii) any obligations with respect to such agreements, contracts,
certificates, instruments, franchises, permits, trademarks, licenses and other
documents.

         (e)      By accepting or approving anything required to be observed,
performed or fulfilled or to be given to Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the
Mortgage, the Note or the other

                                    - 105 -

<PAGE>

Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any officer's certificate,
balance sheet, statement of profit and loss or other financial statement,
survey, appraisal, or insurance policy, Lender shall not be deemed to have
warranted, consented to, or affirmed the sufficiency, the legality or
effectiveness of same, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not
constitute any warranty or affirmation with respect thereto by Lender.

         (f)      Borrower recognizes and acknowledges that in accepting this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, Lender is
expressly and primarily relying on the truth and accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement without any obligation
to investigate the Property and notwithstanding any investigation of the
Property by Lender; that such reliance existed on the part of Lender prior to
the date hereof, that the warranties and representations are a material
inducement to Lender in making the Loan; and that Lender would not be willing to
make the Loan and accept this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents in the absence of the warranties and representations as set forth
in Article 4 of this Agreement.

         SECTION 20.8. PUBLICITY

         All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan, Lender, Banc of America Securities LLC, or any of their Affiliates
shall be subject to the prior written approval of Lender, not to be unreasonably
withheld, provided however, that Lender's consent shall not be required in
connection with any such news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or
its Affiliates to the extent Borrower or its Affiliates are required to make
such news releases pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements. Lender shall be
permitted to make any news, releases, publicity or advertising by Lender or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan, the Property, Borrower, Borrower Principal and their respective
Affiliates without the approval of Borrower or any such Persons. Borrower also
agrees that Lender may share any information pertaining to the Loan with Bank of
America Corporation, including its bank subsidiaries, Banc of America Securities
LLC and any other Affiliates of the foregoing, in connection with the sale or
transfer of the Loan or any Participations and/or Securities created. In the
event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this Section 20.8 and
paragraph 5 of the Advisory Agreement, the applicable provisions of the Advisory
Agreement shall control.

         SECTION 20.9. CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE

         In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent
counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan
Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of
construing their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower
acknowledges that, with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its
own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any
manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it
under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or

                                    - 106 -

<PAGE>

instruments which govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them may
acquire in Borrower, and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise
any defense or take any action on the basis of the foregoing with respect to
Lender's exercise of any such rights or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that
Lender engages in the business of real estate financings and other real estate
transactions and investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive
with the business of Borrower or its Affiliates.

         SECTION 20.10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

         This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such
parties, whether oral or written between Borrower and Lender are superseded by
the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 20.11. TAX DISCLOSURE

         Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as reasonably
necessary to comply with applicable securities laws, each party (and each
employee, representative or other agent of each party) hereto may disclose to
any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, any information with
respect to the United States federal income "tax treatment" and "tax structure"
(in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of
the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such parties (or their
representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that
with respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains
information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as
well as other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of
the document or similar item that relate to the United States federal income tax
treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         SECTION 20.12. EXECUTION BY BORROWER PRINCIPAL

         Borrower Principal is executing this Agreement solely for the purpose
of (a) making the representations and warranties applicable to Borrower
Principal contained in Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 4.10, 4.14 (with
respect to financial information of Borrower Principal), 4.31, 4.39, and 4.40 of
this Agreement, and (b) agreeing to the terms, covenants and conditions

                              (ADVISORY AGREEMENT)

         The Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. (the "Company") agrees that all
advice given by Banc of America Securities LLC ("BAS") in connection with its
engagement hereunder is for the benefit and use of the Company in considering
its strategic situation and that no such advice shall be used for any other
purpose or be disclosed, reproduced, disseminated, quoted or referred to at any
time, in any manner or for any purpose, nor shall any public references to BAS
be made by or on behalf of the Company, in each case without BAS' prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. BAS agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of the confidential or proprietary information
("Confidential Information") provided by the Company to BAS in connection with
this engagement and to utilize or disclose the Confidential Information only in
connection with the activities and transactions contemplated by this letter
agreement (the "Permitted Use"). BAS shall only disclose the Confidential
Information (i) to its employees, officers, agents, advisors and other
representatives (collectively, its "Representatives") who need to know such
Confidential Information in connection with the Permitted Use or (ii) as
required by law, regulation or legal, governmental or regulatory process but
only after, in the case of this clause (iii), notice to the Company, unless such
notice is prohibited by law, regulation or legal, governmental or regulatory
process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not constitute
Confidential Information: (i) information which was already known to BAS prior
to its disclosure by the Company; (ii) information which is obtained by the BAS
from a third party who is not known by the BAS to be prohibited from disclosing
the information to the BAS by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to
the Company; (iii) information which is or becomes publicly available (other
than as a result of disclosure by the BAS in violation of this paragraph); and
(iv) information which is independently developed, discovered or arrived at by
the BAS or any of its Representatives without use of Confidential Information.
BAS shall be liable for any beach of the provisions of this paragraph by its
Representatives. The obligations related to Confidential Information contained
in this paragraph shall terminate two years from the date of this letter
agreement and will survive any earlier termination of this letter agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, BAS and the Company
shall be permitted to disclose the tax treatment and tax structure of any
strategic alternative (including any materials, opinions or analyses relating to
such tax treatment or tax structure, but without disclosure of identifying
information or, except to the extent relating to such tax structure or tax
treatment, any nonpublic commercial or financial information) on and after the
earliest to occur of the date of (i) public announcement of discussions relating
to such strategic alternative, (ii) public announcement of such strategic
alternative or (iii) execution of a definitive agreement (with or without
conditions) to enter into such strategic alternative; provided, however, that if
such strategic alternative is not consummated for any reason, the provisions of
this sentence shall cease to apply with respect to such strategic alternative.

                                  GENERAL TERMS

         SECTION 2.1. LOAN COMMITMENT; DISBURSEMENT TO BORROWER

         (a) Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Lender hereby agrees to make and Borrower hereby agrees to accept the Loan on
the Closing Date.

                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>

         (b) Borrower may request and receive only one borrowing in respect of
the Loan and any amount borrowed and repaid in respect of the Loan may not be
reborrowed.

         (c) The Loan shall be evidenced by the Note and secured by the Mortgage
and the other Loan Documents.

         (d) Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan to (i) pay certain
costs in connection with the financing of the Property, (ii) make deposits into
the Reserve Funds on the Closing Date in the amounts provided herein, (iii) pay
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the Loan, as
approved by Lender, (iv) fund any working capital requirements of the Property,
and (v) distribute the balance, if any, to its partners or members, as
applicable.

         SECTION 2.2. LOAN PAYMENTS

         (a) The Loan shall bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to the
Note Rate. Interest shall be computed based on the daily rate produced assuming
a three hundred sixty (360) day year, multiplied by the actual number of days
elapsed. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, interest shall be paid
in arrears.

         (b) Borrower hereby agrees to pay sums due under the Note as follows:
An initial payment of is due on the Closing Date for interest from the Closing
Date through and including October 31, 2003. Thereafter, except as may be
adjusted in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.2(c), consecutive
monthly installments of principal and interest in an amount equal to the sum set
forth on Schedule 1, attached hereto, shall be payable pursuant to the terms of
Section 2.2(d) (the "Monthly Payment Amount") on the first (1st) day of each
month beginning on December 1, 2003 (each a "Scheduled Payment Date") until the
entire indebtedness evidenced hereby is fully paid, except that any remaining
indebtedness, if not sooner paid, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

         (c) The Monthly Payment Amount shall mean the amount of interest and
principal which would be due in order to fully amortize the principal amount of
the Loan over an amortization term of thirty (30) years assuming an annual
interest rate equal to the Note Rate, computed on the basis of a three hundred
sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days each.
Borrower expressly understands and agrees that such computation of interest
based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months
of thirty (30) days each is solely for the purpose of determining the Monthly
Payment Amount, and, notwithstanding such computation, interest shall accrue on
the outstanding principal amount of the Loan as provided in Section 2.2(a)
above. Borrower understands and acknowledges that such interest accrual
requirement results in more interest accruing on the Loan than if either a
thirty (30) day month and a three hundred sixty (360) day year or the actual
number of days and a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year were used to
compute the accrual of interest on the Loan. Borrower recognizes that such
interest accrual requirement will not fully amortize the Loan within the
amortization period set forth above. Following any partial prepayment occurring
solely as a result of the application of Insurance Proceeds or Awards pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
adjust the Monthly Payment Amount to give effect to any such partial prepayment,
provided, however, that in no event will any such

                                     - 16 -
<PAGE>

adjustment result in any such installment becoming due and payable on any date
after the Maturity Date.

         (d) Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be
payable at the payment address set forth on Schedule 1, attached hereto, or at
such other place as the Lender may designate from time to time in writing, on
the date such payment is due, to Lender by deposit to such account as Lender may
designate by written notice to Borrower. Whenever any payment hereunder or under
the Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the first Business Day preceding such scheduled due
date.

         (e) Prior to the occurrence and following the cure (in accordance with
the terms hereof) of an Event of Default, all monthly payments made as scheduled
under this Agreement and the Note shall be applied first to the payment of
interest computed at the Note Rate, and the balance toward the reduction of the
principal amount of the Note. All voluntary and involuntary prepayments on the
Note shall be applied, to the extent thereof, to accrued but unpaid interest on
the amount prepaid, to the remaining principal amount, and any other sums due
and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan, in such manner and order as
Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion, including, but not limited
to, application to principal installments in inverse order of maturity.
Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, any
payment made on the Note shall be applied to accrued but unpaid interest, late
charges, accrued fees, the unpaid principal amount of the Note, and any other
sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan, in such manner and
order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion.

         (f) All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under the Note or the
other Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without any deduction
for, any setoff, defense or counterclaims.

         SECTION 2.3. LATE PAYMENT CHARGE

         If any principal or interest payment is not paid by Borrower on or
before the date which is ten (10) calendar days after the same is due, Borrower
shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of four percent
(4%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law in
order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such
delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such
delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable law.

         SECTION 2.4. PREPAYMENT; DEFEASANCE

         Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 2.4, no
voluntary prepayments, whether in whole or in part, of the Loan or any other
amount at any time due and owing under the Note can be made by Borrower or any
other Person without the express written consent of Lender.

         (a) Lockout Period. Borrower has no right to make, and Lender shall
have no obligation to accept, any voluntary prepayment, whether in whole or in
part, of the Loan during the Lockout Period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
either (i) Lender, in its sole and absolute

                                     - 17 -
<PAGE>

discretion, accepts a full or partial voluntary prepayment during the Lockout
Period or (ii) there is an involuntary prepayment during the Lockout Period,
then, in either case, Borrower shall, in addition to any portion of the Loan
prepaid (together with all interest accrued and unpaid thereon), pay to Lender a
prepayment premium in an amount calculated in accordance with Section 2.4(d)
hereof.

         (b) Total Defeasance.

                  (i)      Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 2.4 to
         the contrary, including, without limitation, subsection (a) of this
         Section 2.4, at any time after the earlier to occur of the (1)
         expiration of the REMIC Prohibition Period or (2) expiration of the
         Substitution/Defeasance Lockout Period, Borrower may cause the release
         of the Property from the lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan
         Documents upon the satisfaction of the following conditions:

                           (A)      no Event of Default shall exist under any of
                  the Loan Documents;

                           (B)      not less than thirty (30) (but not more than
                  ninety (90)) days prior written notice shall be given to
                  Lender specifying a date on which the Defeasance Collateral
                  (as hereinafter defined) is to be delivered (the "RELEASE
                  DATE"), such date being on a Scheduled Payment Date; provided,
                  however, that Borrower shall have the right (i) to cancel such
                  notice by providing Lender with notice of cancellation ten
                  (10) days prior to the scheduled Release Date, or (ii) to
                  extend the scheduled Release Date until the next Scheduled
                  Payment Date; provided that in each case, Borrower shall pay
                  all of Lender's reasonable costs and expenses incurred as a
                  result of such cancellation or extension;

                           (C)      all accrued and unpaid interest and all
                  other sums due under the Note, this Agreement and under the
                  other Loan Documents up to the Release Date, including,
                  without limitation, all reasonable fees, costs and expenses
                  incurred by Lender and its agents in connection with such
                  release (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees
                  and expenses for the review and preparation of the Defeasance
                  Security Agreement (as hereinafter defined) and of the other
                  materials described in Section 2.4(b)(i)(D) below and any
                  related documentation, and any servicing fees, Rating Agency
                  fees or other costs related to such release), shall be paid in
                  full on or prior to the Release Date;

                           (D)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender on or prior
                  to the Release Date:

                  (1)      a pledge and security agreement, in form and
substance which would be satisfactory to a prudent institutional mortgage loan
lender, creating a first priority security interest in favor of Lender in the
Defeasance Collateral, as defined herein (the "DEFEASANCE SECURITY AGREEMENT"),
which shall provide, among other things, that any excess amounts received by
Lender from the Defeasance Collateral over the amounts payable by Borrower on a
given Scheduled Payment Date, which excess amounts are not required to cover all
or any portion of amounts payable on a future Scheduled Payment Date, shall be
refunded to Borrower promptly after each such Scheduled Payment Date;

                                     - 18 -
<PAGE>

                  (2)      direct non-callable obligations of the United States
of America (or other obligations which are "government securities" within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent
the applicable Rating Agencies rating the Securities have confirmed in writing
will not cause a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if
higher, then applicable ratings of the Securities), that provide for payments
prior and as close as possible to (but in no event later than) all successive
Scheduled Payment Dates occurring after the Release Date, with each such payment
being equal to or greater than the amount of the corresponding Monthly Payment
Amount required to be paid under this Agreement and the Note (including all
amounts due on the Maturity Date) for the balance of the term hereof (the
"DEFEASANCE COLLATERAL"), each of which shall be duly endorsed by the holder
thereof as directed by Lender or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form and substance which would be satisfactory to a prudent lender
(including, without limitation, such certificates, documents and instruments as
may be required by the depository institution holding such securities or the
issuer thereof, as the case may be, to effectuate book-entry transfers and
pledges through the book-entry facilities of such institution) in order to
perfect upon the delivery of the Defeasance Security Agreement the first
priority security interest therein in favor of Lender in conformity with all
applicable state and federal laws governing granting of such security interests;

                  (3)      a certificate of Borrower certifying that all of the
requirements set forth in this Section 2.4(b)(i) have been satisfied;

                  (4)      one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower in form
and substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a prudent
lender stating, among other things, that (i) Lender has a perfected first
priority security interest in the Defeasance Collateral and that the Defeasance
Security Agreement is enforceable against Borrower in accordance with its terms,
(ii) the release of the lien of the Mortgage and the pledge of Defeasance
Collateral will not directly or indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust
that then holds the Note to fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and
(iii) the defeasance will not cause any REMIC Trust to be an "investment
company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, at Borrower's cost;

                  (5)      a certificate in form and scope which would be
acceptable to a prudent lender from an Acceptable Accountant certifying that the
Defeasance Collateral will generate amounts sufficient to make all payments of
principal and interest due under the Note (including the scheduled outstanding
principal balance of the Loan due on the Maturity Date); and

                  (6)      such other certificates, documents and instruments as
a prudent institutional lender would require; and

                           (E)      in the event the Loan is held by a REMIC
                  Trust, Lender has received written confirmation from any
                  Rating Agency rating any Securities that substitution of the
                  Defeasance Collateral will not result in a downgrade,
                  withdrawal, or qualification of the ratings then assigned to
                  any of the Securities.

                  (ii)     Upon compliance with the requirements of Section
         2.4(b)(i), the Property shall be released from the lien of the Mortgage
         and the other Loan Documents, and the Defeasance Collateral shall
         constitute collateral which shall secure the Note and all other

                                     - 19 -
<PAGE>

         obligations under the Loan Documents. Lender will, at Borrower's
         expense, execute and deliver any agreements reasonably requested by
         Borrower to release the lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan
         Documents from the Property.

                  (iii)    Upon the release of the Property in accordance with
         this Section 2.4(b), Borrower shall (at Lender's sole and absolute
         discretion) assign all its obligations and rights under the Note,
         together with the pledged Defeasance Collateral, to a successor entity
         designated and approved by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion
         ("SUCCESSOR BORROWER"). Successor Borrower shall execute an assignment
         and assumption agreement in form and substance which would be
         satisfactory to a prudent lender pursuant to which it shall assume
         Borrower's obligations under the Note and the Defeasance Security
         Agreement. As conditions to such assignment and assumption, Borrower
         shall (A) deliver to Lender one or more opinions of counsel in form and
         substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a
         prudent lender stating, among other things, that such assignment and
         assumption agreement is enforceable against Borrower and the Successor
         Borrower in accordance with its terms and that the Note, the Defeasance
         Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as so assigned and
         assumed, are enforceable against the Successor Borrower in accordance
         with their respective terms, and opining to such other matters relating
         to Successor Borrower and its organizational structure as Lender may
         require, and (B) pay all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred
         by Lender or its agents in connection with such assignment and
         assumption (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses and
         for the review of the proposed transferee and the preparation of the
         assignment and assumption agreement and related certificates, documents
         and instruments and any fees payable to any Rating Agencies and their
         counsel in connection with the issuance of the confirmation referred to
         in subsection (b)(i)(E) above). Upon such assignment and assumption,
         Borrower shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder, under the
         Note, under the other Loan Documents and under the Defeasance Security
         Agreement, except as expressly set forth in the assignment and
         assumption agreement.

                  (iv)     For purposes of this Section 2.4, "REMIC PROHIBITION
         PERIOD" means the two-year period commencing with the "startup day"
         within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code of any REMIC Trust
         that holds the Note. In no event shall Lender have any obligation to
         notify Borrower that a REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect with
         respect to the Loan, except that Lender shall notify Borrower if any
         REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect with respect to the Loan after
         receiving any notice described in Section 2.4(b)(i)(B); provided,
         however, that the failure of Lender to so notify Borrower shall not
         impose any liability on Lender or grant Borrower any right to defease
         the Loan during any such REMIC Prohibition Period.

         (c) Intentionally deleted.

         (d) Involuntary Prepayment During the Lockout Period. During the
Lockout Period, in the event of any involuntary prepayment of the Loan or any
other amount under the Note, whether in whole or in part, in connection with or
following Lender's acceleration of the Note or otherwise, and whether the
Mortgage is satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of sale or
judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means,
including, without

                                     - 20 -
<PAGE>

limitation, repayment of the Loan by Borrower or any other Person pursuant to
any statutory or common law right of redemption, Borrower shall, in addition to
any portion of the principal balance of the Loan prepaid (together with all
interest accrued and unpaid thereon and in the event the prepayment is made on a
date other than a Scheduled Payment Date, a sum equal to the amount of interest
which would have accrued under the Note on the amount of such prepayment if such
prepayment had occurred on the next Scheduled Payment Date), pay to Lender a
prepayment premium in an amount calculated in accordance with this Section
2.4(d). Such prepayment premium shall be in an amount equal to the greater of:

                  (i)      1% of the portion of the Loan being prepaid; or

                  (ii)     the product obtained by multiplying:

                           (A)      the portion of the Loan being prepaid,
                  times;

                           (B)      the difference obtained by subtracting (I)
                  the Yield Rate from (II) the Note Rate, times;

                           (C)      the present value factor calculated using
                  the following formula:

                                    1-(1+r)(-n)
                                    -----------
                                        r

                                    r  =   Yield Rate

                                    n  =   the number of years and any fraction
                                           thereof, remaining between the date
                                           the prepayment is made and the
                                           Maturity Date of the Note.

         As used herein, "YIELD RATE" means the yield per annum calculated by
Lender by the linear interpolation of the yield of U.S. Treasury Securities
having a maturity date (one longer and one shorter) most nearly approximating
the Maturity Date as reported on the fifth Business Day preceding the Prepayment
Calculation Date. The "PREPAYMENT CALCULATION DATE" shall mean, as applicable,
the date on which (i) Lender applies any partial prepayment to the reduction of
the outstanding principal amount of the Note, in the case of a voluntary partial
prepayment which is accepted by Lender, (ii) Lender accelerates the Loan, in the
case of a prepayment resulting from acceleration, or (iii) Lender applies funds
held under any Reserve Account, in the case of a prepayment resulting from such
an application (other than in connection with acceleration of the Loan).

         (e) Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds; Excess Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, and provided no
Event of Default exists, Borrower shall not be required to pay any prepayment
premium in connection with any prepayment occurring solely as a result of (i)
the application of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Documents, or (ii) the application of any interest in excess
of the Maximum Legal Rate.

         (f) After the Lockout Period. Commencing on the day after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, and upon giving Lender at least thirty (30)
days (but not more than ninety (90)

                                     - 21 -
<PAGE>

days) prior written notice, Borrower may voluntarily prepay (without premium)
the Note in whole (but not in part) on a Scheduled Payment Date. Lender shall
accept a prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.4(h) on a day other than a
Scheduled Payment Date provided that, in addition to payment of the full
outstanding principal balance of the Note, Borrower pays to Lender a sum equal
to the amount of interest which would have accrued on the Note if such
prepayment occurred on the next Scheduled Payment Date (the "INTEREST
SHORTFALL").

         (g) Limitation on Partial Prepayments. Except as set forth in Section
2.4(e), in no event shall Lender have any obligation to accept a partial
prepayment.

         SECTION 2.5. SUBSTITUTION OF PROPERTIES

         Subject to the terms of this Section 2.5 after the earlier to occur of
(1) the expiration of the REMIC Prohibition Period or (2) the
Substitution/Defeasance Lockout Period (provided, however, that prior to a
Securitization of the Loan, Borrower may obtain a substitution pursuant to this
Section 2.5 during the Substitution/Defeasance Lockout Period), Borrower may
obtain a release of the Lien of the Mortgage (and the related Loan Documents)
encumbering the Property (the "RELEASE PROPERTY") up to one (1) time during the
Loan term by substituting therefor another property of like kind and quality,
acquired by Borrower or an Affiliate of Borrower (provided, however, if the
Substitute Property shall be owned by an Affiliate of Borrower said Affiliate
(i) shall assume all the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Note
and the other Loan Documents and (ii) shall become a party to the Note and the
other Loan Documents and shall be bound by the terms and provisions thereof as
if it had executed the Note and the other Loan Documents and shall have the
rights and obligations of Borrower thereunder) (individually, a "SUBSTITUTE
PROPERTY" and collectively, the "SUBSTITUTE PROPERTIES"), provided that the
following conditions precedent are satisfied:

         (a) Lender shall have received at least sixty (60) days prior written
notice requesting the substitution and identifying the Substitute Property and
Release Property.

         (b) Lender shall have received (i) a copy of a deed conveying all of
Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the Release Property to a Person
other than Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to an arms length transaction
and (ii) a letter from Borrower countersigned by a title insurance company
acknowledging receipt of such deed and agreeing to record such deed in the real
estate records for the county in which the Release Property is located.

         (c) Lender shall have received a current Appraisal of the Substitute
Property prepared within one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the release and
substitution (i) showing an appraised value equal to or greater than the
appraised value of the Release Property as of the Closing Date, and (ii) which
supports a loan-to-value ratio with respect to the Substitute Property not
greater than the lesser of (A) the loan-to-value ratio as of the Closing Date
with respect to the Release Property and (B) the loan-to-value ratio with
respect to the Release Property immediately prior to the date of the proposed
substitution.

         (d) Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower certifying,
together with other evidence that would be satisfactory to a prudent
institutional mortgage loan lender that, after the substitution of the
Substitute Property and the release of the Release Property, (i) the

                                     - 22 -
<PAGE>

Debt Service Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately
preceding the date of the substitution with respect to the Substitute Property
after the substitution shall be equal to or greater than (A) Debt Service
Coverage Ratio for the Release Property for the twelve (12) full calendar months
immediately preceding the Closing Date and (B) Debt Service Coverage Ratio for
the Release Property for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately
preceding the substitution.

         (e) If the Loan is part of a Securitization, Lender shall have received
confirmation in writing from the Rating Agencies to the effect that such release
and substitution will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or downgrade of
the respective ratings in effect immediately prior to such release and
substitution for the Securities issued in connection with the Securitization
that are then outstanding. If the Loan is not part of a Securitization, Lender
shall have consented in writing to such release and substitution, which consent
shall be given in Lender's reasonable discretion applying the requirements of a
prudent institutional mortgage loan lender with respect to real estate
collateral of similar size, scope and value of the Substitute Property.

         (f) No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Lender
shall have received a certificate from Borrower confirming the foregoing,
stating that the representations and warranties of Borrower contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date of the release and substitution with respect to
Borrower, the Property and the Substitute Property and containing any other
representations and warranties with respect to Borrower, the Property, the
Substitute Property or the Loan as Lender and, if the Loan has been securitized,
the Rating Agencies may reasonably require, unless such certificate would be
inaccurate, such certificate to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to a prudent institutional mortgage loan lender and, if the Loan has been
securitized, the Rating Agencies.

         (g) Borrower shall have executed, acknowledged and delivered to Lender
(I) a Mortgage, and two UCC-1 Financing Statements with respect to the
Substitute Property, together with a letter from Borrower countersigned by a
title insurance company acknowledging receipt of such Mortgage and UCC-1
Financing Statements and agreeing to record or file, as applicable, such
Mortgage, and one of the UCC-1 Financing Statements in the real estate records
for the county in which the Substitute Property is located and to file one of
the UCC-1 Financing Statements in the office of the Secretary of State (or other
central filing office) of the State in which Borrower is formed, so as to
effectively create upon such recording and filing valid and enforceable first
priority Lien upon the Substitute Property, in favor of Lender (or such other
trustee as may be desired under local law), subject only to the Permitted
Encumbrances and such other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan
Documents and (II) an environmental indemnity with respect to the Substitute
Property from Borrower and Borrower Principal as set forth in the Loan
Agreement. The Mortgage, UCC-1 Financing Statements, and other Loan Documents
shall be the same in form and substance as the counterparts of such documents
executed and delivered with respect to the related Release Property subject to
modifications reflecting only the Substitute Property as the Property and such
modifications reflecting the laws of the State in which the Substitute Property
is located. The Mortgage encumbering the Substitute Property shall secure all
amounts then outstanding under the Note. If the Note is secured by more than one
Mortgage, in the event that the jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is
located imposes a mortgage recording, intangibles or similar tax and does not
permit

                                     - 23 -
<PAGE>

the allocation of indebtedness for the purpose of determining the amount of such
tax payable, the principal amount secured by such Mortgage shall be equal to one
hundred ten percent (110%) of the allocated loan amount for the Substitute
Property.

         (h) Lender shall have received (A) to the extent available and
applicable, any "tie-in" or similar endorsement, together with a "first loss"
endorsement, to each Title Insurance Policy insuring the Lien of the existing
Mortgage as of the date of the substitution with respect to the Title Insurance
Policy insuring the Lien of the Mortgage with respect to the Substitute Property
and (B) a Title Insurance Policy (or a marked, signed and redated commitment to
issue such Title Insurance Policy) insuring the Lien of the Mortgage encumbering
the Substitute Property, issued by the title company that issued the Title
Insurance Policies insuring the Lien of the existing Mortgage and dated as of
the date of the substitution. The Title Insurance Policy issued with respect to
the Substitute Property shall (1) to the extent applicable, provide coverage in
the amount of the Loan if the "tie-in" or similar endorsement described above is
available or, if such endorsement is not available, in an amount equal to one
hundred ten percent (110%) of the original principal balance of the Loan,
together with "last dollar endorsement," (2) insure Lender that the relevant
Mortgage creates a valid first lien on the Substitute Property encumbered
thereby, free and clear of all exceptions from coverage other than Permitted
Encumbrances and standard exceptions and exclusions from coverage (as modified
by the terms of any endorsements), (3) contain such endorsements and affirmative
coverages as are then available and are contained in the Title Insurance
Policies insuring the Liens of the existing Mortgage, and such other
endorsements or affirmative coverage that a prudent institutional mortgage
lender would require, and (4) name Lender as the insured. Lender also shall have
received copies of paid receipts or other evidence showing that all premiums in
respect of such endorsements and Title Insurance Policies have been paid.

         (i) Lender shall have received a current Survey for the Substitute
Property, certified to the title company and Lender and its successors and
assigns, in the same form and having the same content as the certification of
the Survey of the Release Property prepared by a professional land surveyor
licensed in the State in which the Substitute Property is located in accordance
with the 1999 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title
Surveys. Such Survey shall reflect the same legal description contained in the
Title Insurance Policy relating to such Substitute Property and shall include,
among other things, a metes and bounds description of the real property
comprising part of such Substitute Property (unless such real property has been
satisfactorily designated by lot number on a recorded plat). The surveyor's seal
shall be affixed to each Survey and each Survey shall certify whether or not the
surveyed property is located in a "one-hundred-year flood hazard area."

         (j) Lender shall have received valid certificates of insurance
indicating that the requirements for the policies of insurance required for the
Property hereunder have been satisfied with respect to the Substitute Property
and evidence of the payment of all Insurance Premiums payable for the existing
policy period.

         (k) Lender shall have received a Phase I environmental report dated not
more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the proposed date of
substitution and otherwise acceptable to a prudent institutional mortgage loan
lender and, if recommended under the Phase I environmental report, a Phase II
environmental report that would be acceptable to a prudent

                                     - 24 -
<PAGE>

institutional mortgage loan lender, which conclude that the Substitute Property
does not contain any Hazardous Materials in violation of Environmental Laws and
is not subject to any significant risk of contamination from any off site
Hazardous Materials.

         (l) Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Lender (A)
updates or, if the Substitute Property is to be owned by an Affiliate of
Borrower, originals, in either case certified by Borrower or such Affiliate, as
applicable, of all organizational documentation related to Borrower or such
Affiliate, as applicable, and/or the formation, structure, existence, good
standing and/or qualification to do business delivered to Lender on the Closing
Date; (B) good standing certificates, certificates of qualification to do
business in the jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is located (if
required in such jurisdiction); and (C) resolutions of Borrower of such
Affiliate, as applicable, authorizing the substitution and any actions taken in
connection with such substitution.

         (m) Lender shall have received the following opinions of Borrower's
counsel: (A) an opinion or opinions of counsel admitted to practice under the
laws of the State in which the Substitute Property is located stating that the
Loan Documents delivered with respect to the Substitute Property pursuant to
clause (i) above are valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms,
subject to the laws applicable to creditors' rights and equitable principles,
and that Borrower is qualified to do business and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction where the Substitute Property is located or that
Borrower is not required by Applicable Law to qualify to do business in such
jurisdiction; (B) an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Lender, and, if
the Loan has been securitized, the Rating Agencies, stating that the Loan
Documents delivered with respect to the Substitute Property pursuant to clause
(i) above were, among other things, duly authorized, executed and delivered by
Borrower and that the execution and delivery of such Loan Documents and the
performance by Borrower of its obligations thereunder will not cause a breach
of, or a default under, any agreement, document or instrument to which Borrower
is a party or to which it or its properties are bound; (C) an update of any
Insolvency Opinion delivered in connection with the closing of the Loan,
indicating that the substitution does not affect the opinions set forth therein;
(D) if the Loan is part of a Securitization, an opinion of counsel acceptable to
the Rating Agencies that the substitution does not constitute a "significant
modification" of the Loan under Section 1001 of the Code or otherwise cause a
tax to be imposed on a "prohibited transaction" by any REMIC Trust.

         (n) Borrower shall (i) have paid, (ii) have escrowed with Lender (if
then required hereunder) or (iii) be contesting in accordance with the terms
hereof, all Basic Carrying Costs relating to the Property and the Substitute

currently due and payable Taxes (including any in arrears) relating to the
Property and the Substitute Property and (iii) currently due and payable Other

costs and expenses incurred by Lender (including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and disbursements) in connection with the release and
substitution and Borrower shall have paid all recording charges, filing fees,
taxes or other expenses (including, without limitation, mortgage and intangibles
taxes and documentary stamp taxes) payable in connection with the substitution.

                                     - 25 -

Borrower shall have paid all costs and expenses of the Rating Agencies incurred
in connection with the substitution.

         (p) Lender shall have received annual operating statements and
occupancy statements for the Substitute Property for the most current completed
fiscal year and a current operating statement for the Release Property, each
certified by Borrower to Lender as being true and correct in all material
respects and a certificate from Borrower certifying that there has been no
material adverse change in the financial condition of the Substitute Property
since the date of such operating statements.

         (q) Borrower shall have delivered to Lender estoppel certificates from
each Tenant under a Major Lease, except with respect to commercial Leases under
which a Tenant has leased less than 3,000 square feet. All such estoppel
certificates shall be in a form that would be satisfactory to a prudent mortgage
loan lender and shall indicate that (1) the subject Lease is a valid and binding
obligation of the tenant thereunder, (2) to the best of the tenant's knowledge,
there are no defaults under such Lease on the part of the landlord or tenant
thereunder, (3) the tenant thereunder has no knowledge of any defense or offset
to the payment of rent under such Lease, (4) no rent under such Lease has been

under such Lease to purchase all or any portion of the Substitute Property, and
(6) all tenant improvement work required under such Lease has been substantially

premises. If an estoppel certificate indicates that all tenant improvement work
required under the subject Lease has not yet been completed, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender financial statements indicating that Borrower has adequate
funds to pay all costs related to such tenant improvement work as required under
such Lease.

         (r) Lender shall have received copies of all Leases (except those
Leases relating to mobile home or recreational vehicle pads) affecting the

Insurance Policy insuring the Lien of the Mortgage encumbering the Substitute
Property insuring that the Substitute Property constitutes a separate tax lot

                                     - 26 -
<PAGE>

         (v) Lender shall have received evidence which would be satisfactory to
a prudent institutional mortgage loan lender to the effect that all material
building and operating licenses and permits necessary for the use and occupancy
of the Substitute Property as a mobile home park and/or recreational vehicle
resort, as applicable, (and, if applicable, a golf course, together with all
other appurtenant uses for which the Substitute Property is used) including, but
not limited to, current certificates of occupancy, have been obtained and are in
full force and effect.

         (w) In the event the Release Property is subject to a Management
Agreement along with one or more additional Properties, Lender shall have
received a certified copy of an amendment to the Management Agreement reflecting
the deletion of the Release Property and the addition of the Substitute Property
as a property managed pursuant thereto and Manager shall have executed and
delivered to Lender an amendment to the Assignment of Management Agreement
reflecting such amendment to the Management Agreement. In the event that the
Release Property is subject to a Management Agreement relating only to such
Release Property, Lender shall have received a certified copy of a new
Management Agreement for the Substitute Property on substantially the same terms
as the Management Agreement for the Release Property and the Manager thereunder
shall have executed and delivered to Lender an Assignment of Management
Agreement with respect to such new Management Agreement on substantially the
same terms as used in connection with the Release Property or such other terms

agreements (that are not terminable by Borrower upon thirty (30) days' notice)
relating to the leasing and operation of the Substitute Property (other than the
Management Agreement), each of which shall be in a form and substance which
would be satisfactory to a prudent institutional mortgage loan lender together
with a certification of Borrower attached to each such contract or agreement
certifying that the attached copy is a true and correct copy of such contract or
agreement and all amendments thereto.

         (z) Lender shall have received certified copies of all material
consents, licenses and approvals, if any, required in connection with the
substitution of a Substitute Property, and evidence that such consents, licenses
and approvals are in full force and effect.

         (aa) Lender shall have received satisfactory (i.e., showing no Liens
other than Permitted Encumbrances) UCC searches, together with tax lien,

         (bb) If Borrower owns a leasehold estate in the Substitute Property,
Lender shall have received, (i) a certified copy of the Ground Lease for the
Substitute Property, together with all amendments and modifications thereto and

which

                                     - 27 -
<PAGE>

in a diligent manner, (C) for a new lease on the same terms to Lender as tenant
if the Ground Lease is terminated for any reason, (D) the non-merger of fee and
leasehold interests, and (E) that insurance proceeds and condemnation awards
(from the fee interest as well as the leasehold interest) will be applied
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) a ground lease estoppel
executed by the fee owner and ground lessor of the Substitute Property,
reasonably acceptable to a prudent institutional mortgage loan lender.

         (cc) Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the date of such substitution, a release of Lien (and
related Loan Documents) for the Release Property for execution by Lender. Such
release shall be in a form appropriate for the jurisdiction in which the Release
Property is located and shall contain standard provisions, if any, protecting
the rights of the releasing lender;

         (dd) In the event the Release Property is a mobile home park, no
portion of the Substitute Property shall be used as a recreational vehicle park;

         (ee) Borrower stall deliver an Officers Certificate certifying that the
requirements set forth in this Section 2.5 have been satisfied; and

         (ff) the entity that is Borrower under the Loan is either (i) the
entity that was Borrower under the Loan as of the Closing Date (the "ORIGINAL
BORROWER") or (ii) an entity Controlled by Borrower Principal and in which
Borrower Principal owns directly or indirectly, at least a 51% interest (a
"BORROWER PRINCIPAL AFFILIATE").

         Upon the satisfaction of the foregoing conditions precedent, Lender
will release its Lien from the Release Property and the Substitute Property
shall be deemed to be the Property for purposes of this Agreement.

         SECTION 2.6. PAYMENTS AFTER DEFAULT

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect of the Loan,
(a) shall accrue at the Default Rate, and (b) Lender shall be entitled to
receive and Borrower shall pay to Lender all cash flow from the Property in
accordance with the terms of Article X hereof, such amount to be applied by
Lender to the payment of the Debt in such order as Lender shall determine in its
sole discretion, including, without limitation, alternating applications thereof
between interest and principal. Interest at the Default Rate shall be computed
from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the earlier of (i) the actual
receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion thereof that is then due)
and (ii) the cure of such Event of Default. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, interest at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, shall
itself accrue interest at the same rate as the Loan and shall be secured by the
Mortgage. This paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to
extend the date of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right
or

                                     - 28 -
<PAGE>

remedy accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Event of Default;
the acceptance of any payment from Borrower shall not be deemed to cure or
constitute a waiver of any Event of Default; and Lender retains its rights under
this Agreement to accelerate and to continue to demand payment of the Debt upon
the happening of and during the continuance any Event of Default, despite any
payment by Borrower to Lender.

         SECTION 2.7. USURY SAVINGS

         This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that
at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject Lender to either
civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate. If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower
is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance
due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Note Rate or
the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum
Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and
not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid
to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and
applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding. Borrower hereby
agrees to pay an effective rate of interest that is the sum of the interest rate
provided for herein, together with any additional interest or rate of interest
resulting from any other charges of interest or in the nature of interest paid
or to be paid in connection with the Loan, including, without limitation, any
fees to be paid by Borrower pursuant to the provisions of any and/or all of the
Loan Documents. Lender and Borrower agree that none of the terms and provisions
contained herein or in any of the Loan Documents shall be construed to create a
contract for the use, forbearance or detention of money requiring payment of
interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

         The obligation of Lender to make the Loan hereunder is subject to the
fulfillment by Borrower or waiver by Lender of the following conditions
precedent no later than the Closing Date.

         SECTION 3.1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; COMPLIANCE WITH CONDITIONS

         The representations and warranties of Borrower contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on and as
of such date, and Lender shall have determined that no Default or an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing nor will any Default or Event of
Default occur immediately following the Closing Date; and Borrower shall be in
compliance in all material respects with all terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in each other Loan Document on its part to be observed or
performed.

         SECTION 3.2. DELIVERY OF LOAN DOCUMENTS; TITLE INSURANCE; REPORTS;
         LEASES

         (a) Mortgage, Loan Agreement and Note. Lender shall have received from
Borrower a fully executed and acknowledged counterpart of the Mortgage and

default) under any of the terms and conditions of any REA, and any such REA
remains unmodified and in full force and effect;

         (b) All easements granted pursuant to any REA which were to have

the same has been completed), remain in full force and effect and have not been
released, terminated, extinguished or discharged by agreement or otherwise;

         (c) All sums due and owing by Borrower to the other parties to any REA

all financial statements, rent rolls, reports, certificates and other documents
submitted in connection with the Loan or in satisfaction of the terms thereof
and all statements of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any other
Loan Document, are accurate, complete and correct in all material respects.
There has been no material adverse change in any condition, fact, circumstance

otherwise misleading in any material respect or that otherwise materially and
adversely affects or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, could reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect the Property or the business
operations or the financial condition of Borrower. To the best of Borrower's

of Borrower as presently conducted or as Borrower contemplates conducting its
business are in good standing and, to the extent of Borrower's actual knowledge,

                  provided, however, that with respect to a Property (other than
                  properties that are hotels, nursing homes, or other properties
                  that would be deemed to constitute a business and not real
                  estate under Regulation S-X or other legal requirements) that
                  has been acquired by Borrower from an unaffiliated third party
                  (such Property, "Acquired Property"), as to which the other
                  conditions set forth in Section 210.3-14 of Regulation S-X for
                  provision of financial statements in accordance with such
                  Section have been met, in lieu of the Standard Statements
                  otherwise required by this section, Borrower shall instead
                  provide the financial statements required by such Section
                  210.3-14 of Regulation S-X ("Acquired Property Statements").

                           (B)      Not later than 30 days after the end of each
                  fiscal quarter following the date hereof, a balance sheet of

                  the most recent fiscal year and ending on the date of such
                  balance sheet and for the corresponding period of the most
                  recent fiscal year, meeting the requirements of Section
                  210.3-02 of Regulation S-X.

                           (D)      Within ten Business Days after notice from
                  Lender in connection with the Securitization of this Loan,
                  such additional financial statements, such that, as of the
                  date (each an "Offering Document Date") of each Disclosure
                  Document, Borrower shall have provided Lender with all
                  financial statements as described in subsection (f)(i) above;
                  provided that the fiscal year and interim periods for which
                  such financial statements shall be provided shall be
                  determined as of such Offering Document Date.

                  (iii)    All financial statements provided by Borrower
         hereunder pursuant to Section 5.11(c)(ii) hereof shall be prepared in
         accordance with GAAP, and shall meet the requirements of Regulation S-X
         and other applicable legal requirements. All financial statements
         (audited or unaudited) provided by Borrower under this Section 5.11
         shall be certified by an authorized officer or administrative member of
         Borrower, which

                                     - 49 -
<PAGE>

         certification shall state that such financial statements meet the
         requirements set forth in the first sentence of this Section
         5.11(c)(iii).

                  (iv)     If requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide
         Lender, promptly upon request, with any other or additional financial
         statements, or financial, statistical or operating information, as
         Lender shall determine to be required pursuant to Regulation S-X or any
         amendment, modification or replacement thereto or other legal
         requirements in connection with any Disclosure Document or any filing
         under or pursuant to the Exchange Act in connection with or relating to
         a Securitization (hereinafter an "Exchange Act Filing") or as shall
         otherwise be reasonably requested by Lender.

                  (v)      In the event Lender determines, in connection with a
         Securitization, that the financial statements required in order to
         comply with Regulation S-X or other legal requirements are other than
         as provided herein, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section
         5.11(c) hereof, Lender may request, and Borrower shall promptly
         provide, such combination of Acquired Property Statement and/or
         Standard Statements or such other financial statements as Lender
         determines to be necessary or appropriate for such compliance.

                  (vi)     Any reports, statements or other information required
         to be delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered in paper form
         and in the event that Lender requires financial statements in
         connection with subsection (c) above because the Loan when combined
         with the principal amount of any Affiliated Loans equal or exceed 20%
         of the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans included in a
         Securitization (defined below), Borrower shall deliver such reports,
         statements and other information (A) on a diskette, and (B) if
         requested by Lender and within the capabilities of Borrower's data
         systems without change or modification thereto, in electronic form and
         prepared using Microsoft Word for Windows or WordPerfect for Windows
         files (which files may be prepared using a spreadsheet program and
         saved as word processing files).

         (d) Borrower and Borrower Principal shall furnish Lender with such
other additional financial or management information (including state and
federal tax returns) as may, from time to time, be reasonably required by Lender
in form and substance satisfactory to Lender (including, without limitation, any
financial reports required to be delivered by any Tenant or any guarantor of any
Lease pursuant to the terms of such Lease), and shall furnish to Lender and its
agents convenient facilities for the examination and audit of any such books and
records.

         (e) All items requiring the certification of Borrower shall, except
where Borrower is an individual, require a certificate executed by the general
partner, managing member or authorized/senior officer of Borrower, as applicable
(and the same rules shall apply to any sole shareholder, general partner or
managing member which is not an individual).

         (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no
event shall Borrower be required to comply with the financial reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X that would be applicable solely as a result of
the principal amount of the Loan and any Affiliated Loans (at the time of
Securitization) equaling or exceeding 20% of the aggregate principal

                                     - 50 -
<PAGE>

amount of all mortgage loans included or expected to be included, as applicable,
in a Securitization.

         SECTION 5.12. ESTOPPEL STATEMENT

         (a) After request by Lender, Borrower shall within fifteen (15)
Business Days furnish Lender with a statement, duly acknowledged and certified,
setting forth (i) the amount of the original principal amount of the Note, (ii)
the rate of interest on the Note, (iii) the unpaid principal amount of the Note,
(iv) the date installments of interest and/or principal were last paid, (v) any
offsets or defenses to the payment of the Debt, if any, and (vi) that the Note,
this Agreement, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents are valid, legal and
binding obligations and have not been modified or if modified, giving
particulars of such modification.

         (b) Borrower shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver to Lender,
promptly upon request, but subject to the terms of the applicable Major Leases
that are either Ground Leases or Operating Leases, duly executed estoppel
certificates from any one or more Tenants thereunder as required by Lender (but
no more frequently than once every twelve (12) months provided no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing) attesting to such facts regarding the
related Lease as Lender may reasonably require, including, but not limited to
attestations that each Lease covered thereby is in full force and effect with no
defaults thereunder on the part of any party, that none of the Rents have been
paid more than one month in advance, except as security, and that the Tenant
claims no defense or offset against the full and timely performance of its
obligations under the Lease.

         SECTION 5.13. LEASING MATTERS.

         (a) Except as otherwise consented to by Lender in writing, all Leases
shall be written on the standard form of lease which shall have been (i) with
respect to pad Leases, delivered to Lender in connection with the closing of the
Loan and (ii) with respect to Operating Leases or Ground Leases, if any,
approved by Lender, provided however that Lender acknowledges that to the extent
any portion of the Property consists of a recreational vehicle resort, Borrower
shall not be required to enter into written Leases with any occupant or tenant
of such portion of the Property and such tenants and/or occupants of such
recreational vehicle resorts shall be deemed month to month tenants or licensees
of Borrower. So long as either Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal
Affiliate is Borrower under the Loan, Borrower may modify its standard form of
pad lease in accordance with sound business practices and Legal Requirements,
provided that the form of such Lease contains covenants and conditions that are
consistent with those contained in comparable leases in the applicable local
market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the majority of owners,
managers and/or operators of comparable recreational vehicle resorts in the
applicable local market enter into written Leases with the occupants of
recreational vehicle resorts, Borrower shall be required to enter into written
Leases with respect to such occupants, and the form of such lease shall contain
terms and conditions that are consistent with those of Leases of comparable
properties in the applicable market or sub-market. Upon request, Borrower (1)
shall furnish Lender with executed copies of all Major Leases and (2) shall make
available to Lender at Borrower's offices (upon reasonable notice to Borrower),
executed copies of all other Leases. No material changes may be made to the
Lender-approved standard form of Operating Lease and Ground Lease, if
applicable, without the prior written

                                     - 51 -
<PAGE>

consent of Lender. In addition, all renewals of Leases and all proposed leases
shall provide for rental rates and terms comparable to existing local market
rates and terms and, except with respect to one pad at the Property used for
on-site community managers (or other employees of Manager), shall be
arm's-length transactions with bona fide, independent third party tenants. All
proposed Major Leases and renewals of existing Major Leases shall be subject to
the prior approval of Lender and its counsel, at Borrower's expense. All Leases
shall provide that they are subordinate to the Mortgage and that the tenant
agrees to attorn to Lender.

         (b) Borrower (i) shall observe and perform all the obligations imposed
upon the landlord under the Leases and shall not do or permit to be done
anything to impair the value of the Leases as security for the Debt; (ii) shall
enforce all of the material terms, covenants and conditions contained in the
Leases upon the part of the Tenant thereunder to be observed or performed, short
of termination thereof; provided however, with respect to pad leases, a pad
Lease may be terminated in the event of a default by the tenant thereunder;
(iii) with respect to any Leases (other than Leases relating to mobile home park
pads or recreational vehicle resort pads), shall not collect any of the Rents
more than one (1) month in advance; provided, however, that in no event shall
Borrower collect any Rents under Leases (or any other applicable occupancy
agreements (written or otherwise)) relating to mobile home park pads or
recreational vehicle resort pads more than one (1) year in advance; (iv) shall
not execute any other assignment of the landlord's interest in the Leases or the
Rents; and (v) shall not consent to any assignment of or subletting under the
Major Leases not in accordance with their terms, without the prior written
consent of Lender.

         (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above, renewals of
existing commercial Leases and proposed Leases for commercial space shall not be
subject to the prior approval of Lender, provided all of the following
conditions are satisfied: (i) the rental income pursuant to the renewal or
proposed Lease is not more than five (5%) percent of the total rental income for
the Property, (ii) the renewal or proposed Lease has a base term of less than
six (6) years including options to renew, (iii) no rent, credits, free rents or
concessions have been granted under the renewal or proposed Lease (except to the
extent consistent with current market conditions), (iv) the renewal or proposed
Lease is subject and subordinate to the Mortgage and the tenant thereunder shall
have agreed to attorn to Lender, (v) the renewal or proposed Lease is on the
standard form of lease approved by Lender, (vi) the renewal or proposed Lease
does not contain any option, offer, right of first refusal, or other similar
right to acquire all or any portion of the Property, and (vii) the renewal or
proposed Lease provides for rental rates and terms comparable to existing market
rates and terms and is an arm's-length transaction with a bona fide, independent
third party tenant. Borrower shall deliver to Lender copies of all Leases which
are entered into pursuant to the preceding sentence together with Borrower's
certification that it has satisfied all of the conditions of the preceding
sentence within thirty (30) days after the execution of the Lease.

         SECTION 5.14. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

         (a) Borrower shall (i) promptly perform and observe all of the
covenants required to be performed and observed by it under the Management
Agreement and do all things necessary to preserve and to keep unimpaired its
material rights thereunder; (ii) promptly notify Lender of any material default
under the Management Agreement of which it is aware; (iii) promptly

                                     - 52 -
<PAGE>

deliver to Lender a copy of any notice of default or other material notice
received by Borrower under the Management Agreement; (iv) promptly give notice
to Lender of any notice or information that Borrower receives which indicates
that Manager is terminating the Management Agreement or that Manager is
otherwise discontinuing its management of the Property; and (v) promptly enforce
the performance and observance of all of the covenants required to be performed
and observed by Manager under the Management Agreement.

         (b) If at any time, (i) an Event of Default under Section 11.1(a)
hereof has occurred and is continuing; or (ii) Manager is not an Affiliated
Manager and either (A) a default has occurred and is continuing under the
Management Agreement or (B) Manager has become insolvent or a debtor in a
bankruptcy proceeding, Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, terminate the
Management Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior notice to Manager and replace
Manager with a Qualified Manager approved by Lender on terms and conditions
satisfactory to Lender, it being understood and agreed that the management fee
for such replacement manager shall not exceed then prevailing market rates.

         (c) Intentionally deleted.

         (d) Any entity Controlled by MHC or MHCOP shall be deemed Qualified
Manager. Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender (which

surrender, terminate or cancel the Management Agreement or otherwise replace
Manager or enter into any other management agreement with respect to the
Property; (ii) reduce or consent to the reduction of the term of the Management
Agreement; (iii) increase or consent to the increase of the amount of any
charges under the Management Agreement; or (iv) otherwise modify, change,

if Manager is Controlled by MHC or MHCOP, then Borrower shall have the right to
enter into amendments to the Management Agreement (1) which are consistent with
good operating practices, (2) which do not increase any of the fees or other
similar charges payable by Borrower thereunder and (3) which do not otherwise
materially increase any of Borrower's obligations thereunder, and Borrower shall
have the right to enter into a new management agreement with another entity
Controlled by MHC or MHCOP on substantially the same terms and conditions as
those set forth in the Management Agreement approved by Lender in connection
with the closing of the Loan and otherwise in accordance with the terms
permitted hereunder, without the consent of Lender. In the event that Borrower
replaces Manager at any time during the term of Loan pursuant to this
subsection, such Manager shall be a Qualified Manager.

         SECTION 5.15. LIENS

         Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any portion of the Property
or permit any such action to be taken, except Permitted Encumbrances.

                                     - 53 -
<PAGE>

         SECTION 5.16. DEBT CANCELLATION

         Borrower shall not cancel or otherwise forgive or release any claim or
debt (other than termination of Leases in accordance herewith) owed to Borrower
by any Person, except for adequate consideration and in the ordinary course of
Borrower's business.

         SECTION 5.17. ZONING

         Borrower shall not initiate or consent to any zoning reclassification
of any portion of the Property or seek any variance under any existing zoning
ordinance or use or permit the use of any portion of the Property in any manner
that could result in such use becoming a non-conforming use under any zoning
ordinance or any other applicable land use law, rule or regulation, without the
prior written consent of Lender.

         SECTION 5.18. ERISA

         (a) Borrower shall not engage in any transaction which would cause any
obligation, or action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise by Lender
of any of its rights under the Note, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents)
to be a non-exempt (under a statutory or administrative class exemption)
prohibited transaction under ERISA.

         (b) Borrower further covenants and agrees to deliver to Lender such
certifications or other evidence from time to time throughout the term of the
Loan, as requested by Lender in its sole discretion, that (i) Borrower is not
and does not maintain an "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, which is subject to Title I of ERISA, or a "governmental plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA; (ii) Borrower is not subject to state statutes
regulating investments and fiduciary obligations with respect to governmental
plans; and (iii) one or more of the following circumstances is true:

                           (A)      Equity interests in Borrower are publicly
                  offered securities, within the meaning of 29
                  C.F.R. Section 2510.3-101(b)(2);

                           (B)      Less than twenty-five percent (25%) of each
                  outstanding class of equity interests in Borrower are held by
                  "benefit plan investors" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
                  Section 2510.3-101(f)(2); or

                           (C)      Borrower qualifies as an "operating company"

         SECTION 5.20. RECIPROCAL EASEMENT AGREEMENTS

         Borrower shall not enter into, terminate or modify (in any material
respects) any REA without Lender's prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Borrower shall enforce,
comply with, and cause each of the parties to the REA to comply with all of the
material economic terms and conditions contained in the REA. Lender acknowledges
that it would be unreasonable to withhold its consent to Borrower entering into
an REA with an Affiliate owning property adjacent to the Property with respect
to the use of certain amenities and facilities at the Property, provided that
(A) any such REA would not (i) have a material adverse affect on the Property or
the Borrower, (ii) impose any material obligations on the Borrower, (B) the
terms of any such REA provide that Borrower shall be paid fair market value for
the use of such amenities and/or facilities under any such REA and (C)
sufficient utilities, facilities and other amenities shall continue to be
available to and serve the Property.

         SECTION 5.21. ALTERATIONS

         Lender's prior approval shall be required in connection with any
alterations to any Improvements, exclusive of alterations to tenant spaces
required under any Lease, (a) that may have a material adverse effect on the
Property or (b) that, together with any other alterations undertaken at the same
time (including any related alterations, improvements or replacements), are
reasonably anticipated to have a cost in excess of the Alteration Threshold.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) above and provided that either
the Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal Affiliate is Borrower under the
Loan, Lender's prior approval shall not be required in connection with any
alterations in excess of the Alteration Threshold, provided that Lender shall
have received (a) a current Appraisal of the Property (or a letter update to the
Appraisal delivered in connection with the closing of the Loan), (b) a
certificate from Borrower and (c) such other evidence that would be satisfactory
to a prudent institutional mortgage loan lender each indicating that such
alterations will not impair (as security for the Loan) the fair market value of
the real estate collateral portion of the Property, as determined by a prudent
institutional secondary market lender. If the total unpaid amounts incurred and
to be incurred with respect to such alterations to the Improvements shall at any
time exceed the Alteration Threshold and regardless of whether Lender's consent
is required in connection with any such alterations, Borrower shall promptly
deliver to Lender as security for the payment of such amounts and as additional
security for Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents any of the
following: (i) cash, (ii) direct non-callable obligations of the United States
of America or other obligations which are "government securities" within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent
acceptable to the applicable Rating Agencies, (iii) other securities acceptable
to Lender and the Rating Agencies, or (iv) a completion bond, provided that such
completion bond is acceptable to the Lender and the Rating Agencies. Such
security shall be in an amount equal to the excess of the total unpaid amounts
incurred and to be incurred with respect to such alterations to the Improvements
over the Alteration Threshold.

         SECTION 5.22. TAX CREDITS

         Borrower shall not claim a low income housing credit for the Property
under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code without Lender's prior written
consent.

         dissolve, terminate, liquidate in whole or in part, transfer or
         otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets or change
         its legal structure;

                  (iv)     fail to observe all organizational formalities, or
         fail to preserve its existence as an entity duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing (if applicable) under the applicable
         Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction of its organization or

         (1) unsecured, (2) not evidenced by a note, (3) on commercially
         reasonable terms and conditions, and (4) due not more than sixty (60)
         days past the date incurred and paid on or prior to such date, and/or
         (C) financing leases and purchase money indebtedness incurred in the
         ordinary course of business relating to Personal Property on
         commercially reasonable terms and conditions; provided however, the

         exceed at any time three percent (3%) of the outstanding principal
         amount of the Note;

                  (viii)   fail to maintain its records, books of account, bank

         operating results may be included in the consolidated financial
         statements of

                                     - 56 -

         an Affiliate, provided that such consolidated financial statements
         indicate that Borrower is a separate legal entity and that it maintains
         separate books and records;

                  (ix)     enter into any contract or agreement with any general
         partner, member, shareholder, principal, guarantor of the obligations
         of Borrower, or any Affiliate of the foregoing, except upon terms and
         conditions that are intrinsically fair, commercially reasonable and
         substantially similar to those that would be available on an
         arm's-length basis with unaffiliated third parties;

                  (x)      maintain its assets in such a manner that it will be
         costly or difficult to segregate, ascertain or identify its individual
         assets from those of any other Person;

                  (xi)     assume or guaranty the debts of any other Person,
         hold itself out to be responsible for the debts of any other Person, or

                  (xiv)    fail either to hold itself out to the public as a

                  (xv)     fail to maintain adequate capital for the normal
         obligations reasonably foreseeable in a business of its size and
         character and in light of its contemplated business operations,
         provided, however, that any such failure to maintain adequate capital
         will not constitute a breach of this covenant if cash flow from the
         Property is insufficient for Borrower to maintain adequate capital as
         set forth above;;

                  (xvi)    if it is a partnership or limited liability company,
         without the unanimous written consent of all of its partners or
         members, as applicable, and the written consent of 100% of the managers
         of Borrower (if any), including, without limitation, each Independent

         voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any Creditors Rights
         Laws, (b) seek or consent to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator
         or any similar official, (c) take any action that might cause such

         limitation, shared office space and services performed by an employee
         of an Affiliate) among the Persons sharing such expenses and to use

                                     - 57 -
<PAGE>

                  (xviii)  make any distributions so as to render Borrower
         insolvent or cause Borrower to become unable to pay its own liabilities
         (including, without limitation, the salaries of its own employees, if
         any) from its own funds;

                  (xix)    acquire obligations or securities of its partners,
         members, shareholders or other affiliates, as applicable; or

                  (xx)     violate or cause to be violated the assumptions made
         with respect to Borrower and its principals in any opinion letter
         pertaining to substantive consolidation delivered to Lender in
         connection with the Loan; or

                  (xxi)    If Borrower is a partnership or limited liability
         company, each general partner in the case of a general partnership,
         each general partner in the case of a limited partnership, or the
         managing member in the case of a limited liability company (each an
         "SPE COMPONENT ENTITY") of Borrower, as applicable, shall be a
         corporation or a single member Delaware limited liability company whose
         sole asset is its interest in Borrower. Each SPE Component Entity (i)
         will at all times comply with each of the covenants, terms and
         provisions contained in Section 6.1(a)(iii) - (vi) and (viii) - (xxi),
         as if such representation, warranty or covenant was made directly by
         such SPE Component Entity; (ii) will not engage in any business or
         activity other than owning an interest in Borrower; (iii) will not
         acquire or own any assets other than its partnership, membership, or
         other equity interest in Borrower; (iv) will not incur any debt,
         secured or unsecured, direct or contingent (including guaranteeing any
         obligation); (v) will at all times when the Loan is outstanding own at
         least a one hundredth of one percent (.01%) general partnership or
         managing membership interest in Borrower; and (vi) will cause Borrower
         to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.1 and Section 6.4.
         Prior to the withdrawal or the disassociation of any SPE Component
         Entity from Borrower, Borrower shall immediately appoint a new general
         partner or managing member whose articles of incorporation or limited
         liability company operating agreement, as applicable, are substantially
         similar to those of such SPE Component Entity and, if an opinion letter
         pertaining to substantive consolidation was required at closing,
         deliver a new opinion letter acceptable to Lender and the Rating
         Agencies with respect to the new SPE Component Entity and its equity
         owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Borrower is a
         single member Delaware limited liability company, so long as Borrower
         maintains such formation status, no SPE Component Entity shall be
         required.

         (b) In the event Borrower is a single member Delaware limited liability
company, the limited liability company agreement of Borrower (the "LLC
AGREEMENT") shall provide that (i) upon the occurrence of any event that causes
the sole member of Borrower ("MEMBER") to cease to be the member of Borrower
(other than (A) upon an assignment by Member of all of its limited liability
company interest in Borrower and the admission of the transferee in accordance
with the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement, or (B) the resignation of Member
and the admission of an additional member of Borrower in accordance with the
terms of the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement), any person acting as
Independent Director of Borrower shall, without any action of any other Person
and simultaneously with the Member ceasing to be the member of Borrower,
automatically be admitted to Borrower ("SPECIAL MEMBER") and shall continue
Borrower without dissolution and (ii) Special Member may not resign from
Borrower

                                     - 58 -
<PAGE>

or transfer its rights as Special Member unless (A) a successor Special
Member has been admitted to Borrower as Special Member in accordance with
requirements of Delaware law and (B) such successor Special Member has also
accepted its appointment as an Independent Director. The LLC Agreement shall
further provide that (i) Special Member shall automatically cease to be a member
of Borrower upon the admission to Borrower of a substitute Member, (ii) Special
Member shall be a member of Borrower that has no interest in the profits, losses
and capital of Borrower and has no right to receive any distributions of
Borrower assets, (iii) pursuant to Section 18-301 of the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act (the "ACT"), Special Member shall not be required to make
any capital contributions to Borrower and shall not receive a limited liability
company interest in Borrower, (iv) Special Member, in its capacity as Special
Member, may not bind Borrower and (v) except as required by any mandatory
provision of the Act, Special Member, in its capacity as Special Member, shall
have no right to vote on, approve or otherwise consent to any action by, or
matter relating to, Borrower, including, without limitation, the merger,
consolidation or conversion of Borrower; provided, however, such prohibition
shall not limit the obligations of Special Member, in its capacity as
Independent Director, to vote on such matters required by the Loan Documents or
the LLC Agreement. In order to implement the admission to Borrower of Special
Member, Special Member shall execute a counterpart to the LLC Agreement. Prior
to its admission to Borrower as Special Member, Special Member shall not be a
member of Borrower.

         Upon the occurrence of any event that causes the Member to cease to be
a member of Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the personal
representative of Member shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of
the event that terminated the continued membership of Member in Borrower, agree
in writing (i) to continue Borrower and (ii) to the admission of the personal
representative or its nominee or designee, as the case may be, as a substitute
member of Borrower, effective as of the occurrence of the event that terminated
the continued membership of Member of Borrower in Borrower. Any action initiated
by or brought against Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws
shall not cause Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of Borrower and
upon the occurrence of such an event, the business of Borrower shall continue
without dissolution. The LLC Agreement shall provide that each of Member and
Special Member waives any right it might have to agree in writing to dissolve
Borrower upon the occurrence of any action initiated by or brought against
Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws, or the occurrence of
an event that causes Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of
Borrower.

         SECTION 6.2. CHANGE OF NAME, IDENTITY OR STRUCTURE

         Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed (a) Borrower's name,
(b) Borrower's identity (including its trade name or names), (c) Borrower's
principal place of business set forth on the first page of this Agreement, (d)
the corporate, partnership or other organizational structure of Borrower, each
SPE Component Entity (if any), or Borrower Principal, (e) Borrower's state of
organization, or (f) Borrower's organizational identification number, without in
each case notifying Lender of such change in writing at least thirty (30) days
prior to the effective date of such change and, in the case of a change in
Borrower's structure, without first obtaining the prior written consent of
Lender. In addition, Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed any
organizational documents of Borrower or any SPE Component Entity (if any) if
such change would adversely impact the covenants set forth in Section 6.1 and
Section

                                     - 59 -
<PAGE>

6.4 hereof. Borrower authorizes Lender to file any financing statement or
financing statement amendment required by Lender to establish or maintain the
validity, perfection and priority of the security interest granted herein. At
the request of Lender, Borrower shall execute a certificate in form satisfactory
to Lender listing the trade names under which Borrower intends to operate the
Property, and representing and warranting that Borrower does business under no
other trade name with respect to the Property. If Borrower does not now have an
organizational identification number and later obtains one, or if the
organizational identification number assigned to Borrower subsequently changes,
Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of such organizational identification
number or change.

         SECTION 6.3. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

         Borrower will qualify to do business and will remain in good standing
under the laws of the State as and to the extent the same are required for the
ownership, maintenance, management and operation of the Property.

         SECTION 6.4. INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

         (a) The organizational documents of Borrower or each SPE Component
Entity (if any), as applicable, shall provide that at all times there shall be,
and Borrower shall cause there to be, at least one manager (each an "INDEPENDENT
DIRECTOR") of Borrower or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, reasonably
satisfactory to Lender each of whom are not at the time of such individual's
initial appointment, and shall not have been at any time during the preceding
five (5) years, and shall not be at any time while serving as a director of
Borrower or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, either (i) a shareholder
(or other equity owner) of, or an officer, director, partner, manager, member

liability companies), employee, attorney or counsel of, Borrower, such SPE
Component Entity or any of their respective shareholders, partners, members,
subsidiaries or affiliates; (ii) a customer or creditor of, or supplier to,

shareholder, officer, director, partner, manager, member, employee, supplier,
creditor or customer; or (iv) a member of the immediate family of any such
shareholder, officer, director, partner, manager, member, employee, supplier,
creditor or customer.

         (b) The organizational documents of Borrower or each SPE Component
Entity (if any), as the case may be, shall provide that the manager of Borrower
or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, shall not take any action which,
under the terms of any articles of organization or operating agreement, as
applicable, requires an unanimous vote of the members and manager of Borrower or
such SPE Component Entity, as the case may be, unless at the time of such action
there shall be at least one manager who is an Independent Director. Borrower or
such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, will not, without the unanimous
written consent of its members and managers, including each Independent
Director, on behalf of itself or Borrower, (i) file or consent to the filing of
any petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any
applicable Creditors Rights Laws; (ii) seek or consent to the appointment of a
receiver,

                                     - 60 -

liquidator or any similar official; (iii) take any action that might cause such
entity to become insolvent; or (iv) make an assignment for the benefit of
creditors.

less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of such proposed transfer or
(iii) the sale, transfer or issuance of stock in MHC provided that MHC is listed

owning in excess of forty-nine percent (49%) of the ownership interest in a
Restricted Party shall comply with the requirements of Section 7.4 hereof,
provided however, that with respect to transfers provided for in subsection
(a)(iii) hereof, Borrower shall not be required to deliver a revised substantive
non-consolidation opinion to Lender in connection with any such transfers.

         (b) In addition to the foregoing and supplementing subsection (a)
above, Lender's prior written consent shall not be required with respect to (i)

Affiliates, (ii) transfers of limited partnership interests in MHCOP, provided

(iii) the merger or consolidation of MHC or MHCOP without regard to whether MHC

         SECTION 7.4. LENDER'S RIGHTS

         Lender reserves the right to condition the consent to a Prohibited
Transfer requested hereunder upon (a) a modification of the terms hereof and an
assumption of the Note and the other Loan Documents as so modified by the
proposed Prohibited Transfer, (b) receipt of payment of a transfer fee equal to
one percent (1%) of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and all of
Lender's expenses incurred in connection with such Prohibited Transfer, (c)
receipt of written confirmation from the Rating Agencies that the Prohibited
Transfer will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
initial, or if higher, then current ratings issued in connection with a
Securitization, or if a Securitization has not occurred, any ratings to

                                     - 62 -
<PAGE>

be assigned in connection with a Securitization, (d) the proposed transferee's
continued compliance with the covenants set forth in this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the covenants in Article 6) and the other Loan Documents,
(e) a new manager for the Property and a new management agreement satisfactory
to Lender, and (f) the satisfaction of such other conditions and/or legal
opinions as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion to be in the interest
of Lender. All expenses incurred by Lender shall be payable by Borrower whether
or not Lender consents to the Prohibited Transfer. Lender shall not be required
to demonstrate any actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of
default hereunder in order to declare the Debt immediately due and payable upon
a Prohibited Transfer made without Lender's consent. This provision shall apply
to each and every Prohibited Transfer, whether or not Lender has consented to
any previous Prohibited Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 7.4, in the event a substantive non-consolidation
opinion was delivered to Lender and the Rating Agencies in connection with the
closing of the Loan, and if any Sale or Pledge permitted under this Article 7
results in any Person and its Affiliates owning in excess of forty-nine percent
(49%) of the ownership interests in a Restricted Party, Borrower shall, prior to
such transfer, and in addition to any other requirement for Lender consent
contained herein, deliver a revised substantive non-consolidation opinion to
Lender reflecting such Prohibited Transfer, which opinion shall be in form,
scope and substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating
Agencies.

         SECTION 7.5. ASSUMPTION

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 7, Lender
shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a transfer of the Property in its
entirety to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, any Person (a
"TRANSFEREE") and Lender shall release Borrower and Borrower Principal from
their obligations under the Loan (to the extent such obligations arise from
events occurring after the date of the assumption), provided that each of the
following terms and conditions are satisfied:

         (a) no Default or Event of Default has occurred;

         (b) Borrower shall have (i) delivered written notice to Lender of the
terms of such prospective transfer not less than sixty (60) days before the date
on which such transfer is scheduled to close and, concurrently therewith, all
such information concerning the proposed Transferee as Lender shall reasonably
require and (ii) paid to Lender a non-refundable processing fee in the amount of
$10,000 (which fee shall be credited against the assumption fee payable in
connection with such assumption). Lender shall have the right to approve or
disapprove the proposed transfer based on its then current underwriting and
credit requirements for similar loans secured by similar properties which loans
are sold in the secondary market, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld.
In determining whether to give or withhold its approval of the proposed
transfer, Lender shall consider the experience and track record of Transferee
and its principals in owning and operating facilities similar to the Property,
the financial strength of Transferee and its principals, the general business
standing of Transferee and its principals and Transferee's and its principals'
relationships and experience with contractors, vendors, tenants, lenders and
other business entities; provided, however, that, notwithstanding Lender's
agreement to consider the foregoing factors in determining whether to give or
withhold such approval, such approval shall be given or withheld based on what
Lender

                                     - 63 -
<PAGE>

determines to be commercially reasonable and, if given, may be given subject to
such conditions as Lender may deem reasonably appropriate;

         (c) Borrower shall have paid to Lender, concurrently with the closing
of such transfer, (i) a non-refundable assumption fee in an amount equal to one
percent (1.0%) of the then outstanding principal balance of the Note (subject to
credit for any previously paid non-refundable processing fees), and (ii) all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, incurred by Lender in connection with the transfer;

         (d) Transferee assumes and agrees to pay the Debt as and when due
subject to the provisions of Article 15 hereof and, prior to or concurrently
with the closing of such transfer, Transferee and its constituent partners,
members or shareholders as Lender may require, shall execute, without any cost
or expense to Lender, such documents and agreements as Lender shall reasonably
require to evidence and effectuate said assumption;

         (e) Borrower and Transferee, without any cost to Lender, shall furnish
any information requested by Lender for the preparation of, and shall authorize
Lender to file, new financing statements and financing statement amendments and
other documents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and shall
execute any additional documents reasonably requested by Lender;

         (f) Borrower shall have delivered to Lender, without any cost or
expense to Lender, such endorsements to Lender's Title Insurance Policy insuring
that fee simple or leasehold title to the Property, as applicable, is vested in
Transferee (subject to Permitted Encumbrances), hazard insurance endorsements or

require, shall comply with the covenants set forth in Article 6 hereof;

         (h) Transferee shall assume the obligations of Borrower under any

which meets with the requirements of Section 5.14 hereof and assign to Lender as
additional security such new management agreement;

         (i) Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
Lender and its counsel (A) that Transferee's formation documents provide for the
matters described in subparagraph (g) above, (B) that the assumption of the Debt
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and that the Note, the
Mortgage, this Agreement, the assumption agreement and the other Loan Documents
are valid, binding and enforceable against Transferee in accordance with their
terms, (C) that Transferee and any entity which is a controlling stockholder,
member

respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of the Property in its entirety

Property as determined by Lender.

documents relating to the organization and formation of Affiliate Transferee and

assignment to Lender of such Management Agreement as additional security for the
Loan;

         (h) Affiliate Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel

<PAGE>

qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any rating initially assigned or to be
assigned to the Securities;

         (j) Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale, if any, pursuant
to which the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject to the

connection with the closing of the Loan, Borrower and Affiliate Transferee
shall, prior to such transfer and assumption, deliver a new or updated
Insolvency Opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and
substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies;

         (l) Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence which would be
satisfactory to a prudent lender that (i) the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property has been legally split or subdivided from the remainder of the
Property; (ii) after giving effect to such transfer, each of the Affiliate
Transfer Portion of the Property and the balance of the Property conforms and is
in compliance in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements and
constitutes a separate tax lot and (iii) the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property is not necessary for the Property to comply with any zoning, building,
land use or parking or other Legal Requirements applicable to the Property or
for the then current use of the Property, including, without limitation, for
access, driveways, parking, utilities or drainage or, to the extent that the
Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property is necessary for any such purposes, a
reciprocal easement agreement has been executed and recorded that would allow
the owner of the Property to continue to use the Affiliate Transfer Portion of
the Property to the extent necessary for such purposes;

         (m) Borrower shall deliver to Lender an endorsement to the Title
Insurance Policy (i) extending the effective date of the Title Insurance Policy

under the Title Insurance Policy; and (iii) insuring the rights and benefits
under any new or amended reciprocal easement agreement or such other agreement
required pursuant to subsection 7.7(l)(iii) hereof that has been executed and
recorded, if any. Borrower shall have delivered to Lender, without any cost or
expense to Lender, such endorsements to Lender's Title Insurance Policy insuring
that fee simple or leasehold title to the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property, as applicable, is vested in Affiliate Transferee (subject to Permitted
Encumbrances), hazard insurance endorsements or certificates and other similar
materials as Lender may deem necessary at the time of the transfer, all in form
and substance satisfactory to Lender;

         (n) not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the

executed by any entities other than Lender holding Liens encumbering the
Property or the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property (or holding any other

         (o) Borrower and Affiliate Transferee have complied with any
requirements applicable to the transfer in any Major Leases, REA's, operating
agreements, parking agreements or other similar agreements affecting the
Property or the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property and the transfer does
not violate any of the provisions of such documents in any respect that would
result in a termination (or give any other party thereto the right to
terminate), extinguishment or other loss of material right of Borrower or in a
material increase in Borrower's obligations under such documents and, to the
extent necessary to comply with such documents, the Affiliate Transferee has
assumed Borrower's obligations, if any, relating to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property under such documents; and

         (p) if a securitization shall have occurred, Borrower shall deliver to

form and substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a
prudent lender stating, among other things, that the transfer and assumption by
Affiliate Transferee pursuant to this Section 7.7 (1) will not directly or
indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust that then holds the Note to fail
to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and (2) will not cause any REMIC Trust
to be an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, at
Borrower's cost; and

         (q) Borrower delivers to Lender any other information, approvals and
documents which would be required by a prudent Lender in connection with such
transfer and assumption.

         A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of a portion of the
Property to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, an Affiliate Transferee
pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right
of Lender to consent to any subsequent transfer of the Property or assumption of
the Loan. Notwithstanding any transfer and assumption to an Affiliate Transferee
pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Property and the Affiliate Transfer Portion of
the Property shall be deemed a single Property for purposes of this Agreement
and the Loan.

         SECTION 7.8. ADDITIONAL PERMITTED TRANSFERS.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 7,
Borrower may grant easements, restrictions, covenants, reservations and rights
of way with respect to the Property in the ordinary course of business for water
and sewer lines, telephone and telegraph lines, electric lines and other
utilities or for other similar purposes, provided that such transfers,
conveyances or encumbrances (i) shall not impair the utility and operation of
the Property or materially adversely affect the value of the Property or
adversely affect Borrower's ability to pay the Debt or the Monthly Payment
Amount and (ii) shall be in a form that is reasonably acceptable to Lender.

         each case (A) in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the
         "Full Replacement Cost," which for purposes of this Agreement shall

         depreciation; (B) containing an agreed amount endorsement with respect
         to the Improvements and Personal Property waiving all co-insurance
         provisions; (C) providing for no deductible in excess of $100,000 for

         consistent with the comprehensive all risk insurance policy required
         under this subsection (i);

                  (ii)     Commercial General Liability insurance against claims
         for personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring

         so-called "occurrence" form with a general aggregate limit of not less
         than $2,000,000 and a per occurrence limit of not less than $1,000,000;
         (B) to continue at not less than the aforesaid limit until required to
         be changed by Lender in writing by reason of changed economic

         the following hazards: (1) premises and operations; (2) products and
         completed operations; (3) independent contractors; (4) blanket

         as applicable, (A) with loss payable to Lender; (B) covering all risks
         required to be covered by the insurance provided for in subsection (i)
         above; and (C) which provides that after the physical loss to the

         as applicable, will be insured until completion of Restoration or the
         expiration of twelve (12) months, whichever first occurs, and
         notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such
         period; and (D) which contains an extended period of indemnity
         endorsement which provides that after the physical loss to the
         Improvements and Personal Property has been repaired, the continued
         loss of income will be insured until such income either returns to the
         same level it was at prior to the loss, or the expiration of twelve
         (12) months from the date that the Property is repaired or replaced and
         operations are resumed, whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding
         that the policy may expire prior to the end of such period. The amount
         of such loss of rents or business

                                     - 69 -

         income insurance, as applicable, shall be determined prior to the date
         hereof and at least once each year thereafter based on Borrower's
         reasonable estimate of the gross income from the Property for the
         succeeding period of coverage required above. All proceeds payable to
         Lender pursuant to this subsection shall be held by Lender and shall be
         applied to the obligations secured by the Loan Documents from time to
         time due and payable hereunder and under the Note; provided, however,
         that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to relieve Borrower of
         its obligations to pay the obligations secured by the Loan Documents on
         the respective dates of payment provided for in the Note, this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents except to the extent such

         business income insurance, as applicable;

                  (iv)     at all times during which structural construction,

         not covered by or under the terms or provisions of the above mentioned
         commercial general liability insurance policy; and (B) the insurance
         provided for in subsection (i) above written in a so-called Builder's
         Risk Completed Value form (1) on a non-reporting basis, (2) against
         "all risks" insured against pursuant to subsection (i) above, (3)
         including permission to occupy the Property, and (4) with an agreed
         amount endorsement waiving co-insurance provisions;

                  (vi)     comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if

         general liability insurance required under subsection (ii) above; and

                  (viii)   upon sixty (60) days' written notice, such other
         reasonable insurance and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time
         to time may reasonably request against such other insurable hazards
         which at the time are commonly insured against for property similar to
         the Property located in or around the region in which the Property is
         located.

         (b) All insurance provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall be obtained
under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or in the
singular, the "POLICY"), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to
insurance companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The
Policies shall be issued by financially sound and responsible insurance
companies authorized to do business in the State and having a claims paying
ability rating of either (1) "AA" or better by at least two Rating Agencies, one

least A-/VII by A.M. Best Company, Inc. The Policies described in Section 8.1(a)
shall designate Lender and its successors and assigns as additional insureds,
mortgagees and/or loss payee as deemed appropriate by Lender. To the

extent such Policies are not available as of the Closing Date, Borrower shall

deliver to Lender renewal Policies

         (c) Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to the
Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and shall
otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring only
the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(a).

         (d) All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 8.1(a), except
for the Policy referenced in Section 8.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as the
insured, as its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage, boiler
and machinery, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called New
York standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing
that the loss thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

         (e) All Policies provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall contain clauses
or endorsements to the effect that:

                  (i)      no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting
         for Borrower, or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply
         with the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a
         forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way
         affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as
         Lender is concerned;

                  (ii)     the Policies shall not be materially changed (other
         than to increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at
         least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lender and any other
         party named therein as an additional insured;

                  (iii)    the issuers thereof shall give written notice to
         Lender if the Policies have not been renewed thirty (30) days prior to
         its expiration; and

                  (iv)     Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums
         thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

         (f) If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence that
all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall have
the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Property, including, without
limitation, obtaining such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion
deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such
action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the Mortgage
and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

         SECTION 8.2. CASUALTY

         If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part in
any material respect, by fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"), Borrower shall
give prompt notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and
diligently prosecute the Restoration of the Property in accordance with Section
8.4, whether or not Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section
8.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or not such costs
are covered by insurance. Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Borrower shall adjust all claims for
Insurance Proceeds in consultation with, and approval of, Lender; provided,
however, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall
have the exclusive right to participate in the adjustment of all claims for
Insurance Proceeds.

         SECTION 8.3. CONDEMNATION

         Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of the Property of which
Borrower has knowledge and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers
served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including but not
limited to any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and
applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest
paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive
out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.
If the Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority,
Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the
Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 8.4, whether or not
Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section 8.4. If the Property
is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the
Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the
Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a
portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

         SECTION 8.4. RESTORATION

         The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration
of the Property:

         (a)      If the Net Proceeds shall be less than $250,000 and the costs
of completing the Restoration shall be less than $250,000, the Net Proceeds will
be disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers to
Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously commence and to

                                      -72-

satisfactorily complete with due diligence the Restoration in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

         (b)      If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than $250,000 or
the costs of completing the Restoration are equal to or greater than $250,000,
Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.4. The term "NET PROCEEDS" for purposes of
this Section 8.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds
received by Lender pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (viii) as a
result of a Casualty, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("INSURANCE PROCEEDS"), or (ii) the net amount of the Award as a result
of a Condemnation, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS"), whichever the case may be.

                  (i)      The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower
         for Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                           (A)      no Event of Default shall have occurred and
                  be continuing;

                           (B)      (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are
                  Insurance Proceeds, less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
                  mobile home and/or recreational vehicle pads, as applicable,
                  on the Property shall be rendered unusable for a period in
                  excess of twelve (12) months as a result of a Casualty or (2)
                  in the event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less
                  than fifteen percent (15%) of the rentable area of the
                  Property and fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market value of
                  the Land constituting the Property is taken, such land is
                  located along the perimeter or periphery of the Property, and
                  no portion of the permanent Improvements is located on such
                  land;

                           (C)      intentionally deleted;

                           (D)      Borrower shall commence the Restoration as
                  soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than
                  sixty (60) days after such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever
                  the case may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same
                  to satisfactory completion;

                           (E)      Lender shall be satisfied that any operating
                  deficits, including all scheduled payments of principal and
                  interest under the Note, which will be incurred with respect
                  to the Property as a result of the occurrence of any such
                  Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will be
                  covered out of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
                  8.1(a)(iii) above;

                           (F)      Lender shall be satisfied that the
                  Restoration will be completed on or before the earliest to
                  occur of (1) six (6) months prior to the Maturity Date, (2)
                  the earliest date required for such completion under the terms
                  of any Major Leases, Ground Leases, if applicable, Operating
                  Leases, if applicable, or material agreements affecting the
                  Property, (3) such time as may be required under

                                      -73-
<PAGE>

                  applicable zoning law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or (4)
                  the expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in
                  Section 8.1(a)(iii);

                           (G)      the Property and the use thereof after the
                  Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under all
                  Legal Requirements;

                           (H)      the Restoration shall be done and completed
                  by Borrower in an expeditious and diligent fashion and in
                  compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements;

                           (I)      such Casualty or Condemnation, as
                  applicable, does not result in the loss of access to the
                  Property or the Improvements;

                           (J)      Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be
                  delivered, to Lender a signed detailed budget approved in
                  writing by Borrower's architect or engineer stating the entire
                  cost of completing the Restoration, which budget shall be
                  reasonably acceptable to Lender; and

                           (K)      the Net Proceeds together with any cash or
                  cash equivalent deposited by Borrower with Lender are
                  sufficient in Lender's reasonable judgment to cover the cost
                  of the Restoration.

                  (ii)     The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender until
         disbursements commence, and, until disbursed in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 8.4, shall constitute additional security
         for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net
         Proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower
         on a monthly basis during the course of the Restoration in accordance
         with customary construction lending practices, upon receipt of evidence
         satisfactory to Lender that (A) all the conditions precedent to such
         advance, including those set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i), have been
         satisfied, (B) all materials installed and work and labor performed
         (except to the extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested
         disbursement) in connection with the related Restoration item have been
         paid for in full, and (C) there exist no notices of pendency, stop
         orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices of intention to
         file same, or any other liens or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever
         on the Property which have not either been fully bonded to the
         satisfaction of Lender and discharged of record or in the alternative
         fully insured to the satisfaction of Lender by the title company
         issuing the Title Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
         Insurance Proceeds from the Policies required to be maintained by
         Borrower pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii) shall be controlled by Lender
         at all times, shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section
         8.4 and shall be used for the payment of all of the obligations due and
         payable under the Loan Documents for the entire time period for which
         any such Insurance Proceeds relate. After such application of the
         Insurance Proceeds, the remaining balance, if any, of any such proceeds
         shall be disbursed and/or applied as follows: (A) provided no Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing, to Borrower and (B) upon the
         occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to
         Operating Expenses.

                  (iii)    All plans and specifications required in connection
         with the Restoration shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in
         all respects by Lender and to the extent the Restoration relates to any
         permanent Improvements on the Property, by an independent consulting
         engineer selected by Lender (the "Restoration Consultant"). Lender
         shall have the use of the plans and specifications and all permits,
         licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with the
         Restoration. To the extent the Restoration relates to any permanent
         Improvements on the Property, the identity of the contractors,
         subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as
         the contracts in excess of $100,000 under which they have been engaged,
         shall be subject to prior review and acceptance by Lender and the
         Restoration Consultant. All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in
         connection with making the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration,
         including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
         disbursements and the Restoration Consultant's fees, shall be paid by
         Borrower.

                  (iv)     In no event shall Lender be obligated to make
         disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the
         costs actually incurred from time to time for work in place as part of
         the Restoration, as certified by the Restoration Consultant, minus the
         Restoration Retainage. The term "Restoration Retainage" shall mean an
         amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for
         work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the
         Restoration Consultant, until the Restoration has been completed. The
         Restoration Retainage shall be reduced to five percent (5%) of the
         costs incurred upon receipt by Lender of satisfactory evidence that
         fifty percent (50%) of the Restoration has been completed. The
         Restoration Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything
         to the contrary set forth above in this Section 8.4(b), be less than
         the amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors,
         subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The
         Restoration Retainage shall not be released until the Restoration
         Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed
         in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b) and that all
         approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the Property have
         been obtained from all appropriate Governmental Authorities, and Lender
         receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the
         Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the
         Restoration Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release the
         portion of the Restoration Retainage being held with respect to any
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as
         of the date upon which the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender
         that the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily
         completed all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with
         the provisions of the contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's
         contract, the contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the
         lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested
         by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy,
         and Lender receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy
         insuring the continued priority of the lien of the Mortgage and
         evidence of payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. If
         required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Restoration
         Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has
         issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor,
         subcontractor or materialman.

<PAGE>

                  (v)      Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements
         of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

                  (vi)     If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed
         balance thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in
         consultation with the Restoration Consultant, as applicable, be
         sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are estimated
         to be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration,
         Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency")
         with Lender before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall
         be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be
         held by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in
         connection with the Restoration on the same conditions applicable to
         the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant
         to this Section 8.4(b) shall constitute additional security for the
         Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (vii)    The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the
         remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited
         with Lender after Borrower and the Restoration Consultant, to the
         extent applicable, certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
         completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b), and
         the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs
         incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full,
         shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default
         shall have occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this
         Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

         (c)      All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 8.4(b)(vii) may (x) be retained and applied by Lender toward the
payment of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority
and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, (y) at
the sole discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part,
to Borrower for such purposes and upon such conditions as Lender shall
designate.

         (d)      In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage, or other transfer
of title to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt, all
right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies then in force
concerning the Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest
in the purchaser at such foreclosure, Lender or other transferee in the event of
such other transfer of title.

                                  RESERVE FUNDS

         SECTION 9.1. REQUIRED REPAIRS

         (a)      Borrower shall make the repairs and improvements to the
Property set forth on Schedule 2 and as more particularly described in the
Physical Conditions Report prepared in connection with the closing of the Loan
(such repairs hereinafter referred to as "REQUIRED REPAIRS"). Borrower shall
complete the Required Repairs in a good and workmanlike manner on or before the
date that is twelve (12) months from the date hereof or within such other time
frame for completion specifically set forth on Schedule 2.

                                      -76-
<PAGE>

         SECTION 9.2. REPLACEMENTS

         (a)      On an ongoing basis throughout the term of the Loan, Borrower
shall make capital repairs, replacements and improvements necessary to keep the
Property in good order and repair and in a good marketable condition or prevent
deterioration of the Property ("REPLACEMENTS"). Borrower shall complete all
Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as soon as commercially reasonable
after commencing to make each such Replacement.

         (b)      Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible
Account with Lender or Lender's agent to fund the Replacements (the "REPLACEMENT
RESERVE ACCOUNT"). In addition, Borrower shall deposit $4.17 monthly per pad
(the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE MONTHLY DEPOSIT") into the Replacement Reserve Account
on each Scheduled Payment Date during any Replacement Reserve Period. Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as "REPLACEMENT RESERVE FUNDS."

         SECTION 9.3. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION 9.4. REQUIRED WORK.

         Borrower shall diligently pursue all Required Repairs and Replacements
(collectively, the "REQUIRED Work") to completion in accordance with the
following requirements:

         (a)      Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all
contracts or work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors,
contractors or other parties providing labor or materials in connection with the
Required Work to the extent such contracts or work orders exceed $100,000. Upon
Lender's request, Borrower shall assign any contract or subcontract to Lender.

         (b)      In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion
that any Required Work is not being or has not been performed in a workmanlike
or timely manner, upon ten (10) days notice to Borrower and Borrower's failure
to commence performance of such Required Work in accordance with this Section
9.4, Lender shall have the option to withhold disbursement for such
unsatisfactory Required Work and to proceed under existing contracts or to
contract with third parties to complete such Required Work and to apply
Replacement Reserve Funds, if any, toward the labor and materials necessary to
complete such Required Work, without providing any prior notice to Borrower and
to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender upon an Event of
Default hereunder.

         (c)      In order to facilitate Lender's completion of the Required
Work, as permitted in subsection 9.4(b) above, Borrower grants Lender the right
to enter onto the Property and perform any and all work and labor necessary to
complete the Required Work and/or employ watchmen to protect the Property from
damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the extent not from the Reserve
Funds, shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower and
secured by the Mortgage. For this purpose Borrower constitutes and appoints
Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to
complete or undertake the Required Work in the name of Borrower upon Borrower's
failure to do so in a workmanlike and timely manner. Such power of attorney
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any of the

                                      -77-
<PAGE>

Reserve Funds for the purpose of making or completing the Required Work; (ii) to
make such additions, changes and corrections to the Required Work as shall be
reasonably necessary to complete the Required Work; (iii) to employ such
contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as shall be
required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills
and claims which are or may become Liens against the Property, or as may be
reasonably necessary for the completion of the Required Work, or for clearance
of title; (v) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of
Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to
prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Property
or the rehabilitation and repair of the Property; and (vii) to do any and every
act which Borrower would be required to do on its own behalf to fulfill the
terms of this Agreement.

         (d)      Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall: (i) make Lender responsible
for making or completing the Required Work; (ii) require Lender to expend funds
in addition to the Reserve Funds to make or complete any Required Work; (iii)
obligate Lender to proceed with the Required Work; or (iv) obligate Lender to
demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Required Work.

         (e)      Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or
inspector) or third parties performing Required Work pursuant to this Section
9.4 to enter onto the Property during normal business hours (subject to the
rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any Required
Work and all materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all plans
and shop drawings relating to such Required Work which are or may be kept at the
Property, and to complete any Required Work made pursuant to this Section 9.4.
Borrower shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender
and Lender's representatives or such other persons described above in connection
with inspections described in this Section 9.4 or the completion of Required
Work pursuant to this Section 9.4.

         (f)      Lender may, to the extent any Required Work would reasonably
require an inspection of the Property, inspect the Property at Borrower's
expense prior to making a disbursement of the Reserve Funds in order to verify
completion of the Required Work for which reimbursement is sought. Borrower
shall pay Lender a reasonable inspection fee not exceeding $500 for each such
inspection. Lender may require that such inspection be conducted by an
appropriate independent qualified professional selected by Lender and/or may
require a copy of a certificate of completion by an independent qualified
professional acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of the Reserve
Funds. Borrower shall pay the expense of the inspection as required hereunder,
whether such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified
professional.

         (g)      The Required Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or
any other item comprising a part of any Required Work shall be constructed,
installed or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's,
materialman's or other Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (h)      Before each disbursement of the Reserve Funds, if any, Lender
may require Borrower to provide Lender with a search of title to the Property
effective to the date of the

                                      -78-
<PAGE>

disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's or materialmen's or other
Liens of any nature have been placed against the Property since the date of
recordation of the Mortgage and that title to the Property is free and clear of
all Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (i)      All Required Work shall comply with all Legal Requirements in
all material respects and applicable insurance requirements including, without
limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits, environmental
regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

         (j)      Borrower hereby assigns to Lender all rights and claims
Borrower may have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in connection
with the Required Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such
rights or claims unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

         SECTION 9.5. RELEASE OF RESERVE FUNDS

         (a)      Upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of the
requirements set forth in this Agreement, Lender shall disburse to Borrower
amounts, if any, from the Replacement Reserve Account to the extent necessary to
reimburse Borrower for the actual costs of any approved Replacements.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall Lender be required to
(x) disburse funds from any of the Reserve Accounts if an Event of Default
exists or (y) disburse funds (if any) from the Replacement Reserve Account to
reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine repairs or maintenance to the
Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from funds held in any other
Reserve Account.

         (b)      Each request for disbursement from any of the Reserve Accounts
shall be on a form provided or approved by Lender and shall (i) include copies
of invoices for all items or materials purchased and all labor or services
provided and (ii) specify (A) the Required Work for which the disbursement is
requested, (B) the quantity and price of each item purchased, if the Required
Work includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (C) the price of
all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any Required Work other than
the purchase or replacement of specific items, and (D) the cost of all
contracted labor or other services applicable to each Required Work for which
such request for disbursement is made. With each request Borrower shall certify
that all Required Work has been performed in accordance with all Legal
Requirements. Except as provided in Section 9.5(d), each request for
disbursement shall be made only after completion of the Replacement (or the
portion thereof completed in accordance with Section 9.5(d)) for which
disbursement is requested. Borrower shall provide Lender evidence satisfactory
to Lender in its reasonable judgment of such completion or performance.

         (c)      Upon Borrower's request, Lender shall disburse funds from the
Replacement Reserve Account to Borrower on a monthly basis, and Borrower shall
use such funds to pay all invoices in connection with the Required Work with
respect to which a disbursement is requested. In addition, as a condition to any
disbursement, Lender may require Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor who receives
payment in an amount equal to or greater than $10,000 for completion of its work
or delivery of its materials. Any lien waiver delivered hereunder shall conform
to all Legal Requirements and shall cover all work performed and materials
supplied (including equipment

                                      -79-
<PAGE>

and fixtures) for the Property by that contractor, supplier, subcontractor,
mechanic or materialman through the date covered by the current disbursement
request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor, supplier,
subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint check, the
release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by the previous
release of funds request).

         (d)      If (i) the cost of any item of Required Work exceeds $25,000
and (ii) the contractor performing such Required Work requires periodic payments
pursuant to terms of a written contract, a request for disbursement from the
Reserve Accounts may be made after completion of a portion of the work under
such contract, provided (A) such contract requires payment upon completion of
such portion of work, (B) the materials for which the request is made are on
site at the Property and are properly secured or have been installed in the
Property, (C) all other conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been
satisfied, and (D) in the case of a Replacement, funds remaining in the
Replacement Reserve Account are, in Lender's judgment, sufficient to complete
such Replacement and other Replacements when required.

         (e)      Borrower shall not make a request for, nor shall Lender have
any obligation to make, any disbursement from any Reserve Account more
frequently than once in any calendar month and (except in connection with the
final disbursement) in any amount less than the lesser of (i) $10,000 or (ii)
the total cost of the Required Work for which the disbursement is requested.

         (f)      Intentionally deleted.

         (g)      Intentionally deleted.

         (h)      Lender's disbursement of any Reserve Funds or other
acknowledgment of completion of any Required Work in a manner satisfactory to
Lender shall not be deemed a certification or warranty by Lender to any Person
that the Required Work has been completed in accordance with Legal Requirements.

         (i)      If the funds in any Reserve Account should exceed the amount
of payments actually applied by Lender for the purposes of the account, Lender
in its sole discretion shall either return any excess to Borrower or credit such
excess against future payments to be made to that Reserve Account. In allocating
any such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on Lender's records as
being the owner of the Property.

         (j)      The insufficiency of any balance in any of the Reserve
Accounts shall not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all
preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

         (k)      INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         (l)      Upon termination of the Replacement Reserve Period or payment
in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on deposit, if any, in the
Replacement Reserve Account shall be returned to Borrower or the Person shown on
Lender's records as being the owner of the Property and no other party shall
have any right or claim thereto.

         SECTION 9.6. TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS

         Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent sufficient to discharge Borrower's obligations for the
payment of Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1
hereof (the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Borrower shall deposit into
the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account on each Scheduled Payment Date during any
Tax and Insurance Reserve Period (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender
estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months or such
higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all
such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to the earlier of (i) the date that
the same will become delinquent and (ii) the date that additional charges or
interest will accrue due to the non-payment thereof, and (b) except to the
extent Lender has waived the insurance escrow because the insurance required
hereunder is maintained under a blanket insurance Policy acceptable to Lender in
accordance with Section 8.1(c), one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that
Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months for
the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof
or such higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to
pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called
the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS"). Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance
Reserve Funds to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by
Borrower pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof. In making any
disbursement from the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account, Lender may do so
according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate
public office or tax lien service (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent
(with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such
bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale,
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount of the Tax and
Insurance Reserve Funds shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance
Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof, Lender shall, in its
sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against
future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account. In
allocating any such excess, Lender may deal with the person shown on Lender's
records as being the owner of the Property. Any amount remaining in the Tax and
Insurance Reserve Account after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned
to Borrower or the person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the
Property and no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. If at any
time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds are
not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates
set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such
determination and Borrower shall pay to Lender any amount necessary to make up
the deficiency within ten (10) days after notice from Lender to Borrower
requesting payment thereof.

         SECTION 9.7. EXCESS CASH

         Borrower shall establish on the date hereof a sub-account of the Cash
Management Account into which Borrower shall deposit all Excess Cash on each
Scheduled Payment Date during any Cash Management Period (the "EXCESS CASH
RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"EXCESS CASH RESERVE FUNDS." Sums from the Excess Cash Reserve Account shall be
disbursed to Borrower's Account upon the discontinuation of a Cash Management
Period.

                                      -81-
<PAGE>

         SECTION 9.8. TERRORISM RESERVE.

         Upon the occurrence of an Act of Terror (i) Borrower shall establish an
Eligible Account with Lender or Lender's agent (the "TERRORISM RESERVE ACCOUNT")
and (ii) Borrower Principal shall immediately deposit into the Terrorism Reserve
Account an amount equal to the sum of the three (3) Monthly Payment Amounts that
would be payable by Borrower for the three (3) Scheduled Payment Dates
immediately following the occurrence of such Act of Terror. Amounts so deposited
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "TERRORISM RESERVE FUNDS". "ACT OF
TERROR" shall mean any foreign acts of terrorism or similar acts of sabotage
(excluding acts of war or nuclear, chemical and biological acts) in which the
Property is directly affected by such acts. Lender shall apply Terrorism Reserve
Funds, if any, to any amounts due hereunder.

         SECTION 9.9. RESERVE FUNDS GENERALLY

         (a)      Funds on deposit in the Reserve Accounts shall be held by
Lender or any Loan servicer, as applicable, and invested in Permitted
Investments as directed by Lender, and interest shall be credited to Borrower.
All such interest shall be and become part of the applicable Reserve Accounts
and shall be disbursed in accordance with Section 9.5 above, provided, however,
that Lender may, at its election, retain any such interest for its own account
for application to the Debt in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default. Borrower
agrees that it shall include all interest on the applicable Reserve Funds as the
income of Borrower (and, if Borrower is a partnership or other pass-through
entity, the partners, members or beneficiaries of Borrower, as the case may be),
and shall be the owner of the applicable Reserve Funds for federal and
applicable state and local tax purposes.

         (b)      Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security
interest in, and assigns and pledges to Lender, each of the Reserve Accounts and
any and all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts as
additional security for payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in
accordance herewith, the Reserve Accounts and the Reserve Funds shall constitute
additional security for the Debt. The provisions of this Section 9.9 are
intended to give Lender or any subsequent holder of the Loan "control" of the
Reserve Accounts within the meaning of the UCC.

         (c)      The Reserve Accounts and any and all Reserve Funds now or
hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts shall be subject to the exclusive
dominion and control of Lender, which shall hold the Reserve Accounts and any or
all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Borrower shall have no right of
withdrawal from the Reserve Accounts or any other right or power with respect to
the Reserve Accounts or any or all of the Reserve Funds now or hereafter
deposited in the Reserve Accounts, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement.

         (d)      Lender shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Borrower,
without charge, an annual accounting of each Reserve Account in the normal
format of Lender or its loan servicer, showing credits and debits to such
Reserve Account and the purpose for which each debit to each Reserve Account was
made.

                                      -82-
<PAGE>

         (e)      As long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Lender shall make disbursements from the Reserve Accounts in accordance with
this Agreement. All such disbursements shall be deemed to have been expressly
pre-authorized by Borrower, and shall not be deemed to constitute the exercise
by Lender of any remedies against Borrower unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and Lender has expressly stated in writing its intent
to proceed to exercise its remedies as a secured party, pledgee or lienholder
with respect to the Reserve Accounts.

         (f)      If any Event of Default occurs, Borrower shall immediately
lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve Accounts until
the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured to
Lender's satisfaction, or (ii) the payment in full of the Debt. In addition, at
Lender's election, Borrower shall lose all of its rights to receive interest on
the Reserve Accounts during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured party,
pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Reserve Accounts. Without limitation
of the foregoing, during the continuance of any Event of Default, Lender may use
and disburse the Reserve Funds (or any portion thereof) for any of the following
purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited to, principal
prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or partial
prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses, fees,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other
Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item from any of the Reserve Accounts as
required or permitted under this Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted
by applicable law; provided, however, that any such application of funds shall
not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default. Without limiting any other
provisions hereof, each of the remedial actions described in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable exercise of
Lender's rights and remedies as a secured party with respect to the Reserve
Funds and shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a
foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve Funds to effect a
cure of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt, or in any specific order of
priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's rights and remedies under this
Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents shall not in any way
prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate and complete a foreclosure under
the Mortgage.

         (g)      The Reserve Funds shall not constitute escrow or trust funds
and may be commingled with other monies held by Lender. Notwithstanding anything
else herein to the contrary, Lender may commingle in one or more Eligible
Accounts any and all funds controlled by Lender, including, without limitation,
funds pledged in favor of Lender by other borrowers, whether for the same
purposes as the Reserve Accounts or otherwise. Without limiting any other
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Reserve Accounts
may be established and held in such name or names as Lender or its loan
servicer, as agent for Lender, shall deem appropriate, including, without
limitation, in the name of Lender or such loan servicer as agent for Lender. In
the case of any Reserve Account which is held in a commingled account, Lender or
its loan servicer, as applicable, shall maintain records sufficient to enable it
to determine at all times which portion of such account is related to the Loan.
The Reserve

                                      -83-
<PAGE>

Accounts are solely for the protection of Lender. With respect to the Reserve
Accounts, Lender shall have no responsibility beyond the allowance of due credit
for the sums actually received by Lender or beyond the reimbursement or payment
of the costs and expenses for which such accounts were established in accordance
with their terms. Upon assignment of the Loan by Lender, any Reserve Funds shall
be turned over to the assignee and any responsibility of Lender as assignor
shall terminate. The requirements of this Agreement concerning Reserve Accounts
in no way supersede, limit or waive any other rights or obligations of the
parties under any of the Loan Documents or under applicable law.

         (h)      Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written
consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the
Reserve Accounts or the Reserve Funds deposited therein or permit any Lien to
attach thereto, except for the security interest granted in this Section 9.9, or
any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC Financing Statements, except those
naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

         (i)      Borrower will maintain the security interest created by this
Section 9.9 as a first priority perfected security interest and will defend the
right, title and interest of Lender in and to the Reserve Accounts and the
Reserve Funds against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. At any
time and from time to time, upon the written request of Lender, and at the sole
expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and duly execute and deliver such
further instruments and documents and will take such further actions as Lender
reasonably may request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                 CASH MANAGEMENT

         SECTION 10.1. LOCKBOX ACCOUNT AND CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT

         (a)      Borrower acknowledges and confirms that Borrower has
established, and Borrower covenants that it shall maintain, (i) pursuant to the
Lockbox Agreement, an Eligible Account into which Borrower shall, and shall
cause Manager to, deposit or cause to be deposited, all Rents and other revenue
from the Property (such account, all funds at any time on deposit therein and
any proceeds, replacements or substitutions of such account or funds therein,
are referred to herein as the "LOCKBOX ACCOUNT"), and (ii) an Eligible Account
with Lender or any Loan servicer, as applicable, into which funds in the Lockbox
Account shall be transferred pursuant to the terms of Section 10.2(b) hereof
(such account, the sub-accounts thereof, all funds at any time on deposit
therein and any proceeds, replacements or substitutions of such account or funds
therein, are referred to herein as the "CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT").

         (b)      The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall each be
in the name of Borrower for the benefit of Lender, as secured party, provided
that Borrower shall be the owner of all funds on deposit in such accounts for
federal and applicable state and local tax purposes. Sums on deposit in the Cash
Management Account shall not be invested except in such Permitted Investments as
determined and directed by Lender and all income earned thereon shall be the
income of Borrower and be applied to and become part of the Cash Management
Account, to be disbursed in accordance with this Article 10. Neither Lockbox
Bank nor Lender

                                      -84-
<PAGE>

shall have any liability for any loss resulting from the investment of funds in
Permitted Investments in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

         (c)      The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall be
subject to the exclusive dominion and control of Lender and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other party
claiming on behalf of, or through, Borrower or Manager, shall have any right of
withdrawal therefrom or any other right or power with respect thereto.

         (d)      Borrower agrees to pay the customary fees and expenses of
Lockbox Bank (incurred in connection with maintaining the Lockbox Account) and
Lender (incurred in connection with maintaining the Cash Management Account) and
any successors thereto in connection therewith, as separately agreed by them
from time to time.

         (e)      Lender shall be responsible for the performance only of such
duties with respect to the Cash Management Account as are specifically set forth
herein, and no duty shall be implied from any provision hereof. Lender shall not
be under any obligation or duty to perform any act which would involve it in
expense or liability or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof, or to
advance any of its own monies. Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender and its
directors, employees, officers and agents harmless from and against any loss,
cost or damage (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by such parties in connection with the Cash Management
Account other than such as result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Lender or intentional nonperformance by Lender of its obligations
under this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.2. DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS

         (a)      Borrower represents, warrants and covenants that:

                  (i)      Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
         Borrower shall notify and advise Manager to deposit directly into the
         Lockbox Account all payments of Rents or any other item payable under
         such Leases pursuant to an instruction letter in the form of Exhibit A
         attached hereto (a "RENT DIRECTION LETTER"). If Borrower fails to
         provide any such notice (and without prejudice to Lender's rights with
         respect to such default), Lender shall have the right, and Borrower
         hereby grants to Lender a power of attorney (which power of attorney
         shall be coupled with an interest and irrevocable so long as any
         portion of the Debt remains outstanding), to sign and deliver a Rent
         Direction Letter;

                  (ii)     Borrower shall, and shall cause Manager to, instruct
         all Persons that maintain open accounts with Borrower or Manager with
         respect to the Property or with whom Borrower or Manager does business
         on an "accounts receivable" basis with respect to the Property to
         deliver all payments due under such accounts to the Lockbox Account.
         Neither Borrower nor Manager shall direct any such Person to make
         payments due under such accounts in any other manner;

                  (iii)    All Rents or other income from the Property shall (A)
         be deemed additional security for payment of the Debt and shall be held
         in trust for the benefit, and as the property, of Lender, (B) not be
         commingled with any other funds or property of

                                      -85-
<PAGE>

         Borrower or Manager, and (C) if received by Borrower notwithstanding
         the delivery of a Rent Direction Letter, be deposited in the Lockbox
         Account within one (1) Business Day of receipt;

                  (iv)     Without the prior written consent of Lender, so long
         as any portion of the Debt remains outstanding, Borrower shall not
         terminate, amend, revoke or modify any Rent Direction Letter in any
         manner whatsoever or direct or cause Manager to pay any amount in any
         manner other than as provided in the Rent Direction Letter; and

                  (v)      So long as any portion of the Debt remains
         outstanding, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other Person shall open
         or maintain any accounts other than the Lockbox Account into which
         revenues from the ownership and operation of the Property are
         deposited. The foregoing shall not prohibit Borrower from utilizing one
         or more separate accounts for the disbursement or retention of funds
         that have been transferred to Borrower pursuant to the express terms of
         this Agreement.

         (b)      Provided no Event of Default has occurred, at all times other
than during a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall, on each Business Day,
withdraw all collected and available funds in excess of $2,500 (funds are not
available if, in the reasonable determination of Lockbox Bank, such funds are
subject to a bank hold or freeze (pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements),
dispute or legal process preventing their withdrawal) held in the Lockbox
Account and disburse such funds to the Borrower Account. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall (and
Lender shall instruct Lockbox Bank to), on each Business Day, withdraw all
collected and available funds (funds are not available if, in the reasonable
determination of Lockbox Bank, such funds are subject to a bank hold or freeze
(pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements), dispute or legal process preventing
their withdrawal) held in the Lockbox Account and transfer by wire transfer or
other method of transfer mutually agreeable to Lockbox Bank and Lender to the
Cash Management Account to be held until disbursed by Lender pursuant to Section
10.2(c). Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the
earlier to occur of (a) payment in full of the Debt or (b) the discontinuation
of a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall no longer transfer funds in the
Lockbox Account to the Cash Management Account in accordance with this
subsection (b) and shall transfer funds (if any) in the Lockbox Account to the
Borrower Account or, upon payment in full of the Debt, as otherwise directed by
Borrower. In the event a Cash Management Period occurs three times during the
term of the Loan and if required by the Lockbox Bank, Borrower shall not be
entitled to any rights to the withdrawal of funds from the Lockbox Account
during the remaining term of the Loan, the Cash Management Period shall
continue, and Lender shall continue to have the right to the withdrawal of funds
from the Lockbox Account until the Debt is paid in full.

         (c)      During a Cash Management Period, on each Scheduled Payment
Date (and if such day is not a Business Day, then the immediately preceding day
which is a Business Day) commencing the month immediately following the month
during which the Cash Management Period commences, Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes Lender to withdraw or allocate to the sub-accounts of the Cash
Management Account, as the case may be, amounts received in the Cash Management
Account, in each case to the extent that sufficient funds remain therefor and
Lender may, at its option, withdraw or allocate such funds as follows:

                                      -86-
<PAGE>

                  (i)      during a Tax and Insurance Reserve Period, funds
         sufficient to pay the monthly deposits to the Tax and Insurance Reserve
         Account shall be allocated to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account to
         be held and disbursed in accordance with Section 9.6;

                  (ii)     funds sufficient to pay the Monthly Payment Amount
         (or an amount up to the entire amount of the Debt upon an acceleration
         of the Loan in accordance with the terms hereof), shall be withdrawn
         and paid to Lender;

                  (iii)    during a Replacement Reserve Period, funds sufficient
         to pay the Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit shall be allocated to
         the Replacement Reserve Account to be held and disbursed in accordance
         with Section 9.5;

                  (iv)     funds sufficient to pay any interest accruing at the
         Default Rate, late payment charges, if any, and any other sums due and
         payable to Lender under any of the Loan Documents, shall be withdrawn
         and paid to Lender and applied against such items;

                  (v)      funds sufficient to pay Lockbox Bank for all costs
         and expenses incurred by Lockbox Bank in connection with the
         maintenance and administration of the Lockbox Account;

                  (vi)     funds sufficient to pay Lender or any Loan servicer,
         as applicable, the customary fees and expenses incurred in connection
         with maintaining the Cash Management Account; and

                  (vii)    funds in an amount equal to the balance (if any)
         remaining on deposit in the Cash Management Account after the foregoing
         withdrawals and allocations shall be deposited in the Excess Cash
         Reserve Account to be held and disbursed in accordance with Section
         9.7. Upon the discontinuance of a Cash Management Period, funds (if
         any) on deposit in the Excess Cash Reserve Account shall be transferred
         to Borrower's Account.

         (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Borrower
acknowledges that Borrower is responsible for monitoring the sufficiency of
funds deposited in the Cash Management Account and that Borrower is liable for
any deficiency in available funds, irrespective of whether Borrower has received
any account statement, notice or demand from Lender or Lender's servicer. If the
amount on deposit in the Cash Management Account is insufficient to make all of
the withdrawals and allocations described in Section 10.2(c)(i) through (vi)
above, Borrower shall deposit such deficiency into the Cash Management Account
within five (5) days (provided that such five day period shall not constitute a
grace period for any default or Event of Default under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document based on a failure to satisfy any monetary obligation
provided in any Loan Document).

         (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower hereby
irrevocably authorizes Lender to make any and all withdrawals from the Lockbox
Account and Cash Management Account and transfers between any of the Reserve
Accounts as Lender shall determine in Lender's sole and absolute discretion and
Lender may use all funds contained in any such accounts for any purpose,
including but not limited to repayment of the Debt in such order, proportion and
priority

                                      -87-
<PAGE>

as Lender may determine in its sole and absolute discretion. Lender's right to
withdraw and apply funds as stated herein shall be in addition to all other
rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement, the Note, the
Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 10.3. SECURITY INTEREST

         (a)      To secure the full and punctual payment of the Debt and
performance of all obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a
first-priority perfected security interest in the Lockbox Account and Cash
Management Account, all interest, cash, checks, drafts, certificates and
instruments, if any, from time to time deposited or held therein, any and all
amounts invested in Permitted Investments, and all "proceeds" (as defined in the
UCC as in effect in the state in which the Lockbox Account and Cash Management
Account are located or maintained) of any or all of the foregoing. Furthermore,
Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender,
further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any of the foregoing or
permit any Lien to attach thereto or any levy to be made thereon or any UCC
Financing Statements to be filed with respect thereto. Borrower will maintain
the security interest created by this Section 10.3(a) as a first priority
perfected security interest and will defend the right, title and interest of
Lender in and to the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account against the
claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever.

         (b)      Borrower authorizes Lender to file any financing statement or
statements required by Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection
and priority of the security interest granted herein in connection with the
Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account. Borrower agrees that at any time
and from time to time, at the expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and
duly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all
further action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that Lender may
reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any security interest
granted or purported to be granted hereby (including, without limitation, any
security interest in and to any Permitted Investments) or to enable Lender to
exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder.

         (c)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured
party, pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Lockbox Account and Cash
Management Account. Without limitation of the foregoing, upon any Event of
Default, Lender may use the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account for any
of the following purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited
to, principal prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or
partial prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses,
fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other
Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item as required or permitted under this
Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted by applicable law; provided,
however, that any such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure
any Event of Default. Without limiting any other provisions hereof, each of the
remedial actions described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed
to be a commercially reasonable exercise of Lender's rights and remedies as a
secured party with respect to the Lockbox Account and Cash Management

                                      -88-

Account and shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a
foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Lockbox Account or Cash
Management Account to effect a cure of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt,
or in any specific order of priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's
rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan
Documents shall not in any way prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate
and complete a foreclosure under the Mortgage.

         SECTION 10.4. DEFINITIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, For purposes of this Article 10 only, Business Day shall mean

foregoing being referred to as the "PROVIDED INFORMATION");

         (b)      make changes to the organizational documents of Borrower, any
SPE Component Entity and their respective principals;

         (c)      at Borrower's expense, cause counsel to render or update
existing opinion letters as to enforceability and non-consolidation, which may
be relied upon by the holder of the Note, the Rating Agencies and their
respective counsel, which shall be dated as of the closing date of the
Securitization;

         (d)      at Lender's sole cost and expense, permit site inspections in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, appraisals, market studies and
other due diligence investigations of the Property, as may be reasonably
requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or as may be
necessary or appropriate in connection with the Securitization;

         (e)      intentionally deleted;

         (f)      execute such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be
requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or otherwise to
effect the Securitization including, without limitation, bifurcation of the Loan
into two or more components and/or separate notes and/or creating a
senior/subordinate note structure; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be
required to modify or amend any Loan Document if such modification or amendment
would (i) change the interest rate, the stated maturity or the amortization of
principal set forth in the Note, except in connection with a bifurcation of the
Loan which may result in varying fixed interest rates and amortization
schedules, but which shall have the same initial weighted average coupon of the
original Note, or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of Borrower, modify or amend
any other material economic term of the Loan, or (iii) in the reasonable
judgment of Borrower, materially increase Borrower's obligations and liabilities
under the Loan Documents;

         (g)      deliver to Lender and/or any Rating Agency one or more
certificates executed by an officer of Borrower certifying as to the accuracy,
as of the closing date of the Securitization, of all representations made by
Borrower in the Loan Documents as of the Closing Date or, if such
representations are no longer accurate, certifying as to what modifications to
the representations would be required to make such representations accurate as
of the closing date of the Securitization;

         (h)      have reasonably appropriate personnel participate in a bank
meeting and/or presentation for the Rating Agencies or Investors;

         (i)      cooperate with and assist Lender in obtaining ratings of the

         (j)      if required by any Rating Agency, deliver, at Borrower's sole
cost and expense and within fifteen (15) Business Days of Lender's request
therefore, (1) opinions relating to certain aspects of federal and Delaware law

                                      -97-
<PAGE>

be given by a law firm acceptable to such Rating Agency and shall otherwise be
in form and substance acceptable to such Rating Agency. Lender hereby
acknowledges that Borrower may deliver such opinions in one consolidated opinion
that, together with the Loan, addresses other Loans (made by Lender) relating to
Affiliates of Borrower, provided that such opinion adequately identifies
Borrower, the Property and other applicable matters relating to the Loan. In
addition, Borrower shall make any changes to its organizational documents to the
extent required in connection with the issuance of such opinions, provided that
such changes shall not result in an adverse economic effect to Borrower.

         All reasonable third party costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in
connection with Borrower's complying with requests made under this Section 13.4
shall be paid by Borrower. Lender shall be responsible for all of its
out-of-pocket costs in connection with a securitization.

         In the event that Borrower requests any consent or approval hereunder
and the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Documents require the receipt
of written confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to the rating on
the Securities, or, in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents
relating to a Securitization, such a rating confirmation is required in order
for the consent of Lender to be given, Borrower shall pay all of the costs and
expenses of Lender, Lender's servicer and each Rating Agency in connection
therewith, and, if applicable, shall pay any fees imposed by any Rating Agency
as a condition to the delivery of such confirmation. Lender agrees, upon
request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower and
to facilitate Borrower's efforts to obtain any such rating confirmation as
required hereunder, which cooperation shall include supplying the Rating
Agencies with copies of reports, documents and other information and materials
provided to Lender by Borrower, provided however, that in no event shall (1)
Lender be required to incur any costs or expenses (other than de minimus costs
or expenses) in connection with such cooperation or (2) Lender's agreement
hereunder to cooperate with Borrower in obtaining a rating confirmation obligate
Lender to institute (or threaten to institute) or participate in (or threaten to
participate in) any litigation, suits, or proceedings at law or in equity
against any Rating Agency in connection with Borrower's efforts to obtain such
rating confirmation.

         SECTION 13.5. SECURITIZATION INDEMNIFICATION

         (a)      Borrower understands that certain of the Provided Information
may be included in disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization,
including, without limitation, a prospectus, prospectus supplement, offering
memorandum or private placement memorandum (each, a "DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT") and
may also be included in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or provided or made
available to investors or prospective investors in the Securities, the Rating
Agencies, and service providers relating to the Securitization. In the event
that the Disclosure Document is required to be revised prior to the sale of all
Securities, Borrower will cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the
Disclosure Document by providing all current information required to be
delivered by Borrower under Article 5 hereof necessary to keep the Disclosure
Document accurate and complete in all material respects.

         (b)      Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each of (i) a
preliminary and a final offering memorandum or private placement memorandum or
similar document (including

                                      -98-
<PAGE>

any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Property and/or the Loan) or (ii) a preliminary and final prospectus or
prospectus supplement, as applicable, an indemnification certificate (A)
indemnifying Lender (and for purposes of this Section 13.5, Lender hereunder
shall include its officers and directors) and the Affiliate of Lender that (i)
has filed the registration statement, if any, relating to the Securitization
and/or (ii) which is acting as issuer, depositor, sponsor and/or a similar
capacity with respect to the Securitization (any Person described in (i) or
(ii), an "ISSUER PERSON") and each director and officer of any Issuer Person,
and each Person or entity who controls any Issuer Person within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "ISSUER GROUP") for any Losses to which Lender or the Issuer
Group may become subject insofar as the Losses arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained
in such sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or
presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated in such sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency
"term sheets" or presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or
necessary in order to make the statements in such sections (including any
Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Property and/or the Loan) or in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading (collectively the "SECURITIES LIABILITIES") and (B)
agreeing to reimburse Lender and the Issuer Group for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by Lender and Issuer Group in connection with
investigating or defending the Securities Liabilities; provided, however, that
Borrower will be liable in any such case under clauses (A) or (B) above only to
the extent that any such Securities Liabilities arise out of or is based upon
any such untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished to Lender or any member of the Issuer
Group by or on behalf of Borrower in connection with the Provided Information.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Borrower may
otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification provided for in Clauses (A) and
(B) above shall be effective in the event an indemnification certificate
certifying that Borrower has carefully examined any preliminary or a final
offering memorandum described above or prospectus or other document (including
any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Property and/or the Loan), as applicable, including without limitation, the
sections entitled "Special Considerations," and/or "Risk Factors," and "Certain
Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loan," or similar sections, and all sections
relating to Borrower, Borrower Principal, Manager, their Affiliates, the Loan,
the Loan Documents and the Property, and any risks or special considerations
relating thereto, and that, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, such sections
(and any other sections reasonably requested) do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading has been requested by Lender and has not been provided
by Borrower and shall be applicable based on information previously provided by
Borrower or its Affiliates if Borrower does not provide such requested
indemnification certificate.

         (c)      In connection with filings under the Exchange Act or any
information provided to holders of Securities on an ongoing basis, Borrower
agrees to indemnify (i) Lender and the Issuer Group for Losses to which Lender
or the Issuer Group may become subject insofar as the Securities Liabilities
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in the
Provided Information a material fact required to be stated in the Provided
Information in

                                      -99-
<PAGE>

order to make the statements in the Provided Information, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made not misleading and (ii) reimburse
Lender or the Issuer Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by Lender or the Issuer Group in connection with defending or investigating the
Securities Liabilities.

         (d)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 13.5 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 13.5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying
party may have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that
any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be
entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and,
to the extent that it (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the
indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party
to such indemnified party under this Section 13.5 the indemnifying party shall
be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
behalf of such indemnified party or parties. The indemnifying party shall not be
liable for the expenses of more than one such separate counsel unless an
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those
available to another indemnified party.

         (e)      In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 13.5(c)
or Section 13.5(d) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be
indemnifiable under Section 13.5(c) or Section 13.5(d), the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which
the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered:
(i) the indemnified party's and Borrower's relative knowledge and access to
information concerning the matter with respect to which claim was asserted; (ii)
the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii) any
other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Lender and
Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation.

                                     -100-

         (f)      The liabilities and obligations of Borrower, and Lender under
this Section 13.5 shall survive the satisfaction of this Agreement and the
satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

                                INDEMNIFICATIONS

         SECTION 14.1. GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out
of or in any way relating to any one or more of the following: (a) any accident,
injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on
or about the Property or any part thereof or on the adjoining sidewalks, curbs,
adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets or ways; (b) any use,
nonuse or condition in, on or about the Property or any part thereof or on the
adjoining sidewalks, curbs, adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets
or ways; (c) performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
materials or other property in respect of the Property or any part thereof; (d)
any failure of the Property to be in compliance with any Applicable Legal
Requirements; (e) any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be
asserted against Lender by reason of any alleged obligations or undertakings on
its part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants, or agreements
contained in any Lease; (f) the holding or investing of the Reserve Accounts or
the performance of the Required Work, or Additional Replacements, or (g) the
payment of any commission, charge or brokerage fee to anyone which may be
payable in connection with the funding of the Loan (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, however, that Borrower shall not have any
obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities
arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of
Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it
violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum portion that
it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Lender.

         SECTION 14.2. MORTGAGE AND INTANGIBLE TAX INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way
relating to any tax on the making and/or recording of the Mortgage, the Note or
any of the other Loan Documents, but excluding any income, franchise or other
similar taxes.

         SECTION 14.3. ERISA INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of Losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA

                                     -101-
<PAGE>

that may be required, in Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur,
directly or indirectly, as a result of a default under Section 4.8 or Section
5.18 of this Agreement.

         SECTION 14.4. SURVIVAL

         The obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Article 14 shall
fully survive indefinitely notwithstanding any termination, satisfaction,
assignment, entry of a judgment of foreclosure, exercise of any power of sale,
or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage.

                                   ARTICLE 15
                                   EXCULPATION

         SECTION 15.1. EXCULPATION

         (a)      Except as otherwise provided herein or in the other Loan
Documents, Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower or
Borrower Principal, as applicable, to perform and observe the obligations
contained herein or in the other Loan Documents by any action or proceeding
wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower or Borrower Principal,
except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, action for specific
performance or other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to
enforce and realize upon this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents, and the interest in the Property, the Rents and any other
collateral given to Lender created by this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that any judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower only to the extent of
Borrower's interest in the Property, in the Rents and in any other collateral
given to Lender. Lender, by accepting this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents, agrees that it shall not, except as otherwise provided
in this Section 15.1, sue for, seek or demand any deficiency judgment against
Borrower or Borrower Principal in any such action or proceeding, under or by
reason of or under or in connection with this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage
or the other Loan Documents. The provisions of this Section 15.1 shall not,
however, (i) constitute a waiver, release or impairment of any obligation
evidenced or secured by this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan
Documents; (ii) impair the right of Lender to name Borrower or Borrower
Principal as a party defendant in any action or suit for judicial foreclosure
and sale under this Agreement and the Mortgage; (iii) affect the validity or
enforceability of any indemnity (including, without limitation, those contained
in Section 12.6, with respect to Borrower or Borrower Principal, Section 13.5,
with respect to Borrower, and Article 14 of this Agreement, with respect to
Borrower), guaranty, master lease or similar instrument made in connection with
this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents; (iv) impair
the right of Lender to obtain the appointment of a receiver; (v) impair the
enforcement of the assignment of leases provisions contained in the Mortgage; or
(vi) impair the right of Lender to obtain a deficiency judgment or other
judgment on the Note against Borrower or Borrower Principal if necessary to
obtain any Insurance Proceeds or Awards to which Lender would otherwise be
entitled under this Agreement; provided however, Lender shall only enforce such
judgment to the extent of the Insurance Proceeds and/or Awards.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 15.1 to the
contrary:

                                     -102-
<PAGE>

                  (1)      Borrower and Borrower Principal shall be personally
liable to Lender on a joint and several basis for Losses due to:

                  (i)      fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower,
         Borrower Principal or any other Affiliate of Borrower or Borrower
         Principal in connection with the execution and the delivery of this
         Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage, any of the other Loan Documents, or
         any certificate, report, financial statement or other instrument or
         document furnished to Lender at the time of the closing of the Loan or
         during the term of the Loan;

                  (ii)     Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of
         Rents received by Borrower after the occurrence and during the
         continuance of an Event of Default;

                  (iii)    Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of
         tenant security deposits or Rents collected in advance and which have
         not been applied to the operation of the Property;

                  (iv)     the misapplication or the misappropriation of
         Insurance Proceeds or Awards;

                  (v)      Borrower's failure to pay Taxes, Other Charges
         (except to the extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have
         been deposited in escrow with Lender pursuant to the terms hereof and
         there exists no impediment to Lender's utilization thereof) beyond any
         applicable notice and cure periods specified therein;

                  (vi)     any act of actual intentional physical waste or arson
         by Borrower, any principal, Affiliate, member or general partner
         thereof or by Borrower Principal, any principal, Affiliate, member or
         general partner thereof; or

                  (vii)    the portion of any Rent paid by any Tenant more than
         thirty (30) days in advance that would have been payable by such Tenant
         from and after the occurrence of an Event of Default; and

                  (2)      Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to
Lender for Losses due to the Property, or any part thereof, becoming an asset in
(A) a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower or Borrower
Principal, or (B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower
or Borrower Principal in connection with which Borrower, Borrower Principal, SPE
Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing has or have solicited,
procured, or supported in any way with the creditors commencing or filing such
proceeding. Additionally, Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to
Lender for Losses in the event of a breach by Borrower or SPE Component Entity
of any of the covenants set forth in Article 6, except to the extent that such
breach was inadvertent, immaterial and is promptly cured in accordance with
Section 11.1(d).

         (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to
pursue recourse liability as set forth in subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL
AND VOID and shall be of no further force and effect and the Debt shall become
fully recourse (1) to Borrower and Borrower Principal, jointly and severally, in
the event of a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Article 7 hereof and
(2) to Borrower in the event (i) of a breach by Borrower or SPE

Component Entity of any of the covenants set forth in Article 6, except the
extent that such breach was inadvertent, immaterial and is promptly cured in
accordance with Section 11.1(d) hereof or (ii) the Property or any part thereof
shall become an asset in (A) a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of
Borrower or Borrower Principal, or (B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency
proceeding of Borrower or Borrower Principal in connection with which Borrower,
Borrower Principal, SPE Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of the
foregoing has or have solicited, procured, or supported in any way with the
creditors commencing or filing such proceeding.

         (d)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right
which Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other
provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of the
indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or to require that all collateral shall
continue to secure all of the indebtedness owing to Lender in accordance with
this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents.

         Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of Lender as to the loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation of the Note or any other Loan Document which is
not of public record, and, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender
and cancellation of such Note or other Loan Document, Borrower will issue, in
lieu thereof, a replacement Note or other Loan Document, dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or other Loan Document in the same
principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.

         SECTION 17.2. RECORDING OF MORTGAGE, ETC.

         Borrower forthwith upon the execution and delivery of the Mortgage and
thereafter, from time to time, will cause the Mortgage and any of the other Loan
Documents creating a lien or security interest or evidencing the lien hereof
upon the Property and each instrument of further assurance to be filed,
registered or recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by
any present or future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect and
perfect the lien or security interest hereof upon, and the interest of Lender
in, the Property. Borrower will pay all taxes, filing, registration or recording
fees, and all expenses incident to the preparation, execution, acknowledgment
and/or recording of the Note, the Mortgage, the other Loan Documents, any note,
deed of trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with
respect to the Property and any instrument of further assurance, and any

trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with respect to
the Property or any instrument of further assurance, and any modification or
amendment of the foregoing documents, except where prohibited by law so to do.

         SECTION 17.3. FURTHER ACTS, ETC.

         Borrower will, at the cost of Borrower, and without expense to Lender,
do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every further acts, deeds,

conveying, assigning, transferring, and confirming unto Lender the property and
rights hereby mortgaged, deeded, granted, bargained, sold, conveyed, confirmed,
pledged, assigned, warranted and transferred or intended now or hereafter so to
be, or which Borrower may be or

                                     -105-
<PAGE>

may hereafter become bound to convey or assign to Lender, or for carrying out
the intention or facilitating the performance of the terms of this Agreement or

execute in the name of Borrower or without the signature of Borrower to the
extent Lender may lawfully do so, one or more financing statements and financing
statement amendments to evidence more effectively, perfect and maintain the
priority of the security interest of Lender in the Property. Borrower grants to
Lender an irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest for the purpose
of exercising and perfecting any and all rights and remedies available to Lender
at law and in equity, including without limitation, such rights and remedies
available to Lender pursuant to this Section 17.3.

         SECTION 17.4. CHANGES IN TAX, DEBT, CREDIT AND DOCUMENTARY STAMP LAWS

         (a)      If any law is enacted or adopted or amended after the date of
this Agreement which deducts the Debt from the value of the Property for the
purpose of taxation or which imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly, on
the Debt or Lender's interest in the Property, Borrower will pay the tax, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any. If Lender is advised by counsel chosen
by it that the payment of tax by Borrower would be unlawful or taxable to Lender
or unenforceable or provide the basis for a defense of usury then Lender shall
have the option by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days
to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without any prepayment premium.

         (b)      Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit
or credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Taxes or Other Charges
assessed against the Property, or any part thereof, and no deduction shall
otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of the Property, or any
part thereof, for real estate tax purposes by reason of the Mortgage or the
Debt. If such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by law, Lender shall
have the option, by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120)
days, to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without any prepayment
premium.

         If at any time the United States of America, any State thereof or any
subdivision of any such State shall require revenue or other stamps to be
affixed to the Note, the Mortgage, or any of the other Loan Documents or impose
any other tax or charge on the same, Borrower will pay for the same, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any.

         SECTION 17.5. EXPENSES

         Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to
reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable, actual attorneys' fees and

Documents with respect to the Property); (b) Borrower's ongoing performance of
and compliance with Borrower's respective

                                     -106-
<PAGE>

agreements and covenants contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date,
including, without limitation, confirming compliance with environmental and
insurance requirements; (c) following a request by Borrower, Lender's ongoing
performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or complied
with after the Closing Date; (d) the negotiation, preparation, execution,
delivery and administration of any consents, amendments, waivers or other
modifications to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other
documents or matters requested by Lender; (e) securing Borrower's compliance
with any requests made pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement; (f) the

preserving any rights, in response to third party claims or the prosecuting or

under or affecting Borrower, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
Property, or any other security given for the Loan; and (h) enforcing any
obligations of or collecting any payments due from Borrower under this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect to the Property or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the credit arrangements
provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out" or of any insolvency
or bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be liable
for the payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent the same arise by
reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of
Lender.

                                     WAIVERS

         SECTION 18.1. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS

         The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's
rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's
sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power
accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power
or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power
may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A
waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be
construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by
Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

         SECTION 18.2. MODIFICATION, WAIVER IN WRITING

         No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement, or of the Note, or of any other Loan
Document, nor consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which given.

                                     -107-
<PAGE>

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand on
Borrower, shall entitle Borrower to any other or future notice or demand in the
same, similar or other circumstances.

         SECTION 18.3. DELAY NOT A WAIVER

         Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender in insisting
upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement, or
exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note or
under any other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security
therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of
any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under
this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed
to have waived any right either to require prompt payment when due of all other
amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents, or to
declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of any such other amount.

         SECTION 18.4. TRIAL BY JURY

         BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES NOT TO ELECT
A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER
ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS
GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER, AND
IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. EACH OF LENDER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND BORROWER IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN
ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND LENDER.

         SECTION 18.5. WAIVER OF NOTICE

         Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

         SECTION 18.6. REMEDIES OF BORROWER

         In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment. Lender
agrees that, in such event, it shall cooperate in expediting any action seeking
injunctive relief or declaratory judgment.

         SECTION 18.7. WAIVER OF MARSHALLING OF ASSETS

         To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Property, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the
marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters
whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan
Documents to a sale of the Property for the collection of the Debt without any
prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in preference to
every other claimant whatsoever.

         SECTION 18.8. WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

         Borrower hereby expressly waives and releases, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the pleading of any statute of limitations as a defense to
payment of the Debt or performance of its Other Obligations.

         SECTION 18.9. WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM

         Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

                                   ARTICLE 19
                                  GOVERNING LAW

         SECTION 19.1. CHOICE OF LAW

         This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract entered into pursuant
to the laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed,
construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, provided however, (a) that with respect to the creation, perfection,
priority and enforcement of any Lien created by the Loan Documents, and the
determination of deficiency judgments, the laws of the state where the Property
is located shall apply, and (b) with respect to the security interest in each of
the Reserve Accounts and the Lockbox Account, the laws of the state where each
such account is located shall apply.

         SECTION 19.2. SEVERABILITY

         Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 19.3. PREFERENCES

         Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or
reverse and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to any portion of the
obligations of Borrower hereunder. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or
payments to Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
Creditors Rights Laws, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause,
then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations
hereunder or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue
in full force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received
by Lender.

promises and agreements in this Agreement, by or on behalf of Borrower, shall
inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of
Lender.

         SECTION 20.2. LENDER'S DISCRETION

of this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

         SECTION 20.6. OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES

         Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note

         SECTION 20.7. NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES

         (a)      Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and
lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture,
partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower
and Lender nor to grant Lender any interest in the Property other than that of
mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

         (b)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and
Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the
obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of
strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

         (c)      The general partners, members, principals and (if Borrower is
a trust) beneficial owners of Borrower are experienced in the ownership and
operation of properties similar to the

                                     -111-
<PAGE>

Property, and Borrower and Lender are relying solely upon such expertise and
business plan in connection with the ownership and operation of the Property.
Borrower is not relying on Lender's expertise, business acumen or advice in
connection with the Property.

         (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Lender is not undertaking the performance of (i) any obligations under the
Leases; or (ii) any obligations with respect to such agreements, contracts,
certificates, instruments, franchises, permits, trademarks, licenses and other
documents.

         (e)      By accepting or approving anything required to be observed,
performed or fulfilled or to be given to Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the
Mortgage, the Note or the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation,
any officer's certificate, balance sheet, statement of profit and loss or other
financial statement, survey, appraisal, or insurance policy, Lender shall not be
deemed to have warranted, consented to, or affirmed the sufficiency, the
legality or effectiveness of same, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall
not constitute any warranty or affirmation with respect thereto by Lender.

         (f)      Borrower recognizes and acknowledges that in accepting this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, Lender is
expressly and primarily relying on the truth and accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement without any obligation
to investigate the Property and notwithstanding any investigation of the
Property by Lender; that such reliance existed on the part of Lender prior to
the date hereof, that the warranties and representations are a material
inducement to Lender in making the Loan; and that Lender would not be willing to
make the Loan and accept this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents in the absence of the warranties and representations as set forth
in Article 4 of this Agreement.

         SECTION 20.8. PUBLICITY

         All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan, Lender, Banc of America Securities LLC, or any of their Affiliates
shall be subject to the prior written approval of Lender, not to be unreasonably
withheld, provided however, that Lender's consent shall not be required in
connection with any such news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or
its Affiliates to the extent Borrower or its Affiliates are required to make
such news releases pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements. Lender shall be
permitted to make any news, releases, publicity or advertising by Lender or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan, the Property, Borrower, Borrower Principal and their respective
Affiliates without the approval of Borrower or any such Persons. Borrower also
agrees that Lender may share any information pertaining to the Loan with Bank of
America Corporation, including its bank subsidiaries, Banc of America Securities
LLC and any other Affiliates of the foregoing, in connection with the sale or
transfer of the Loan or any Participations and/or Securities created. In the
event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this Section 20.8 and

         SECTION 20.9. CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE

         In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent
counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan
Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of
construing their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower
acknowledges that, with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its
own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any
manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it
under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which
govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or
Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower,
and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take
any action on the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of
any such rights or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the
business of real estate financings and other real estate transactions and
investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business
of Borrower or its Affiliates.

         SECTION 20.10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

         This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such
parties, whether oral or written between Borrower and Lender are superseded by
the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 20.11. TAX DISCLOSURE

         Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as reasonably
necessary to comply with applicable securities laws, each party (and each
employee, representative or other agent of each party) hereto may disclose to
any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, any information with
respect to the United States federal income "tax treatment" and "tax structure"
(in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of
the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such parties (or their
representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that

information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as
well as other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of
the document or similar item that relate to the United States federal income tax
treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby.

agreement and will survive any earlier termination of this letter agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, BAS and the Company
shall be permitted to disclose the tax treatment and tax structure of any

                                  GENERAL TERMS

         SECTION 2.1. LOAN COMMITMENT; DISBURSEMENT TO BORROWER

         (a)      Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein,
Lender hereby agrees to make and Borrower hereby agrees to accept the Loan on
the Closing Date.

         (b)      Borrower may request and receive only one borrowing in respect
of the Loan and any amount borrowed and repaid in respect of the Loan may not be
reborrowed.

         (c)      The Loan shall be evidenced by the Note and secured by the
Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.

         (d)      Borrower shall use the proceeds of the Loan to (i) pay certain
costs in connection with the financing of the Property, (ii) make deposits into
the Reserve Funds on the Closing Date in the amounts provided herein, (iii) pay
costs and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the Loan, as
approved by Lender, (iv) fund any working capital requirements of the Property,
and (v) distribute the balance, if any, to its partners or members, as
applicable.

         SECTION 2.2. LOAN PAYMENTS

         (a)      The Loan shall bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal
to the Note Rate. Interest shall be computed based on the daily rate produced
assuming a three hundred sixty (360) day year, multiplied by the actual number
of days elapsed. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, interest shall
be paid in arrears.

         (b)      Borrower hereby agrees to pay sums due under the Note as
follows: An initial payment of is due on the Closing Date for interest from the
Closing Date through and including October 31, 2003. Thereafter, except as may
be adjusted in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.2(c), (1)
consecutive monthly installments of interest only in an amount calculated in
accordance with Section 2.2(a) above (such amount, the "I/O Monthly Payment
Amount") shall be payable on the first day of each month beginning December 1,
2003 (each such date through and including the Maturity Date, a "Scheduled
Payment Date") through and including the Scheduled Payment Date occurring in
November, 2006 and (2) thereafter, consecutive monthly installments of principal
and interest in an amount equal to the sum set forth on Schedule 1, attached
hereto, shall be payable pursuant to the terms of Section 2.2(d) (the "Constant
Monthly Payment Amount"; the I/O Monthly Payment Amount and the Constant Monthly
Payment Amount shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the "Monthly
Payment Amount") on each Scheduled Payment Date until the entire indebtedness
evidenced hereby is fully paid, except that any remaining indebtedness, if not
sooner paid, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

         (c)      The Constant Monthly Payment Amount shall mean the amount of
interest and principal which would be due in order to fully amortize the
principal amount of the Loan over an amortization term of thirty (30) years
assuming an annual interest rate equal to the Note Rate, computed on the basis
of a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months of
thirty (30) days each. Borrower expressly understands and agrees that such
computation of interest based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting
of twelve (12) months of thirty

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

(30) days each is solely for the purpose of determining the Monthly Payment
Amount, and, notwithstanding such computation, interest shall accrue on the
outstanding principal amount of the Loan as provided in Section 2.2(a) above.
Borrower understands and acknowledges that such interest accrual requirement
results in more interest accruing on the Loan than if either a thirty (30) day
month and a three hundred sixty (360) day year or the actual number of days and
a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year were used to compute the accrual of
interest on the Loan. Borrower recognizes that such interest accrual requirement
will not fully amortize the Loan within the amortization period set forth above.
Following any partial prepayment occurring solely as a result of the application
of Insurance Proceeds or Awards pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Lender
may, in its sole and absolute discretion, adjust the Monthly Payment Amount to
give effect to any such partial prepayment, provided, however, that in no event
will any such adjustment result in any such installment becoming due and payable
on any date after the Maturity Date.

         (d)      Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be
payable at the payment address set forth on Schedule 1, attached hereto, or at
such other place as the Lender may designate from time to time in writing, on
the date such payment is due, to Lender by deposit to such account as Lender may
designate by written notice to Borrower. Whenever any payment hereunder or under
the Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the first Business Day preceding such scheduled due
date.

         (e)      Prior to the occurrence and following the cure (in accordance
with the terms hereof) of an Event of Default, all monthly payments made as
scheduled under this Agreement and the Note shall be applied first to the
payment of interest computed at the Note Rate, and the balance toward the
reduction of the principal amount of the Note. All voluntary and involuntary
prepayments on the Note shall be applied, to the extent thereof, to accrued but
unpaid interest on the amount prepaid, to the remaining principal amount, and
any other sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan, in such
manner and order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion,
including, but not limited to, application to principal installments in inverse
order of maturity. Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, any payment made on the Note shall be applied to accrued but
unpaid interest, late charges, accrued fees, the unpaid principal amount of the
Note, and any other sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan,
in such manner and order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute
discretion.

         (f)      All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under the Note or
the other Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without any
deduction for, any setoff, defense or counterclaims.

         SECTION 2.3. LATE PAYMENT CHARGE

         If any principal or interest payment is not paid by Borrower on or
before the date which is ten (10) calendar days after the same is due, Borrower
shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of four percent
(4%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law in
order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such
delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable law.

         SECTION 2.4. PREPAYMENT; DEFEASANCE

         Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 2.4, no
voluntary prepayments, whether in whole or in part, of the Loan or any other
amount at any time due and owing under the Note can be made by Borrower or any
other Person without the express written consent of Lender.

         (a)      Lockout Period. Borrower has no right to make, and Lender
shall have no obligation to accept, any voluntary prepayment, whether in whole
or in part, of the Loan during the Lockout Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if either (i) Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, accepts a
full or partial voluntary prepayment during the Lockout Period or (ii) there is
an involuntary prepayment during the Lockout Period, then, in either case,
Borrower shall, in addition to any portion of the Loan prepaid (together with
all interest accrued and unpaid thereon), pay to Lender a prepayment premium in
an amount calculated in accordance with Section 2.4(d) hereof.

         (b)      Total Defeasance.

                  (i)      Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 2.4 to
         the contrary, including, without limitation, subsection (a) of this
         Section 2.4, at any time after the earlier to occur of the (1)
         expiration of the REMIC Prohibition Period or (2) expiration of the
         Substitution/Defeasance Lockout Period, Borrower may cause the release
         of the Property from the lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan
         Documents upon the satisfaction of the following conditions:

                           (A)      no Event of Default shall exist under any of
                  the Loan Documents;

                           (B)      not less than thirty (30) (but not more than
                  ninety (90)) days prior written notice shall be given to
                  Lender specifying a date on which the Defeasance Collateral
                  (as hereinafter defined) is to be delivered (the "RELEASE
                  DATE"), such date being on a Scheduled Payment Date; provided,
                  however, that Borrower shall have the right (i) to cancel such
                  notice by providing Lender with notice of cancellation ten
                  (10) days prior to the scheduled Release Date, or (ii) to
                  extend the scheduled Release Date until the next Scheduled
                  Payment Date; provided that in each case, Borrower shall pay
                  all of Lender's reasonable costs and expenses incurred as a
                  result of such cancellation or extension;

                           (C)      all accrued and unpaid interest and all
                  other sums due under the Note, this Agreement and under the
                  other Loan Documents up to the Release Date, including,
                  without limitation, all reasonable fees, costs and expenses
                  incurred by Lender and its agents in connection with such
                  release (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees
                  and expenses for the review and preparation of the Defeasance
                  Security Agreement (as hereinafter defined) and of the other
                  materials described in Section 2.4(b)(i)(D) below and any
                  related

                                       -18
<PAGE>

                  documentation, and any servicing fees, Rating Agency fees or
                  other costs related to such release), shall be paid in full on
                  or prior to the Release Date;

                           (D)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender on or prior
                  to the Release Date:

                  (1)      a pledge and security agreement, in form and
substance which would be satisfactory to a prudent institutional mortgage loan
lender, creating a first priority security interest in favor of Lender in the
Defeasance Collateral, as defined herein (the "DEFEASANCE SECURITY AGREEMENT"),
which shall provide, among other things, that any excess amounts received by
Lender from the Defeasance Collateral over the amounts payable by Borrower on a
given Scheduled Payment Date, which excess amounts are not required to cover all
or any portion of amounts payable on a future Scheduled Payment Date, shall be
refunded to Borrower promptly after each such Scheduled Payment Date;

                  (2)      direct non-callable obligations of the United States
of America (or other obligations which are "government securities" within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent
the applicable Rating Agencies rating the Securities have confirmed in writing
will not cause a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if
higher, then applicable ratings of the Securities), that provide for payments
prior and as close as possible to (but in no event later than) all successive
Scheduled Payment Dates occurring after the Release Date, with each such payment
being equal to or greater than the amount of the corresponding Monthly Payment
Amount required to be paid under this Agreement and the Note (including all
amounts due on the Maturity Date) for the balance of the term hereof (the
"DEFEASANCE COLLATERAL"), each of which shall be duly endorsed by the holder
thereof as directed by Lender or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form and substance which would be satisfactory to a prudent lender
(including, without limitation, such certificates, documents and instruments as
may be required by the depository institution holding such securities or the
issuer thereof, as the case may be, to effectuate book-entry transfers and
pledges through the book-entry facilities of such institution) in order to
perfect upon the delivery of the Defeasance Security Agreement the first
priority security interest therein in favor of Lender in conformity with all
applicable state and federal laws governing granting of such security interests;

                  (3)      a certificate of Borrower certifying that all of the
requirements set forth in this Section 2.4(b)(i) have been satisfied;

                  (4)      one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower in form
and substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a prudent
lender stating, among other things, that (i) Lender has a perfected first
priority security interest in the Defeasance Collateral and that the Defeasance
Security Agreement is enforceable against Borrower in accordance with its terms,
(ii) the release of the lien of the Mortgage and the pledge of Defeasance
Collateral will not directly or indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust
that then holds the Note to fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and
(iii) the defeasance will not cause any REMIC Trust to be an "investment
company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, at Borrower's cost;

                  (5)      a certificate in form and scope which would be
acceptable to a prudent lender from an Acceptable Accountant certifying that the
Defeasance Collateral will generate

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

amounts sufficient to make all payments of principal and interest due under the
Note (including the scheduled outstanding principal balance of the Loan due on
the Maturity Date); and

                  (6)      such other certificates, documents and instruments as
a prudent institutional lender would require; and

                           (E)      in the event the Loan is held by a REMIC
                  Trust, Lender has received written confirmation from any
                  Rating Agency rating any Securities that substitution of the
                  Defeasance Collateral will not result in a downgrade,
                  withdrawal, or qualification of the ratings then assigned to
                  any of the Securities.

                  (ii)     Upon compliance with the requirements of Section
         2.4(b)(i), the Property shall be released from the lien of the Mortgage
         and the other Loan Documents, and the Defeasance Collateral shall
         constitute collateral which shall secure the Note and all other
         obligations under the Loan Documents. Lender will, at Borrower's
         expense, execute and deliver any agreements reasonably requested by
         Borrower to release the lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan
         Documents from the Property.

                  (iii)    Upon the release of the Property in accordance with
         this Section 2.4(b), Borrower shall (at Lender's sole and absolute
         discretion) assign all its obligations and rights under the Note,
         together with the pledged Defeasance Collateral, to a successor entity
         designated and approved by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion
         ("SUCCESSOR BORROWER"). Successor Borrower shall execute an assignment
         and assumption agreement in form and substance which would be
         satisfactory to a prudent lender pursuant to which it shall assume
         Borrower's obligations under the Note and the Defeasance Security
         Agreement. As conditions to such assignment and assumption, Borrower
         shall (A) deliver to Lender one or more opinions of counsel in form and
         substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a
         prudent lender stating, among other things, that such assignment and
         assumption agreement is enforceable against Borrower and the Successor
         Borrower in accordance with its terms and that the Note, the Defeasance
         Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as so assigned and
         assumed, are enforceable against the Successor Borrower in accordance
         with their respective terms, and opining to such other matters relating
         to Successor Borrower and its organizational structure as Lender may
         require, and (B) pay all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred
         by Lender or its agents in connection with such assignment and
         assumption (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses and
         for the review of the proposed transferee and the preparation of the
         assignment and assumption agreement and related certificates, documents
         and instruments and any fees payable to any Rating Agencies and their
         counsel in connection with the issuance of the confirmation referred to
         in subsection (b)(i)(E) above). Upon such assignment and assumption,
         Borrower shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder, under the
         Note, under the other Loan Documents and under the Defeasance Security
         Agreement, except as expressly set forth in the assignment and
         assumption agreement.

                  (iv)     For purposes of this Section 2.4, "REMIC PROHIBITION
         PERIOD" means the two-year period commencing with the "startup day"
         within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code of any REMIC Trust
         that holds the Note. In no event shall

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

         Lender have any obligation to notify Borrower that a REMIC Prohibition
         Period is in effect with respect to the Loan, except that Lender shall
         notify Borrower if any REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect with
         respect to the Loan after receiving any notice described in Section
         2.4(b)(i)(B); provided, however, that the failure of Lender to so
         notify Borrower shall not impose any liability on Lender or grant
         Borrower any right to defease the Loan during any such REMIC
         Prohibition Period.

         (c)      Intentionally deleted.

         (d)      Involuntary Prepayment During the Lockout Period. During the
Lockout Period, in the event of any involuntary prepayment of the Loan or any
other amount under the Note, whether in whole or in part, in connection with or
following Lender's acceleration of the Note or otherwise, and whether the
Mortgage is satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of sale or
judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means,
including, without limitation, repayment of the Loan by Borrower or any other
Person pursuant to any statutory or common law right of redemption, Borrower
shall, in addition to any portion of the principal balance of the Loan prepaid
(together with all interest accrued and unpaid thereon and in the event the
prepayment is made on a date other than a Scheduled Payment Date, a sum equal to
the amount of interest which would have accrued under the Note on the amount of
such prepayment if such prepayment had occurred on the next Scheduled Payment
Date), pay to Lender a prepayment premium in an amount calculated in accordance
with this Section 2.4(d). Such prepayment premium shall be in an amount equal to
the greater of:

                  (i)      1% of the portion of the Loan being prepaid; or

                  (ii)     the product obtained by multiplying:

                           (A)      the portion of the Loan being prepaid,
                  times;

                           (B)      the difference obtained by subtracting (I)
                  the Yield Rate from (II) the Note Rate, times;

                           (C)      the present value factor calculated using
                  the following formula:

                                  1-(1+r)-(n)
                                  -----------
                                       r

                                    r = Yield Rate

                                    n = the number of years and any fraction
                                        hereof, remaining between the date the
                                        prepayment is made and the Maturity Date
                                        of the Note.

         As used herein, "YIELD RATE" means the yield per annum calculated by
Lender by the linear interpolation of the yield of U.S. Treasury Securities
having a maturity date (one longer and one shorter) most nearly approximating
the Maturity Date as reported on the fifth Business Day preceding the Prepayment
Calculation Date. The "PREPAYMENT CALCULATION DATE" shall mean, as applicable,
the date on which (i) Lender applies any partial prepayment to the reduction of
the outstanding principal amount of the Note, in the case of a voluntary partial
prepayment

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

which is accepted by Lender, (ii) Lender accelerates the Loan, in the case of a
prepayment resulting from acceleration, or (iii) Lender applies funds held under
any Reserve Account, in the case of a prepayment resulting from such an
application (other than in connection with acceleration of the Loan).

         (e)      Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds; Excess Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, and provided no
Event of Default exists, Borrower shall not be required to pay any prepayment
premium in connection with any prepayment occurring solely as a result of (i)
the application of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Documents, or (ii) the application of any interest in excess
of the Maximum Legal Rate.

         (f)      After the Lockout Period. Commencing on the day after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, and upon giving Lender at least thirty (30)
days (but not more than ninety (90) days) prior written notice, Borrower may
voluntarily prepay (without premium) the Note in whole (but not in part) on a
Scheduled Payment Date. Lender shall accept a prepayment pursuant to this
Section 2.4(h) on a day other than a Scheduled Payment Date provided that, in
addition to payment of the full outstanding principal balance of the Note,
Borrower pays to Lender a sum equal to the amount of interest which would have
accrued on the Note if such prepayment occurred on the next Scheduled Payment
Date (the "INTEREST SHORTFALL").

         (g)      Limitation on Partial Prepayments. Except as set forth in
Section 2.4(e), in no event shall Lender have any obligation to accept a partial
prepayment.

         SECTION 2.5. SUBSTITUTION OF PROPERTIES

         Subject to the terms of this Section 2.5 after the earlier to occur of
(1) the expiration of the REMIC Prohibition Period or (2) the
Substitution/Defeasance Lockout Period (provided, however, that prior to a
Securitization of the Loan, Borrower may obtain a substitution pursuant to this
Section 2.5 during the Substitution/Defeasance Lockout Period), Borrower may
obtain a release of the Lien of the Mortgage (and the related Loan Documents)
encumbering the Property (the "RELEASE PROPERTY") up to one (1) time during the
Loan term by substituting therefor another property of like kind and quality,
acquired by Borrower or an Affiliate of Borrower (provided, however, if the
Substitute Property shall be owned by an Affiliate of Borrower said Affiliate
(i) shall assume all the obligations of Borrower under this Agreement, the Note
and the other Loan Documents and (ii) shall become a party to the Note and the
other Loan Documents and shall be bound by the terms and provisions thereof as
if it had executed the Note and the other Loan Documents and shall have the
rights and obligations of Borrower thereunder) (individually, a "SUBSTITUTE
PROPERTY" and collectively, the "SUBSTITUTE PROPERTIES"), provided that the
following conditions precedent are satisfied:

         (a)      Lender shall have received at least sixty (60) days prior
written notice requesting the substitution and identifying the Substitute
Property and Release Property.

         (b)      Lender shall have received (i) a copy of a deed conveying all
of Borrower's right, title and interest in and to the Release Property to a
Person other than Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to an arms length
transaction and (ii) a letter from Borrower countersigned by

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

a title insurance company acknowledging receipt of such deed and agreeing to
record such deed in the real estate records for the county in which the Release
Property is located.

         (c)      Lender shall have received a current Appraisal of the
Substitute Property prepared within one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the
release and substitution (i) showing an appraised value equal to or greater than
the appraised value of the Release Property as of the Closing Date, and (ii)
which supports a loan-to-value ratio with respect to the Substitute Property not
greater than the lesser of (A) the loan-to-value ratio as of the Closing Date
with respect to the Release Property and (B) the loan-to-value ratio with
respect to the Release Property immediately prior to the date of the proposed
substitution.

         (d)      Lender shall have received a certificate of Borrower
certifying, together with other evidence that would be satisfactory to a prudent
institutional mortgage loan lender that, after the substitution of the
Substitute Property and the release of the Release Property, (i) the Debt
Service Coverage Ratio for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately
preceding the date of the substitution with respect to the Substitute Property
after the substitution shall be equal to or greater than (A) Debt Service
Coverage Ratio for the Release Property for the twelve (12) full calendar months
immediately preceding the Closing Date and (B) Debt Service Coverage Ratio for
the Release Property for the twelve (12) full calendar months immediately
preceding the substitution.

         (e)      If the Loan is part of a Securitization, Lender shall have
received confirmation in writing from the Rating Agencies to the effect that
such release and substitution will not result in a withdrawal, qualification or
downgrade of the respective ratings in effect immediately prior to such release
and substitution for the Securities issued in connection with the Securitization
that are then outstanding. If the Loan is not part of a Securitization, Lender
shall have consented in writing to such release and substitution, which consent
shall be given in Lender's reasonable discretion applying the requirements of a
prudent institutional mortgage loan lender with respect to real estate
collateral of similar size, scope and value of the Substitute Property.

         (f)      No Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
Lender shall have received a certificate from Borrower confirming the foregoing,
stating that the representations and warranties of Borrower contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date of the release and substitution with respect to
Borrower, the Property and the Substitute Property and containing any other
representations and warranties with respect to Borrower, the Property, the
Substitute Property or the Loan as Lender and, if the Loan has been securitized,
the Rating Agencies may reasonably require, unless such certificate would be
inaccurate, such certificate to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to a prudent institutional mortgage loan lender and, if the Loan has been
securitized, the Rating Agencies.

         (g)      Borrower shall have executed, acknowledged and delivered to
Lender (I) a Mortgage, and two UCC-1 Financing Statements with respect to the
Substitute Property, together with a letter from Borrower countersigned by a
title insurance company acknowledging receipt of such Mortgage and UCC-1
Financing Statements and agreeing to record or file, as applicable, such
Mortgage, and one of the UCC-1 Financing Statements in the real estate records
for the county in which the Substitute Property is located and to file one of
the UCC-1 Financing

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

Statements in the office of the Secretary of State (or other central filing
office) of the State in which Borrower is formed, so as to effectively create
upon such recording and filing valid and enforceable first priority Lien upon
the Substitute Property, in favor of Lender (or such other trustee as may be
desired under local law), subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances and such
other Liens as are permitted pursuant to the Loan Documents and (II) an
environmental indemnity with respect to the Substitute Property from Borrower
and Borrower Principal as set forth in the Loan Agreement. The Mortgage, UCC-1
Financing Statements, and other Loan Documents shall be the same in form and
substance as the counterparts of such documents executed and delivered with
respect to the related Release Property subject to modifications reflecting only
the Substitute Property as the Property and such modifications reflecting the
laws of the State in which the Substitute Property is located. The Mortgage
encumbering the Substitute Property shall secure all amounts then outstanding
under the Note. If the Note is secured by more than one Mortgage, in the event
that the jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is located imposes a
mortgage recording, intangibles or similar tax and does not permit the
allocation of indebtedness for the purpose of determining the amount of such tax
payable, the principal amount secured by such Mortgage shall be equal to one
hundred ten percent (110%) of the allocated loan amount for the Substitute
Property.

         (h)      Lender shall have received (A) to the extent available and
applicable, any "tie-in" or similar endorsement, together with a "first loss"
endorsement, to each Title Insurance Policy insuring the Lien of the existing
Mortgage as of the date of the substitution with respect to the Title Insurance
Policy insuring the Lien of the Mortgage with respect to the Substitute Property
and (B) a Title Insurance Policy (or a marked, signed and redated commitment to
issue such Title Insurance Policy) insuring the Lien of the Mortgage encumbering
the Substitute Property, issued by the title company that issued the Title
Insurance Policies insuring the Lien of the existing Mortgage and dated as of
the date of the substitution. The Title Insurance Policy issued with respect to
the Substitute Property shall (1) to the extent applicable, provide coverage in
the amount of the Loan if the "tie-in" or similar endorsement described above is
available or, if such endorsement is not available, in an amount equal to one
hundred ten percent (110%) of the original principal balance of the Loan,
together with "last dollar endorsement," (2) insure Lender that the relevant
Mortgage creates a valid first lien on the Substitute Property encumbered
thereby, free and clear of all exceptions from coverage other than Permitted
Encumbrances and standard exceptions and exclusions from coverage (as modified
by the terms of any endorsements), (3) contain such endorsements and affirmative
coverages as are then available and are contained in the Title Insurance
Policies insuring the Liens of the existing Mortgage, and such other
endorsements or affirmative coverage that a prudent institutional mortgage
lender would require, and (4) name Lender as the insured. Lender also shall have
received copies of paid receipts or other evidence showing that all premiums in
respect of such endorsements and Title Insurance Policies have been paid.

         (i)      Lender shall have received a current Survey for the Substitute
Property, certified to the title company and Lender and its successors and
assigns, in the same form and having the same content as the certification of
the Survey of the Release Property prepared by a professional land surveyor
licensed in the State in which the Substitute Property is located in accordance
with the 1999 Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ACSM Land Title
Surveys. Such Survey shall reflect the same legal description contained in the
Title Insurance Policy relating to such Substitute Property and shall include,
among other things, a metes and bounds description

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

of the real property comprising part of such Substitute Property (unless such
real property has been satisfactorily designated by lot number on a recorded
plat). The surveyor's seal shall be affixed to each Survey and each Survey shall
certify whether or not the surveyed property is located in a "one-hundred-year
flood hazard area."

         (j)      Lender shall have received valid certificates of insurance
indicating that the requirements for the policies of insurance required for the
Property hereunder have been satisfied with respect to the Substitute Property
and evidence of the payment of all Insurance Premiums payable for the existing
policy period.

         (k)      Lender shall have received a Phase I environmental report
dated not more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the proposed date of
substitution and otherwise acceptable to a prudent institutional mortgage loan
lender and, if recommended under the Phase I environmental report, a Phase II
environmental report that would be acceptable to a prudent institutional
mortgage loan lender, which conclude that the Substitute Property does not
contain any Hazardous Materials in violation of Environmental Laws and is not
subject to any significant risk of contamination from any off site Hazardous
Materials.

         (l)      Borrower shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Lender (A)
updates or, if the Substitute Property is to be owned by an Affiliate of
Borrower, originals, in either case certified by Borrower or such Affiliate, as
applicable, of all organizational documentation related to Borrower or such
Affiliate, as applicable, and/or the formation, structure, existence, good
standing and/or qualification to do business delivered to Lender on the Closing
Date; (B) good standing certificates, certificates of qualification to do
business in the jurisdiction in which the Substitute Property is located (if
required in such jurisdiction); and (C) resolutions of Borrower of such
Affiliate, as applicable, authorizing the substitution and any actions taken in
connection with such substitution.

         (m)      Lender shall have received the following opinions of
Borrower's counsel: (A) an opinion or opinions of counsel admitted to practice
under the laws of the State in which the Substitute Property is located stating
that the Loan Documents delivered with respect to the Substitute Property
pursuant to clause (i) above are valid and enforceable in accordance with their
terms, subject to the laws applicable to creditors' rights and equitable
principles, and that Borrower is qualified to do business and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction where the Substitute Property is located or
that Borrower is not required by Applicable Law to qualify to do business in
such jurisdiction; (B) an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to Lender,
and, if the Loan has been securitized, the Rating Agencies, stating that the
Loan Documents delivered with respect to the Substitute Property pursuant to
clause (i) above were, among other things, duly authorized, executed and
delivered by Borrower and that the execution and delivery of such Loan Documents
and the performance by Borrower of its obligations thereunder will not cause a
breach of, or a default under, any agreement, document or instrument to which
Borrower is a party or to which it or its properties are bound; (C) an update of
any Insolvency Opinion delivered in connection with the closing of the Loan,
indicating that the substitution does not affect the opinions set forth therein;
(D) if the Loan is part of a Securitization, an opinion of counsel acceptable to
the Rating Agencies that the substitution does not constitute a "significant
modification" of the Loan under Section 1001 of the Code or otherwise cause a
tax to be imposed on a "prohibited transaction" by any REMIC Trust.

substitution and Borrower shall have paid all recording charges, filing fees,
taxes or other expenses (including, without limitation, mortgage and intangibles
taxes and documentary stamp taxes) payable in connection with the substitution.
Borrower shall have paid all costs and expenses of the Rating Agencies incurred
in connection with the substitution.

         (p)      Lender shall have received annual operating statements and
occupancy statements for the Substitute Property for the most current completed
fiscal year and a current operating statement for the Release Property, each
certified by Borrower to Lender as being true and correct in all material
respects and a certificate from Borrower certifying that there has been no
material adverse change in the financial condition of the Substitute Property
since the date of such operating statements.

         (q)      Borrower shall have delivered to Lender estoppel certificates
from each Tenant under a Major Lease, except with respect to commercial Leases

certificates shall be in a form that would be satisfactory to a prudent mortgage
loan lender and shall indicate that (1) the subject Lease is a valid and binding
obligation of the tenant thereunder, (2) to the best of the tenant's knowledge,
there are no defaults under such Lease on the part of the landlord or tenant
thereunder, (3) the tenant thereunder has no knowledge of any defense or offset

         (t)      Lender shall have received (A) an endorsement to the Title

together with all other appurtenant uses for which the Substitute Property is
used) including, but not limited to, current certificates of occupancy, have
been obtained and are in full force and effect.

         (w)      In the event the Release Property is subject to a Management
Agreement along with one or more additional Properties, Lender shall have
received a certified copy of an amendment to the Management Agreement reflecting
the deletion of the Release Property and the addition of the Substitute Property

         (cc)     Borrower shall submit to Lender, not less than twenty (20)

         SECTION 2.6. PAYMENTS AFTER DEFAULT

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect of the Loan,
(a) shall accrue at the Default Rate, and (b) Lender shall be entitled to
receive and Borrower shall pay to Lender all cash flow from the Property in
accordance with the terms of Article X hereof, such amount to be applied by
Lender to the payment of the Debt in such order as Lender shall determine in its
sole discretion, including, without limitation, alternating applications thereof
between interest and principal. Interest at the Default Rate shall be computed
from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the earlier of (i) the actual
receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion thereof that is then due)
and (ii) the cure of such Event of Default. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, interest at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, shall
itself accrue interest at the same rate as the Loan and shall be secured by the
Mortgage. This paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to
extend the date of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right
or remedy accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Event of
Default; the acceptance of any payment from Borrower shall not be deemed to cure
or constitute a waiver of any Event of Default; and Lender retains its rights
under this Agreement to accelerate and to continue to demand payment of the Debt
upon the happening of and during the continuance any Event of Default, despite
any payment by Borrower to Lender.

         SECTION 2.7. USURY SAVINGS

         This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that
at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject Lender to either
civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate. If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower
is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance
due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Note Rate or
the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum
Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and
not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid
to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount of interest on account of the Loan does not
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of interest from time to time in effect and
applicable to the Loan for so long as the Loan is outstanding.

                                    ARTICLE 3
                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

         The obligation of Lender to make the Loan hereunder is subject to the
fulfillment by Borrower or waiver by Lender of the following conditions
precedent no later than the Closing Date.

Default shall have occurred and be continuing nor will any Default or Event of
Default occur immediately following the Closing Date; and Borrower shall be in

         SECTION 4.2. STATUS OF BORROWER

         Borrower's exact legal name is correctly set forth on the first page of
this Agreement, on the Mortgage and on any UCC-1 Financing Statements filed in
connection with the Loan. Borrower is an organization of the type specified on
the first page of this Agreement. Borrower is incorporated in or organized under
the laws of the state of Delaware. Borrower's principal place of business and
chief executive office, and the place where Borrower keeps its books and
records, including recorded data of any kind or nature, regardless of the medium
of recording, including software, writings, plans, specifications and

and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

         SECTION 4.4. NO CONFLICTS

         The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents by Borrower and each Borrower Principal will not conflict with or

or assets of Borrower or any Borrower Principal pursuant to the terms of any
agreement or instrument to which Borrower or any Borrower Principal is a party
or by which any of Borrower's or Borrower Principal's property or assets is
subject, nor to the best of Borrower's knowledge will such action result in any
violation of the provisions of any statute or any order, rule or regulation of
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Borrower or any Borrower
Principal or any of Borrower's or Borrower Principal's properties or assets, and
any consent, approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or

or Borrower Principal's knowledge, threatened against or affecting Borrower, any
Borrower Principal, Manager or the Property, which actions, suits or
proceedings, if determined against Borrower, any Borrower Principal, Manager or

ownership of the Property other than as disclosed in Schedule 4.5 attached
hereto.

         SECTION 4.6. AGREEMENTS

any restriction which would materially and adversely affect Borrower or the
Property, or Borrower's business, properties or assets, operations or condition,
financial or otherwise. Borrower is not in default in any material respect in
the performance, observance or fulfillment of any of the obligations, covenants
or conditions contained in any agreement or instrument to which it is a party or
by which Borrower or the Property is bound. Borrower has no material financial
obligation under any agreement or instrument to which Borrower is a party or by

incurred in the ordinary course of the operation of the Property and (b)
obligations under the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 4.7. SOLVENCY

transaction or executed the Note, this Agreement or any other Loan Documents
with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud any creditor and (b) received
reasonably equivalent value in exchange for their

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

obligations under such Loan Documents. Giving effect to the Loan, the fair
saleable value of the assets of Borrower and each Borrower Principal exceeds and
will, immediately following the making of the Loan, exceed the total liabilities
of Borrower and each Borrower Principal, including, without limitation,
subordinated, unliquidated, disputed and contingent liabilities. No petition in
bankruptcy has been filed against Borrower, any Borrower Principal, any SPE
Component Entity (if any) or Affiliated Manager in the last ten (10) years, and
neither Borrower nor any Borrower Principal, any SPE Component Entity (if any)
or Affiliated Manager in the last ten (10) years has made an assignment for the
benefit of creditors or taken advantage of any Creditors Rights Laws. Neither
Borrower nor any Borrower Principal, any SPE Component Entity (if any) or
Affiliated Manager is contemplating either the filing of a petition by it under
any Creditors Rights Laws or the liquidation of all or a major portion of
Borrower's assets or property, and Borrower has no knowledge of any Person
contemplating the filing of any such petition against Borrower or any Borrower
Principal, any SPE Component Entity (if any) or Affiliated Manager.

         SECTION 4.8. FULL AND ACCURATE DISCLOSURE

         To the best of Borrower's knowledge, no statement of fact made by or on
behalf of Borrower or any Borrower Principal in this Agreement or in any of the
other Loan Documents or in any other document or certificate delivered by or on
behalf of Borrower or any Borrower Principal contains any untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary to make statements
contained herein or therein not misleading. There is no material fact presently
known to Borrower or any Borrower Principal which has not been disclosed to
Lender which materially and adversely affects, nor as far as Borrower or any
Borrower Principal can reasonably foresee, might materially and adversely
affect, the Property or the business, operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of Borrower or any Borrower Principal.

         SECTION 4.9. NO PLAN ASSETS

         The Loan Documents are not subject to any right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense by Borrower, including the defense of usury, nor would

right thereunder, render the Loan Documents

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

unenforceable, and neither Borrower nor Borrower Principal has asserted any
right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense with respect thereto. No
Default or Event of Default exists under or with respect to any Loan Document.

         SECTION 4.12. BUSINESS PURPOSES

         The Loan is solely for the business purpose of Borrower, and is not for

         SECTION 4.13. COMPLIANCE

any Governmental Authority and Borrower has received no written notice of any
such default or violation which if determined against Borrower or the Property
would materially adversely affect Borrower or the Property. There has not been
committed by Borrower or, to Borrower's knowledge, any other Person in occupancy
of or involved with the operation or use of the Property any act or omission
affording any Governmental Authority the right of forfeiture as against the
Property or any part thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower's
obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 4.14. FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Insurance Policy. All roads necessary for the use of the Property for its
current purposes have been completed and dedicated to public use and accepted by

extent required to comply with all Legal Requirements in all material respects.

         SECTION 4.17. SEPARATE LOTS

thereof.

         SECTION 4.18. ASSESSMENTS

         To Borrower's knowledge after due inquiry, there are no pending or

         Borrower has delivered to Lender a true, correct and complete rent roll
for the Property (a "RENT ROLL") which includes all Leases affecting the
Property and contains an aging report setting forth past due amounts with
respect to the Tenants; provided, however, that Lender acknowledges that, to the

been paid and no portion thereof has been paid for any period more than thirty
(30) days in advance; (e) the rent payable under each Lease is the amount of

under any Major Lease which remains outstanding nor has Borrower or Manager
received, by telephonic, in-person, e-mail or other communication, any notice of
a material default under any Lease and (2) no more than five percent (5%) of
Tenants under pad leases have made any written claims of material defaults from

received any written notice of material defaults from greater than five percent
(5%) of the Tenants under such Leases; (g) to Borrower's knowledge there is no
present material default by a Tenant under any Major Lease; (h) all security
deposits under the Leases have been collected by Borrower; (i) Borrower is the
sole owner of the entire landlord's interest in each Lease; (j) each Lease is
the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Borrower and the applicable
Tenant thereunder and there are no agreements with the Tenants under any Major
Leases other than as expressly set forth in the Leases; (k) no Person has any
possessory interest in, or right to occupy, the Property or any portion thereof
except under the terms of a Lease (or as otherwise provided for under applicable
law); provided, however, that Lender acknowledges that, to the extent the
Property consists of a recreational vehicle resort (and for so long as either
Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal Affiliate is Borrower under the Loan),
written Leases are not used in the ordinary course of the Property's operation;
(l) none of the Leases contains any option or offer to purchase or right of
first refusal to purchase the Property or any part thereof, except to the extent
such rights of first refusal are provided to Tenants (occupying the Property
under pad Leases) or a homeowner's association, solely as the result of
applicable Legal Requirements; (m) neither the Leases nor the Rents have been
assigned, pledged or hypothecated except to Lender, and no other Person has any
interest therein except the Tenants thereunder; and (n) no conditions exist
which now give any Tenant or party the right to "go dark" pursuant to the
provision of any Major Lease and/or the any REA. In the event there are any
Leases affecting the Property relating to laundry facilities (each, a "LAUNDRY
LEASE"), none of any such Laundry Leases (A) provides that the Tenant under such
Laundry Lease shall be entitled to any proceeds payable in connection with a
Casualty of Condemnation, (B) contains any option or offer to purchase or right
of first refusal or right of first offer to purchase the Property or any part
thereof, (C) comprises a material portion of the Property or (D) imposes any
material obligations upon Borrower.

         The Management Agreement is in full force and effect and there is no
default thereunder by any party thereto and, to Borrower's knowledge, no event
has occurred that, with the passage of time and/or the giving of notice would
constitute a default thereunder. No management fees under the Management

         All costs and expenses of any and all labor, materials, supplies and
equipment used in the construction maintenance or repair of the Improvements

Lender satisfactory affirmative insurance with respect to such Lien. To
Borrower's knowledge after due inquiry, there are no claims for payment for
work, labor or materials affecting the Property which are or may become a lien
prior to, or of equal priority with, the Liens created by the Loan Documents.

encumbrances, except for Permitted Encumbrances and the Lien and security
interest created by the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 4.31. TAXES

         Borrower and Borrower Principal have filed all federal, state, county,
municipal, and city income, personal property and other tax returns required to
have been filed by them and have paid all taxes and related liabilities which
have become due pursuant to such returns or pursuant to any assessments received
by them. Neither Borrower nor Borrower Principal knows of any basis for any
additional assessment in respect of any such taxes and related liabilities for
prior years.

         SECTION 4.32. PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES

         None of the Permitted Encumbrances, individually or in the aggregate,
materially interferes with the benefits of the security intended to be provided

"margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System or for any other purpose which would be inconsistent
with such Regulation U or any other Regulations of such Board of Governors, or

"subsidiary company" within the meaning of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, as amended; or (c) subject to any other federal or state law or
regulation which purports to restrict or regulate its ability to borrow money.

(nor has any notice been given or received with respect to an alleged or current
default) under any of the terms and conditions of any REA, and any such REA
remains unmodified and in full force and effect;

         (b)      All easements granted pursuant to any REA which were to have
survived the site preparation and completion of construction (to the extent that
the same has been completed), remain in full force and effect and have not been
released, terminated, extinguished or discharged by agreement or otherwise;

         (c)      All sums due and owing by Borrower to the other parties to any
REA (or by the other parties to any such REA to Borrower) pursuant to the terms
of any such REA, including without limitation, all sums, charges, fees,
assessments, costs, and expenses in connection with any taxes, site preparation
and construction, non-shareholder contributions, and common area and other
property management activities have been paid, are current, and no lien has
attached on the Property (or threat thereof been made) for failure to pay any of
the foregoing;

         (d)      The terms, conditions, covenants, uses and restrictions
contained in any REA do not conflict in any manner with any terms, conditions,
covenants, uses and restrictions contained in any Lease or in any agreement
between Borrower and occupant of any peripheral parcel, including without
limitation, conditions and restrictions with respect to kiosk placement, tenant

and/or other use restrictions; and

         (e)      The terms, conditions, covenants, uses and restrictions

to kiosk placement, tenant restrictions (type, location or exclusivity), sale of

         SECTION 4.36. NO CHANGE IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES; DISCLOSURE

         All information submitted by Borrower or its agents to Lender and in
all financial statements, rent rolls, reports, certificates and other documents
submitted in connection with the Loan or in satisfaction of the terms thereof
and all statements of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any other
Loan Document, are accurate, complete and correct in all material respects.
There has been no material adverse change in any condition, fact, circumstance
or event that would make any such information inaccurate, incomplete or
otherwise misleading in any material respect or that otherwise materially and
adversely affects or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, could reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect the Property or the business
operations or the financial condition of Borrower. To the best of Borrower's
knowledge, Borrower has disclosed to Lender all material facts and has not
failed to disclose any material fact that could cause any representation or
warranty made herein to be materially misleading.

         SECTION 4.37. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

         All trademarks, trade names and service marks necessary to the business
of Borrower as presently conducted or as Borrower contemplates conducting its
business are in good standing and, to the extent of Borrower's actual knowledge,
uncontested. Borrower has not infringed, is not infringing, and has not received
notice of infringement with respect to asserted trademarks, trade names and
service marks of others. To Borrower's knowledge, there is no infringement by
others of trademarks, trade names and service marks of Borrower.

         SECTION 4.38. SURVEY

         The Survey for the Property delivered to Lender in connection with this
Agreement has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2(c)

or interest therein will be in danger of being sold,

                                      -46-

furnish such security as may be required in the proceeding, or, in the event
that neither Original Borrower nor a Borrower Principal Affiliate is Borrower
under the Loan, deliver to Lender such reserve deposits as may be requested by
Lender, to insure the payment of any such Taxes or Other Charges, together with
all interest and penalties thereon (unless Borrower has paid all of the Taxes or
Other Charges under protest). Lender may pay over any such cash deposit or part
thereof held by Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at any time when, in the

                           (B)      Not later than 30 days after the end of each
                  fiscal quarter following the date hereof, a balance sheet of

                  statements of income and statements of cash flows of the

                  recent fiscal year, meeting the requirements of Section
                  210.3-02 of Regulation S-X.

                           (C)      Not later than 75 days after the end of each

                           (D)      Within ten Business Days after notice from
                  Lender in connection with the Securitization of this Loan,
                  such additional financial statements, such that, as of the
                  date (each an "Offering Document Date") of each Disclosure
                  Document, Borrower shall have provided Lender with all
                  financial statements as described in subsection (f)(i) above;
                  provided that the fiscal year and interim

                                     - 49 -

<PAGE>

                  periods for which such financial statements shall be provided
                  shall be determined as of such Offering Document Date.

                  (iii)    All financial statements provided by Borrower
         hereunder pursuant to Section 5.11(c)(ii) hereof shall be prepared in
         accordance with GAAP, and shall meet the requirements of Regulation S-X
         and other applicable legal requirements. All financial statements
         (audited or unaudited) provided by Borrower under this Section 5.11
         shall be certified by an authorized officer or administrative member of
         Borrower, which certification shall state that such financial
         statements meet the requirements set forth in the first sentence of
         this Section 5.11(c)(iii).

                  (iv)     If requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide
         Lender, promptly upon request, with any other or additional financial
         statements, or financial, statistical or operating information, as
         Lender shall determine to be required pursuant to Regulation S-X or any
         amendment, modification or replacement thereto or other legal
         requirements in connection with any Disclosure Document or any filing
         under or pursuant to the Exchange Act in connection with or relating to
         a Securitization (hereinafter an "Exchange Act Filing") or as shall
         otherwise be reasonably requested by Lender.

                  (v)      In the event Lender determines, in connection with a
         Securitization, that the financial statements required in order to
         comply with Regulation S-X or other legal requirements are other than
         as provided herein, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section
         5.11(c) hereof, Lender may request, and Borrower shall promptly
         provide, such combination of Acquired Property Statement and/or
         Standard Statements or such other financial statements as Lender
         determines to be necessary or appropriate for such compliance.

                  (vi)     Any reports, statements or other information required
         to be delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered in paper form
         and in the event that Lender requires financial statements in
         connection with subsection (c) above because the Loan when combined
         with the principal amount of any Affiliated Loans equal or exceed 20%
         of the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans included in a
         Securitization (defined below), Borrower shall deliver such reports,
         statements and other information (A) on a diskette, and (B) if
         requested by Lender and within the capabilities of Borrower's data
         systems without change or modification thereto, in electronic form and
         prepared using Microsoft Word for Windows or WordPerfect for Windows
         files (which files may be prepared using a spreadsheet program and
         saved as word processing files).

         (d)      Borrower and Borrower Principal shall furnish Lender with such
other additional financial or management information (including state and
federal tax returns) as may, from time to time, be reasonably required by Lender
in form and substance satisfactory to Lender (including, without limitation, any
financial reports required to be delivered by any Tenant or any guarantor of any
Lease pursuant to the terms of such Lease), and shall furnish to Lender and its
agents convenient facilities for the examination and audit of any such books and
records.

         (e)      All items requiring the certification of Borrower shall,
except where Borrower is an individual, require a certificate executed by the
general partner, managing member or

                                     - 50 -

<PAGE>

authorized/senior officer of Borrower, as applicable (and the same rules shall
apply to any sole shareholder, general partner or managing member which is not
an individual).

         (f)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
no event shall Borrower be required to comply with the financial reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X that would be applicable solely as a result of
the principal amount of the Loan and any Affiliated Loans (at the time of
Securitization) equaling or exceeding 20% of the aggregate principal amount of
all mortgage loans included or expected to be included, as applicable, in a
Securitization.

         SECTION 5.12. ESTOPPEL STATEMENT

         (a)      After request by Lender, Borrower shall within fifteen (15)
Business Days furnish Lender with a statement, duly acknowledged and certified,
setting forth (i) the amount of the original principal amount of the Note, (ii)
the rate of interest on the Note, (iii) the unpaid principal amount of the Note,
(iv) the date installments of interest and/or principal were last paid, (v) any
offsets or defenses to the payment of the Debt, if any, and (vi) that the Note,
this Agreement, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents are valid, legal and
binding obligations and have not been modified or if modified, giving
particulars of such modification.

         (b)      Borrower shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver to
Lender, promptly upon request, but subject to the terms of the applicable Major
Leases that are either Ground Leases or Operating Leases, duly executed estoppel
certificates from any one or more Tenants thereunder as required by Lender (but
no more frequently than once every twelve (12) months provided no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing) attesting to such facts regarding the
related Lease as Lender may reasonably require, including, but not limited to
attestations that each Lease covered thereby is in full force and effect with no
defaults thereunder on the part of any party, that none of the Rents have been
paid more than one month in advance, except as security, and that the Tenant
claims no defense or offset against the full and timely performance of its
obligations under the Lease.

         SECTION 5.13. LEASING MATTERS.

         (a)      Except as otherwise consented to by Lender in writing, all
Leases shall be written on the standard form of lease which shall have been (i)
with respect to pad Leases, delivered to Lender in connection with the closing
of the Loan and (ii) with respect to Operating Leases or Ground Leases, if any,
approved by Lender, provided however that Lender acknowledges that to the extent
any portion of the Property consists of a recreational vehicle resort, Borrower
shall not be required to enter into written Leases with any occupant or tenant
of such portion of the Property and such tenants and/or occupants of such
recreational vehicle resorts shall be deemed month to month tenants or licensees
of Borrower. So long as either Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal
Affiliate is Borrower under the Loan, Borrower may modify its standard form of
pad lease in accordance with sound business practices and Legal Requirements,
provided that the form of such Lease contains covenants and conditions that are
consistent with those contained in comparable leases in the applicable local
market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the majority of owners,
managers and/or operators of comparable recreational vehicle resorts in the
applicable local market enter into written Leases with the occupants of

                                     - 51 -

<PAGE>

recreational vehicle resorts, Borrower shall be required to enter into written
Leases with respect to such occupants, and the form of such lease shall contain
terms and conditions that are consistent with those of Leases of comparable
properties in the applicable market or sub-market. Upon request, Borrower (1)
shall furnish Lender with executed copies of all Major Leases and (2) shall make
available to Lender at Borrower's offices (upon reasonable notice to Borrower),
executed copies of all other Leases. No material changes may be made to the
Lender-approved standard form of Operating Lease and Ground Lease, if
applicable, without the prior written consent of Lender. In addition, all
renewals of Leases and all proposed leases shall provide for rental rates and
terms comparable to existing local market rates and terms and, except with
respect to one pad at the Property used for on-site community managers (or other
employees of Manager), shall be arm's-length transactions with bona fide,
independent third party tenants. All proposed Major Leases and renewals of
existing Major Leases shall be subject to the prior approval of Lender and its
counsel, at Borrower's expense. All Leases shall provide that they are
subordinate to the Mortgage and that the tenant agrees to attorn to Lender.

         (b)      Borrower (i) shall observe and perform all the obligations
imposed upon the landlord under the Leases and shall not do or permit to be done
anything to impair the value of the Leases as security for the Debt; (ii) shall
enforce all of the material terms, covenants and conditions contained in the
Leases upon the part of the Tenant thereunder to be observed or performed, short
of termination thereof; provided however, with respect to pad leases, a pad
Lease may be terminated in the event of a default by the tenant thereunder;
(iii) with respect to any Leases (other than Leases relating to mobile home park
pads or recreational vehicle resort pads), shall not collect any of the Rents
more than one (1) month in advance; provided, however, that in no event shall
Borrower collect any Rents under Leases (or any other applicable occupancy
agreements (written or otherwise)) relating to mobile home park pads or
recreational vehicle resort pads more than one (1) year in advance; (iv) shall
not execute any other assignment of the landlord's interest in the Leases or the
Rents; and (v) shall not consent to any assignment of or subletting under the
Major Leases not in accordance with their terms, without the prior written
consent of Lender.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above,
renewals of existing commercial Leases and proposed Leases for commercial space
shall not be subject to the prior approval of Lender, provided all of the
following conditions are satisfied: (i) the rental income pursuant to the
renewal or proposed Lease is not more than five (5%) percent of the total rental
income for the Property, (ii) the renewal or proposed Lease has a base term of
less than six (6) years including options to renew, (iii) no rent, credits, free
rents or concessions have been granted under the renewal or proposed Lease
(except to the extent consistent with current market conditions), (iv) the
renewal or proposed Lease is subject and subordinate to the Mortgage and the
tenant thereunder shall have agreed to attorn to Lender, (v) the renewal or
proposed Lease is on the standard form of lease approved by Lender, (vi) the
renewal or proposed Lease does not contain any option, offer, right of first
refusal, or other similar right to acquire all or any portion of the Property,
and (vii) the renewal or proposed Lease provides for rental rates and terms
comparable to existing market rates and terms and is an arm's-length transaction
with a bona fide, independent third party tenant. Borrower shall deliver to
Lender copies of all Leases which are entered into pursuant to the preceding
sentence together with Borrower's certification that it has satisfied all of the
conditions of the preceding sentence within thirty (30) days after the execution
of the Lease.

Agreement and do all things necessary to preserve and to keep unimpaired its
material rights thereunder; (ii) promptly notify Lender of any material default
under the Management Agreement of which it is aware; (iii) promptly deliver to
Lender a copy of any notice of default or other material notice received by

observance of all of the covenants required to be performed and observed by
Manager under the Management Agreement.

hereof has occurred and is continuing; or (ii) Manager is not an Affiliated
Manager and either (A) a default has occurred and is continuing under the
Management Agreement or (B) Manager has become insolvent or a debtor in a
bankruptcy proceeding, Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, terminate the
Management Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior notice to Manager and replace
Manager with a Qualified Manager approved by Lender on terms and conditions
satisfactory to Lender, it being understood and agreed that the management fee
for such replacement manager shall not exceed then prevailing market rates.

         (c)      Intentionally deleted.

         (d)      Any entity Controlled by MHC or MHCOP shall be deemed

otherwise replace Manager or enter into any other management agreement with
respect to the Property; (ii) reduce or consent to the reduction of the term of
the Management Agreement; (iii) increase or consent to the increase of the
amount of any charges under the Management Agreement; or (iv) otherwise modify,
change, supplement, alter or amend, or waive or release any of its rights and
remedies under, the Management Agreement in any material respect, provided,
however, that if Manager is Controlled by MHC or MHCOP, then Borrower shall have
the right to enter into amendments to the Management Agreement (1) which are
consistent with good operating practices, (2) which do not increase any of the
fees or other similar charges payable by Borrower thereunder and (3) which do
not otherwise materially increase any of Borrower's obligations thereunder, and
Borrower shall have the right to enter into a new management agreement with
another entity Controlled by MHC or MHCOP on substantially the same terms and
conditions as those set forth in the Management Agreement approved by Lender in
connection with the closing of the Loan and otherwise in accordance with the
terms permitted hereunder, without the consent of Lender. In the event that
Borrower replaces Manager at any time during the term of Loan pursuant to this
subsection, such Manager shall be a Qualified Manager.

         SECTION 5.15. LIENS

         Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any portion of the Property
or permit any such action to be taken, except Permitted Encumbrances.

         SECTION 5.16. DEBT CANCELLATION

         Borrower shall not cancel or otherwise forgive or release any claim or
debt (other than termination of Leases in accordance herewith) owed to Borrower

Borrower's business.

         SECTION 5.17. ZONING

         Borrower shall not initiate or consent to any zoning reclassification
of any portion of the Property or seek any variance under any existing zoning
ordinance or use or permit the use of any portion of the Property in any manner
that could result in such use becoming a non-conforming use under any zoning
ordinance or any other applicable land use law, rule or regulation, without the
prior written consent of Lender.

         SECTION 5.18. ERISA

         (a)      Borrower shall not engage in any transaction which would cause
any obligation, or action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise by
Lender of any of its rights under the Note, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents) to be a non-exempt (under a statutory or administrative class
exemption) prohibited transaction under ERISA.

         (b)      Borrower further covenants and agrees to deliver to Lender
such certifications or other evidence from time to time throughout the term of
the Loan, as requested by Lender in its sole discretion, that (i) Borrower is

of ERISA, which is subject to Title I of ERISA, or a "governmental plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA; (ii) Borrower is not subject to state
statutes regulating investments and fiduciary obligations with respect to
governmental plans; and (iii) one or more of the following circumstances is

         SECTION 5.19. NO JOINT ASSESSMENT

         Borrower shall not suffer, permit or initiate the joint assessment of
the Property with (a) any other real property constituting a tax lot separate

taxes which may be levied against such personal property shall be assessed or
levied or charged to the Property.

         SECTION 5.20. RECIPROCAL EASEMENT AGREEMENTS

         Borrower shall not enter into, terminate or modify (in any material
respects) any REA without Lender's prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Borrower shall enforce,
comply with, and cause each of the parties to the REA to comply with all of the
material economic terms and conditions contained in the REA. Lender acknowledges
that it would be unreasonable to withhold its consent to Borrower entering into
an REA with an Affiliate owning property adjacent to the Property with respect
to the use of certain amenities and facilities at the Property, provided that
(A) any such REA would not (i) have a material adverse affect on the Property or
the Borrower, (ii) impose any material obligations on the Borrower, (B) the
terms of any such REA provide that Borrower shall be paid fair market value for
the use of such amenities and/or facilities under any such REA and (C)

         SECTION 5.21. ALTERATIONS

         Lender's prior approval shall be required in connection with any
alterations to any Improvements, exclusive of alterations to tenant spaces
required under any Lease, (a) that may have a material adverse effect on the
Property or (b) that, together with any other alterations undertaken at the same
time (including any related alterations, improvements or replacements), are
reasonably anticipated to have a cost in excess of the Alteration Threshold.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) above and provided that either
the Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal Affiliate is Borrower under the
Loan, Lender's prior approval shall not be required in connection with any
alterations in excess of the Alteration Threshold, provided that Lender shall
have received (a) a current Appraisal of the Property (or a letter update to the
Appraisal delivered in connection with the closing of the Loan), (b) a
certificate from Borrower and (c) such other evidence that would be satisfactory
to a prudent institutional mortgage loan lender each indicating that such
alterations will not impair (as security for the Loan) the fair market value of
the real estate collateral portion of the Property, as determined by a prudent
institutional secondary market lender. If the total unpaid amounts incurred and
to be incurred with respect to such alterations to the Improvements shall at any
time exceed the Alteration Threshold and regardless of whether Lender's consent
is required in connection with any such alterations, Borrower shall promptly
deliver to Lender as security for the payment of such amounts and as additional
security for Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents any of the
following: (i) cash, (ii) direct non-callable obligations of the United States
of America or other obligations which are "government securities" within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent
acceptable to the applicable Rating Agencies, (iii) other securities acceptable
to Lender and the Rating Agencies, or (iv) a completion bond,

                                     - 55 -

provided that such completion bond is acceptable to the Lender and the Rating
Agencies. Such security shall be in an amount equal to the excess of the total
unpaid amounts incurred and to be incurred with respect to such alterations to
the Improvements over the Alteration Threshold.

         SECTION 5.22. TAX CREDITS

         Borrower shall not claim a low income housing credit for the Property
under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code without Lender's prior written
consent.

         SECTION 5.23. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

                  (iv)     fail to observe all organizational formalities, or
         fail to preserve its existence as an entity duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing (if applicable) under the applicable
         Legal Requirements of the jurisdiction of its organization or
         formation, or amend, modify, terminate or fail to comply with the
         provisions of its organizational documents;

                  (v)      own any subsidiary, or make any investment in, any

         conditions that are intrinsically fair, commercially reasonable and
         substantially similar to those that would be available on an
         arm's-length basis with unaffiliated third parties;

                  (x)      maintain its assets in such a manner that it will be
         costly or difficult to segregate, ascertain or identify its individual
         assets from those of any other Person;

                  (xi)     assume or guaranty the debts of any other Person,
         hold itself out to be responsible for the debts of any other Person, or
         otherwise pledge its assets for the benefit of any other Person or hold
         out its credit as being available to satisfy the obligations of any
         other Person;

                  (xiv)    fail either to hold itself out to the public as a

                  (xv)     fail to maintain adequate capital for the normal
         obligations reasonably foreseeable in a business of its size and
         character and in light of its contemplated business operations,
         provided, however, that any such failure to maintain adequate capital
         will not constitute a breach of this covenant if cash flow from the
         Property is insufficient for Borrower to maintain adequate capital as
         set forth above;;

                  (xvi)    if it is a partnership or limited liability company,
         without the unanimous written consent of all of its partners or

         the benefit of creditors;

                  (xvii)   fail to allocate shared expenses (including, without
         limitation, shared office space and services performed by an employee
         of an Affiliate) among the Persons sharing such expenses and to use
         separate stationery, invoices and checks;

                  (xviii)  make any distributions so as to render Borrower

         any) from its own funds;

                  (xix)    acquire obligations or securities of its partners,
         members, shareholders or other affiliates, as applicable; or

                  (xx)     violate or cause to be violated the assumptions made
         with respect to Borrower and its principals in any opinion letter
         pertaining to substantive consolidation delivered to Lender in
         connection with the Loan; or

                  (xxi)    If Borrower is a partnership or limited liability
         company, each general partner in the case of a general partnership,
         each general partner in the case of a limited partnership, or the
         managing member in the case of a limited liability company (each an
         "SPE COMPONENT ENTITY") of Borrower, as applicable, shall be a
         corporation or a single member Delaware limited liability company whose
         sole asset is its interest in Borrower. Each SPE Component Entity (i)
         will at all times comply with each of the covenants, terms and
         provisions contained in Section 6.1(a)(iii) - (vi) and (viii) - (xxi),
         as if such representation, warranty or covenant was made directly by
         such SPE Component Entity; (ii) will not engage in any business or
         activity other than owning an interest in Borrower; (iii) will not
         acquire or own any assets other than its partnership, membership, or
         other equity interest in Borrower; (iv) will not incur any debt,
         secured or unsecured, direct or contingent (including guaranteeing any
         obligation); (v) will at all times when the Loan is outstanding own at

         managing membership interest in Borrower; and (vi) will cause Borrower
         to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.1 and Section 6.4.
         Prior to the withdrawal or the disassociation of any SPE Component
         Entity from Borrower, Borrower shall immediately appoint a new general
         partner or managing member whose articles of incorporation or limited
         liability company operating agreement, as applicable, are substantially
         similar to those of such SPE Component Entity and, if an opinion letter
         pertaining to substantive consolidation was required at closing,
         deliver a new opinion letter acceptable to Lender and the Rating
         Agencies with respect to the new SPE Component Entity and its equity
         owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Borrower is a
         single member Delaware limited liability company, so long as Borrower
         maintains such formation status, no SPE Component Entity shall be
         required.

         (b)      In the event Borrower is a single member Delaware limited
liability company, the limited liability company agreement of Borrower (the "LLC
AGREEMENT") shall provide that (i) upon the occurrence of any event that causes
the sole member of Borrower ("MEMBER") to cease to be the member of Borrower
(other than (A) upon an assignment by Member of all of its

                                     - 58 -

<PAGE>

limited liability company interest in Borrower and the admission of the
transferee in accordance with the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement, or (B)
the resignation of Member and the admission of an additional member of Borrower
in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement), any
person acting as Independent Director of Borrower shall, without any action of
any other Person and simultaneously with the Member ceasing to be the member of
Borrower, automatically be admitted to Borrower ("SPECIAL MEMBER") and shall
continue Borrower without dissolution and (ii) Special Member may not resign
from Borrower or transfer its rights as Special Member unless (A) a successor
Special Member has been admitted to Borrower as Special Member in accordance
with requirements of Delaware law and (B) such successor Special Member has also
accepted its appointment as an Independent Director. The LLC Agreement shall
further provide that (i) Special Member shall automatically cease to be a member
of Borrower upon the admission to Borrower of a substitute Member, (ii) Special
Member shall be a member of Borrower that has no interest in the profits, losses
and capital of Borrower and has no right to receive any distributions of
Borrower assets, (iii) pursuant to Section 18-301 of the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act (the "ACT"), Special Member shall not be required to make
any capital contributions to Borrower and shall not receive a limited liability
company interest in Borrower, (iv) Special Member, in its capacity as Special
Member, may not bind Borrower and (v) except as required by any mandatory
provision of the Act, Special Member, in its capacity as Special Member, shall
have no right to vote on, approve or otherwise consent to any action by, or
matter relating to, Borrower, including, without limitation, the merger,
consolidation or conversion of Borrower; provided, however, such prohibition
shall not limit the obligations of Special Member, in its capacity as
Independent Director, to vote on such matters required by the Loan Documents or
the LLC Agreement. In order to implement the admission to Borrower of Special
Member, Special Member shall execute a counterpart to the LLC Agreement. Prior
to its admission to Borrower as Special Member, Special Member shall not be a
member of Borrower.

         Upon the occurrence of any event that causes the Member to cease to be
a member of Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the personal
representative of Member shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of
the event that terminated the continued membership of Member in Borrower, agree
in writing (i) to continue Borrower and (ii) to the admission of the personal
representative or its nominee or designee, as the case may be, as a substitute
member of Borrower, effective as of the occurrence of the event that terminated
the continued membership of Member of Borrower in Borrower. Any action initiated
by or brought against Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws
shall not cause Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of Borrower and
upon the occurrence of such an event, the business of Borrower shall continue
without dissolution. The LLC Agreement shall provide that each of Member and
Special Member waives any right it might have to agree in writing to dissolve
Borrower upon the occurrence of any action initiated by or brought against
Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws, or the occurrence of
an event that causes Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of
Borrower.

         SECTION 6.2. CHANGE OF NAME, IDENTITY OR STRUCTURE

         Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed (a) Borrower's name,
(b) Borrower's identity (including its trade name or names), (c) Borrower's
principal place of business set forth on the first page of this Agreement, (d)
the corporate, partnership or other organizational

                                     - 59 -

structure of Borrower, each SPE Component Entity (if any), or Borrower
Principal, (e) Borrower's state of organization, or (f) Borrower's
organizational identification number, without in each case notifying Lender of
such change in writing at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of
such change and, in the case of a change in Borrower's structure, without first
obtaining the prior written consent of Lender. In addition, Borrower shall not
change or permit to be changed any organizational documents of Borrower or any
SPE Component Entity (if any) if such change would adversely impact the
covenants set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.4 hereof. Borrower authorizes
Lender to file any financing statement or financing statement amendment required
by Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection and priority of the
security interest granted herein. At the request of Lender, Borrower shall
execute a certificate in form satisfactory to Lender listing the trade names
under which Borrower intends to operate the Property, and representing and
warranting that Borrower does business under no other trade name with respect to
the Property. If Borrower does not now have an organizational identification
number and later obtains one, or if the organizational identification number
assigned to Borrower subsequently changes, Borrower shall promptly notify Lender
of such organizational identification number or change.

         SECTION 6.3. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

         Borrower will qualify to do business and will remain in good standing
under the laws of the State as and to the extent the same are required for the
ownership, maintenance, management and operation of the Property.

         SECTION 6.4. INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

         (a)      The organizational documents of Borrower or each SPE Component
Entity (if any), as applicable, shall provide that at all times there shall be,
and Borrower shall cause there to be, at least one manager (each an "INDEPENDENT
DIRECTOR") of Borrower or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, reasonably
satisfactory to Lender each of whom are not at the time of such individual's
initial appointment, and shall not have been at any time during the preceding

liability companies), employee, attorney or counsel of, Borrower, such SPE
Component Entity or any of their respective shareholders, partners, members,
subsidiaries or affiliates; (ii) a customer or creditor of, or supplier to,
Borrower or any of its respective shareholders, partners, members, subsidiaries
or affiliates who derives any of its purchases or revenue from its activities
with Borrower or such SPE Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of them;
(iii) a Person who Controls or is under common Control with any such
shareholder, officer, director, partner, manager, member, employee, supplier,
creditor or customer; or (iv) a member of the immediate family of any such

creditor or customer.

         (b)      The organizational documents of Borrower or each SPE Component
Entity (if any), as the case may be, shall provide that the manager of Borrower
or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, shall not take any action which,
under the terms of any articles of organization or operating agreement, as
applicable, requires an unanimous vote of the members

                                     - 60 -

and manager of Borrower or such SPE Component Entity, as the case may be, unless
at the time of such action there shall be at least one manager who is an
Independent Director. Borrower or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, will

including each Independent Director, on behalf of itself or Borrower, (i) file
or consent to the filing of any petition, either voluntary or involuntary, to
take advantage of any applicable Creditors Rights Laws; (ii) seek or consent to
the appointment of a receiver, liquidator or any similar official; (iii) take
any action that might cause such entity to become insolvent; or (iv) make an
assignment for the benefit of creditors.

Restricted Party shall comply with the requirements of Section 7.4 hereof,
provided however, that with respect to transfers provided for in subsection
(a)(iii) hereof, Borrower shall not be required to deliver a revised substantive
non-consolidation opinion to Lender in connection with any such transfers.

         (b)      In addition to the foregoing and supplementing subsection (a)

         SECTION 7.4. LENDER'S RIGHTS

         Lender reserves the right to condition the consent to a Prohibited
Transfer requested hereunder upon (a) a modification of the terms hereof and an
assumption of the Note and the

                                     - 62 -

<PAGE>

other Loan Documents as so modified by the proposed Prohibited Transfer, (b)
receipt of payment of a transfer fee equal to one percent (1%) of the
outstanding principal balance of the Loan and all of Lender's expenses incurred
in connection with such Prohibited Transfer, (c) receipt of written confirmation
from the Rating Agencies that the Prohibited Transfer will not result in a
downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or if higher, then
current ratings issued in connection with a Securitization, or if a
Securitization has not occurred, any ratings to be assigned in connection with a
Securitization, (d) the proposed transferee's continued compliance with the
covenants set forth in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the
covenants in Article 6) and the other Loan Documents, (e) a new manager for the
Property and a new management agreement satisfactory to Lender, and (f) the
satisfaction of such other conditions and/or legal opinions as Lender shall
determine in its sole discretion to be in the interest of Lender. All expenses
incurred by Lender shall be payable by Borrower whether or not Lender consents
to the Prohibited Transfer. Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any
actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of default hereunder in
order to declare the Debt immediately due and payable upon a Prohibited Transfer
made without Lender's consent. This provision shall apply to each and every
Prohibited Transfer, whether or not Lender has consented to any previous
Prohibited Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 7.4, in the event a substantive non-consolidation opinion was delivered
to Lender and the Rating Agencies in connection with the closing of the Loan,
and if any Sale or Pledge permitted under this Article 7 results in any Person
and its Affiliates owning in excess of forty-nine percent (49%) of the ownership
interests in a Restricted Party, Borrower shall, prior to such transfer, and in
addition to any other requirement for Lender consent contained herein, deliver a
revised substantive non-consolidation opinion to Lender reflecting such
Prohibited Transfer, which opinion shall be in form, scope and substance
acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

         SECTION 7.5. ASSUMPTION

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 7, Lender
shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a transfer of the Property in its
entirety to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, any Person (a
"TRANSFEREE") and Lender shall release Borrower and Borrower Principal from
their obligations under the Loan (to the extent such obligations arise from
events occurring after the date of the assumption), provided that each of the
following terms and conditions are satisfied:

         (a)      no Default or Event of Default has occurred;

         (b)      Borrower shall have (i) delivered written notice to Lender of
the terms of such prospective transfer not less than sixty (60) days before the
date on which such transfer is scheduled to close and, concurrently therewith,
all such information concerning the proposed Transferee as Lender shall
reasonably require and (ii) paid to Lender a non-refundable processing fee in
the amount of $10,000 (which fee shall be credited against the assumption fee
payable in connection with such assumption). Lender shall have the right to
approve or disapprove the proposed transfer based on its then current
underwriting and credit requirements for similar loans secured by similar
properties which loans are sold in the secondary market, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld. In determining whether to give or withhold its approval
of the proposed transfer, Lender shall consider the experience and track record
of

                                     - 63 -

<PAGE>

Transferee and its principals in owning and operating facilities similar to the
Property, the financial strength of Transferee and its principals, the general
business standing of Transferee and its principals and Transferee's and its
principals' relationships and experience with contractors, vendors, tenants,
lenders and other business entities; provided, however, that, notwithstanding
Lender's agreement to consider the foregoing factors in determining whether to
give or withhold such approval, such approval shall be given or withheld based
on what Lender determines to be commercially reasonable and, if given, may be
given subject to such conditions as Lender may deem reasonably appropriate;

         (c)      Borrower shall have paid to Lender, concurrently with the
closing of such transfer, (i) a non-refundable assumption fee in an amount equal
to one percent (1.0%) of the then outstanding principal balance of the Note
(subject to credit for any previously paid non-refundable processing fees), and
(ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred by Lender in connection with the transfer;

         (d)      Transferee assumes and agrees to pay the Debt as and when due
subject to the provisions of Article 15 hereof and, prior to or concurrently
with the closing of such transfer, Transferee and its constituent partners,
members or shareholders as Lender may require, shall execute, without any cost
or expense to Lender, such documents and agreements as Lender shall reasonably
require to evidence and effectuate said assumption;

         (e)      Borrower and Transferee, without any cost to Lender, shall
furnish any information requested by Lender for the preparation of, and shall
authorize Lender to file, new financing statements and financing statement
amendments and other documents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, and shall execute any additional documents reasonably requested by Lender;

         (f)      Borrower shall have delivered to Lender, without any cost or
expense to Lender, such endorsements to Lender's Title Insurance Policy insuring
that fee simple or leasehold title to the Property, as applicable, is vested in
Transferee (subject to Permitted Encumbrances), hazard insurance endorsements or
certificates and other similar materials as Lender may deem necessary at the
time of the transfer, all in form and substance satisfactory to Lender;

         (g)      Transferee shall have furnished to Lender, if Transferee is a
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, all
appropriate papers evidencing Transferee's organization and good standing, and
the qualification of the signers to execute the assumption of the Debt, which
papers shall include certified copies of all documents relating to the
organization and formation of Transferee and of the entities, if any, which are
partners or members of Transferee. Transferee and such constituent partners,
members or shareholders of Transferee (as the case may be), as Lender shall
require, shall comply with the covenants set forth in Article 6 hereof;

         (h)      Transferee shall assume the obligations of Borrower under any
Management Agreement or provide a new management agreement with a new manager
which meets with the requirements of Section 5.14 hereof and assign to Lender as
additional security such new management agreement;

                                     - 64 -

<PAGE>

         (i)      Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
Lender and its counsel (A) that Transferee's formation documents provide for the
matters described in subparagraph (g) above, (B) that the assumption of the Debt
has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and that the Note, the
Mortgage, this Agreement, the assumption agreement and the other Loan Documents
are valid, binding and enforceable against Transferee in accordance with their
terms, (C) that Transferee and any entity which is a controlling stockholder,
member or general partner of Transferee, have been duly organized, and are in
existence and good standing, and (E) with respect to such other matters as
Lender may reasonably request;

         (j)      if required by Lender, Lender shall have received confirmation
in writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that
the transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

         (k)      Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale pursuant to
which the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject to the
satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Section 7.5; and

         (l)      in the event a substantive non-consolidation opinion was
delivered to Lender in connection with the closing of the Loan, Transferee
shall, prior to such transfer, deliver a new or updated substantive
non-consolidation opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and
substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of the Property in its entirety
to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, a Transferee pursuant to this
Section 7.5 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of Lender to
consent to any subsequent transfer of the Property. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 7.5, prior to a Securitization Lender's
consent to any transfer of the Property and assumption of the Loan pursuant to
this Section 7.5 shall not be required if the consideration to be paid to
Borrower by the proposed Transferee is less than the appraised value of the
Property as determined by Lender.

         SECTION 7.6. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION 7.7. ASSUMPTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN TRANSFERS TO
AFFILIATES.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 7, Lender
shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a transfer (by deed or ground lease
for nominal consideration), of a portion of the Property (the "AFFILIATE
TRANSFER PORTION OF THE PROPERTY") to, and the related assumption of the Loan
by, an Affiliate of Borrower (i) in which Borrower Principal owns, directly or
indirectly, at least a 70% ownership interest or (ii) in which MHCOP owns,
directly or indirectly, at least a 99% ownership interest (an "AFFILIATE
TRANSFEREE") such Affiliate Transferee to be a co-obligor and co-mortgagee under
the Loan and jointly and severally obligated thereunder, provided that, among
other things, each of the following conditions are satisfied:

         (a)      no Default or Event of Default has occurred;

         (b)      Borrower shall have (i) delivered written notice to Lender of
the terms of such prospective transfer and assumption not less than sixty (60)
days before the date on which such transfer and assumption is scheduled to close
and, concurrently therewith, all such information concerning the proposed
Affiliate Transferee as Lender shall reasonably require and (ii) paid to Lender
a non-refundable processing fee in the amount of $10,000;

         (c)      Borrower shall have paid to Lender all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred

such transfer and assumption;

         (e)      Borrower and Affiliate Transferee, without any cost to Lender,

shall authorize Lender to file, new and/or amended security instruments,
financing statements and financing statement amendments and other documents to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and shall execute any additional
documents reasonably requested by Lender;

         (f)      Affiliate Transferee shall have furnished to Lender, if
Affiliate Transferee is a corporation, partnership, limited liability company or
other entity, all appropriate papers evidencing Affiliate Transferee's
organization and good standing, and the qualification of the signers to execute
the assumption of the Debt, which papers shall include certified copies of all
documents relating to the organization and formation of Affiliate Transferee and
of the entities, if any, which are partners or members of Affiliate Transferee.
Affiliate Transferee and such constituent partners, members or shareholders of
Affiliate Transferee (as the case may be), as Lender shall require, shall comply
with the covenants set forth in Article 6 hereof;

         (g)      Affiliate Transferee shall (i) assume the obligations of
Borrower under any Management Agreement as they relate to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property, provided, however, that in the event the Affiliate
Transfer Portion of the Property is operated solely as a sewage treatment and/or
water treatment facility and operated solely by Affiliate Transferee (and
Manager does not perform any services with respect to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property), Affiliate Transferee shall not be required to assume
the obligations of Borrower under the Management Agreement, and (ii) if
applicable, execute an assignment to Lender of such Management Agreement as
additional security for the Loan;

         (h)      Affiliate Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel
satisfactory to Lender and its counsel (A) that Affiliate Transferee's formation
documents provide for the matters described in subparagraph (f) above, (B) that
the assumption of the Debt has been duly authorized, executed and delivered, and
that the Note, the Mortgage, this Agreement, the assumption agreement and the
other Loan Documents are valid, binding and enforceable against Affiliate
Transferee in accordance with their terms, (C) that Affiliate Transferee and any
entity which is a controlling stockholder, managing or sole member or general
partner of Affiliate Transferee,

                                     - 66 -

have been duly organized, and are in existence and good standing, and (E) with
respect to such other matters as Lender may reasonably request;

         (i)      if required by Lender, Lender shall have received confirmation
in writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that
the transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

         (j)      Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale, if any,
pursuant to which the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject
to the satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Section 7.7;

         (k)      in the event an Insolvency Opinion was delivered to Lender in
connection with the closing of the Loan, Borrower and Affiliate Transferee
shall, prior to such transfer and assumption, deliver a new or updated
Insolvency Opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and
substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies;

         (l)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence which would be
satisfactory to a prudent lender that (i) the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property has been legally split or subdivided from the remainder of the
Property; (ii) after giving effect to such transfer, each of the Affiliate
Transfer Portion of the Property and the balance of the Property conforms and is
in compliance in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements and
constitutes a separate tax lot and (iii) the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property is not necessary for the Property to comply with any zoning, building,
land use or parking or other Legal Requirements applicable to the Property or
for the then current use of the Property, including, without limitation, for
access, driveways, parking, utilities or drainage or, to the extent that the
Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property is necessary for any such purposes, a
reciprocal easement agreement has been executed and recorded that would allow
the owner of the Property to continue to use the Affiliate Transfer Portion of
the Property to the extent necessary for such purposes;

         (m)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender an endorsement to the Title
Insurance Policy (i) extending the effective date of the Title Insurance Policy
to the effective date of the transfer; (ii) confirming no change in the priority
of the Mortgage on the Property (including the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property) or in the amount of the insurance or the coverage of the Property
under the Title Insurance Policy; and (iii) insuring the rights and benefits
under any new or amended reciprocal easement agreement or such other agreement
required pursuant to subsection 7.7(l)(iii) hereof that has been executed and
recorded, if any. Borrower shall have delivered to Lender, without any cost or
expense to Lender, such endorsements to Lender's Title Insurance Policy insuring
that fee simple or leasehold title to the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property, as applicable, is vested in Affiliate Transferee (subject to Permitted
Encumbrances), hazard insurance endorsements or certificates and other similar
materials as Lender may deem necessary at the time of the transfer, all in form
and substance satisfactory to Lender;

         (n)      not less than three (3) Business Days prior to the date of the
transfer and assumption, Borrower delivers to Lender approvals to the transfer
executed by any entities other than Lender holding Liens encumbering the
Property or the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the

                                     - 67 -

<PAGE>

Property (or holding any other interest therein that would be affected by the
transfer), if and to the extent such approval is required pursuant to the terms
of any of the documents evidencing or securing such Lien or interest;

         (o)      Borrower and Affiliate Transferee have complied with any
requirements applicable to the transfer in any Major Leases, REA's, operating
agreements, parking agreements or other similar agreements affecting the
Property or the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property and the transfer does
not violate any of the provisions of such documents in any respect that would
result in a termination (or give any other party thereto the right to
terminate), extinguishment or other loss of material right of Borrower or in a
material increase in Borrower's obligations under such documents and, to the
extent necessary to comply with such documents, the Affiliate Transferee has
assumed Borrower's obligations, if any, relating to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property under such documents; and

         (p)      if a securitization shall have occurred, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower and Affiliate
Transferee in form and substance and delivered by counsel which would be
satisfactory to a prudent lender stating, among other things, that the transfer
and assumption by Affiliate Transferee pursuant to this Section 7.7 (1) will not
directly or indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust that then holds the
Note to fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and (2) will not cause any
REMIC Trust to be an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of
1940, at Borrower's cost; and

         (q)      Borrower delivers to Lender any other information, approvals
and documents which would be required by a prudent Lender in connection with
such transfer and assumption.

         A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of a portion of the
Property to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, an Affiliate Transferee
pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right
of Lender to consent to any subsequent transfer of the Property or assumption of
the Loan. Notwithstanding any transfer and assumption to an Affiliate Transferee
pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Property and the Affiliate Transfer Portion of
the Property shall be deemed a single Property for purposes of this Agreement
and the Loan.

         SECTION 7.8. ADDITIONAL PERMITTED TRANSFERS.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 7,
Borrower may grant easements, restrictions, covenants, reservations and rights
of way with respect to the Property in the ordinary course of business for water
and sewer lines, telephone and telegraph lines, electric lines and other
utilities or for other similar purposes, provided that such transfers,
conveyances or encumbrances (i) shall not impair the utility and operation of
the Property or materially adversely affect the value of the Property or
adversely affect Borrower's ability to pay the Debt or the Monthly Payment
Amount and (ii) shall be in a form that is reasonably acceptable to Lender.

                 INSURANCE; CASUALTY; CONDEMNATION; RESTORATION

         SECTION 8.1. INSURANCE

         (a)      Borrower shall obtain and maintain, or cause to be maintained,
at all times insurance for Borrower and the Property providing at least the
following coverages:

                  (i)      comprehensive "all risk" insurance (excluding
         terrorism coverage) on the Improvements and the Personal Property, in
         each case (A) in an amount equal to one hundred percent (100%) of the
         "Full Replacement Cost," which for purposes of this Agreement shall
         mean actual replacement value (exclusive of costs of excavations,
         foundations, underground utilities and footings) with a waiver of
         depreciation; (B) containing an agreed amount endorsement with respect
         to the Improvements and Personal Property waiving all co-insurance
         provisions; (C) providing for no deductible in excess of $100,000 for
         all such insurance coverage; and (D) if any of the Improvements or the
         use of the Property shall at any time constitute legal non-conforming
         structures or uses, providing coverage for contingent liability from
         Operation of Building Laws, Demolition Costs and Increased Cost of
         Construction Endorsements and containing an "Ordinance or Law Coverage"
         or "Enforcement" endorsement. In addition, Borrower shall obtain: (y)
         if any portion of the Improvements is currently or at any time in the
         future located in a "special flood hazard area" designated by the
         Federal Emergency Management Agency, flood hazard insurance in an
         amount equal to the maximum amount of such insurance available under
         the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, the Flood Disaster Protection
         Act of 1973 or the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, as each
         may be amended, and providing for no deductible in excess of $250,000;
         and (z) earthquake insurance in amounts and in form and substance
         reasonably satisfactory to Lender in the event the Property is located
         in an area with a high degree of seismic risk, provided that the
         insurance pursuant to clauses (y) and (z) hereof shall be on terms
         consistent with the comprehensive all risk insurance policy required
         under this subsection (i);

                  (ii)     Commercial General Liability insurance against claims
         for personal injury, bodily injury, death or property damage occurring
         upon, in or about the Property, with such insurance (A) to be on the
         so-called "occurrence" form with a general aggregate limit of not less
         than $2,000,000 and a per occurrence limit of not less than $1,000,000;
         (B) to continue at not less than the aforesaid limit until required to
         be changed by Lender in writing by reason of changed economic
         conditions making such protection inadequate; and (C) to cover at least
         the following hazards: (1) premises and operations; (2) products and
         completed operations; (3) independent contractors; (4) blanket
         contractual liability; and (5) contractual liability covering the
         indemnities contained in Article 12 and Article 14 hereof to the extent
         the same is available;

                  (iii)    loss of rents insurance or business income insurance,
         as applicable, (A) with loss payable to Lender; (B) covering all risks
         required to be covered by the insurance provided for in subsection (i)
         above; and (C) which provides that after the physical loss to the
         Improvements and Personal Property occurs, the loss of rents or income,
         as applicable, will be insured until completion of Restoration or the
         expiration of

                                     - 69 -

<PAGE>

         twelve (12) months, whichever first occurs, and notwithstanding that
         the policy may expire prior to the end of such period; and (D) which
         contains an extended period of indemnity endorsement which provides
         that after the physical loss to the Improvements and Personal Property
         has been repaired, the continued loss of income will be insured until
         such income either returns to the same level it was at prior to the
         loss, or the expiration of twelve (12) months from the date that the
         Property is repaired or replaced and operations are resumed, whichever
         first occurs, and notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to
         the end of such period. The amount of such loss of rents or business
         income insurance, as applicable, shall be determined prior to the date
         hereof and at least once each year thereafter based on Borrower's
         reasonable estimate of the gross income from the Property for the
         succeeding period of coverage required above. All proceeds payable to
         Lender pursuant to this subsection shall be held by Lender and shall be
         applied to the obligations secured by the Loan Documents from time to
         time due and payable hereunder and under the Note; provided, however,
         that nothing herein contained shall be deemed to relieve Borrower of
         its obligations to pay the obligations secured by the Loan Documents on
         the respective dates of payment provided for in the Note, this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents except to the extent such
         amounts are actually paid out of the proceeds of such loss of rents or
         business income insurance, as applicable;

                  (iv)     at all times during which structural construction,
         repairs or alterations are being made with respect to the Improvements,
         and only if the Property coverage form does not otherwise apply, (A)
         owner's contingent or protective liability insurance covering claims
         not covered by or under the terms or provisions of the above mentioned
         commercial general liability insurance policy; and (B) the insurance
         provided for in subsection (i) above written in a so-called Builder's
         Risk Completed Value form (1) on a non-reporting basis, (2) against
         "all risks" insured against pursuant to subsection (i) above, (3)
         including permission to occupy the Property, and (4) with an agreed
         amount endorsement waiving co-insurance provisions;

                  (v)      workers' compensation, subject to the statutory
         limits of the State, and employer's liability insurance in respect of
         any work or operations on or about the Property, or in connection with
         the Property or its operation (if applicable);

                  (vi)     comprehensive boiler and machinery insurance, if
         applicable, in amounts as shall be reasonably required by Lender on
         terms consistent with the commercial property insurance policy required
         under subsection (i) above;

                  (vii)    excess liability insurance in an amount not less than
         $50,000,000 per occurrence on terms consistent with the commercial
         general liability insurance required under subsection (ii) above; and

                  (viii)   upon sixty (60) days' written notice, such other
         reasonable insurance and in such reasonable amounts as Lender from time
         to time may reasonably request against such other insurable hazards
         which at the time are commonly insured against for property similar to
         the Property located in or around the region in which the Property is
         located.

                                     - 70 -

<PAGE>

         (b)      All insurance provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall be obtained
under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or in the
singular, the "POLICY"), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to
insurance companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The
Policies shall be issued by financially sound and responsible insurance
companies authorized to do business in the State and having a claims paying
ability rating of either (1) "AA" or better by at least two Rating Agencies, one
of which must be S&P or such other Rating Agencies approved by Lender or (2) at
least A-/VII by A.M. Best Company, Inc. The Policies described in Section 8.1(a)
shall designate Lender and its successors and assigns as additional insureds,
mortgagees and/or loss payee as deemed appropriate by Lender. To the extent such
Policies are not available as of the Closing Date, Borrower shall deliver
certified copies of all Policies to Lender not later than thirty (30) days after
the Closing Date. Not less than ten (10) days prior to the expiration dates of
the Policies theretofore furnished to Lender, Borrower shall deliver to Lender
certificates evidencing renewal of the Policies (such certificates, the
"INSURANCE CERTIFICATES")accompanied by evidence satisfactory to Lender of
payment of the premiums due thereunder (the "INSURANCE PREMIUMS") and within
sixty (60) days after the expiration date of such Policies, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender renewal Policies

         (c)      Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to
the Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and
shall otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring
only the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(a).

         (d)      All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 8.1(a),
except for the Policy referenced in Section 8.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as
the insured, as its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage,
boiler and machinery, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called
New York standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing
that the loss thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

         (e)      All Policies provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall contain
clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

                  (i)      no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting
         for Borrower, or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply
         with the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a
         forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way
         affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as
         Lender is concerned;

                  (ii)     the Policies shall not be materially changed (other
         than to increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at
         least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lender and any other
         party named therein as an additional insured;

                  (iii)    the issuers thereof shall give written notice to
         Lender if the Policies have not been renewed thirty (30) days prior to
         its expiration; and

                  (iv)     Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums
         thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

                                     - 71 -

<PAGE>

         (f)      If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence
that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall
have the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Property, including, without
limitation, obtaining such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion
deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such
action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the Mortgage
and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

         SECTION 8.2. CASUALTY

         If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part in
any material respect, by fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"), Borrower shall
give prompt notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and
diligently prosecute the Restoration of the Property in accordance with Section
8.4, whether or not Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section
8.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or not such costs
are covered by insurance. Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Borrower shall adjust all claims for
Insurance Proceeds in consultation with, and approval of, Lender; provided,
however, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall
have the exclusive right to participate in the adjustment of all claims for
Insurance Proceeds.

         SECTION 8.3. CONDEMNATION

         Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of the Property of which
Borrower has knowledge and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers
served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including but not
limited to any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and
applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest
paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive
out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.
If the Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority,
Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the
Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 8.4, whether or not
Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section 8.4. If the Property
is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the
Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the
Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a
portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

         SECTION 8.4. RESTORATION

         The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration
of the Property:

         (a)      If the Net Proceeds shall be less than $250,000 and the costs
of completing the Restoration shall be less than $250,000, the Net Proceeds will
be disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers to
Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously commence and to satisfactorily
complete with due diligence the Restoration in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

         (b)      If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than $250,000 or
the costs of completing the Restoration are equal to or greater than $250,000,
Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.4. The term "NET PROCEEDS" for purposes of
this Section 8.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds
received by Lender pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (viii) as a
result of a Casualty, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("INSURANCE PROCEEDS"), or (ii) the net amount of the Award as a result
of a Condemnation, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS"), whichever the case may be.

                  (i)      The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower
         for Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                           (A) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be
                  continuing;

                           (B) (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are Insurance
                  Proceeds, less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the mobile
                  home and/or recreational vehicle pads, as applicable, on the
                  Property shall be rendered unusable for a period in excess of
                  twelve (12) months as a result of a Casualty or (2) in the
                  event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less than
                  fifteen percent (15%) of the rentable area of the Property and
                  fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market value of the Land
                  constituting the Property is taken, such land is located along
                  the perimeter or periphery of the Property, and no portion of
                  the permanent Improvements is located on such land;

                           (C) intentionally deleted;

                           (D) Borrower shall commence the Restoration as soon
                  as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than sixty
                  (60) days after such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the
                  case may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same to
                  satisfactory completion;

                           (E) Lender shall be satisfied that any operating
                  deficits, including all scheduled payments of principal and
                  interest under the Note, which will be incurred with respect
                  to the Property as a result of the occurrence of any such

<PAGE>

                  Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will be
                  covered out of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
                  8.1(a)(iii) above;

                           (F) Lender shall be satisfied that the Restoration
                  will be completed on or before the earliest to occur of (1)
                  six (6) months prior to the Maturity Date, (2) the earliest
                  date required for such completion under the terms of any Major
                  Leases, Ground Leases, if applicable, Operating Leases, if
                  applicable, or material agreements affecting the Property, (3)
                  such time as may be required under applicable zoning law,
                  ordinance, rule or regulation, or (4) the expiration of the
                  insurance coverage referred to in Section 8.1(a)(iii);

                           (G) the Property and the use thereof after the
                  Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under all
                  Legal Requirements;

                           (H) the Restoration shall be done and completed by
                  Borrower in an expeditious and diligent fashion and in
                  compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements;

                           (I) such Casualty or Condemnation, as applicable,
                  does not result in the loss of access to the Property or the
                  Improvements;

                           (J) Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be delivered,
                  to Lender a signed detailed budget approved in writing by
                  Borrower's architect or engineer stating the entire cost of
                  completing the Restoration, which budget shall be reasonably
                  acceptable to Lender; and

                           (K) the Net Proceeds together with any cash or cash
                  equivalent deposited by Borrower with Lender are sufficient in
                  Lender's reasonable judgment to cover the cost of the
                  Restoration.

                  (ii)     The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender until
         disbursements commence, and, until disbursed in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 8.4, shall constitute additional security
         for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net
         Proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower
         on a monthly basis during the course of the Restoration in accordance
         with customary construction lending practices, upon receipt of evidence
         satisfactory to Lender that (A) all the conditions precedent to such
         advance, including those set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i), have been
         satisfied, (B) all materials installed and work and labor performed
         (except to the extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested
         disbursement) in connection with the related Restoration item have been
         paid for in full, and (C) there exist no notices of pendency, stop
         orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices of intention to
         file same, or any other liens or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever
         on the Property which have not either been fully bonded to the
         satisfaction of Lender and discharged of record or in the alternative
         fully insured to the satisfaction of Lender by the title company
         issuing the Title Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
         Insurance Proceeds from the Policies required to be maintained by
         Borrower pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii) shall be controlled by Lender
         at all times, shall not be subject to the provisions of this

                                     - 74 -

<PAGE>

         Section 8.4 and shall be used for the payment of all of the obligations
         due and payable under the Loan Documents for the entire time period for
         which any such Insurance Proceeds relate. After such application of the
         Insurance Proceeds, the remaining balance, if any, of any such proceeds
         shall be disbursed and/or applied as follows: (A) provided no Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing, to Borrower and (B) upon the
         occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to
         Operating Expenses.

                  (iii)    All plans and specifications required in connection
         with the Restoration shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in
         all respects by Lender and to the extent the Restoration relates to any
         permanent Improvements on the Property, by an independent consulting
         engineer selected by Lender (the "Restoration Consultant"). Lender
         shall have the use of the plans and specifications and all permits,
         licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with the
         Restoration. To the extent the Restoration relates to any permanent
         Improvements on the Property, the identity of the contractors,
         subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as
         the contracts in excess of $100,000 under which they have been engaged,
         shall be subject to prior review and acceptance by Lender and the
         Restoration Consultant. All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in
         connection with making the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration,
         including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
         disbursements and the Restoration Consultant's fees, shall be paid by
         Borrower.

                  (iv)     In no event shall Lender be obligated to make
         disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the
         costs actually incurred from time to time for work in place as part of
         the Restoration, as certified by the Restoration Consultant, minus the
         Restoration Retainage. The term "Restoration Retainage" shall mean an
         amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for
         work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the
         Restoration Consultant, until the Restoration has been completed. The
         Restoration Retainage shall be reduced to five percent (5%) of the
         costs incurred upon receipt by Lender of satisfactory evidence that
         fifty percent (50%) of the Restoration has been completed. The
         Restoration Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything
         to the contrary set forth above in this Section 8.4(b), be less than
         the amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors,
         subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The
         Restoration Retainage shall not be released until the Restoration
         Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed
         in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b) and that all
         approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the Property have
         been obtained from all appropriate Governmental Authorities, and Lender
         receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the
         Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the
         Restoration Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release the
         portion of the Restoration Retainage being held with respect to any
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as
         of the date upon which the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender
         that the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily
         completed all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with
         the provisions of the contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's
         contract, the contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the
         lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested
         by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy,
         and

                                     - 75 -

<PAGE>

         Lender receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy insuring
         the continued priority of the lien of the Mortgage and evidence of
         payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. If required by
         Lender, the release of any such portion of the Restoration Retainage
         shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has issued a
         payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor,
         subcontractor or materialman.

                  (v)      Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements
         of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

                  (vi)     If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed
         balance thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in
         consultation with the Restoration Consultant, as applicable, be
         sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are estimated
         to be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration,
         Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency")
         with Lender before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall
         be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be
         held by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in
         connection with the Restoration on the same conditions applicable to
         the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant
         to this Section 8.4(b) shall constitute additional security for the
         Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (vii)    The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the
         remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited
         with Lender after Borrower and the Restoration Consultant, to the
         extent applicable, certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
         completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b), and
         the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs
         incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full,
         shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default
         shall have occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this
         Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

         (c)      All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 8.4(b)(vii) may (x) be retained and applied by Lender toward the
payment of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority
and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, (y) at
the sole discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part,
to Borrower for such purposes and upon such conditions as Lender shall
designate.

         (d)      In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage, or other transfer
of title to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt, all
right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies then in force
concerning the Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest
in the purchaser at such foreclosure, Lender or other transferee in the event of
such other transfer of title.

                                 RESERVE FUNDS

         SECTION 9.1. REQUIRED REPAIRS

         (a)      Borrower shall make the repairs and improvements to the
Property set forth on Schedule 2 and as more particularly described in the
Physical Conditions Report prepared in connection with the closing of the Loan
(such repairs hereinafter referred to as "REQUIRED REPAIRS"). Borrower shall
complete the Required Repairs in a good and workmanlike manner on or before the
date that is twelve (12) months from the date hereof or within such other time
frame for completion specifically set forth on Schedule 2.

         SECTION 9.2. REPLACEMENTS

         (a)      On an ongoing basis throughout the term of the Loan, Borrower
shall make capital repairs, replacements and improvements necessary to keep the
Property in good order and repair and in a good marketable condition or prevent
deterioration of the Property ("REPLACEMENTS"). Borrower shall complete all
Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as soon as commercially reasonable
after commencing to make each such Replacement.

         (b)      Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible
Account with Lender or Lender's agent to fund the Replacements (the "REPLACEMENT
RESERVE ACCOUNT"). In addition, Borrower shall deposit $4.17 monthly per pad
(the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE MONTHLY DEPOSIT") into the Replacement Reserve Account
on each Scheduled Payment Date during any Replacement Reserve Period. Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as "REPLACEMENT RESERVE FUNDS."

         SECTION 9.3. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION 9.4. REQUIRED WORK.

         Borrower shall diligently pursue all Required Repairs and Replacements
(collectively, the "REQUIRED WORK") to completion in accordance with the
following requirements:

         (a)      Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all
contracts or work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors,
contractors or other parties providing labor or materials in connection with the
Required Work to the extent such contracts or work orders exceed $100,000. Upon
Lender's request, Borrower shall assign any contract or subcontract to Lender.

         (b)      In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion
that any Required Work is not being or has not been performed in a workmanlike
or timely manner, upon ten (10) days notice to Borrower and Borrower's failure
to commence performance of such Required Work in accordance with this Section
9.4, Lender shall have the option to withhold disbursement for such
unsatisfactory Required Work and to proceed under existing contracts or to
contract with third parties to complete such Required Work and to apply
Replacement Reserve Funds, if any, toward the labor and materials necessary to
complete such Required Work, without

                                     - 77 -

<PAGE>

providing any prior notice to Borrower and to exercise any and all other
remedies available to Lender upon an Event of Default hereunder.

         (c)      In order to facilitate Lender's completion of the Required
Work, as permitted in subsection 9.4(b) above, Borrower grants Lender the right
to enter onto the Property and perform any and all work and labor necessary to
complete the Required Work and/or employ watchmen to protect the Property from
damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the extent not from the Reserve
Funds, shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower and
secured by the Mortgage. For this purpose Borrower constitutes and appoints
Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to
complete or undertake the Required Work in the name of Borrower upon Borrower's
failure to do so in a workmanlike and timely manner. Such power of attorney
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any of the
Reserve Funds for the purpose of making or completing the Required Work; (ii) to
make such additions, changes and corrections to the Required Work as shall be
reasonably necessary to complete the Required Work; (iii) to employ such
contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as shall be
required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills
and claims which are or may become Liens against the Property, or as may be
reasonably necessary for the completion of the Required Work, or for clearance
of title; (v) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of
Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to
prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Property
or the rehabilitation and repair of the Property; and (vii) to do any and every
act which Borrower would be required to do on its own behalf to fulfill the
terms of this Agreement.

         (d)      Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall: (i) make Lender responsible
for making or completing the Required Work; (ii) require Lender to expend funds
in addition to the Reserve Funds to make or complete any Required Work; (iii)
obligate Lender to proceed with the Required Work; or (iv) obligate Lender to
demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Required Work.

         (e)      Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or
inspector) or third parties performing Required Work pursuant to this Section
9.4 to enter onto the Property during normal business hours (subject to the
rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any Required
Work and all materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all plans
and shop drawings relating to such Required Work which are or may be kept at the
Property, and to complete any Required Work made pursuant to this Section 9.4.
Borrower shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender
and Lender's representatives or such other persons described above in connection
with inspections described in this Section 9.4 or the completion of Required
Work pursuant to this Section 9.4.

         (f)      Lender may, to the extent any Required Work would reasonably
require an inspection of the Property, inspect the Property at Borrower's
expense prior to making a disbursement of the Reserve Funds in order to verify
completion of the Required Work for which reimbursement is sought. Borrower
shall pay Lender a reasonable inspection fee not exceeding $500 for each such
inspection. Lender may require that such inspection be conducted by an

                                     - 78 -

<PAGE>

appropriate independent qualified professional selected by Lender and/or may
require a copy of a certificate of completion by an independent qualified
professional acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of the Reserve
Funds. Borrower shall pay the expense of the inspection as required hereunder,
whether such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified
professional.

         (g)      The Required Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or
any other item comprising a part of any Required Work shall be constructed,
installed or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's,
materialman's or other Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (h)      Before each disbursement of the Reserve Funds, if any, Lender
may require Borrower to provide Lender with a search of title to the Property
effective to the date of the disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's
or materialmen's or other Liens of any nature have been placed against the
Property since the date of recordation of the Mortgage and that title to the
Property is free and clear of all Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (i)      All Required Work shall comply with all Legal Requirements in
all material respects and applicable insurance requirements including, without
limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits, environmental
regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

         (j)      Borrower hereby assigns to Lender all rights and claims
Borrower may have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in connection
with the Required Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such
rights or claims unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

         SECTION 9.5. RELEASE OF RESERVE FUNDS

         (a)      Upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of the
requirements set forth in this Agreement, Lender shall disburse to Borrower
amounts, if any, from the Replacement Reserve Account to the extent necessary to
reimburse Borrower for the actual costs of any approved Replacements.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall Lender be required to
(x) disburse funds from any of the Reserve Accounts if an Event of Default
exists or (y) disburse funds (if any) from the Replacement Reserve Account to
reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine repairs or maintenance to the
Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from funds held in any other
Reserve Account.

         (b)      Each request for disbursement from any of the Reserve Accounts
shall be on a form provided or approved by Lender and shall (i) include copies
of invoices for all items or materials purchased and all labor or services
provided and (ii) specify (A) the Required Work for which the disbursement is
requested, (B) the quantity and price of each item purchased, if the Required
Work includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (C) the price of
all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any Required Work other than
the purchase or replacement of specific items, and (D) the cost of all
contracted labor or other services applicable to each Required Work for which
such request for disbursement is made. With each request Borrower shall certify
that all Required Work has been performed in accordance with all Legal

                                     - 79 -

<PAGE>

Requirements. Except as provided in Section 9.5(d), each request for
disbursement shall be made only after completion of the Replacement (or the
portion thereof completed in accordance with Section 9.5(d)) for which
disbursement is requested. Borrower shall provide Lender evidence satisfactory
to Lender in its reasonable judgment of such completion or performance.

         (c)      Upon Borrower's request, Lender shall disburse funds from the
Replacement Reserve Account to Borrower on a monthly basis, and Borrower shall
use such funds to pay all invoices in connection with the Required Work with
respect to which a disbursement is requested. In addition, as a condition to any
disbursement, Lender may require Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor who receives
payment in an amount equal to or greater than $10,000 for completion of its work
or delivery of its materials. Any lien waiver delivered hereunder shall conform
to all Legal Requirements and shall cover all work performed and materials
supplied (including equipment and fixtures) for the Property by that contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialman through the date covered by the
current disbursement request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor,
supplier, subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint check,
the release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by the previous
release of funds request).

         (d)      If (i) the cost of any item of Required Work exceeds $25,000
and (ii) the contractor performing such Required Work requires periodic payments
pursuant to terms of a written contract, a request for disbursement from the
Reserve Accounts may be made after completion of a portion of the work under
such contract, provided (A) such contract requires payment upon completion of
such portion of work, (B) the materials for which the request is made are on
site at the Property and are properly secured or have been installed in the
Property, (C) all other conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been
satisfied, and (D) in the case of a Replacement, funds remaining in the
Replacement Reserve Account are, in Lender's judgment, sufficient to complete
such Replacement and other Replacements when required.

         (e)      Borrower shall not make a request for, nor shall Lender have
any obligation to make, any disbursement from any Reserve Account more
frequently than once in any calendar month and (except in connection with the
final disbursement) in any amount less than the lesser of (i) $10,000 or (ii)
the total cost of the Required Work for which the disbursement is requested.

         (f)      Intentionally deleted.

         (g)      Intentionally deleted.

         (h)      Lender's disbursement of any Reserve Funds or other
acknowledgment of completion of any Required Work in a manner satisfactory to
Lender shall not be deemed a certification or warranty by Lender to any Person
that the Required Work has been completed in accordance with Legal Requirements.

         (i)      If the funds in any Reserve Account should exceed the amount
of payments actually applied by Lender for the purposes of the account, Lender
in its sole discretion shall either return any excess to Borrower or credit such
excess against future payments to be made to

                                     - 80 -

<PAGE>

that Reserve Account. In allocating any such excess, Lender may deal with the
Person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the Property.

         (j)      The insufficiency of any balance in any of the Reserve
Accounts shall not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all
preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

         (k)      INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         (l)      Upon termination of the Replacement Reserve Period or payment
in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on deposit, if any, in the
Replacement Reserve Account shall be returned to Borrower or the Person shown on
Lender's records as being the owner of the Property and no other party shall
have any right or claim thereto.

         SECTION 9.6. TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS

         Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent sufficient to discharge Borrower's obligations for the
payment of Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1
hereof (the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Borrower shall deposit into
the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account on each Scheduled Payment Date during any
Tax and Insurance Reserve Period (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender
estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months or such
higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all
such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to the earlier of (i) the date that
the same will become delinquent and (ii) the date that additional charges or
interest will accrue due to the non-payment thereof, and (b) except to the
extent Lender has waived the insurance escrow because the insurance required
hereunder is maintained under a blanket insurance Policy acceptable to Lender in
accordance with Section 8.1(c), one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that
Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months for
the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof
or such higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to
pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called
the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS"). Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance
Reserve Funds to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by
Borrower pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof. In making any
disbursement from the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account, Lender may do so
according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate
public office or tax lien service (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent
(with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such
bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale,
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount of the Tax and
Insurance Reserve Funds shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance
Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof, Lender shall, in its
sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against
future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account. In
allocating any such excess, Lender may deal with the person shown on Lender's
records as being the owner of the Property. Any amount remaining in the Tax and
Insurance Reserve Account after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned
to Borrower or the person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the
Property and no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. If at any
time Lender

                                     - 81 -

<PAGE>

reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds are not or will
not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates set forth in
(a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such determination and
Borrower shall pay to Lender any amount necessary to make up the deficiency
within ten (10) days after notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment
thereof.

         SECTION 9.7. EXCESS CASH

         Borrower shall establish on the date hereof a sub-account of the Cash
Management Account into which Borrower shall deposit all Excess Cash on each
Scheduled Payment Date during any Cash Management Period (the "EXCESS CASH
RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"EXCESS CASH RESERVE FUNDS." Sums from the Excess Cash Reserve Account shall be
disbursed to Borrower's Account upon the discontinuation of a Cash Management
Period.

         SECTION 9.8. TERRORISM RESERVE.

         Upon the occurrence of an Act of Terror (i) Borrower shall establish an
Eligible Account with Lender or Lender's agent (the "TERRORISM RESERVE ACCOUNT")
and (ii) Borrower Principal shall immediately deposit into the Terrorism Reserve
Account an amount equal to the sum of the three (3) Monthly Payment Amounts that
would be payable by Borrower for the three (3) Scheduled Payment Dates
immediately following the occurrence of such Act of Terror. Amounts so deposited
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "TERRORISM RESERVE FUNDS". "ACT OF
TERROR" shall mean any foreign acts of terrorism or similar acts of sabotage
(excluding acts of war or nuclear, chemical and biological acts) in which the
Property is directly affected by such acts. Lender shall apply Terrorism Reserve
Funds, if any, to any amounts due hereunder.

         SECTION 9.9. RESERVE FUNDS GENERALLY

         (a)      Funds on deposit in the Reserve Accounts shall be held by
Lender or any Loan servicer, as applicable, and invested in Permitted
Investments as directed by Lender, and interest shall be credited to Borrower.
All such interest shall be and become part of the applicable Reserve Accounts
and shall be disbursed in accordance with Section 9.5 above, provided, however,
that Lender may, at its election, retain any such interest for its own account
for application to the Debt in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default. Borrower
agrees that it shall include all interest on the applicable Reserve Funds as the
income of Borrower (and, if Borrower is a partnership or other pass-through
entity, the partners, members or beneficiaries of Borrower, as the case may be),
and shall be the owner of the applicable Reserve Funds for federal and
applicable state and local tax purposes.

         (b)      Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security
interest in, and assigns and pledges to Lender, each of the Reserve Accounts and
any and all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts as
additional security for payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in
accordance herewith, the Reserve Accounts and the Reserve Funds shall constitute
additional security for the Debt. The provisions of this Section 9.9 are
intended

                                     - 82 -

<PAGE>

to give Lender or any subsequent holder of the Loan "control" of the Reserve
Accounts within the meaning of the UCC.

         (c)      The Reserve Accounts and any and all Reserve Funds now or
hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts shall be subject to the exclusive
dominion and control of Lender, which shall hold the Reserve Accounts and any or
all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Borrower shall have no right of
withdrawal from the Reserve Accounts or any other right or power with respect to
the Reserve Accounts or any or all of the Reserve Funds now or hereafter
deposited in the Reserve Accounts, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement.

         (d)      Lender shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Borrower,
without charge, an annual accounting of each Reserve Account in the normal
format of Lender or its loan servicer, showing credits and debits to such
Reserve Account and the purpose for which each debit to each Reserve Account was
made.

         (e)      As long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Lender shall make disbursements from the Reserve Accounts in accordance with
this Agreement. All such disbursements shall be deemed to have been expressly
pre-authorized by Borrower, and shall not be deemed to constitute the exercise
by Lender of any remedies against Borrower unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and Lender has expressly stated in writing its intent
to proceed to exercise its remedies as a secured party, pledgee or lienholder
with respect to the Reserve Accounts.

         (f)      If any Event of Default occurs, Borrower shall immediately
lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve Accounts until
the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured to
Lender's satisfaction, or (ii) the payment in full of the Debt. In addition, at
Lender's election, Borrower shall lose all of its rights to receive interest on
the Reserve Accounts during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured party,
pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Reserve Accounts. Without limitation
of the foregoing, during the continuance of any Event of Default, Lender may use
and disburse the Reserve Funds (or any portion thereof) for any of the following
purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited to, principal
prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or partial
prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses, fees,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other
Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item from any of the Reserve Accounts as
required or permitted under this Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted
by applicable law; provided, however, that any such application of funds shall
not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default. Without limiting any other
provisions hereof, each of the remedial actions described in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable exercise of
Lender's rights and remedies as a secured party with respect to the Reserve
Funds and shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a
foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve Funds to effect a
cure

                                     - 83 -

<PAGE>

of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt, or in any specific order of
priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's rights and remedies under this
Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents shall not in any way
prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate and complete a foreclosure under
the Mortgage.

         (g)      The Reserve Funds shall not constitute escrow or trust funds
and may be commingled with other monies held by Lender. Notwithstanding anything
else herein to the contrary, Lender may commingle in one or more Eligible
Accounts any and all funds controlled by Lender, including, without limitation,
funds pledged in favor of Lender by other borrowers, whether for the same
purposes as the Reserve Accounts or otherwise. Without limiting any other
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Reserve Accounts
may be established and held in such name or names as Lender or its loan
servicer, as agent for Lender, shall deem appropriate, including, without
limitation, in the name of Lender or such loan servicer as agent for Lender. In
the case of any Reserve Account which is held in a commingled account, Lender or
its loan servicer, as applicable, shall maintain records sufficient to enable it
to determine at all times which portion of such account is related to the Loan.
The Reserve Accounts are solely for the protection of Lender. With respect to
the Reserve Accounts, Lender shall have no responsibility beyond the allowance
of due credit for the sums actually received by Lender or beyond the
reimbursement or payment of the costs and expenses for which such accounts were
established in accordance with their terms. Upon assignment of the Loan by
Lender, any Reserve Funds shall be turned over to the assignee and any
responsibility of Lender as assignor shall terminate. The requirements of this
Agreement concerning Reserve Accounts in no way supersede, limit or waive any
other rights or obligations of the parties under any of the Loan Documents or
under applicable law.

         (h)      Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written
consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the
Reserve Accounts or the Reserve Funds deposited therein or permit any Lien to
attach thereto, except for the security interest granted in this Section 9.9, or
any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC Financing Statements, except those
naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

         (i)      Borrower will maintain the security interest created by this
Section 9.9 as a first priority perfected security interest and will defend the
right, title and interest of Lender in and to the Reserve Accounts and the
Reserve Funds against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. At any
time and from time to time, upon the written request of Lender, and at the sole
expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and duly execute and deliver such
further instruments and documents and will take such further actions as Lender
reasonably may request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                CASH MANAGEMENT

         SECTION 10.1. LOCKBOX ACCOUNT AND CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT

         (a)      Borrower acknowledges and confirms that Borrower has
established, and Borrower covenants that it shall maintain, (i) pursuant to the
Lockbox Agreement, an Eligible

                                     - 84 -

<PAGE>

Account into which Borrower shall, and shall cause Manager to, deposit or cause
to be deposited, all Rents and other revenue from the Property (such account,
all funds at any time on deposit therein and any proceeds, replacements or
substitutions of such account or funds therein, are referred to herein as the
"LOCKBOX ACCOUNT"), and (ii) an Eligible Account with Lender or any Loan
servicer, as applicable, into which funds in the Lockbox Account shall be
transferred pursuant to the terms of Section 10.2(b) hereof (such account, the
sub-accounts thereof, all funds at any time on deposit therein and any proceeds,
replacements or substitutions of such account or funds therein, are referred to
herein as the "CASH MANAGEMENT Account").

         (b)      The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall each be
in the name of Borrower for the benefit of Lender, as secured party, provided
that Borrower shall be the owner of all funds on deposit in such accounts for
federal and applicable state and local tax purposes. Sums on deposit in the Cash
Management Account shall not be invested except in such Permitted Investments as
determined and directed by Lender and all income earned thereon shall be the
income of Borrower and be applied to and become part of the Cash Management
Account, to be disbursed in accordance with this Article 10. Neither Lockbox
Bank nor Lender shall have any liability for any loss resulting from the
investment of funds in Permitted Investments in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

         (c)      The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall be
subject to the exclusive dominion and control of Lender and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other party
claiming on behalf of, or through, Borrower or Manager, shall have any right of
withdrawal therefrom or any other right or power with respect thereto.

         (d)      Borrower agrees to pay the customary fees and expenses of
Lockbox Bank (incurred in connection with maintaining the Lockbox Account) and
Lender (incurred in connection with maintaining the Cash Management Account) and
any successors thereto in connection therewith, as separately agreed by them
from time to time.

         (e)      Lender shall be responsible for the performance only of such
duties with respect to the Cash Management Account as are specifically set forth
herein, and no duty shall be implied from any provision hereof. Lender shall not
be under any obligation or duty to perform any act which would involve it in
expense or liability or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof, or to
advance any of its own monies. Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender and its
directors, employees, officers and agents harmless from and against any loss,
cost or damage (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by such parties in connection with the Cash Management
Account other than such as result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Lender or intentional nonperformance by Lender of its obligations
under this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.2. DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS

         (a)      Borrower represents, warrants and covenants that:

                  (i)      Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
         Borrower shall notify and advise Manager to deposit directly into the
         Lockbox Account all payments of Rents

                                     - 85 -

<PAGE>

         or any other item payable under such Leases pursuant to an instruction
         letter in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (a "RENT DIRECTION
         LETTER"). If Borrower fails to provide any such notice (and without
         prejudice to Lender's rights with respect to such default), Lender
         shall have the right, and Borrower hereby grants to Lender a power of
         attorney (which power of attorney shall be coupled with an interest and
         irrevocable so long as any portion of the Debt remains outstanding), to
         sign and deliver a Rent Direction Letter;

                  (ii)     Borrower shall, and shall cause Manager to, instruct
         all Persons that maintain open accounts with Borrower or Manager with
         respect to the Property or with whom Borrower or Manager does business
         on an "accounts receivable" basis with respect to the Property to
         deliver all payments due under such accounts to the Lockbox Account.
         Neither Borrower nor Manager shall direct any such Person to make
         payments due under such accounts in any other manner;

                  (iii)    All Rents or other income from the Property shall (A)
         be deemed additional security for payment of the Debt and shall be held
         in trust for the benefit, and as the property, of Lender, (B) not be
         commingled with any other funds or property of Borrower or Manager, and
         (C) if received by Borrower notwithstanding the delivery of a Rent
         Direction Letter, be deposited in the Lockbox Account within one (1)
         Business Day of receipt;

                  (iv)     Without the prior written consent of Lender, so long
         as any portion of the Debt remains outstanding, Borrower shall not
         terminate, amend, revoke or modify any Rent Direction Letter in any
         manner whatsoever or direct or cause Manager to pay any amount in any
         manner other than as provided in the Rent Direction Letter; and

                  (v)      So long as any portion of the Debt remains
         outstanding, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other Person shall open
         or maintain any accounts other than the Lockbox Account into which
         revenues from the ownership and operation of the Property are
         deposited. The foregoing shall not prohibit Borrower from utilizing one
         or more separate accounts for the disbursement or retention of funds
         that have been transferred to Borrower pursuant to the express terms of
         this Agreement.

         (b)      Provided no Event of Default has occurred, at all times other
than during a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall, on each Business Day,
withdraw all collected and available funds in excess of $2,500 (funds are not
available if, in the reasonable determination of Lockbox Bank, such funds are
subject to a bank hold or freeze (pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements),
dispute or legal process preventing their withdrawal) held in the Lockbox
Account and disburse such funds to the Borrower Account. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall (and
Lender shall instruct Lockbox Bank to), on each Business Day, withdraw all
collected and available funds (funds are not available if, in the reasonable
determination of Lockbox Bank, such funds are subject to a bank hold or freeze
(pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements), dispute or legal process preventing
their withdrawal) held in the Lockbox Account and transfer by wire transfer or
other method of transfer mutually agreeable to Lockbox Bank and Lender to the
Cash Management Account to be held until disbursed by Lender pursuant to Section
10.2(c). Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the
earlier to occur of (a) payment in full of the

                                     - 86 -

<PAGE>

Debt or (b) the discontinuation of a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall
no longer transfer funds in the Lockbox Account to the Cash Management Account
in accordance with this subsection (b) and shall transfer funds (if any) in the
Lockbox Account to the Borrower Account or, upon payment in full of the Debt, as
otherwise directed by Borrower. In the event a Cash Management Period occurs
three times during the term of the Loan and if required by the Lockbox Bank,
Borrower shall not be entitled to any rights to the withdrawal of funds from the
Lockbox Account during the remaining term of the Loan, the Cash Management
Period shall continue, and Lender shall continue to have the right to the
withdrawal of funds from the Lockbox Account until the Debt is paid in full.

         (c)      During a Cash Management Period, on each Scheduled Payment
Date (and if such day is not a Business Day, then the immediately preceding day
which is a Business Day) commencing the month immediately following the month
during which the Cash Management Period commences, Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes Lender to withdraw or allocate to the sub-accounts of the Cash
Management Account, as the case may be, amounts received in the Cash Management
Account, in each case to the extent that sufficient funds remain therefor and
Lender may, at its option, withdraw or allocate such funds as follows:

                  (i)      during a Tax and Insurance Reserve Period, funds
         sufficient to pay the monthly deposits to the Tax and Insurance Reserve
         Account shall be allocated to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account to
         be held and disbursed in accordance with Section 9.6;

                  (ii)     funds sufficient to pay the Monthly Payment Amount
         (or an amount up to the entire amount of the Debt upon an acceleration
         of the Loan in accordance with the terms hereof), shall be withdrawn
         and paid to Lender;

                  (iii)    during a Replacement Reserve Period, funds sufficient
         to pay the Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit shall be allocated to
         the Replacement Reserve Account to be held and disbursed in accordance
         with Section 9.5;

                  (iv)     funds sufficient to pay any interest accruing at the
         Default Rate, late payment charges, if any, and any other sums due and
         payable to Lender under any of the Loan Documents, shall be withdrawn
         and paid to Lender and applied against such items;

                  (v)      funds sufficient to pay Lockbox Bank for all costs
         and expenses incurred by Lockbox Bank in connection with the
         maintenance and administration of the Lockbox Account;

                  (vi)     funds sufficient to pay Lender or any Loan servicer,
         as applicable, the customary fees and expenses incurred in connection
         with maintaining the Cash Management Account; and

                  (vii)    funds in an amount equal to the balance (if any)
         remaining on deposit in the Cash Management Account after the foregoing
         withdrawals and allocations shall be deposited in the Excess Cash
         Reserve Account to be held and disbursed in accordance with Section
         9.7. Upon the discontinuance of a Cash Management Period, funds (if
         any) on deposit in the Excess Cash Reserve Account shall be transferred
         to Borrower's Account.

                                     - 87 -

<PAGE>

         (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Borrower
acknowledges that Borrower is responsible for monitoring the sufficiency of
funds deposited in the Cash Management Account and that Borrower is liable for
any deficiency in available funds, irrespective of whether Borrower has received
any account statement, notice or demand from Lender or Lender's servicer. If the
amount on deposit in the Cash Management Account is insufficient to make all of
the withdrawals and allocations described in Section 10.2(c)(i) through (vi)
above, Borrower shall deposit such deficiency into the Cash Management Account
within five (5) days (provided that such five day period shall not constitute a
grace period for any default or Event of Default under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document based on a failure to satisfy any monetary obligation
provided in any Loan Document).

         (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower hereby
irrevocably authorizes Lender to make any and all withdrawals from the Lockbox
Account and Cash Management Account and transfers between any of the Reserve
Accounts as Lender shall determine in Lender's sole and absolute discretion and
Lender may use all funds contained in any such accounts for any purpose,
including but not limited to repayment of the Debt in such order, proportion and
priority as Lender may determine in its sole and absolute discretion. Lender's
right to withdraw and apply funds as stated herein shall be in addition to all
other rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement, the Note, the
Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 10.3. SECURITY INTEREST

         (a)      To secure the full and punctual payment of the Debt and
performance of all obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a
first-priority perfected security interest in the Lockbox Account and Cash
Management Account, all interest, cash, checks, drafts, certificates and
instruments, if any, from time to time deposited or held therein, any and all
amounts invested in Permitted Investments, and all "proceeds" (as defined in the
UCC as in effect in the state in which the Lockbox Account and Cash Management
Account are located or maintained) of any or all of the foregoing. Furthermore,
Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender,
further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any of the foregoing or
permit any Lien to attach thereto or any levy to be made thereon or any UCC
Financing Statements to be filed with respect thereto. Borrower will maintain
the security interest created by this Section 10.3(a) as a first priority
perfected security interest and will defend the right, title and interest of
Lender in and to the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account against the
claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever.

         (b)      Borrower authorizes Lender to file any financing statement or
statements required by Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection
and priority of the security interest granted herein in connection with the
Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account. Borrower agrees that at any time
and from time to time, at the expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and
duly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all
further action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that Lender may
reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any security interest
granted or purported to be granted hereby (including, without limitation, any
security interest in and to any Permitted Investments) or to enable Lender to
exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder.

                                     - 88 -

<PAGE>

         (c)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured
party, pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Lockbox Account and Cash
Management Account. Without limitation of the foregoing, upon any Event of
Default, Lender may use the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account for any
of the following purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited
to, principal prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or
partial prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses,
fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other

         (i)      cooperate with and assist Lender in obtaining ratings of the

cost and expense and within fifteen (15) Business Days of Lender's request
therefore, (1) opinions relating to certain aspects of federal and Delaware law
and Borrower's status as a single member Delaware limited liability company

a law firm acceptable to such Rating Agency and shall otherwise be in form and
substance acceptable to such Rating Agency. Lender hereby acknowledges that
Borrower may deliver such opinions in one consolidated opinion that, together
with the Loan, addresses other Loans (made by Lender) relating to Affiliates of
Borrower, provided that such opinion adequately identifies Borrower, the
Property and other applicable matters relating to the Loan. In addition,
Borrower shall make any changes to its organizational documents to the extent
required in connection with the issuance of such opinions, provided that such
changes shall not result in an adverse economic effect to Borrower.

         All reasonable third party costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in
connection with Borrower's complying with requests made under this Section 13.4
shall be paid by Borrower. Lender shall be responsible for all of its
out-of-pocket costs in connection with a securitization.

         In the event that Borrower requests any consent or approval hereunder
and the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Documents require the receipt
of written confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to the rating on
the Securities, or, in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents
relating to a Securitization, such a rating confirmation is required in order
for the consent of Lender to be given, Borrower shall pay all of the costs and
expenses of Lender, Lender's servicer and each Rating Agency in connection
therewith, and, if applicable, shall pay any fees imposed by any Rating Agency
as a condition to the delivery of such confirmation. Lender agrees, upon
request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower and
to facilitate Borrower's efforts to obtain any such rating confirmation as
required hereunder, which cooperation shall include supplying the Rating
Agencies with copies of reports, documents and other information and materials
provided to Lender by Borrower, provided however, that in no event shall (1)
Lender be required to incur any costs or expenses (other than de minimus costs
or expenses) in connection with such cooperation or (2) Lender's agreement

SECTION 13.5. SECURITIZATION INDEMNIFICATION

         (a)      Borrower understands that certain of the Provided Information
may be included in disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization,
including, without limitation, a prospectus, prospectus supplement, offering
memorandum or private placement memorandum (each, a "DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT") and
may also be included in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or provided or made
available to investors or prospective investors in the Securities, the Rating
Agencies, and service providers relating to the Securitization. In the event
that the Disclosure Document is required to be revised prior to the sale of all
Securities, Borrower will cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the
Disclosure Document by providing all current information required to be
delivered by Borrower under Article 5 hereof necessary to keep the Disclosure
Document accurate and complete in all material respects.

         (b)      Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each of (i) a
preliminary and a final offering memorandum or private placement memorandum or
similar document (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or
presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or (ii) a preliminary
and final prospectus or prospectus supplement, as applicable, an indemnification
certificate (A) indemnifying Lender (and for purposes of this Section 13.5,
Lender hereunder shall include its officers and directors) and the Affiliate of
Lender that (i) has filed the registration statement, if any, relating to the
Securitization and/or (ii) which is acting as issuer, depositor, sponsor and/or
a similar capacity with respect to the Securitization (any Person described in

Person, and each Person or entity who controls any Issuer Person within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "ISSUER GROUP") for any Losses to which Lender or the Issuer
Group may become subject insofar as the Losses arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained
in such sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or
presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated in such sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency
"term sheets" or presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or
necessary in order to make the statements in such sections (including any
Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Property and/or the Loan) or in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading (collectively the "SECURITIES LIABILITIES") and (B)
agreeing to reimburse Lender and the Issuer Group for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by Lender and Issuer Group in connection with
investigating or defending the Securities Liabilities; provided, however, that
Borrower will be liable in any such case under clauses (A) or (B) above only to
the extent that any such Securities Liabilities arise out of or is based upon
any such untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished to Lender or any member of the Issuer
Group by or on behalf of Borrower in connection with the Provided Information.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Borrower may
otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification provided for in Clauses (A) and
(B) above shall be effective in the

                                     - 99 -

<PAGE>

event an indemnification certificate certifying that Borrower has carefully
examined any preliminary or a final offering memorandum described above or
prospectus or other document (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term
sheets" or presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan), as
applicable, including without limitation, the sections entitled "Special
Considerations," and/or "Risk Factors," and "Certain Legal Aspects of the
Mortgage Loan," or similar sections, and all sections relating to Borrower,
Borrower Principal, Manager, their Affiliates, the Loan, the Loan Documents and
the Property, and any risks or special considerations relating thereto, and
that, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, such sections (and any other sections
reasonably requested) do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading has
been requested by Lender and has not been provided by Borrower and shall be
applicable based on information previously provided by Borrower or its
Affiliates if Borrower does not provide such requested indemnification
certificate.

         (c)      In connection with filings under the Exchange Act or any
information provided to holders of Securities on an ongoing basis, Borrower
agrees to indemnify (i) Lender and the Issuer Group for Losses to which Lender
or the Issuer Group may become subject insofar as the Securities Liabilities
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in the
Provided Information a material fact required to be stated in the Provided
Information in order to make the statements in the Provided Information, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading and (ii)
reimburse Lender or the Issuer Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by Lender or the Issuer Group in connection with defending or
investigating the Securities Liabilities.

         (d)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 13.5 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 13.5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying
party may have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that
any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be
entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and,
to the extent that it (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the
indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party
to such indemnified party under this Section 13.5 the indemnifying party shall
be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
behalf of such indemnified party or parties. The indemnifying party shall not be
liable for the expenses of more than one such separate counsel unless an
indemnified party shall have

                                    - 100 -

<PAGE>

reasonably concluded that there may be legal defenses available to it that are
different from or additional to those available to another indemnified party.

         (e)      In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 13.5(c)
or Section 13.5(d) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be
indemnifiable under Section 13.5(c) or Section 13.5(d), the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which
the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered:
(i) the indemnified party's and Borrower's relative knowledge and access to
information concerning the matter with respect to which claim was asserted; (ii)
the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii) any
other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Lender and
Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation.

         (f)      The liabilities and obligations of Borrower, and Lender under
this Section 13.5 shall survive the satisfaction of this Agreement and the
satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

         SECTION 13.6. INTENTIONALLY DELETED

                                   ARTICLE 14
                                INDEMNIFICATIONS

         SECTION 14.1. GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out
of or in any way relating to any one or more of the following: (a) any accident,
injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on
or about the Property or any part thereof or on the adjoining sidewalks, curbs,
adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets or ways; (b) any use,
nonuse or condition in, on or about the Property or any part thereof or on the
adjoining sidewalks, curbs, adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets
or ways; (c) performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
materials or other property in respect of the Property or any part thereof; (d)
any failure of the Property to be in compliance with any Applicable Legal
Requirements; (e) any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be
asserted against Lender by reason of any alleged obligations or undertakings on
its part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants, or agreements
contained in any Lease; (f) the holding or investing of the Reserve Accounts or
the performance of the Required Work, or Additional Replacements, or (g) the
payment of any commission, charge or brokerage fee to anyone which may be
payable in connection with the funding of the Loan (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, however, that Borrower shall not have any
obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such

                                    - 101 -

<PAGE>

Indemnified Liabilities arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or
willful misconduct of Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable because it violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay
the maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law
to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by
Lender.

         SECTION 14.2. MORTGAGE AND INTANGIBLE TAX INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way
relating to any tax on the making and/or recording of the Mortgage, the Note or
any of the other Loan Documents, but excluding any income, franchise or other
similar taxes.

         SECTION 14.3. ERISA INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of Losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA that may be required, in Lender's sole discretion) that Lender may incur,
directly or indirectly, as a result of a default under Section 4.8 or Section
5.18 of this Agreement.

         SECTION 14.4. SURVIVAL

         The obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Article 14 shall
fully survive indefinitely notwithstanding any termination, satisfaction,
assignment, entry of a judgment of foreclosure, exercise of any power of sale,
or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage.

                                   ARTICLE 15
                                  EXCULPATION

         SECTION 15.1. EXCULPATION

         (a)      Except as otherwise provided herein or in the other Loan
Documents, Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower or
Borrower Principal, as applicable, to perform and observe the obligations
contained herein or in the other Loan Documents by any action or proceeding
wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower or Borrower Principal,
except that Lender may bring a foreclosure action, action for specific
performance or other appropriate action or proceeding to enable Lender to
enforce and realize upon this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents, and the interest in the Property, the Rents and any other
collateral given to Lender created by this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents; provided, however, that any judgment in any such
action or proceeding shall be enforceable against Borrower only to the extent of
Borrower's interest in the Property, in the Rents and in any other collateral
given to Lender. Lender, by accepting this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents, agrees that it

                                    - 102 -

<PAGE>

shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Section 15.1, sue for, seek or
demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower or Borrower Principal in any
such action or proceeding, under or by reason of or under or in connection with
this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents. The
provisions of this Section 15.1 shall not, however, (i) constitute a waiver,
release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or secured by this Agreement,
the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents; (ii) impair the right of
Lender to name Borrower or Borrower Principal as a party defendant in any action
or suit for judicial foreclosure and sale under this Agreement and the Mortgage;
(iii) affect the validity or enforceability of any indemnity (including, without
limitation, those contained in Section 12.6, with respect to Borrower or
Borrower Principal, Section 13.5, with respect to Borrower, and Article 14 of
this Agreement, with respect to Borrower), guaranty, master lease or similar
instrument made in connection with this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents; (iv) impair the right of Lender to obtain the
appointment of a receiver; (v) impair the enforcement of the assignment of
leases provisions contained in the Mortgage; or (vi) impair the right of Lender
to obtain a deficiency judgment or other judgment on the Note against Borrower
or Borrower Principal if necessary to obtain any Insurance Proceeds or Awards to
which Lender would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement; provided however,
Lender shall only enforce such judgment to the extent of the Insurance Proceeds
and/or Awards.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 15.1 to the
contrary:

                  (1)      Borrower and Borrower Principal shall be personally
liable to Lender on a joint and several basis for Losses due to:

                  (i)      fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower,

         Principal in connection with the execution and the delivery of this
         Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage, any of the other Loan Documents, or
         any certificate, report, financial statement or other instrument or
         document furnished to Lender at the time of the closing of the Loan or
         during the term of the Loan;

                  (ii)     Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of

         continuance of an Event of Default;

                  (iii)    Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of
         tenant security deposits or Rents collected in advance and which have
         not been applied to the operation of the Property;

                  (iv)     the misapplication or the misappropriation of
         Insurance Proceeds or Awards;

                  (v)      Borrower's failure to pay Taxes, Other Charges
         (except to the extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have
         been deposited in escrow with Lender pursuant to the terms hereof and
         there exists no impediment to Lender's utilization thereof) beyond any
         applicable notice and cure periods specified therein;

                  (vi)     any act of actual intentional physical waste or arson
         by Borrower, any principal, Affiliate, member or general partner
         thereof or by Borrower Principal, any principal, Affiliate, member or
         general partner thereof; or

                                    - 103 -

<PAGE>

                  (vii)    the portion of any Rent paid by any Tenant more than
         thirty (30) days in advance that would have been payable by such Tenant
         from and after the occurrence of an Event of Default; and

                  (2)      Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to
Lender for Losses due to the Property, or any part thereof, becoming an asset in
(A) a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower or Borrower
Principal, or (B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower
or Borrower Principal in connection with which Borrower, Borrower Principal, SPE
Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing has or have solicited,
procured, or supported in any way with the creditors commencing or filing such
proceeding. Additionally, Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to
Lender for Losses in the event of a breach by Borrower or SPE Component Entity
of any of the covenants set forth in Article 6, except to the extent that such
breach was inadvertent, immaterial and is promptly cured in accordance with
Section 11.1(d).

         (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to
pursue recourse liability as set forth in subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL
AND VOID and shall be of no further force and effect and the Debt shall become
fully recourse (1) to Borrower and Borrower Principal, jointly and severally, in
the event of a breach of any of the covenants set forth in Article 7 hereof and
(2) to Borrower in the event (i) of a breach by Borrower or SPE Component Entity
of any of the covenants set forth in Article 6, except the extent that such
breach was inadvertent, immaterial and is promptly cured in accordance with
Section 11.1(d) hereof or (ii) the Property or any part thereof shall become an
asset in (A) a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower or
Borrower Principal, or (B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of
Borrower or Borrower Principal in connection with which Borrower, Borrower
Principal, SPE Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing has or
have solicited, procured, or supported in any way with the creditors commencing
or filing such proceeding.

         (d)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right
which Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other
provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of the
indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or to require that all collateral shall
continue to secure all of the indebtedness owing to Lender in accordance with
this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents.

amendment of the foregoing documents, except where prohibited by law so to do.

         SECTION 17.3. FURTHER ACTS, ETC.

         Borrower will, at the cost of Borrower, and without expense to Lender,
do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every further acts, deeds,
conveyances, deeds of trust, mortgages, assignments, security agreements,
control agreements, notices of assignments, transfers and assurances as Lender
shall, from time to time, reasonably require, for the better assuring,
conveying, assigning, transferring, and confirming unto Lender the property and
rights hereby mortgaged, deeded, granted, bargained, sold, conveyed, confirmed,
pledged, assigned, warranted and transferred or intended now or hereafter so to
be, or which Borrower may be or may hereafter become bound to convey or assign
to Lender, or for carrying out the intention or facilitating the performance of
the terms of this Agreement or for filing, registering or recording the
Mortgage, or for complying with all Legal Requirements. Borrower, on demand,
will execute and deliver, and in the event it shall fail to so execute and
deliver, hereby authorizes Lender to execute in the name of Borrower or without
the signature of Borrower to the extent Lender may lawfully do so, one or more
financing statements and financing statement amendments to evidence more
effectively, perfect and maintain the priority of the security interest of
Lender in the Property. Borrower grants to Lender an irrevocable power of
attorney coupled with an interest for the purpose of exercising and perfecting
any and all rights and remedies available to Lender at law and in equity,
including without limitation, such rights and remedies available to Lender
pursuant to this Section 17.3.

         SECTION 17.4. CHANGES IN TAX, DEBT, CREDIT AND DOCUMENTARY STAMP LAWS

         (a)      If any law is enacted or adopted or amended after the date of
this Agreement which deducts the Debt from the value of the Property for the
purpose of taxation or which imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly, on
the Debt or Lender's interest in the Property, Borrower will pay the tax, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any. If Lender is advised by counsel chosen
by it that the payment of tax by Borrower would be unlawful or taxable to Lender
or unenforceable or provide the basis for a defense of usury then Lender shall
have the option by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days
to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without any prepayment premium.

         (b)      Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit
or credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Taxes or Other Charges
assessed against the Property, or any part thereof, and no deduction shall
otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of

                                    - 106 -

<PAGE>

the Property, or any part thereof, for real estate tax purposes by reason of the
Mortgage or the Debt. If such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by
law, Lender shall have the option, by written notice of not less than one
hundred twenty (120) days, to declare the Debt immediately due and payable
without any prepayment premium.

         If at any time the United States of America, any State thereof or any
subdivision of any such State shall require revenue or other stamps to be
affixed to the Note, the Mortgage, or any of the other Loan Documents or impose
any other tax or charge on the same, Borrower will pay for the same, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any.

         SECTION 17.5. EXPENSES

         Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to
reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable, actual attorneys' fees and

connection with (a) the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and all the costs of furnishing all opinions by
counsel for Borrower (including without limitation any opinions requested by
Lender as to any legal matters arising under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents with respect to the Property); (b) Borrower's ongoing performance of
and compliance with Borrower's respective agreements and covenants contained in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or

compliance with environmental and insurance requirements; (c) following a
request by Borrower, Lender's ongoing performance and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date;
(d) the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and administration of any
consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications to this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and any other documents or matters requested by Lender; (e)
securing Borrower's compliance with any requests made pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement; (f) the filing and recording fees and expenses, title
insurance and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for providing to Lender
all required legal opinions, and other similar expenses incurred in creating and
perfecting the Lien in favor of Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents; (g) enforcing or preserving any rights, in response to third
party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any action or proceeding or
other litigation, in each case against, under or affecting Borrower, this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Property, or any other security given
for the Loan; and (h) enforcing any obligations of or collecting any payments
due from Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect
to the Property or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the
credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out"
or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower
shall not be liable for the payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent
the same arise by reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
misconduct of Lender.

                                     WAIVERS

         SECTION 18.1. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS

         The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's
rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's
sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power
accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power
or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power
may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A
waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be
construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by
Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

         SECTION 18.2. MODIFICATION, WAIVER IN WRITING

         No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement, or of the Note, or of any other Loan
Document, nor consent to any departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be in a writing signed by the party against
whom enforcement is sought, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance, and for the purpose, for which given. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, no notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall
entitle Borrower to any other or future notice or demand in the same, similar or
other circumstances.

         SECTION 18.3. DELAY NOT A WAIVER

         Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender in insisting
upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement, or
exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note or
under any other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security
therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of
any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under
this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed
to have waived any right either to require prompt payment when due of all other
amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents, or to
declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of any such other amount.

         SECTION 18.4. TRIAL BY JURY

         BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES NOT TO ELECT
A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH

                                    - 108 -

<PAGE>

REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER ACTION ARISING
IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS GIVEN
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER, AND IS
INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH THE
RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. EACH OF LENDER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND BORROWER IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN
ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND LENDER.

         SECTION 18.5. WAIVER OF NOTICE

         Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

         SECTION 18.6. REMEDIES OF BORROWER

         In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment. Lender
agrees that, in such event, it shall cooperate in expediting any action seeking
injunctive relief or declaratory judgment.

         SECTION 18.7. WAIVER OF MARSHALLING OF ASSETS

         To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Property, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the
marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters
whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan
Documents to a sale of the Property for the collection of the Debt without any
prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in preference to
every other claimant whatsoever.

<PAGE>

         SECTION 18.8. WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

         Borrower hereby expressly waives and releases, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the pleading of any statute of limitations as a defense to
payment of the Debt or performance of its Other Obligations.

         SECTION 18.9. WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM

         Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

                                   ARTICLE 19
                                  GOVERNING LAW

         SECTION 19.1. CHOICE OF LAW

         This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract entered into pursuant
to the laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed,
construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, provided however, (a) that with respect to the creation, perfection,
priority and enforcement of any Lien created by the Loan Documents, and the
determination of deficiency judgments, the laws of the state where the Property
is located shall apply, and (b) with respect to the security interest in each of
the Reserve Accounts and the Lockbox Account, the laws of the state where each
such account is located shall apply.

         SECTION 19.2. SEVERABILITY

         Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 19.3. PREFERENCES

         Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or
reverse and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to any portion of the
obligations of Borrower hereunder. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or
payments to Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
Creditors Rights Laws, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause,
then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations
hereunder or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue
in full force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received
by Lender.

warranties made herein and in the certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall

or any of the Debt is outstanding and unpaid unless a longer period is expressly
set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Whenever in this Agreement any
of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include
the legal representatives, successors and assigns of such party. All covenants,
promises and agreements in this Agreement, by or on behalf of Borrower, shall
inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of
Lender.

         SECTION 20.2. LENDER'S DISCRETION

         Whenever pursuant to this Agreement, Lender exercises any right given
to it to approve or disapprove, or any arrangement or term is to be satisfactory

         SECTION 20.3. HEADINGS

         The Article and/or Section headings and the Table of Contents in this
Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not

<PAGE>

         SECTION 20.6. OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES

         Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note
and the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,

such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or
defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

         SECTION 20.7. NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES

         (a)      Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and
lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture,
partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower
and Lender nor to grant Lender any interest in the Property other than that of
mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

         (b)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and
Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the
obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of
strict compliance with any or all thereof and no other Person shall under any
circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary of such conditions, any or all of
which may be freely waived in whole or in part by Lender if, in Lender's sole
discretion, Lender deems it advisable or desirable to do so.

         (c)      The general partners, members, principals and (if Borrower is
a trust) beneficial owners of Borrower are experienced in the ownership and
operation of properties similar to the Property, and Borrower and Lender are
relying solely upon such expertise and business plan in connection with the
ownership and operation of the Property. Borrower is not relying on Lender's
expertise, business acumen or advice in connection with the Property.

         (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Lender is not undertaking the performance of (i) any obligations under the
Leases; or (ii) any obligations with respect to such agreements, contracts,
certificates, instruments, franchises, permits, trademarks, licenses and other
documents.

         (e)      By accepting or approving anything required to be observed,
performed or fulfilled or to be given to Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the
Mortgage, the Note or the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation,
any officer's certificate, balance sheet, statement of profit and loss or other
financial statement, survey, appraisal, or insurance policy, Lender shall not be
deemed to have warranted, consented to, or affirmed the sufficiency, the
legality or

                                    - 112 -

effectiveness of same, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall not
constitute any warranty or affirmation with respect thereto by Lender.

         (f)      Borrower recognizes and acknowledges that in accepting this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, Lender is
expressly and primarily relying on the truth and accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement without any obligation
to investigate the Property and notwithstanding any investigation of the
Property by Lender; that such reliance existed on the part of Lender prior to
the date hereof, that the warranties and representations are a material
inducement to Lender in making the Loan; and that Lender would not be willing to
make the Loan and accept this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents in the absence of the warranties and representations as set forth
in Article 4 of this Agreement.

         SECTION 20.8. PUBLICITY

         All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan, Lender, Banc of America Securities LLC, or any of their Affiliates
shall be subject to the prior written approval of Lender, not to be unreasonably
withheld, provided however, that Lender's consent shall not be required in
connection with any such news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or
its Affiliates to the extent Borrower or its Affiliates are required to make
such news releases pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements. Lender shall be
permitted to make any news, releases, publicity or advertising by Lender or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan, the Property, Borrower, Borrower Principal and their respective
Affiliates without the approval of Borrower or any such Persons. Borrower also
agrees that Lender may share any information pertaining to the Loan with Bank of
America Corporation, including its bank subsidiaries, Banc of America Securities
LLC and any other Affiliates of the foregoing, in connection with the sale or
transfer of the Loan or any Participations and/or Securities created. In the
event of a conflict between any of the provisions of this Section 20.8 and
paragraph 5 of the Advisory Agreement, the applicable provisions of the Advisory
Agreement shall control.

         SECTION 20.9. CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE

         In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent
counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan
Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of
construing their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower
acknowledges that, with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its
own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any
manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it
under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which
govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or
Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower,
and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take
any action on the basis of the

                                    - 113 -

<PAGE>

foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of any such rights or remedies.
Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the business of real estate
financings and other real estate transactions and investments which may be
viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business of Borrower or its
Affiliates.

         SECTION 20.10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

         This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such
parties, whether oral or written between Borrower and Lender are superseded by
the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 20.11. TAX DISCLOSURE

         Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, except as reasonably
necessary to comply with applicable securities laws, each party (and each

any and all persons, without limitation of any kind, any information with
respect to the United States federal income "tax treatment" and "tax structure"
(in each case, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.6011-4) of
the transactions contemplated hereby and all materials of any kind (including
opinions or other tax analyses) that are provided to such parties (or their
representatives) relating to such tax treatment and tax structure; provided that
with respect to any document or similar item that in either case contains
information concerning the tax treatment or tax structure of the transaction as
well as other information, this sentence shall only apply to such portions of
the document or similar item that relate to the United States federal income tax
treatment or tax structure of the transactions contemplated hereby.

         SECTION 20.12. EXECUTION BY BORROWER PRINCIPAL

         Borrower Principal is executing this Agreement solely for the purpose
of (a) making the representations and warranties applicable to Borrower
Principal contained in Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.7, 4.8, 4.10, 4.14 (with
respect to financial information of Borrower Principal), 4.31, 4.39, and 4.40 of
this Agreement, and (b) agreeing to the terms, covenants and conditions

         (a)      The Loan shall bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal
to the Note Rate. Interest shall be computed based on the daily rate produced
assuming a three hundred sixty (360) day year, multiplied by the actual number
of days elapsed. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, interest shall
be paid in arrears.

         (b)      Borrower hereby agrees to pay sums due under the Note as
follows: An initial payment of is due on the Closing Date for interest from the
Closing Date through and including October 31, 2003. Thereafter, except as may
be adjusted in accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.2(c), (1)
consecutive monthly installments of interest only in an amount calculated in
accordance with Section 2.2(a) above (such amount, the "I/O Monthly Payment
Amount") shall be payable on the first day of each month beginning December 1,
2003 (each such date through and including the Maturity Date, a "Scheduled
Payment Date") through and including the Scheduled Payment Date occurring in
November, 2004 and (2) thereafter, consecutive monthly installments of principal
and interest in an amount equal to the sum set forth on Schedule 1, attached
hereto, shall be payable pursuant to the terms of Section 2.2(d) (the "Constant
Monthly Payment Amount"; the I/O Monthly Payment Amount and the Constant Monthly
Payment Amount shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the "Monthly
Payment Amount") on each Scheduled Payment Date until the entire indebtedness
evidenced hereby is fully paid, except that any remaining indebtedness, if not
sooner paid, shall be due and payable on the Maturity Date.

         (c)      The Constant Monthly Payment Amount shall mean the amount of
interest and principal which would be due in order to fully amortize the
principal amount of the Loan over an amortization term of thirty (30) years
assuming an annual interest rate equal to the Note Rate, computed on the basis
of a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting of twelve (12) months of
thirty (30) days each. Borrower expressly understands and agrees that such
computation of interest based on a three hundred sixty (360) day year consisting
of twelve (12) months of thirty (30) days each is solely for the purpose of
determining the Monthly Payment Amount, and, notwithstanding such computation,
interest shall accrue on the outstanding principal amount of the Loan as
provided in Section 2.2(a) above. Borrower understands and acknowledges that
such interest accrual requirement results in more interest accruing on the Loan
than if either a thirty (30) day month and a three hundred sixty (360) day year
or the actual number of days and a three hundred sixty-five (365) day year were
used to compute the accrual of interest on the Loan. Borrower recognizes that
such interest accrual requirement will not fully amortize the Loan within the
amortization period set forth above. Following any partial prepayment occurring
solely as a result of the application of Insurance Proceeds or Awards pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement, Lender may, in its sole and absolute discretion,
adjust the Monthly Payment Amount to give effect to any such partial prepayment,
provided, however, that in no event will any such adjustment result in any such
installment becoming due and payable on any date after the Maturity Date.

                                     - 16 -

<PAGE>

         (d)      Each payment by Borrower hereunder or under the Note shall be
payable at the payment address set forth on Schedule 1, attached hereto, or at
such other place as the Lender may designate from time to time in writing, on
the date such payment is due, to Lender by deposit to such account as Lender may
designate by written notice to Borrower. Whenever any payment hereunder or under
the Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, such
payment shall be made on the first Business Day preceding such scheduled due
date.

         (e)      Prior to the occurrence and following the cure (in accordance
with the terms hereof) of an Event of Default, all monthly payments made as
scheduled under this Agreement and the Note shall be applied first to the
payment of interest computed at the Note Rate, and the balance toward the
reduction of the principal amount of the Note. All voluntary and involuntary
prepayments on the Note shall be applied, to the extent thereof, to accrued but
unpaid interest on the amount prepaid, to the remaining principal amount, and
any other sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan, in such
manner and order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute discretion,
including, but not limited to, application to principal installments in inverse
order of maturity. Following the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default, any payment made on the Note shall be applied to accrued but
unpaid interest, late charges, accrued fees, the unpaid principal amount of the
Note, and any other sums due and unpaid to Lender in connection with the Loan,
in such manner and order as Lender may elect in its sole and absolute
discretion.

         (f)      All payments made by Borrower hereunder or under the Note or
the other Loan Documents shall be made irrespective of, and without any
deduction for, any setoff, defense or counterclaims.

         SECTION 2.3. LATE PAYMENT CHARGE

         If any principal or interest payment is not paid by Borrower on or
before the date which is ten (10) calendar days after the same is due, Borrower
shall pay to Lender upon demand an amount equal to the lesser of four percent
(4%) of such unpaid sum or the maximum amount permitted by applicable law in
order to defray the expense incurred by Lender in handling and processing such
delinquent payment and to compensate Lender for the loss of the use of such
delinquent payment. Any such amount shall be secured by the Mortgage and the
other Loan Documents to the extent permitted by applicable law.

         SECTION 2.4. PREPAYMENT; DEFEASANCE

         Except as otherwise expressly permitted by this Section 2.4, no
voluntary prepayments, whether in whole or in part, of the Loan or any other
amount at any time due and owing under the Note can be made by Borrower or any
other Person without the express written consent of Lender.

         (a)      Lockout Period. Borrower has no right to make, and Lender
shall have no obligation to accept, any voluntary prepayment, whether in whole
or in part, of the Loan during the Lockout Period. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if either (i) Lender, in its sole and absolute discretion, accepts a
full or partial voluntary prepayment during the Lockout Period or (ii) there is
an involuntary prepayment during the Lockout Period, then, in either case,
Borrower shall, in

                                     - 17 -

<PAGE>

addition to any portion of the Loan prepaid (together with all interest accrued
and unpaid thereon), pay to Lender a prepayment premium in an amount calculated
in accordance with Section 2.4(d) hereof.

         (b)      Total Defeasance.

                  (i)      Notwithstanding any provisions of this Section 2.4 to
         the contrary, including, without limitation, subsection (a) of this
         Section 2.4, at any time after the earlier to occur of the (1)
         expiration of the REMIC Prohibition Period or (2) expiration of the
         Substitution/Defeasance Lockout Period, Borrower may cause the release
         of the Property from the lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan
         Documents upon the satisfaction of the following conditions:

                           (A)      no Event of Default shall exist under any of
                  the Loan Documents;

                           (B)      not less than thirty (30) (but not more than
                  ninety (90)) days prior written notice shall be given to
                  Lender specifying a date on which the Defeasance Collateral
                  (as hereinafter defined) is to be delivered (the "RELEASE
                  DATE"), such date being on a Scheduled Payment Date; provided,
                  however, that Borrower shall have the right (i) to cancel such
                  notice by providing Lender with notice of cancellation ten
                  (10) days prior to the scheduled Release Date, or (ii) to
                  extend the scheduled Release Date until the next Scheduled
                  Payment Date; provided that in each case, Borrower shall pay
                  all of Lender's reasonable costs and expenses incurred as a
                  result of such cancellation or extension;

                           (C)      all accrued and unpaid interest and all
                  other sums due under the Note, this Agreement and under the
                  other Loan Documents up to the Release Date, including,
                  without limitation, all reasonable fees, costs and expenses
                  incurred by Lender and its agents in connection with such
                  release (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees
                  and expenses for the review and preparation of the Defeasance
                  Security Agreement (as hereinafter defined) and of the other
                  materials described in Section 2.4(b)(i)(D) below and any
                  related documentation, and any servicing fees, Rating Agency
                  fees or other costs related to such release), shall be paid in
                  full on or prior to the Release Date;

                           (D)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender on or prior
                  to the Release Date:

                  (1)      a pledge and security agreement, in form and
substance which would be satisfactory to a prudent institutional mortgage loan
lender, creating a first priority security interest in favor of Lender in the
Defeasance Collateral, as defined herein (the "DEFEASANCE SECURITY AGREEMENT"),
which shall provide, among other things, that any excess amounts received by
Lender from the Defeasance Collateral over the amounts payable by Borrower on a
given Scheduled Payment Date, which excess amounts are not required to cover all
or any portion of amounts payable on a future Scheduled Payment Date, shall be
refunded to Borrower promptly after each such Scheduled Payment Date;

                  (2)      direct non-callable obligations of the United States
of America (or other obligations which are "government securities" within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the

                                     - 18 -

<PAGE>

Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent the applicable Rating Agencies
rating the Securities have confirmed in writing will not cause a downgrade,
withdrawal or qualification of the initial, or, if higher, then applicable
ratings of the Securities), that provide for payments prior and as close as
possible to (but in no event later than) all successive Scheduled Payment Dates
occurring after the Release Date, with each such payment being equal to or
greater than the amount of the corresponding Monthly Payment Amount required to
be paid under this Agreement and the Note (including all amounts due on the
Maturity Date) for the balance of the term hereof (the "DEFEASANCE COLLATERAL"),
each of which shall be duly endorsed by the holder thereof as directed by Lender
or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form and substance which
would be satisfactory to a prudent lender (including, without limitation, such
certificates, documents and instruments as may be required by the depository
institution holding such securities or the issuer thereof, as the case may be,
to effectuate book-entry transfers and pledges through the book-entry facilities
of such institution) in order to perfect upon the delivery of the Defeasance
Security Agreement the first priority security interest therein in favor of
Lender in conformity with all applicable state and federal laws governing
granting of such security interests;

                  (3)      a certificate of Borrower certifying that all of the
requirements set forth in this Section 2.4(b)(i) have been satisfied;

                  (4)      one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower in form
and substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a prudent
lender stating, among other things, that (i) Lender has a perfected first
priority security interest in the Defeasance Collateral and that the Defeasance
Security Agreement is enforceable against Borrower in accordance with its terms,
(ii) the release of the lien of the Mortgage and the pledge of Defeasance
Collateral will not directly or indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust
that then holds the Note to fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and
(iii) the defeasance will not cause any REMIC Trust to be an "investment
company" under the Investment Company Act of 1940, at Borrower's cost;

                  (5)      a certificate in form and scope which would be
acceptable to a prudent lender from an Acceptable Accountant certifying that the
Defeasance Collateral will generate amounts sufficient to make all payments of
principal and interest due under the Note (including the scheduled outstanding
principal balance of the Loan due on the Maturity Date); and

                  (6)      such other certificates, documents and instruments as
a prudent institutional lender would require; and

                           (E)      in the event the Loan is held by a REMIC
                  Trust, Lender has received written confirmation from any
                  Rating Agency rating any Securities that substitution of the
                  Defeasance Collateral will not result in a downgrade,
                  withdrawal, or qualification of the ratings then assigned to
                  any of the Securities.

                  (ii)     Upon compliance with the requirements of Section
         2.4(b)(i), the Property shall be released from the lien of the Mortgage
         and the other Loan Documents, and the Defeasance Collateral shall
         constitute collateral which shall secure the Note and all other
         obligations under the Loan Documents. Lender will, at Borrower's
         expense, execute and

                                     - 19 -

<PAGE>


         deliver any agreements reasonably requested by Borrower to release the
         lien of the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents from the Property.

                  (iii)    Upon the release of the Property in accordance with
         this Section 2.4(b), Borrower shall (at Lender's sole and absolute
         discretion) assign all its obligations and rights under the Note,
         together with the pledged Defeasance Collateral, to a successor entity
         designated and approved by Lender in its sole and absolute discretion
         ("SUCCESSOR BORROWER"). Successor Borrower shall execute an assignment
         and assumption agreement in form and substance which would be
         satisfactory to a prudent lender pursuant to which it shall assume
         Borrower's obligations under the Note and the Defeasance Security
         Agreement. As conditions to such assignment and assumption, Borrower
         shall (A) deliver to Lender one or more opinions of counsel in form and
         substance and delivered by counsel which would be satisfactory to a
         prudent lender stating, among other things, that such assignment and
         assumption agreement is enforceable against Borrower and the Successor
         Borrower in accordance with its terms and that the Note, the Defeasance
         Security Agreement and the other Loan Documents, as so assigned and
         assumed, are enforceable against the Successor Borrower in accordance
         with their respective terms, and opining to such other matters relating
         to Successor Borrower and its organizational structure as Lender may
         require, and (B) pay all reasonable fees, costs and expenses incurred
         by Lender or its agents in connection with such assignment and
         assumption (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses and
         for the review of the proposed transferee and the preparation of the
         assignment and assumption agreement and related certificates, documents
         and instruments and any fees payable to any Rating Agencies and their
         counsel in connection with the issuance of the confirmation referred to
         in subsection (b)(i)(E) above). Upon such assignment and assumption,
         Borrower shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder, under the
         Note, under the other Loan Documents and under the Defeasance Security
         Agreement, except as expressly set forth in the assignment and
         assumption agreement.

                  (iv)     For purposes of this Section 2.4, "REMIC PROHIBITION
         PERIOD" means the two-year period commencing with the "startup day"
         within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code of any REMIC Trust
         that holds the Note. In no event shall Lender have any obligation to
         notify Borrower that a REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect with
         respect to the Loan, except that Lender shall notify Borrower if any
         REMIC Prohibition Period is in effect with respect to the Loan after
         receiving any notice described in Section 2.4(b)(i)(B); provided,
         however, that the failure of Lender to so notify Borrower shall not
         impose any liability on Lender or grant Borrower any right to defease
         the Loan during any such REMIC Prohibition Period.

         (c)      Intentionally deleted.

         (d)      Involuntary Prepayment During the Lockout Period. During the
Lockout Period, in the event of any involuntary prepayment of the Loan or any
other amount under the Note, whether in whole or in part, in connection with or
following Lender's acceleration of the Note or otherwise, and whether the
Mortgage is satisfied or released by foreclosure (whether by power of sale or
judicial proceeding), deed in lieu of foreclosure or by any other means,
including, without limitation, repayment of the Loan by Borrower or any other
Person pursuant to any statutory or

                                     - 20 -

<PAGE>

common law right of redemption, Borrower shall, in addition to any portion of
the principal balance of the Loan prepaid (together with all interest accrued
and unpaid thereon and in the event the prepayment is made on a date other than
a Scheduled Payment Date, a sum equal to the amount of interest which would have
accrued under the Note on the amount of such prepayment if such prepayment had
occurred on the next Scheduled Payment Date), pay to Lender a prepayment premium
in an amount calculated in accordance with this Section 2.4(d). Such prepayment
premium shall be in an amount equal to the greater of:

                  (i)      1% of the portion of the Loan being prepaid; or

                  (ii)     the product obtained by multiplying:

                           (A)      the portion of the Loan being prepaid,
                  times;

                           (B)      the difference obtained by subtracting (I)
                  the Yield Rate from (II) the Note Rate, times;

                           (C)      the present value factor calculated using
                  the following formula:

                                    1-(1+r)-n
                                    ---------
                                        r

                                    r =  Yield Rate

                                    n =  the number of years and any fraction
                                         thereof, remaining between the date the
                                         prepayment is made and the Maturity
                                         Date of the Note.

         As used herein, "YIELD RATE" means the yield per annum calculated by
Lender by the linear interpolation of the yield of U.S. Treasury Securities
having a maturity date (one longer and one shorter) most nearly approximating
the Maturity Date as reported on the fifth Business Day preceding the Prepayment
Calculation Date. The "PREPAYMENT CALCULATION DATE" shall mean, as applicable,
the date on which (i) Lender applies any partial prepayment to the reduction of
the outstanding principal amount of the Note, in the case of a voluntary partial
prepayment which is accepted by Lender, (ii) Lender accelerates the Loan, in the
case of a prepayment resulting from acceleration, or (iii) Lender applies funds
held under any Reserve Account, in the case of a prepayment resulting from such
an application (other than in connection with acceleration of the Loan).

         (e)      Insurance and Condemnation Proceeds; Excess Interest.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, and provided no
Event of Default exists, Borrower shall not be required to pay any prepayment
premium in connection with any prepayment occurring solely as a result of (i)
the application of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds pursuant to the
terms of the Loan Documents, or (ii) the application of any interest in excess
of the Maximum Legal Rate.

         (f)      After the Lockout Period. Commencing on the day after the
expiration of the Lockout Period, and upon giving Lender at least thirty (30)
days (but not more than ninety (90) days) prior written notice, Borrower may
voluntarily prepay (without premium) the Note in

                                     - 21 -

<PAGE>

whole (but not in part) on a Scheduled Payment Date. Lender shall accept a
prepayment pursuant to this Section 2.4(h) on a day other than a Scheduled
Payment Date provided that, in addition to payment of the full outstanding
principal balance of the Note, Borrower pays to Lender a sum equal to the amount
of interest which would have accrued on the Note if such prepayment occurred on
the next Scheduled Payment Date (the "INTEREST SHORTFALL").

         (g)      Limitation on Partial Prepayments. Except as set forth in
Section 2.4(e), in no event shall Lender have any obligation to accept a partial
prepayment.

         SECTION 2.5. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION 2.6. PAYMENTS AFTER DEFAULT.

         Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and, to the extent
permitted by law, overdue interest and other amounts due in respect of the Loan,
(a) shall accrue at the Default Rate, and (b) Lender shall be entitled to
receive and Borrower shall pay to Lender all cash flow from the Property in
accordance with the terms of Article X hereof, such amount to be applied by
Lender to the payment of the Debt in such order as Lender shall determine in its
sole discretion, including, without limitation, alternating applications thereof
between interest and principal. Interest at the Default Rate shall be computed
from the occurrence of the Event of Default until the earlier of (i) the actual
receipt and collection of the Debt (or that portion thereof that is then due)
and (ii) the cure of such Event of Default. To the extent permitted by
applicable law, interest at the Default Rate shall be added to the Debt, shall
itself accrue interest at the same rate as the Loan and shall be secured by the
Mortgage. This paragraph shall not be construed as an agreement or privilege to
extend the date of the payment of the Debt, nor as a waiver of any other right
or remedy accruing to Lender by reason of the occurrence of any Event of
Default; the acceptance of any payment from Borrower shall not be deemed to cure
or constitute a waiver of any Event of Default; and Lender retains its rights
under this Agreement to accelerate and to continue to demand payment of the Debt
upon the happening of and during the continuance any Event of Default, despite
any payment by Borrower to Lender.

         SECTION 2.7. USURY SAVINGS

         This Agreement and the Note are subject to the express condition that
at no time shall Borrower be obligated or required to pay interest on the
principal balance of the Loan at a rate which could subject Lender to either
civil or criminal liability as a result of being in excess of the Maximum Legal
Rate. If, by the terms of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Borrower
is at any time required or obligated to pay interest on the principal balance
due hereunder at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate, the Note Rate or
the Default Rate, as the case may be, shall be deemed to be immediately reduced
to the Maximum Legal Rate and all previous payments in excess of the Maximum
Legal Rate shall be deemed to have been payments in reduction of principal and
not on account of the interest due hereunder. All sums paid or agreed to be paid
to Lender for the use, forbearance, or detention of the sums due under the Loan,
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated, and spread throughout the full stated term of the Loan until payment
in full so that the rate or amount

                                     - 22 -

<PAGE>

of interest on account of the Loan does not exceed the Maximum Legal Rate of
interest from time to time in effect and applicable to the Loan for so long as
the Loan is outstanding.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                              CONDITIONS PRECEDENT

         The obligation of Lender to make the Loan hereunder is subject to the
fulfillment by Borrower or waiver by Lender of the following conditions
precedent no later than the Closing Date.

         SECTION 3.1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; COMPLIANCE WITH CONDITIONS

         The representations and warranties of Borrower contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the Closing Date with the same effect as if made on and as
of such date, and Lender shall have determined that no Default or an Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing nor will any Default or Event of
Default occur immediately following the Closing Date; and Borrower shall be in
compliance in all material respects with all terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in each other Loan Document on its part to be observed or
performed.

         SECTION 3.2.  DELIVERY OF LOAN DOCUMENTS; TITLE INSURANCE; REPORTS;
LEASES

         (a)      Mortgage, Loan Agreement and Note. Lender shall have received
from Borrower a fully executed and acknowledged counterpart of the Mortgage and
evidence that counterparts of the Mortgage and Uniform Commercial Code financing
statements have been delivered to the title company for recording, in the

such Laundry Leases (A) provides that the Tenant under such Laundry Lease shall

         The Management Agreement is in full force and effect and there is no
default thereunder by any party thereto and, to Borrower's knowledge, no event

         SECTION 4.28. ILLEGAL ACTIVITY

         No portion of the Property has been or will be purchased with proceeds

resulted in a Lien against the Property, the Title Insurance Policy provides
Lender satisfactory affirmative insurance with respect to such Lien. To
Borrower's knowledge after due inquiry, there are no claims for payment for
work, labor or materials affecting the Property which are or may become a lien
prior to, or of equal priority with, the Liens created by the Loan Documents.

         SECTION 4.30. PERSONAL PROPERTY

         Borrower has paid in full for, and is the owner of, all Personal

additional assessment in respect of any such taxes and related liabilities for
prior years.

         SECTION 4.32. PERMITTED ENCUMBRANCES

         None of the Permitted Encumbrances, individually or in the aggregate,
materially interferes with the benefits of the security intended to be provided
by the Loan Documents, materially and adversely affects the value of the
Property, impairs the use or the operation of the Property or impairs Borrower's
ability to pay its obligations in a timely manner.

         SECTION 4.33. FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATIONS

         Borrower will use the proceeds of the Loan for the purposes set forth
in Section 2.1(d) hereof and not for any illegal activity. No part of the

"margin stock" within the meaning of Regulation U of the Board of Governors of
the Federal Reserve System or for any other purpose which would be inconsistent
with such Regulation U or any other Regulations of such Board of Governors, or

(nor has any notice been given or received with respect to an alleged or current
default) under any of the terms and conditions of any REA, and any such REA
remains unmodified and in full force and effect;

         (b)      All easements granted pursuant to any REA which were to have
survived the site preparation and completion of construction (to the extent that
the same has been completed), remain in full force and effect and have not been
released, terminated, extinguished or discharged by agreement or otherwise;

                                     - 35 -

REA (or by the other parties to any such REA to Borrower) pursuant to the terms
of any such REA, including without limitation, all sums, charges, fees,
assessments, costs, and expenses in connection with any taxes, site preparation
and construction, non-shareholder contributions, and common area and other
property management activities have been paid, are current, and no lien has
attached on the Property (or threat thereof been made) for failure to pay any of
the foregoing;

         (d)      The terms, conditions, covenants, uses and restrictions
contained in any REA do not conflict in any manner with any terms, conditions,
covenants, uses and restrictions contained in any Lease or in any agreement
between Borrower and occupant of any peripheral parcel, including without
limitation, conditions and restrictions with respect to kiosk placement, tenant
restrictions (type, location or exclusivity), sale of certain goods or services,
and/or other use restrictions; and

         (e)      The terms, conditions, covenants, uses and restrictions
contained in each Lease do not conflict in any manner with any terms,
conditions, covenants, uses and restrictions contained in any REA, any other
Lease or in any agreement between Borrower and occupant of any peripheral
parcel, including without limitation, conditions and restrictions with respect
to kiosk placement, tenant restrictions (type, location or exclusivity), sale of
certain goods or services, and/or other use restrictions.

         SECTION 4.36. NO CHANGE IN FACTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES; DISCLOSURE

         All information submitted by Borrower or its agents to Lender and in
all financial statements, rent rolls, reports, certificates and other documents
submitted in connection with the Loan or in satisfaction of the terms thereof
and all statements of fact made by Borrower in this Agreement or in any other
Loan Document, are accurate, complete and correct in all material respects.
There has been no material adverse change in any condition, fact, circumstance
or event that would make any such information inaccurate, incomplete or
otherwise misleading in any material respect or that otherwise materially and
adversely affects or, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, could reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect the Property or the business
operations or the financial condition of Borrower. To the best of Borrower's
knowledge, Borrower has disclosed to Lender all material facts and has not
failed to disclose any material fact that could cause any representation or
warranty made herein to be materially misleading.

         SECTION 4.37. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

         All trademarks, trade names and service marks necessary to the business
of Borrower as presently conducted or as Borrower contemplates conducting its
business are in good standing and, to the extent of Borrower's actual knowledge,
uncontested. Borrower has not infringed, is not infringing, and has not received
notice of infringement with respect to asserted trademarks, trade names and
service marks of others. To Borrower's knowledge, there is no infringement by
others of trademarks, trade names and service marks of Borrower.

         The Survey for the Property delivered to Lender in connection with this
Agreement has been prepared in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.2(c)

material matter affecting the Property or the title thereto, which was required
to be set forth therein pursuant to Section 3.2(c) hereof.

         SECTION 4.39. EMBARGOED PERSON

constitute property of, or are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by
any person, entity or government and (2) none of the funds or other assets of

         With respect to any Operating Leases relating to the Property, each
such Operating Lease provides that (i) it is subject and subordinate to the
lien, terms and conditions of the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents and (ii)
in the event that the Lender takes possession of the Property, either as the
result of foreclosure of the Mortgage or accepting a deed to the Property in
lieu of foreclosure, or otherwise (or the Property shall be purchased at such a
foreclosure by a third party), the Tenant shall attorn to the Lender or such
third party and recognize the Lender or such third party as its landlord under
the applicable Operating Lease, whereupon, the Operating Lease shall continue in
full force and effect as a direct lease between the Lender or such third party
and the Tenant for the full term thereof, together with all extensions and
renewals thereof. None of the Operating Leases (and none of the underlying real
property relating to any such Operating Lease), if any, produce any income to
Borrower or the Tenant thereunder, and there are currently no Rents payable by
the Tenant to the Borrower under such Operating Lease. Each Operating Lease is
in full force and effect, has not been modified or amended in any manner
whatsoever, (b) there are no defaults under any Operating Lease by Borrower, or,
to the best of Borrower's knowledge, the Tenant thereunder, and, to the best of

         SECTION 4.43. SURVIVAL

         Borrower agrees that, unless expressly provided otherwise, all of the
representations and warranties of Borrower set forth in this Agreement and
elsewhere in this Agreement and in the

agreements made in this Agreement or in the other Loan Documents by Borrower
shall be deemed to have been relied upon by Lender notwithstanding any
investigation heretofore or hereafter made by Lender or on its behalf.

                               BORROWER COVENANTS

         From the date hereof and until repayment of the Debt in full and
performance in full of all obligations of Borrower under the Loan Documents or

accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
Borrower hereby covenants and agrees with Lender that:

         SECTION 5.1. EXISTENCE; COMPLIANCE WITH LEGAL REQUIREMENTS

         (a)      Borrower shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve, renew and keep in full force and effect its existence, rights,

Legal Requirements applicable to it and the Property. Borrower hereby covenants
and agrees not to commit, permit or suffer to exist any act or omission
affording any Governmental Authority the right of forfeiture as against the
Property or any part thereof or any monies paid in performance of Borrower's
obligations under any of the Loan Documents.

         (b)      After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own
expense, may contest by appropriate legal proceeding, promptly initiated and
conducted in good faith and with due diligence, the Legal Requirements affecting
the Property, provided that (i) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing; (ii) such proceeding shall be permitted under and be conducted in
accordance with the provisions of any other instrument to which Borrower or the
Property is subject and shall not constitute a default thereunder; (iii) neither
the Property, any part thereof or interest therein, any of the tenants or
occupants thereof, nor Borrower shall be affected in any material adverse way as
a result of such proceeding; (iv) non-compliance with the Legal Requirements
shall not impose civil or criminal liability on Borrower or Lender; (v) Borrower
shall have furnished the security as may be required in the proceeding or by
Lender to ensure compliance by Borrower with the Legal Requirements; and (vi)
Borrower shall have furnished to Lender all other items reasonably requested by
Lender.

         SECTION 5.2. MAINTENANCE AND USE OF PROPERTY

         Borrower shall cause the Property to be maintained in a good and safe
condition and repair. The Improvements and the Personal Property shall not be
removed, demolished or materially altered (except for normal replacement of
Personal Property) other than in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.21
without the prior written consent of Lender. If under applicable zoning
provisions the use of all or any portion of the Property is or shall become a
nonconforming use, Borrower will not cause or permit the nonconforming use to be
discontinued or the nonconforming Improvement to be abandoned without the
express written consent of Lender.

         SECTION 5.3. WASTE

         Borrower shall not commit or suffer any waste of the Property or make
any change in the use of the Property which will in any way materially increase
the risk of fire or other hazard arising out of the operation of the Property,
or take any action that might invalidate or give cause for cancellation of any
Policy, or do or permit to be done thereon anything that may in any way
materially impair the value of the Property or the security for the Loan.
Borrower will not, without the prior written consent of Lender, permit any
drilling or exploration for or extraction, removal, or production of any
minerals from the surface or the subsurface of the Property, regardless of the
depth thereof or the method of mining or extraction thereof.

         SECTION 5.4. TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES

         (a)      Borrower shall pay all Taxes and Other Charges now or
hereafter levied or assessed or imposed against the Property or any part thereof
no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the date on which such Taxes or
Other Charges would be delinquent; provided, however, Borrower's obligation to
directly pay Taxes shall be suspended for so long as Borrower complies with the
terms and provisions of Section 9.6 hereof. Borrower shall furnish to Lender
receipts (or copies of checks and transmittal letters evidencing the payment of
such Taxes or Other Charges) for the payment of the Taxes and the Other Charges
prior to the date the same shall become delinquent (provided, however, that
Borrower is not required to furnish such receipts for payment of Taxes in the
event that such Taxes have been paid by Lender pursuant to Section 9.6 hereof).
Subject to any rights of Borrower under this Agreement to contest Liens,
Borrower shall not suffer and shall promptly cause to be paid and discharged any
Lien or charge whatsoever which may be or become a Lien or charge against the
Property, and shall promptly pay for all utility services provided to the
Property, except to the extent the costs of such utility services are not
payable by Borrower and are billed to Tenants at the Property.

         (b)      After prior written notice to Lender, Borrower, at its own

no Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured; (ii) such proceeding shall
be permitted under and be conducted in accordance with the provisions of any
other instrument to which Borrower is subject and shall not constitute a default
thereunder and such proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with all
applicable Legal Requirements; (iii) neither the Property nor any part thereof
or interest therein will be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated,
canceled or lost; (iv) Borrower shall promptly upon final determination thereof
pay the amount of any such Taxes or Other Charges, together with all costs,
interest and penalties which may be payable in connection therewith; (v) such
proceeding shall suspend the collection of such contested Taxes or Other Charges
from the Property; and (vi) Borrower shall furnish such security as may be
required in the proceeding, or, in the event that neither Original Borrower nor
a Borrower Principal Affiliate is Borrower under the Loan, deliver to Lender
such reserve deposits as may be requested by Lender, to insure the payment of
any such Taxes or Other Charges, together with all interest and penalties
thereon (unless Borrower has paid all of the Taxes or Other Charges under
protest). Lender may pay over any such cash deposit or part thereof held by
Lender to the claimant entitled thereto at any time when, in the judgment of
Lender, the entitlement of such claimant is established or the Property (or part
thereof or interest

                                     - 40 -

therein) shall be in danger of being sold, forfeited, terminated, canceled or

any related Lien.

         SECTION 5.5. LITIGATION

         SECTION 5.8. COOPERATE IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         Borrower shall at Borrower's expense cooperate fully with Lender with
respect to any proceedings before any court, board or other Governmental

connection therewith, permit Lender, at its election, to participate in any such
proceedings.

         SECTION 5.9. PERFORMANCE BY BORROWER

         Borrower shall in a timely manner observe, perform and fulfill each and
every covenant, term and provision to be observed and performed by Borrower
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and any other agreement or
instrument affecting or pertaining to the Property and any amendments,
modifications or changes thereto.

         SECTION 5.10. AWARDS; INSURANCE PROCEEDS

                  (i)      Intentionally deleted.

                  (ii)     If requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide
         Lender, promptly upon request, with summaries of the financial
         statements referenced in Section 5.11(c)(ii)(A)-(D) below if, at the
         time a Disclosure Document is being prepared for a Securitization, it
         is expected that the principal amount of the Loan and any Affiliated
         Loans at the time of Securitization may, or if the principal amount of
         the Loan and any Affiliated Loans at any time during which the Loan and

         exceed 10% of the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans
         included or expected to be included, as applicable, in a
         Securitization. Such summaries shall meet the requirements for

         determined to be necessary or appropriate by Lender.

                  date (each an "Offering Document Date") of each Disclosure
                  Document, Borrower shall have provided Lender with all
                  financial statements as described in subsection (f)(i) above;

                  (iv)     If requested by Lender, Borrower shall provide
         Lender, promptly upon request, with any other or additional financial
         statements, or financial, statistical or operating information, as
         Lender shall determine to be required pursuant to Regulation S-X or any
         amendment, modification or replacement thereto or other legal
         requirements in connection with any Disclosure Document or any filing
         under or pursuant to the Exchange Act in connection with or relating to
         a Securitization (hereinafter an "Exchange Act Filing") or as shall
         otherwise be reasonably requested by Lender.

                  (v)      In the event Lender determines, in connection with a
         Securitization, that the financial statements required in order to
         comply with Regulation S-X or other legal requirements are other than
         as provided herein, then notwithstanding the provisions of Section
         5.11(c) hereof, Lender may request, and Borrower shall promptly
         provide, such combination of Acquired Property Statement and/or
         Standard Statements or such other financial statements as Lender
         determines to be necessary or appropriate for such compliance.

                  (vi)     Any reports, statements or other information required
         to be delivered under this Agreement shall be delivered in paper form
         and in the event that Lender requires financial statements in
         connection with subsection (c) above because the Loan when combined
         with the principal amount of any Affiliated Loans equal or exceed 20%
         of the aggregate principal amount of all mortgage loans included in a
         Securitization (defined below), Borrower shall deliver such reports,
         statements and other information (A) on a diskette, and (B) if
         requested by Lender and within the capabilities of Borrower's data
         systems without change or modification thereto, in electronic form and
         prepared using Microsoft Word for Windows or WordPerfect for Windows
         files (which files may be prepared using a spreadsheet program and
         saved as word processing files).

         (d)      Borrower and Borrower Principal shall furnish Lender with such
other additional financial or management information (including state and
federal tax returns) as may, from time to time, be reasonably required by Lender
in form and substance satisfactory to Lender (including, without limitation, any
financial reports required to be delivered by any Tenant or any guarantor of any
Lease pursuant to the terms of such Lease), and shall furnish to Lender and its
agents convenient facilities for the examination and audit of any such books and
records.

         (e)      All items requiring the certification of Borrower shall,
except where Borrower is an individual, require a certificate executed by the
general partner, managing member or authorized/senior officer of Borrower, as
applicable (and the same rules shall apply to any sole shareholder, general
partner or managing member which is not an individual).

         (f)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
no event shall Borrower be required to comply with the financial reporting
requirements of Regulation S-X that would be applicable solely as a result of
the principal amount of the Loan and any Affiliated Loans (at the time of
Securitization) equaling or exceeding 20% of the aggregate principal amount of
all mortgage loans included or expected to be included, as applicable, in a
Securitization.

         SECTION 5.12. ESTOPPEL STATEMENT

         (a)      After request by Lender, Borrower shall within fifteen (15)
Business Days furnish Lender with a statement, duly acknowledged and certified,
setting forth (i) the amount of the original principal amount of the Note, (ii)
the rate of interest on the Note, (iii) the unpaid principal amount of the Note,
(iv) the date installments of interest and/or principal were last paid, (v) any
offsets or defenses to the payment of the Debt, if any, and (vi) that the Note,
this Agreement, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents are valid, legal and
binding obligations and have not been modified or if modified, giving
particulars of such modification.

         (b)      Borrower shall use its reasonable efforts to deliver to
Lender, promptly upon request, but subject to the terms of the applicable Major
Leases that are either Ground Leases or Operating Leases, duly executed estoppel
certificates from any one or more Tenants thereunder as required by Lender (but
no more frequently than once every twelve (12) months provided no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing) attesting to such facts regarding the
related Lease as Lender may reasonably require, including, but not limited to
attestations that each Lease covered thereby is in full force and effect with no
defaults thereunder on the part of any party, that none of the Rents have been
paid more than one month in advance, except as security, and that the Tenant
claims no defense or offset against the full and timely performance of its
obligations under the Lease.

         SECTION 5.13. LEASING MATTERS.

         (a)      Except as otherwise consented to by Lender in writing, all
Leases shall be written on the standard form of lease which shall have been (i)
with respect to pad Leases, delivered to Lender in connection with the closing
of the Loan and (ii) with respect to Operating Leases or Ground Leases, if any,
approved by Lender, provided however that Lender acknowledges that to the extent
any portion of the Property consists of a recreational vehicle resort, Borrower
shall not be required to enter into written Leases with any occupant or tenant
of such portion of the Property and such tenants and/or occupants of such
recreational vehicle resorts shall be deemed month to month tenants or licensees
of Borrower. So long as either Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal
Affiliate is Borrower under the Loan, Borrower may modify its standard form of
pad lease in accordance with sound business practices and Legal Requirements,
provided that the form of such Lease contains covenants and conditions that are
consistent with those contained in comparable leases in the applicable local
market. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the majority of owners,
managers and/or operators of comparable recreational vehicle resorts in the
applicable local market enter into written Leases with the occupants of
recreational vehicle resorts, Borrower shall be required to enter into written
Leases with respect to such occupants, and the form of such lease shall contain
terms and conditions that are consistent with those of Leases of comparable
properties in the applicable market or sub-market. Upon request, Borrower (1)
shall furnish Lender with executed copies of all Major Leases and (2) shall make
available to Lender at Borrower's offices (upon reasonable notice to Borrower),
executed copies of all other Leases. No material changes may be made to the
Lender-approved standard form of Operating Lease and Ground Lease, if
applicable, without the prior written consent of Lender. In addition, all
renewals of Leases and all proposed leases shall provide for rental rates and
terms comparable to existing local market rates and terms and, except with
respect to one pad at the Property used for on-site community managers (or other
employees of

                                     - 45 -

<PAGE>

Manager), shall be arm's-length transactions with bona fide, independent third
party tenants. All proposed Major Leases and renewals of existing Major Leases
shall be subject to the prior approval of Lender and its counsel, at Borrower's
expense. All Leases shall provide that they are subordinate to the Mortgage and
that the tenant agrees to attorn to Lender.

         (b)      Borrower (i) shall observe and perform all the obligations
imposed upon the landlord under the Leases and shall not do or permit to be done
anything to impair the value of the Leases as security for the Debt; (ii) shall
enforce all of the material terms, covenants and conditions contained in the
Leases upon the part of the Tenant thereunder to be observed or performed, short
of termination thereof; provided however, with respect to pad leases, a pad
Lease may be terminated in the event of a default by the tenant thereunder;
(iii) with respect to any Leases (other than Leases relating to mobile home park
pads or recreational vehicle resort pads), shall not collect any of the Rents
more than one (1) month in advance; provided, however, that in no event shall
Borrower collect any Rents under Leases (or any other applicable occupancy
agreements (written or otherwise)) relating to mobile home park pads or
recreational vehicle resort pads more than one (1) year in advance; (iv) shall
not execute any other assignment of the landlord's interest in the Leases or the
Rents; and (v) shall not consent to any assignment of or subletting under the
Major Leases not in accordance with their terms, without the prior written
consent of Lender.

         (c)      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) above,
renewals of existing commercial Leases and proposed Leases for commercial space
shall not be subject to the prior approval of Lender, provided all of the
following conditions are satisfied: (i) the rental income pursuant to the
renewal or proposed Lease is not more than five (5%) percent of the total rental
income for the Property, (ii) the renewal or proposed Lease has a base term of
less than six (6) years including options to renew, (iii) no rent, credits, free
rents or concessions have been granted under the renewal or proposed Lease
(except to the extent consistent with current market conditions), (iv) the
renewal or proposed Lease is subject and subordinate to the Mortgage and the
tenant thereunder shall have agreed to attorn to Lender, (v) the renewal or
proposed Lease is on the standard form of lease approved by Lender, (vi) the
renewal or proposed Lease does not contain any option, offer, right of first
refusal, or other similar right to acquire all or any portion of the Property,
and (vii) except with respect to the Operating Lease the renewal or proposed
Lease provides for rental rates and terms comparable to existing market rates
and terms and is an arm's-length transaction with a bona fide, independent third
party tenant. Borrower shall deliver to Lender copies of all Leases which are
entered into pursuant to the preceding sentence together with Borrower's
certification that it has satisfied all of the conditions of the preceding
sentence within thirty (30) days after the execution of the Lease.

         SECTION 5.14. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT

         (a)      Borrower shall (i) promptly perform and observe all of the

under the Management Agreement of which it is aware; (iii) promptly deliver to
Lender a copy of any notice of default or other material notice received by
Borrower under the Management Agreement; (iv) promptly give notice to Lender of

Agreement or that Manager is otherwise discontinuing its management of the
Property; and (v) promptly enforce the performance and observance of all of the
covenants required to be performed and observed by Manager under the Management
Agreement.

         (b)      If at any time, (i) an Event of Default under Section 11.1(a)
hereof has occurred and is continuing; or (ii) Manager is not an Affiliated
Manager and either (A) a default has occurred and is continuing under the
Management Agreement or (B) Manager has become insolvent or a debtor in a
bankruptcy proceeding, Borrower shall, at the request of Lender, terminate the
Management Agreement upon thirty (30) days prior notice to Manager and replace
Manager with a Qualified Manager approved by Lender on terms and conditions
satisfactory to Lender, it being understood and agreed that the management fee
for such replacement manager shall not exceed then prevailing market rates.

         (c)      Intentionally deleted.

         (d)      Any entity Controlled by MHC or MHCOP shall be deemed
Qualified Manager. Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of
Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or

otherwise replace Manager or enter into any other management agreement with
respect to the Property; (ii) reduce or consent to the reduction of the term of
the Management Agreement; (iii) increase or consent to the increase of the

the right to enter into amendments to the Management Agreement (1) which are
consistent with good operating practices, (2) which do not increase any of the
fees or other similar charges payable by Borrower thereunder and (3) which do
not otherwise materially increase any of Borrower's obligations thereunder, and
Borrower shall have the right to enter into a new management agreement with
another entity Controlled by MHC or MHCOP on substantially the same terms and
conditions as those set forth in the Management Agreement approved by Lender in
connection with the closing of the Loan and otherwise in accordance with the
terms permitted hereunder, without the consent of Lender. In the event that
Borrower replaces Manager at any time during the term of Loan pursuant to this
subsection, such Manager shall be a Qualified Manager.

         SECTION 5.15. LIENS

         Borrower shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on any portion of the Property
or permit any such action to be taken, except Permitted Encumbrances.

         SECTION 5.16. DEBT CANCELLATION

         SECTION 5.17. ZONING

         Borrower shall not initiate or consent to any zoning reclassification
of any portion of the Property or seek any variance under any existing zoning
ordinance or use or permit the use of any portion of the Property in any manner
that could result in such use becoming a non-conforming use under any zoning
ordinance or any other applicable land use law, rule or regulation, without the
prior written consent of Lender.

         SECTION 5.18. ERISA

         (a)      Borrower shall not engage in any transaction which would cause
any obligation, or action taken or to be taken, hereunder (or the exercise by
Lender of any of its rights under the Note, this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents) to be a non-exempt (under a statutory or administrative class
exemption) prohibited transaction under ERISA.

         (b)      Borrower further covenants and agrees to deliver to Lender
such certifications or other evidence from time to time throughout the term of
the Loan, as requested by Lender in its sole discretion, that (i) Borrower is

statutes regulating investments and fiduciary obligations with respect to
governmental plans; and (iii) one or more of the following circumstances is
true:

                           (A)      Equity interests in Borrower are publicly
                  offered securities, within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
                  Section 2510.3-101(b)(2);

                           (B)      Less than twenty-five percent (25%) of each

                  "benefit plan investors" within the meaning of 29 C.F.R.
                  Section 2510.3-101(f)(2); or

                           (C)      Borrower qualifies as an "operating company"
                  or a "real estate operating company" within the meaning of 29

not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Borrower shall enforce,
comply with, and cause each of the parties to the REA to comply with all of the
material economic terms and conditions contained in the REA. Lender acknowledges

<PAGE>

into an REA with an Affiliate owning property adjacent to the Property with

that (A) any such REA would not (i) have a material adverse affect on the
Property or the Borrower, (ii) impose any material obligations on the Borrower,
(B) the terms of any such REA provide that Borrower shall be paid fair market
value for the use of such amenities and/or facilities under any such REA and (C)

alterations to any Improvements, exclusive of alterations to tenant spaces
required under any Lease, (a) that may have a material adverse effect on the
Property or (b) that, together with any other alterations undertaken at the same
time (including any related alterations, improvements or replacements), are
reasonably anticipated to have a cost in excess of the Alteration Threshold.
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) above and provided that either
the Original Borrower or a Borrower Principal Affiliate is Borrower under the
Loan, Lender's prior approval shall not be required in connection with any
alterations in excess of the Alteration Threshold, provided that Lender shall
have received (a) a current Appraisal of the Property (or a letter update to the

the real estate collateral portion of the Property, as determined by a prudent
institutional secondary market lender. If the total unpaid amounts incurred and
to be incurred with respect to such alterations to the Improvements shall at any
time exceed the Alteration Threshold and regardless of whether Lender's consent
is required in connection with any such alterations, Borrower shall promptly
deliver to Lender as security for the payment of such amounts and as additional
security for Borrower's obligations under the Loan Documents any of the
following: (i) cash, (ii) direct non-callable obligations of the United States
of America or other obligations which are "government securities" within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, to the extent
acceptable to the applicable Rating Agencies, (iii) other securities acceptable
to Lender and the Rating Agencies, or (iv) a completion bond, provided that such
completion bond is acceptable to the Lender and the Rating Agencies. Such
security shall be in an amount equal to the excess of the total unpaid amounts
incurred and to be incurred with respect to such alterations to the Improvements
over the Alteration Threshold.

         SECTION 5.22. TAX CREDITS

         Borrower shall not claim a low income housing credit for the Property

                                ENTITY COVENANTS

         SECTION 6.1. SINGLE PURPOSE ENTITY/SEPARATENESS

         Until the Debt has been paid in full, Borrower represents, warrants and

                  (iv)     fail to observe all organizational formalities, or

         days past the date incurred and paid on or prior to such date, and/or
         (C) financing leases and purchase money indebtedness incurred in the
         ordinary course of business relating to Personal Property on

                  (viii)   fail to maintain its records, books of account, bank
         accounts, financial statements, accounting records and other entity
         documents separate and apart from those of any other Person; except
         that Borrower's financial position, assets, liabilities, net worth and
         operating results may be included in the consolidated financial
         statements of an Affiliate, provided that such consolidated financial
         statements indicate that Borrower is a separate legal entity and that
         it maintains separate books and records;

                  (ix)     enter into any contract or agreement with any general
         partner, member, shareholder, principal, guarantor of the obligations
         of Borrower, or any Affiliate of the foregoing, except upon terms and
         conditions that are intrinsically fair, commercially reasonable and
         substantially similar to those that would be available on an
         arm's-length basis with unaffiliated third parties;

                  (x)      maintain its assets in such a manner that it will be

         out its credit as being available to satisfy the obligations of any
         other Person;

                  (xii)    make any loans or advances to any Person;

                  (xiii)   fail to file its own tax returns or files a

         Requirements);

                  (xiv)    fail either to hold itself out to the public as a
         legal entity separate and distinct from any other Person or to conduct

                  (xv)     fail to maintain adequate capital for the normal
         obligations reasonably foreseeable in a business of its size and
         character and in light of its contemplated business operations,
         provided, however, that any such failure to maintain adequate capital
         will not constitute a breach of this covenant if cash flow from the
         Property is insufficient for Borrower to maintain adequate capital as
         set forth above;;

                  (xvi)    if it is a partnership or limited liability company,
         without the unanimous written consent of all of its partners or

         of Borrower (if any), including, without limitation, each Independent
         Director, (a) file or consent to the filing of any petition, either
         voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any Creditors Rights
         Laws, (b) seek or consent to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator
         or any similar official, (c) take any action that might cause such

                  (xvii)   fail to allocate shared expenses (including, without
         limitation, shared office space and services performed by an employee
         of an Affiliate) among the Persons sharing such expenses and to use
         separate stationery, invoices and checks;

                  (xviii)  make any distributions so as to render Borrower
         insolvent or cause Borrower to become unable to pay its own liabilities
         (including, without limitation, the salaries of its own employees, if
         any) from its own funds;

                  (xix)    acquire obligations or securities of its partners,
         members, shareholders or other affiliates, as applicable; or

                  (xx)     violate or cause to be violated the assumptions made
         with respect to Borrower and its principals in any opinion letter
         pertaining to substantive consolidation delivered to Lender in
         connection with the Loan; or

                  (xxi)    If Borrower is a partnership or limited liability
         company, each general partner in the case of a general partnership,
         each general partner in the case of a limited partnership, or the
         managing member in the case of a limited liability company (each an
         "SPE COMPONENT ENTITY") of Borrower, as applicable, shall be a
         corporation or a single member Delaware limited liability company whose
         sole asset is its interest in Borrower. Each SPE Component Entity (i)
         will at all times comply with each of the covenants, terms and
         provisions contained in Section 6.1(a)(iii) - (vi) and (viii) - (xxi),
         as if such representation, warranty or covenant was made directly by
         such SPE Component Entity; (ii) will not engage in any business or
         activity other than owning an interest in Borrower; (iii) will not
         acquire or own any assets other than its partnership, membership, or

         secured or unsecured, direct or contingent (including guaranteeing any
         obligation); (v) will at all times when the Loan is outstanding own at

         managing membership interest in Borrower; and (vi) will cause Borrower
         to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.1 and Section 6.4.
         Prior to the withdrawal or the disassociation of any SPE Component
         Entity from Borrower, Borrower shall immediately appoint a new general
         partner or managing member whose articles of incorporation or limited
         liability company operating agreement, as applicable, are substantially
         similar to those of such SPE Component Entity and, if an opinion letter
         pertaining to substantive consolidation was required at closing,
         deliver a new opinion letter acceptable to Lender and the Rating
         Agencies with respect to the new SPE Component Entity and its equity
         owners. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent Borrower is a
         single member Delaware limited liability company, so long as Borrower
         maintains such formation status, no SPE Component Entity shall be
         required.

         (b)      In the event Borrower is a single member Delaware limited
liability company, the limited liability company agreement of Borrower (the "LLC
AGREEMENT") shall provide that (i) upon the occurrence of any event that causes
the sole member of Borrower ("MEMBER") to cease to be the member of Borrower
(other than (A) upon an assignment by Member of all of its limited liability
company interest in Borrower and the admission of the transferee in accordance
with the Loan Documents and the LLC Agreement, or (B) the resignation of Member
and the admission of an additional member of Borrower in accordance with the
terms of the Loan

Documents and the LLC Agreement), any person acting as Independent Director of
Borrower shall, without any action of any other Person and simultaneously with
the Member ceasing to be the member of Borrower, automatically be admitted to
Borrower ("SPECIAL MEMBER") and shall continue Borrower without dissolution and
(ii) Special Member may not resign from Borrower or transfer its rights as
Special Member unless (A) a successor Special Member has been admitted to
Borrower as Special Member in accordance with requirements of Delaware law and
(B) such successor Special Member has also accepted its appointment as an
Independent Director. The LLC Agreement shall further provide that (i) Special
Member shall automatically cease to be a member of Borrower upon the admission
to Borrower of a substitute Member, (ii) Special Member shall be a member of
Borrower that has no interest in the profits, losses and capital of Borrower and
has no right to receive any distributions of Borrower assets, (iii) pursuant to
Section 18-301 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the "ACT"),
Special Member shall not be required to make any capital contributions to
Borrower and shall not receive a limited liability company interest in Borrower,
(iv) Special Member, in its capacity as Special Member, may not bind Borrower
and (v) except as required by any mandatory provision of the Act, Special
Member, in its capacity as Special Member, shall have no right to vote on,
approve or otherwise consent to any action by, or matter relating to, Borrower,
including, without limitation, the merger, consolidation or conversion of
Borrower; provided, however, such prohibition shall not limit the obligations of
Special Member, in its capacity as Independent Director, to vote on such matters
required by the Loan Documents or the LLC Agreement. In order to implement the
admission to Borrower of Special Member, Special Member shall execute a
counterpart to the LLC Agreement. Prior to its admission to Borrower as Special
Member, Special Member shall not be a member of Borrower.

         Upon the occurrence of any event that causes the Member to cease to be
a member of Borrower, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the personal
representative of Member shall, within ninety (90) days after the occurrence of
the event that terminated the continued membership of Member in Borrower, agree
in writing (i) to continue Borrower and (ii) to the admission of the personal
representative or its nominee or designee, as the case may be, as a substitute
member of Borrower, effective as of the occurrence of the event that terminated
the continued membership of Member of Borrower in Borrower. Any action initiated
by or brought against Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws
shall not cause Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of Borrower and
upon the occurrence of such an event, the business of Borrower shall continue
without dissolution. The LLC Agreement shall provide that each of Member and
Special Member waives any right it might have to agree in writing to dissolve
Borrower upon the occurrence of any action initiated by or brought against
Member or Special Member under any Creditors Rights Laws, or the occurrence of
an event that causes Member or Special Member to cease to be a member of
Borrower.

         SECTION 6.2. CHANGE OF NAME, IDENTITY OR STRUCTURE

         Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed (a) Borrower's name,
(b) Borrower's identity (including its trade name or names), (c) Borrower's
principal place of business set forth on the first page of this Agreement, (d)
the corporate, partnership or other organizational structure of Borrower, each
SPE Component Entity (if any), or Borrower Principal, (e) Borrower's state of
organization, or (f) Borrower's organizational identification number, without in
each case notifying Lender of such change in writing at least thirty (30) days
prior to

                                     - 53 -

<PAGE>

the effective date of such change and, in the case of a change in Borrower's
structure, without first obtaining the prior written consent of Lender. In
addition, Borrower shall not change or permit to be changed any organizational
documents of Borrower or any SPE Component Entity (if any) if such change would
adversely impact the covenants set forth in Section 6.1 and Section 6.4 hereof.
Borrower authorizes Lender to file any financing statement or financing
statement amendment required by Lender to establish or maintain the validity,
perfection and priority of the security interest granted herein. At the request
of Lender, Borrower shall execute a certificate in form satisfactory to Lender
listing the trade names under which Borrower intends to operate the Property,
and representing and warranting that Borrower does business under no other trade
name with respect to the Property. If Borrower does not now have an
organizational identification number and later obtains one, or if the
organizational identification number assigned to Borrower subsequently changes,
Borrower shall promptly notify Lender of such organizational identification
number or change.

         SECTION 6.3. BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

         Borrower will qualify to do business and will remain in good standing
under the laws of the State as and to the extent the same are required for the
ownership, maintenance, management and operation of the Property.

         SECTION 6.4. INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR

         (a)      The organizational documents of Borrower or each SPE Component
Entity (if any), as applicable, shall provide that at all times there shall be,
and Borrower shall cause there to be, at least one manager (each an "INDEPENDENT
DIRECTOR") of Borrower or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, reasonably
satisfactory to Lender each of whom are not at the time of such individual's
initial appointment, and shall not have been at any time during the preceding
five (5) years, and shall not be at any time while serving as a director of

liability companies), employee, attorney or counsel of, Borrower, such SPE
Component Entity or any of their respective shareholders, partners, members,
subsidiaries or affiliates; (ii) a customer or creditor of, or supplier to,
Borrower or any of its respective shareholders, partners, members, subsidiaries
or affiliates who derives any of its purchases or revenue from its activities
with Borrower or such SPE Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of them;
(iii) a Person who Controls or is under common Control with any such
shareholder, officer, director, partner, manager, member, employee, supplier,
creditor or customer; or (iv) a member of the immediate family of any such
shareholder, officer, director, partner, manager, member, employee, supplier,
creditor or customer.

         (b)      The organizational documents of Borrower or each SPE Component
Entity (if any), as the case may be, shall provide that the manager of Borrower
or such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, shall not take any action which,
under the terms of any articles of organization or operating agreement, as
applicable, requires an unanimous vote of the members and manager of Borrower or
such SPE Component Entity, as the case may be, unless at the time of such action
there shall be at least one manager who is an Independent Director. Borrower or
such SPE Component Entity, as applicable, will not, without the unanimous
written consent of

                                     - 54 -

its members and managers, including each Independent Director, on behalf of
itself or Borrower, (i) file or consent to the filing of any petition, either
voluntary or involuntary, to take advantage of any applicable Creditors Rights
Laws; (ii) seek or consent to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator or any

less than thirty (30) days prior written notice of such proposed transfer or
(iii) the sale, transfer or issuance of stock in MHC provided that MHC is listed

Restricted Party shall comply with the requirements of Section 7.4 hereof,
provided however, that with respect to transfers provided for in subsection
(a)(iii) hereof, Borrower shall not be required to deliver a revised substantive
non-consolidation opinion to Lender in connection with any such transfers.

         (b)      In addition to the foregoing and supplementing subsection (a)
above, Lender's prior written consent shall not be required with respect to (i)
direct or indirect transfers of interests in Borrower among MHC, MHCOP and their
Affiliates, (ii) transfers of limited partnership interests in MHCOP, provided

(iii) the merger or consolidation of MHC or MHCOP without regard to whether MHC

Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in Section 7.4 hereof, Borrower shall

(b)(ii),(iii) and (iv). "MHC SUBSIDIARY" means an entity (A) in which MHC

         SECTION 7.4. LENDER'S RIGHTS

         Lender reserves the right to condition the consent to a Prohibited
Transfer requested hereunder upon (a) a modification of the terms hereof and an
assumption of the Note and the other Loan Documents as so modified by the
proposed Prohibited Transfer, (b) receipt of payment of a transfer fee equal to
one percent (1%) of the outstanding principal balance of the Loan and all of
Lender's expenses incurred in connection with such Prohibited Transfer, (c)

                                     - 56 -

<PAGE>

receipt of written confirmation from the Rating Agencies that the Prohibited
Transfer will not result in a downgrade, withdrawal or qualification of the
initial, or if higher, then current ratings issued in connection with a
Securitization, or if a Securitization has not occurred, any ratings to be
assigned in connection with a Securitization, (d) the proposed transferee's
continued compliance with the covenants set forth in this Agreement (including,
without limitation, the covenants in Article 6) and the other Loan Documents,
(e) a new manager for the Property and a new management agreement satisfactory
to Lender, and (f) the satisfaction of such other conditions and/or legal
opinions as Lender shall determine in its sole discretion to be in the interest
of Lender. All expenses incurred by Lender shall be payable by Borrower whether
or not Lender consents to the Prohibited Transfer. Lender shall not be required
to demonstrate any actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of
default hereunder in order to declare the Debt immediately due and payable upon
a Prohibited Transfer made without Lender's consent. This provision shall apply
to each and every Prohibited Transfer, whether or not Lender has consented to
any previous Prohibited Transfer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 7.4, in the event a substantive non-consolidation
opinion was delivered to Lender and the Rating Agencies in connection with the
closing of the Loan, and if any Sale or Pledge permitted under this Article 7
results in any Person and its Affiliates owning in excess of forty-nine percent
(49%) of the ownership interests in a Restricted Party, Borrower shall, prior to
such transfer, and in addition to any other requirement for Lender consent
contained herein, deliver a revised substantive non-consolidation opinion to
Lender reflecting such Prohibited Transfer, which opinion shall be in form,
scope and substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating
Agencies.

         SECTION 7.5. ASSUMPTION

         Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 7, Lender
shall not unreasonably withhold consent to a transfer of the Property in its
entirety to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, any Person (a
"TRANSFEREE") and Lender shall release Borrower and Borrower Principal from
their obligations under the Loan (to the extent such obligations arise from
events occurring after the date of the assumption), provided that each of the
following terms and conditions are satisfied:

all such information concerning the proposed Transferee as Lender shall
reasonably require and (ii) paid to Lender a non-refundable processing fee in
the amount of $10,000 (which fee shall be credited against the assumption fee
payable in connection with such assumption). Lender shall have the right to
approve or disapprove the proposed transfer based on its then current
underwriting and credit requirements for similar loans secured by similar
properties which loans are sold in the secondary market, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld. In determining whether to give or withhold its approval
of the proposed transfer, Lender shall consider the experience and track record
of Transferee and its principals in owning and operating facilities similar to
the Property, the financial strength of Transferee and its principals, the
general business standing of Transferee and its principals and Transferee's and
its principals' relationships and experience with

contractors, vendors, tenants, lenders and other business entities; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding Lender's agreement to consider the foregoing
factors in determining whether to give or withhold such approval, such approval

reasonable and, if given, may be given subject to such conditions as Lender may
deem reasonably appropriate;

closing of such transfer, (i) a non-refundable assumption fee in an amount equal
to one percent (1.0%) of the then outstanding principal balance of the Note
(subject to credit for any previously paid non-refundable processing fees), and
(ii) all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred by Lender in connection with the transfer;

         (d)      Transferee assumes and agrees to pay the Debt as and when due
subject to the provisions of Article 15 hereof and, prior to or concurrently
with the closing of such transfer, Transferee and its constituent partners,
members or shareholders as Lender may require, shall execute, without any cost
or expense to Lender, such documents and agreements as Lender shall reasonably
require to evidence and effectuate said assumption;

         (e)      Borrower and Transferee, without any cost to Lender, shall
furnish any information requested by Lender for the preparation of, and shall
authorize Lender to file, new financing statements and financing statement
amendments and other documents to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, and shall execute any additional documents reasonably requested by Lender;

certificates and other similar materials as Lender may deem necessary at the
time of the transfer, all in form and substance satisfactory to Lender;

         (g)      Transferee shall have furnished to Lender, if Transferee is a
corporation, partnership, limited liability company or other entity, all
appropriate papers evidencing Transferee's organization and good standing, and
the qualification of the signers to execute the assumption of the Debt, which
papers shall include certified copies of all documents relating to the
organization and formation of Transferee and of the entities, if any, which are
partners or members of Transferee. Transferee and such constituent partners,
members or shareholders of Transferee (as the case may be), as Lender shall
require, shall comply with the covenants set forth in Article 6 hereof;

         (h)      Transferee shall assume the obligations of Borrower under any
Management Agreement or provide a new management agreement with a new manager
which meets with the requirements of Section 5.14 hereof and assign to Lender as
additional security such new management agreement;

         (i)      Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
Lender and its counsel (A) that Transferee's formation documents provide for the
matters described in subparagraph (g) above, (B) that the assumption of the Debt
has been duly authorized, executed

                                     - 58 -

agreement and the other Loan Documents are valid, binding and enforceable
against Transferee in accordance with their terms, (C) that Transferee and any
entity which is a controlling stockholder, member or general partner of
Transferee, have been duly organized, and are in existence and good standing,
and (E) with respect to such other matters as Lender may reasonably request;

         (j)      if required by Lender, Lender shall have received confirmation
in writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that
the transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

         (k)      Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale pursuant to
which the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject to the
satisfaction of the terms and conditions of this Section 7.5; and

substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies.

A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of the Property in its entirety
to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, a Transferee pursuant to this
Section 7.5 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of Lender to
consent to any subsequent transfer of the Property. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Section 7.5, prior to a Securitization Lender's
consent to any transfer of the Property and assumption of the Loan pursuant to
this Section 7.5 shall not be required if the consideration to be paid to
Borrower by the proposed Transferee is less than the appraised value of the
Property as determined by Lender.

         SECTION 7.7. ASSUMPTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN TRANSFERS TO

directly or indirectly, at least a 99% ownership interest (an "AFFILIATE

other things, each of the following conditions are satisfied:

         (a)      no Default or Event of Default has occurred;

         (b)      Borrower shall have (i) delivered written notice to Lender of

and (ii) paid to Lender a non-refundable processing fee in the amount of
$10,000;

         (c)      Borrower shall have paid to Lender all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred
by Lender in connection with the transfer and assumption;

         (d)      Affiliate Transferee assumes and agrees to pay the Debt as and

the assumption of the Debt, which papers shall include certified copies of all
documents relating to the organization and formation of Affiliate Transferee and
of the entities, if any, which are partners or members of Affiliate Transferee.
Affiliate Transferee and such constituent partners, members or shareholders of
Affiliate Transferee (as the case may be), as Lender shall require, shall comply
with the covenants set forth in Article 6 hereof;

         (g)      Affiliate Transferee shall (i) assume the obligations of

water treatment facility and operated solely by Affiliate Transferee (and
Manager does not perform any services with respect to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property), Affiliate Transferee shall not be required to assume
the obligations of Borrower under the Management Agreement, and (ii) if
applicable, execute an assignment to Lender of such Management Agreement as
additional security for the Loan;

         (h)      Affiliate Transferee shall furnish an opinion of counsel
satisfactory to Lender and its counsel (A) that Affiliate Transferee's formation

in writing from the Rating Agencies that rate the Securities to the effect that
the transfer will not result in a qualification, downgrade or withdrawal of any
rating initially assigned or to be assigned to the Securities;

         (j)      Borrower's obligations under the contract of sale, if any,
pursuant to which the transfer is proposed to occur shall expressly be subject

connection with the closing of the Loan, Borrower and Affiliate Transferee
shall, prior to such transfer and assumption, deliver a new or updated
Insolvency Opinion to Lender, which opinion shall be in form, scope and
substance acceptable in all respects to Lender and the Rating Agencies;

         (l)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence which would be
satisfactory to a prudent lender that (i) the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property has been legally split or subdivided from the remainder of the
Property; (ii) after giving effect to such transfer, each of the Affiliate
Transfer Portion of the Property and the balance of the Property conforms and is
in compliance in all material respects with applicable Legal Requirements and
constitutes a separate tax lot and (iii) the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property is not necessary for the Property to comply with any zoning, building,
land use or parking or other Legal Requirements applicable to the Property or
for the then current use of the Property, including, without limitation, for
access, driveways, parking, utilities or drainage or, to the extent that the
Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property is necessary for any such purposes, a
reciprocal easement agreement has been executed and recorded that would allow
the owner of the Property to continue to use the Affiliate Transfer Portion of
the Property to the extent necessary for such purposes;

         (m)      Borrower shall deliver to Lender an endorsement to the Title
Insurance Policy (i) extending the effective date of the Title Insurance Policy
to the effective date of the transfer; (ii) confirming no change in the priority
of the Mortgage on the Property (including the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property) or in the amount of the insurance or the coverage of the Property
under the Title Insurance Policy; and (iii) insuring the rights and benefits
under any new or amended reciprocal easement agreement or such other agreement
required pursuant to subsection 7.7(l)(iii) hereof that has been executed and
recorded, if any. Borrower shall have delivered to Lender, without any cost or
expense to Lender, such endorsements to Lender's Title Insurance Policy insuring
that fee simple or leasehold title to the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the
Property, as applicable, is vested in Affiliate Transferee (subject to Permitted

requirements applicable to the transfer in any Major Leases, REA's, operating
agreements, parking agreements or other similar agreements affecting the
Property or the Affiliate Transfer Portion of the Property and the transfer does
not violate any of the provisions of such documents in any respect that would
result in a termination (or give any other party thereto the right to
terminate), extinguishment or other loss of material right of Borrower or in a
material increase in Borrower's obligations under such documents and, to the
extent necessary to comply with such documents, the Affiliate Transferee has
assumed Borrower's obligations, if any, relating to the Affiliate Transfer
Portion of the Property under such documents; and

         (p)      if a securitization shall have occurred, Borrower shall
deliver to Lender one or more opinions of counsel for Borrower and Affiliate
Transferee in form and substance and delivered by counsel which would be
satisfactory to a prudent lender stating, among other things, that the transfer
and assumption by Affiliate Transferee pursuant to this Section 7.7 (1) will not
directly or indirectly result in or cause any REMIC Trust that then holds the
Note to fail to maintain its status as a REMIC Trust and (2) will not cause any
REMIC Trust to be an "investment company" under the Investment Company Act of
1940, at Borrower's cost; and

         (q)      Borrower delivers to Lender any other information, approvals
and documents which would be required by a prudent Lender in connection with
such transfer and assumption.

         A consent by Lender with respect to a transfer of a portion of the
Property to, and the related assumption of the Loan by, an Affiliate Transferee
pursuant to this Section 7.7 shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right
of Lender to consent to any subsequent transfer of the Property or assumption of
the Loan. Notwithstanding any transfer and assumption to an Affiliate Transferee
pursuant to this Section 7.7, the Property and the Affiliate Transfer Portion of
the Property shall be deemed a single Property for purposes of this Agreement
and the Loan.

         SECTION 7.8. ADDITIONAL PERMITTED TRANSFERS.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article 7,
Borrower may grant easements, restrictions, covenants, reservations and rights
of way with respect to the Property in the ordinary course of business for water
and sewer lines, telephone and telegraph lines, electric lines and other
utilities or for other similar purposes, provided that such transfers,
conveyances or encumbrances (i) shall not impair the utility and operation of
the Property or materially adversely affect the value of the Property or
adversely affect Borrower's ability to pay the Debt or the Monthly Payment
Amount and (ii) shall be in a form that is reasonably acceptable to Lender.

         expiration of twelve (12) months, whichever first occurs, and
         notwithstanding that the policy may expire prior to the end of such
         period; and (D) which contains an extended period of indemnity
         endorsement which provides that after the physical loss to the

         hereof and at least once each year thereafter based on Borrower's
         reasonable estimate of the gross income from the Property for the

         Lender pursuant to this subsection shall be held by Lender and shall be
         applied to the obligations secured by the Loan Documents from time to

         Agreement and the other Loan Documents except to the extent such

         provided for in subsection (i) above written in a so-called Builder's
         Risk Completed Value form (1) on a non-reporting basis, (2) against
         "all risks" insured against pursuant to subsection (i) above, (3)

         to time may reasonably request against such other insurable hazards
         which at the time are commonly insured against for property similar to
         the Property located in or around the region in which the Property is
         located.

         (b)      All insurance provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall be obtained
under valid and enforceable policies (collectively, the "POLICIES" or in the
singular, the "POLICY"), and shall be subject to the approval of Lender as to
insurance companies, amounts, deductibles, loss payees and insureds. The

deliver to Lender renewal Policies

         (c)      Any blanket insurance Policy shall specifically allocate to
the Property the amount of coverage from time to time required hereunder and
shall otherwise provide the same protection as would a separate Policy insuring
only the Property in compliance with the provisions of Section 8.1(a).

         (d)      All Policies provided for or contemplated by Section 8.1(a),
except for the Policy referenced in Section 8.1(a)(v), shall name Borrower as
the insured, as its interests may appear, and in the case of property damage,
boiler and machinery, flood and earthquake insurance, shall contain a so-called
New York standard non-contributing mortgagee clause in favor of Lender providing
that the loss thereunder shall be payable to Lender.

         (e)      All Policies provided for in Section 8.1(a) shall contain
clauses or endorsements to the effect that:

                  (i)      no act or negligence of Borrower, or anyone acting
         for Borrower, or of any Tenant or other occupant, or failure to comply
         with the provisions of any Policy, which might otherwise result in a
         forfeiture of the insurance or any part thereof, shall in any way
         affect the validity or enforceability of the insurance insofar as
         Lender is concerned;

                  (ii)     the Policies shall not be materially changed (other
         than to increase the coverage provided thereby) or canceled without at
         least thirty (30) days' prior written notice to Lender and any other
         party named therein as an additional insured;

                  (iii)    the issuers thereof shall give written notice to
         Lender if the Policies have not been renewed thirty (30) days prior to
         its expiration; and

                  (iv)     Lender shall not be liable for any Insurance Premiums
         thereon or subject to any assessments thereunder.

         (f)      If at any time Lender is not in receipt of written evidence
that all insurance required hereunder is in full force and effect, Lender shall
have the right, without notice to Borrower, to take such action as Lender deems
necessary to protect its interest in the Property, including, without
limitation, obtaining such insurance coverage as Lender in its sole discretion
deems appropriate. All premiums incurred by Lender in connection with such
action or in obtaining such insurance and keeping it in effect shall be paid by
Borrower to Lender upon demand and, until paid, shall be secured by the Mortgage
and shall bear interest at the Default Rate.

         SECTION 8.2. CASUALTY

         If the Property shall be damaged or destroyed, in whole or in part in
any material respect, by fire or other casualty (a "CASUALTY"), Borrower shall
give prompt notice of such damage to Lender and shall promptly commence and
diligently prosecute the Restoration of the Property in accordance with Section
8.4, whether or not Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section
8.4. Borrower shall pay all costs of such Restoration whether or not such costs
are covered by insurance. Lender may, but shall not be obligated to make proof
of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Borrower shall adjust all claims for
Insurance Proceeds in consultation with, and approval of, Lender; provided,
however, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall
have the exclusive right to participate in the adjustment of all claims for
Insurance Proceeds.

         SECTION 8.3. CONDEMNATION

         Borrower shall promptly give Lender notice of the actual or threatened
commencement of any proceeding for the Condemnation of the Property of which
Borrower has knowledge and shall deliver to Lender copies of any and all papers
served in connection with such proceedings. Lender may participate in any such
proceedings, and Borrower shall from time to time deliver to Lender all
instruments requested by it to permit such participation. Borrower shall, at its
expense, diligently prosecute any such proceedings, and shall consult with
Lender, its attorneys and experts, and cooperate with them in the carrying on or
defense of any such proceedings. Notwithstanding any taking by any public or
quasi-public authority through Condemnation or otherwise (including but not
limited to any transfer made in lieu of or in anticipation of the exercise of
such taking), Borrower shall continue to pay the Debt at the time and in the
manner provided for its payment in the Note and in this Agreement and the Debt
shall not be reduced until any Award shall have been actually received and
applied by Lender, after the deduction of expenses of collection, to the
reduction or discharge of the Debt. Lender shall not be limited to the interest
paid on the Award by the condemning authority but shall be entitled to receive
out of the Award interest at the rate or rates provided herein or in the Note.
If the Property or any portion thereof is taken by a condemning authority,
Borrower shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute the Restoration of the
Property and otherwise comply with the provisions of Section 8.4, whether or not
Lender makes any Net Proceeds available pursuant to Section 8.4. If the Property
is sold, through foreclosure or otherwise, prior to the receipt by Lender of the
Award, Lender shall have the right, whether or not a deficiency judgment on the
Note shall have been sought, recovered or denied, to receive the Award, or a
portion thereof sufficient to pay the Debt.

         SECTION 8.4. RESTORATION

         The following provisions shall apply in connection with the Restoration
of the Property:

         (a)      If the Net Proceeds shall be less than $250,000 and the costs
of completing the Restoration shall be less than $250,000, the Net Proceeds will
be disbursed by Lender to Borrower upon receipt, provided that all of the
conditions set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i) are met and Borrower delivers to
Lender a written undertaking to expeditiously commence and to

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

satisfactorily complete with due diligence the Restoration in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

         (b)      If the Net Proceeds are equal to or greater than $250,000 or
the costs of completing the Restoration are equal to or greater than $250,000,
Lender shall make the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 8.4. The term "NET PROCEEDS" for purposes of
this Section 8.4 shall mean: (i) the net amount of all insurance proceeds
received by Lender pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(i), (iv), (vi) and (viii) as a
result of a Casualty, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("INSURANCE PROCEEDS"), or (ii) the net amount of the Award as a result
of a Condemnation, after deduction of its reasonable costs and expenses
(including, but not limited to, reasonable counsel fees), if any, in collecting
the same ("CONDEMNATION PROCEEDS"), whichever the case may be.

                  (i)      The Net Proceeds shall be made available to Borrower
         for Restoration provided that each of the following conditions are met:

                           (A)      no Event of Default shall have occurred and
                  be continuing;

                           (B)      (1) in the event the Net Proceeds are
                  Insurance Proceeds, less than twenty-five percent (25%) of the
                  mobile home and/or recreational vehicle pads, as applicable,
                  on the Property shall be rendered unusable for a period in
                  excess of twelve (12) months as a result of a Casualty or (2)
                  in the event the Net Proceeds are Condemnation Proceeds, less
                  than fifteen percent (15%) of the rentable area of the
                  Property and fifteen percent (15%) of the fair market value of
                  the Land constituting the Property is taken, such land is
                  located along the perimeter or periphery of the Property, and
                  no portion of the permanent Improvements is located on such
                  land;

                           (C)      intentionally deleted;

                           (D)      Borrower shall commence the Restoration as
                  soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than
                  sixty (60) days after such Casualty or Condemnation, whichever
                  the case may be, occurs) and shall diligently pursue the same
                  to satisfactory completion;

                           (E)      Lender shall be satisfied that any operating
                  deficits, including all scheduled payments of principal and
                  interest under the Note, which will be incurred with respect
                  to the Property as a result of the occurrence of any such
                  Casualty or Condemnation, whichever the case may be, will be
                  covered out of the insurance coverage referred to in Section
                  8.1(a)(iii) above;

                           (F)      Lender shall be satisfied that the
                  Restoration will be completed on or before the earliest to
                  occur of (1) six (6) months prior to the Maturity Date, (2)
                  the earliest date required for such completion under the terms
                  of any Major Leases, Ground Leases, if applicable, Operating
                  Leases, if applicable, or material agreements affecting the
                  Property, (3) such time as may be required under

                                      -67-

<PAGE>

                  applicable zoning law, ordinance, rule or regulation, or (4)
                  the expiration of the insurance coverage referred to in
                  Section 8.1(a)(iii);

                           (G)      the Property and the use thereof after the
                  Restoration will be in compliance with and permitted under all
                  Legal Requirements;

                           (H)      the Restoration shall be done and completed
                  by Borrower in an expeditious and diligent fashion and in
                  compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements;

                           (I)      such Casualty or Condemnation, as
                  applicable, does not result in the loss of access to the
                  Property or the Improvements;

                           (J)      Borrower shall deliver, or cause to be
                  delivered, to Lender a signed detailed budget approved in
                  writing by Borrower's architect or engineer stating the entire
                  cost of completing the Restoration, which budget shall be
                  reasonably acceptable to Lender; and

                           (K)      the Net Proceeds together with any cash or
                  cash equivalent deposited by Borrower with Lender are
                  sufficient in Lender's reasonable judgment to cover the cost
                  of the Restoration.

                  (ii)     The Net Proceeds shall be held by Lender until
         disbursements commence, and, until disbursed in accordance with the
         provisions of this Section 8.4, shall constitute additional security
         for the Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents. The Net
         Proceeds shall be disbursed by Lender to, or as directed by, Borrower
         on a monthly basis during the course of the Restoration in accordance
         with customary construction lending practices, upon receipt of evidence
         satisfactory to Lender that (A) all the conditions precedent to such
         advance, including those set forth in Section 8.4(b)(i), have been
         satisfied, (B) all materials installed and work and labor performed
         (except to the extent that they are to be paid for out of the requested
         disbursement) in connection with the related Restoration item have been
         paid for in full, and (C) there exist no notices of pendency, stop
         orders, mechanic's or materialman's liens or notices of intention to
         file same, or any other liens or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever
         on the Property which have not either been fully bonded to the
         satisfaction of Lender and discharged of record or in the alternative
         fully insured to the satisfaction of Lender by the title company
         issuing the Title Insurance Policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
         Insurance Proceeds from the Policies required to be maintained by
         Borrower pursuant to Section 8.1(a)(iii) shall be controlled by Lender
         at all times, shall not be subject to the provisions of this Section
         8.4 and shall be used for the payment of all of the obligations due and
         payable under the Loan Documents for the entire time period for which
         any such Insurance Proceeds relate. After such application of the
         Insurance Proceeds, the remaining balance, if any, of any such proceeds
         shall be disbursed and/or applied as follows: (A) provided no Event of
         Default has occurred and is continuing, to Borrower and (B) upon the
         occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, to
         Operating Expenses.

                  (iii)    All plans and specifications required in connection
         with the Restoration shall be subject to prior review and acceptance in
         all respects by Lender and to the extent the Restoration relates to any
         permanent Improvements on the Property, by an independent consulting
         engineer selected by Lender (the "Restoration Consultant"). Lender
         shall have the use of the plans and specifications and all permits,
         licenses and approvals required or obtained in connection with the
         Restoration. To the extent the Restoration relates to any permanent
         Improvements on the Property, the identity of the contractors,
         subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration, as well as
         the contracts in excess of $100,000 under which they have been engaged,
         shall be subject to prior review and acceptance by Lender and the
         Restoration Consultant. All costs and expenses incurred by Lender in
         connection with making the Net Proceeds available for the Restoration,
         including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees and
         disbursements and the Restoration Consultant's fees, shall be paid by
         Borrower.

                  (iv)     In no event shall Lender be obligated to make
         disbursements of the Net Proceeds in excess of an amount equal to the
         costs actually incurred from time to time for work in place as part of
         the Restoration, as certified by the Restoration Consultant, minus the
         Restoration Retainage. The term "Restoration Retainage" shall mean an
         amount equal to ten percent (10%) of the costs actually incurred for
         work in place as part of the Restoration, as certified by the
         Restoration Consultant, until the Restoration has been completed. The
         Restoration Retainage shall be reduced to five percent (5%) of the
         costs incurred upon receipt by Lender of satisfactory evidence that
         fifty percent (50%) of the Restoration has been completed. The
         Restoration Retainage shall in no event, and notwithstanding anything
         to the contrary set forth above in this Section 8.4(b), be less than
         the amount actually held back by Borrower from contractors,
         subcontractors and materialmen engaged in the Restoration. The
         Restoration Retainage shall not be released until the Restoration
         Consultant certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been completed
         in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b) and that all
         approvals necessary for the re-occupancy and use of the Property have
         been obtained from all appropriate Governmental Authorities, and Lender
         receives evidence satisfactory to Lender that the costs of the
         Restoration have been paid in full or will be paid in full out of the
         Restoration Retainage; provided, however, that Lender will release the
         portion of the Restoration Retainage being held with respect to any
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman engaged in the Restoration as
         of the date upon which the Restoration Consultant certifies to Lender
         that the contractor, subcontractor or materialman has satisfactorily
         completed all work and has supplied all materials in accordance with
         the provisions of the contractor's, subcontractor's or materialman's
         contract, the contractor, subcontractor or materialman delivers the
         lien waivers and evidence of payment in full of all sums due to the
         contractor, subcontractor or materialman as may be reasonably requested
         by Lender or by the title company issuing the Title Insurance Policy,
         and Lender receives an endorsement to the Title Insurance Policy
         insuring the continued priority of the lien of the Mortgage and
         evidence of payment of any premium payable for such endorsement. If
         required by Lender, the release of any such portion of the Restoration
         Retainage shall be approved by the surety company, if any, which has
         issued a payment or performance bond with respect to the contractor,
         subcontractor or materialman.

                  (v)      Lender shall not be obligated to make disbursements
         of the Net Proceeds more frequently than once every calendar month.

                  (vi)     If at any time the Net Proceeds or the undisbursed
         balance thereof shall not, in the reasonable opinion of Lender in
         consultation with the Restoration Consultant, as applicable, be
         sufficient to pay in full the balance of the costs which are estimated
         to be incurred in connection with the completion of the Restoration,
         Borrower shall deposit the deficiency (the "Net Proceeds Deficiency")
         with Lender before any further disbursement of the Net Proceeds shall
         be made. The Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited with Lender shall be
         held by Lender and shall be disbursed for costs actually incurred in
         connection with the Restoration on the same conditions applicable to
         the disbursement of the Net Proceeds, and until so disbursed pursuant
         to this Section 8.4(b) shall constitute additional security for the
         Debt and other obligations under the Loan Documents.

                  (vii)    The excess, if any, of the Net Proceeds and the
         remaining balance, if any, of the Net Proceeds Deficiency deposited
         with Lender after Borrower and the Restoration Consultant, to the
         extent applicable, certifies to Lender that the Restoration has been
         completed in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.4(b), and
         the receipt by Lender of evidence satisfactory to Lender that all costs
         incurred in connection with the Restoration have been paid in full,
         shall be remitted by Lender to Borrower, provided no Event of Default
         shall have occurred and shall be continuing under the Note, this
         Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents.

         (c)      All Net Proceeds not required (i) to be made available for the
Restoration or (ii) to be returned to Borrower as excess Net Proceeds pursuant
to Section 8.4(b)(vii) may (x) be retained and applied by Lender toward the
payment of the Debt whether or not then due and payable in such order, priority
and proportions as Lender in its sole discretion shall deem proper, or, (y) at
the sole discretion of Lender, the same may be paid, either in whole or in part,
to Borrower for such purposes and upon such conditions as Lender shall
designate.

         (d)      In the event of foreclosure of the Mortgage, or other transfer
of title to the Property in extinguishment in whole or in part of the Debt, all
right, title and interest of Borrower in and to the Policies then in force
concerning the Property and all proceeds payable thereunder shall thereupon vest
in the purchaser at such foreclosure, Lender or other transferee in the event of
such other transfer of title.

                                 RESERVE FUNDS

         SECTION 9.1. REQUIRED REPAIRS

         (a)      Borrower shall make the repairs and improvements to the
Property set forth on Schedule 2 and as more particularly described in the
Physical Conditions Report prepared in connection with the closing of the Loan
(such repairs hereinafter referred to as "REQUIRED REPAIRS"). Borrower shall
complete the Required Repairs in a good and workmanlike manner on or before the
date that is twelve (12) months from the date hereof or within such other time
frame for completion specifically set forth on Schedule 2.

                                      -70-

<PAGE>

         SECTION 9.2. REPLACEMENTS

         (a)      On an ongoing basis throughout the term of the Loan, Borrower
shall make capital repairs, replacements and improvements necessary to keep the
Property in good order and repair and in a good marketable condition or prevent
deterioration of the Property (the "REPLACEMENTS"). Borrower shall complete all
Replacements in a good and workmanlike manner as soon as commercially reasonable
after commencing to make each such Replacement.

         (b)      Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible
Account with Lender or Lender's agent to fund the Replacements (the "REPLACEMENT
RESERVE ACCOUNT"). In addition, Borrower shall deposit $4.17 monthly per pad
(the "REPLACEMENT RESERVE MONTHLY DEPOSIT") into the Replacement Reserve Account
on each Scheduled Payment Date during any Replacement Reserve Period. Amounts so
deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as "REPLACEMENT RESERVE FUNDS."

         SECTION 9.3. INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         SECTION 9.4. REQUIRED WORK

         Borrower shall diligently pursue all Required Repairs and Replacements
(collectively, the "REQUIRED WORK") to completion in accordance with the
following requirements:

         (a)      Lender reserves the right, at its option, to approve all
contracts or work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors,
contractors or other parties providing labor or materials in connection with the
Required Work to the extent such contracts or work orders exceed $100,000. Upon
Lender's request, Borrower shall assign any contract or subcontract to Lender.

         (b)      In the event Lender determines in its reasonable discretion
that any Required Work is not being or has not been performed in a workmanlike
or timely manner, upon ten (10) days notice to Borrower and Borrower's failure
to commence performance of such Required Work in accordance with this Section
9.4, Lender shall have the option to withhold disbursement for such
unsatisfactory Required Work and to proceed under existing contracts or to
contract with third parties to complete such Required Work and to apply
Replacement Reserve Funds, if any, toward the labor and materials necessary to
complete such Required Work, without providing any prior notice to Borrower and
to exercise any and all other remedies available to Lender upon an Event of
Default hereunder.

         (c)      In order to facilitate Lender's completion of the Required
Work as permitted in subsection 9.4(b) above, Borrower grants Lender the right
to enter onto the Property and perform any and all work and labor necessary to
complete the Required Work and/or employ watchmen to protect the Property from
damage. All sums so expended by Lender, to the extent not from the Reserve
Funds, shall be deemed to have been advanced under the Loan to Borrower and
secured by the Mortgage. For this purpose Borrower constitutes and appoints
Lender its true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full power of substitution to
complete or undertake the Required Work in the name of Borrower upon Borrower's
failure to do so in a workmanlike and timely manner. Such power of attorney
shall be deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and cannot be revoked.
Borrower empowers said attorney-in-fact as follows: (i) to use any of the

                                      -71-

<PAGE>

Reserve Funds for the purpose of making or completing the Required Work; (ii) to
make such additions, changes and corrections to the Required Work as shall be
reasonably necessary to complete the Required Work; (iii) to employ such
contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects and inspectors as shall be
required for such purposes; (iv) to pay, settle or compromise all existing bills
and claims which are or may become Liens against the Property, or as may be
reasonably necessary for the completion of the Required Work, or for clearance
of title; (v) to execute all applications and certificates in the name of
Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; (vi) to
prosecute and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with the Property
or the rehabilitation and repair of the Property; and (vii) to do any and every
act which Borrower would be required to do on its own behalf to fulfill the
terms of this Agreement.

         (d)      Nothing in this Section 9.4 shall: (i) make Lender responsible
for making or completing the Required Work; (ii) require Lender to expend funds
in addition to the Reserve Funds to make or complete any Required Work; (iii)
obligate Lender to proceed with the Required Work; or (iv) obligate Lender to
demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Required Work.

         (e)      Borrower shall permit Lender and Lender's agents and
representatives (including, without limitation, Lender's engineer, architect, or
inspector) or third parties performing Required Work pursuant to this Section
9.4 to enter onto the Property during normal business hours (subject to the
rights of tenants under their Leases) to inspect the progress of any Required
Work and all materials being used in connection therewith, to examine all plans
and shop drawings relating to such Required Work which are or may be kept at the
Property, and to complete any Required Work made pursuant to this Section 9.4.
Borrower shall cause all contractors and subcontractors to cooperate with Lender
and Lender's representatives or such other persons described above in connection
with inspections described in this Section 9.4 or the completion of Required
Work pursuant to this Section 9.4.

         (f)      Lender may, to the extent any Required Work would reasonably
require an inspection of the Property, inspect the Property at Borrower's
expense prior to making a disbursement of the Reserve Funds in order to verify
completion of the Required Work for which reimbursement is sought. Borrower
shall pay Lender a reasonable inspection fee not exceeding $500 for each such
inspection. Lender may require that such inspection be conducted by an
appropriate independent qualified professional selected by Lender and/or may
require a copy of a certificate of completion by an independent qualified
professional acceptable to Lender prior to the disbursement of the Reserve
Funds. Borrower shall pay the expense of the inspection as required hereunder,
whether such inspection is conducted by Lender or by an independent qualified
professional.

         (g)      The Required Work and all materials, equipment, fixtures, or
any other item comprising a part of any Required Work shall be constructed,
installed or completed, as applicable, free and clear of all mechanic's,
materialman's or other Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (h)      Before each disbursement of the Reserve Funds, if any, Lender
may require Borrower to provide Lender with a search of title to the Property
effective to the date of the

                                      -72-

<PAGE>

disbursement, which search shows that no mechanic's or materialmen's or other
Liens of any nature have been placed against the Property since the date of
recordation of the Mortgage and that title to the Property is free and clear of
all Liens (except for Permitted Encumbrances).

         (i)      All Required Work shall comply with all Legal Requirements in
all material respects and applicable insurance requirements including, without
limitation, applicable building codes, special use permits, environmental
regulations, and requirements of insurance underwriters.

         (j)      Borrower hereby assigns to Lender all rights and claims
Borrower may have against all Persons supplying labor or materials in connection
with the Required Work; provided, however, that Lender may not pursue any such
rights or claims unless an Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured.

         SECTION 9.5. RELEASE OF RESERVE FUNDS

         (a)      Upon written request from Borrower and satisfaction of the
requirements set forth in this Agreement, Lender shall disburse to Borrower
amounts, if any, from the Replacement Reserve Account to the extent necessary to
reimburse Borrower for the actual costs of any approved Replacements.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in no event shall Lender be required to
(x) disburse funds from any of the Reserve Accounts if an Event of Default
exists or (y) disburse funds (if any) from the Replacement Reserve Account to
reimburse Borrower for the costs of routine repairs or maintenance to the
Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed from funds held in any other
Reserve Account.

         (b)      Each request for disbursement from any of the Reserve Accounts
shall be on a form provided or approved by Lender and shall (i) include copies
of invoices for all items or materials purchased and all labor or services
provided and (ii) specify (A) the Required Work for which the disbursement is
requested, (B) the quantity and price of each item purchased, if the Required
Work includes the purchase or replacement of specific items, (C) the price of
all materials (grouped by type or category) used in any Required Work other than
the purchase or replacement of specific items, and (D) the cost of all
contracted labor or other services applicable to each Required Work for which
such request for disbursement is made. With each request Borrower shall certify
that all Required Work has been performed in accordance with all Legal
Requirements. Except as provided in Section 9.5(d), each request for
disbursement shall be made only after completion of the Replacement (or the
portion thereof completed in accordance with Section 9.5(d)) for which
disbursement is requested. Borrower shall provide Lender evidence satisfactory
to Lender in its reasonable judgment of such completion or performance.

         (c)      Upon Borrower's request, Lender shall disburse funds from the
Replacement Reserve Account to Borrower on a monthly basis, and Borrower shall
use such funds to pay all invoices in connection with the Required Work with
respect to which a disbursement is requested. In addition, as a condition to any
disbursement, Lender may require Borrower to obtain lien waivers from each
contractor, supplier, materialman, mechanic or subcontractor who receives
payment in an amount equal to or greater than $10,000 for completion of its work
or delivery of its materials. Any lien waiver delivered hereunder shall conform
to all Legal Requirements and shall cover all work performed and materials
supplied (including equipment

                                      -73-

<PAGE>

and fixtures) for the Property by that contractor, supplier, subcontractor,
mechanic or materialman through the date covered by the current disbursement
request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor, supplier,
subcontractor, mechanic or materialmen is to be made by a joint check, the
release of lien shall be effective through the date covered by the previous
release of funds request).

         (d)      If (i) the cost of any item of Required Work exceeds $25,000
and (ii) the contractor performing such Required Work requires periodic payments
pursuant to terms of a written contract, a request for disbursement from the
Reserve Accounts may be made after completion of a portion of the work under
such contract, provided (A) such contract requires payment upon completion of
such portion of work, (B) the materials for which the request is made are on
site at the Property and are properly secured or have been installed in the
Property, (C) all other conditions in this Agreement for disbursement have been
satisfied, and (D) in the case of a Replacement, funds remaining in the
Replacement Reserve Account are, in Lender's judgment, sufficient to complete
such Replacement and other Replacements when required.

         (e)      Borrower shall not make a request for, nor shall Lender have
any obligation to make, any disbursement from any Reserve Account more
frequently than once in any calendar month and (except in connection with the
final disbursement) in any amount less than the lesser of (i) $10,000 or (ii)
the total cost of the Required Work for which the disbursement is requested.

         (f)      Intentionally deleted.

         (g)      Intentionally deleted.

         (h)      Lender's disbursement of any Reserve Funds or other
acknowledgment of completion of any Required Work in a manner satisfactory to
Lender shall not be deemed a certification or warranty by Lender to any Person
that the Required Work has been completed in accordance with Legal Requirements.

         (i)      If the funds in any Reserve Account should exceed the amount
of payments actually applied by Lender for the purposes of the account, Lender
in its sole discretion shall either return any excess to Borrower or credit such
excess against future payments to be made to that Reserve Account. In allocating
any such excess, Lender may deal with the Person shown on Lender's records as
being the owner of the Property.

         (j)      The insufficiency of any balance in any of the Reserve
Accounts shall not relieve Borrower from its obligation to fulfill all
preservation and maintenance covenants in the Loan Documents.

         (k)      INTENTIONALLY DELETED.

         (l)      Upon termination of the Replacement Reserve Period or payment
in full of the Debt, all amounts remaining on deposit, if any, in the
Replacement Reserve Account shall be returned to Borrower or the Person shown on
Lender's records as being the owner of the Property and no other party shall
have any right or claim thereto.

         SECTION 9.6. TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS

         Borrower shall establish on the date hereof an Eligible Account with
Lender or Lender's agent sufficient to discharge Borrower's obligations for the
payment of Taxes and Insurance Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1
hereof (the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Borrower shall deposit into
the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account on each Scheduled Payment Date during any
Tax and Insurance Reserve Period (a) one-twelfth of the Taxes that Lender
estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months or such
higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to pay all
such Taxes at least thirty (30) days prior to the earlier of (i) the date that
the same will become delinquent and (ii) the date that additional charges or
interest will accrue due to the non-payment thereof, and (b) except to the
extent Lender has waived the insurance escrow because the insurance required
hereunder is maintained under a blanket insurance Policy acceptable to Lender in
accordance with Section 8.1(c), one-twelfth of the Insurance Premiums that
Lender estimates will be payable during the next ensuing twelve (12) months for
the renewal of the coverage afforded by the Policies upon the expiration thereof
or such higher amount necessary to accumulate with Lender sufficient funds to
pay all such Insurance Premiums at least thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the Policies (said amounts in (a) and (b) above hereinafter called
the "TAX AND INSURANCE RESERVE FUNDS"). Lender will apply the Tax and Insurance
Reserve Funds to payments of Taxes and Insurance Premiums required to be made by
Borrower pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof. In making any
disbursement from the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account, Lender may do so
according to any bill, statement or estimate procured from the appropriate
public office or tax lien service (with respect to Taxes) or insurer or agent
(with respect to Insurance Premiums), without inquiry into the accuracy of such
bill, statement or estimate or into the validity of any tax, assessment, sale,
forfeiture, tax lien or title or claim thereof. If the amount of the Tax and
Insurance Reserve Funds shall exceed the amounts due for Taxes and Insurance
Premiums pursuant to Section 5.4 and Section 8.1 hereof, Lender shall, in its
sole discretion, return any excess to Borrower or credit such excess against
future payments to be made to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account. In
allocating any such excess, Lender may deal with the person shown on Lender's
records as being the owner of the Property. Any amount remaining in the Tax and
Insurance Reserve Account after the Debt has been paid in full shall be returned
to Borrower or the person shown on Lender's records as being the owner of the
Property and no other party shall have any right or claim thereto. If at any
time Lender reasonably determines that the Tax and Insurance Reserve Funds are
not or will not be sufficient to pay Taxes and Insurance Premiums by the dates
set forth in (a) and (b) above, Lender shall notify Borrower of such
determination and Borrower shall pay to Lender any amount necessary to make up
the deficiency within ten (10) days after notice from Lender to Borrower
requesting payment thereof.

         SECTION 9.7. EXCESS CASH

         Borrower shall establish on the date hereof a sub-account of the Cash
Management Account into which Borrower shall deposit all Excess Cash on each
Scheduled Payment Date during any Cash Management Period (the "EXCESS CASH
RESERVE ACCOUNT"). Amounts so deposited shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"EXCESS CASH RESERVE FUNDS." Sums from the Excess Cash Reserve Account shall be
disbursed to Borrower's Account upon the discontinuation of a Cash Management
Period.

                                      -75-
<PAGE>

         SECTION 9.8. TERRORISM RESERVE.

         Upon the occurrence of an Act of Terror (i) Borrower shall establish an
Eligible Account with Lender or Lender's agent (the "TERRORISM RESERVE ACCOUNT")
and (ii) Borrower Principal shall immediately deposit into the Terrorism Reserve
Account an amount equal to the sum of the three (3) Monthly Payment Amounts that
would be payable by Borrower for the three (3) Scheduled Payment Dates
immediately following the occurrence of such Act of Terror. Amounts so deposited
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "TERRORISM RESERVE FUNDS". "ACT OF
TERROR" shall mean any foreign acts of terrorism or similar acts of sabotage
(excluding acts of war or nuclear, chemical and biological acts) in which the
Property is directly affected by such acts. Lender shall apply Terrorism Reserve
Funds, if any, to any amounts due hereunder.

         SECTION 9.9. RESERVE FUNDS GENERALLY

         (a)      Funds on deposit in the Reserve Accounts shall be held by
Lender or any Loan servicer, as applicable, and invested in Permitted
Investments as directed by Lender, and interest shall be credited to Borrower.
All such interest shall be and become part of the applicable Reserve Accounts
and shall be disbursed in accordance with Section 9.5 above, provided, however,
that Lender may, at its election, retain any such interest for its own account
for application to the Debt in accordance with this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default. Borrower
agrees that it shall include all interest on the applicable Reserve Funds as the
income of Borrower (and, if Borrower is a partnership or other pass-through
entity, the partners, members or beneficiaries of Borrower, as the case may be),
and shall be the owner of the applicable Reserve Funds for federal and
applicable state and local tax purposes.

         (b)      Borrower grants to Lender a first-priority perfected security
interest in, and assigns and pledges to Lender, each of the Reserve Accounts and
any and all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts as
additional security for payment of the Debt. Until expended or applied in
accordance herewith, the Reserve Accounts and the Reserve Funds shall constitute
additional security for the Debt. The provisions of this Section 9.9 are
intended to give Lender or any subsequent holder of the Loan "control" of the
Reserve Accounts within the meaning of the UCC.

         (c)      The Reserve Accounts and any and all Reserve Funds now or
hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts shall be subject to the exclusive
dominion and control of Lender, which shall hold the Reserve Accounts and any or
all Reserve Funds now or hereafter deposited in the Reserve Accounts subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Borrower shall have no right of
withdrawal from the Reserve Accounts or any other right or power with respect to
the Reserve Accounts or any or all of the Reserve Funds now or hereafter
deposited in the Reserve Accounts, except as expressly provided in this
Agreement.

         (d)      Lender shall furnish or cause to be furnished to Borrower,
without charge, an annual accounting of each Reserve Account in the normal
format of Lender or its loan servicer, showing credits and debits to such
Reserve Account and the purpose for which each debit to each Reserve Account was
made.

                                     - 76 -
<PAGE>

         (e)      As long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Lender shall make disbursements from the Reserve Accounts in accordance with
this Agreement. All such disbursements shall be deemed to have been expressly
pre-authorized by Borrower, and shall not be deemed to constitute the exercise
by Lender of any remedies against Borrower unless an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and Lender has expressly stated in writing its intent
to proceed to exercise its remedies as a secured party, pledgee or lienholder
with respect to the Reserve Accounts.

         (f)      If any Event of Default occurs, Borrower shall immediately
lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve Accounts until
the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which such Event of Default is cured to
Lender's satisfaction, or (ii) the payment in full of the Debt. In addition, at
Lender's election, Borrower shall lose all of its rights to receive interest on
the Reserve Accounts during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of
Default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured party,
pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Reserve Accounts. Without limitation
of the foregoing, during the continuance of any Event of Default, Lender may use
and disburse the Reserve Funds (or any portion thereof) for any of the following
purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited to, principal
prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or partial
prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses, fees,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other
Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item from any of the Reserve Accounts as
required or permitted under this Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted
by applicable law; provided, however, that any such application of funds shall
not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default. Without limiting any other
provisions hereof, each of the remedial actions described in the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to be a commercially reasonable exercise of
Lender's rights and remedies as a secured party with respect to the Reserve
Funds and shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a
foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve Funds to effect a
cure of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt, or in any specific order of
priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's rights and remedies under this
Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents shall not in any way
prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate and complete a foreclosure under
the Mortgage.

         (g)      The Reserve Funds shall not constitute escrow or trust funds
and may be commingled with other monies held by Lender. Notwithstanding anything
else herein to the contrary, Lender may commingle in one or more Eligible
Accounts any and all funds controlled by Lender, including, without limitation,
funds pledged in favor of Lender by other borrowers, whether for the same
purposes as the Reserve Accounts or otherwise. Without limiting any other
provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Reserve Accounts
may be established and held in such name or names as Lender or its loan
servicer, as agent for Lender, shall deem appropriate, including, without
limitation, in the name of Lender or such loan servicer as agent for Lender. In
the case of any Reserve Account which is held in a commingled account, Lender or
its loan servicer, as applicable, shall maintain records sufficient to enable it
to determine at all times which portion of such account is related to the Loan.
The Reserve

                                      -77-

<PAGE>

Accounts are solely for the protection of Lender. With respect to the Reserve
Accounts, Lender shall have no responsibility beyond the allowance of due credit
for the sums actually received by Lender or beyond the reimbursement or payment
of the costs and expenses for which such accounts were established in accordance
with their terms. Upon assignment of the Loan by Lender, any Reserve Funds shall
be turned over to the assignee and any responsibility of Lender as assignor
shall terminate. The requirements of this Agreement concerning Reserve Accounts
in no way supersede, limit or waive any other rights or obligations of the
parties under any of the Loan Documents or under applicable law.

         (h)      Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written
consent of Lender, further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in the
Reserve Accounts or the Reserve Funds deposited therein or permit any Lien to
attach thereto, except for the security interest granted in this Section 9.9, or
any levy to be made thereon, or any UCC Financing Statements, except those
naming Lender as the secured party, to be filed with respect thereto.

         (i)      Borrower will maintain the security interest created by this
Section 9.9 as a first priority perfected security interest and will defend the
right, title and interest of Lender in and to the Reserve Accounts and the
Reserve Funds against the claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever. At any
time and from time to time, upon the written request of Lender, and at the sole
expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and duly execute and deliver such
further instruments and documents and will take such further actions as Lender
reasonably may request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                 CASH MANAGEMENT

         SECTION 10.1. LOCKBOX ACCOUNT AND CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT

         (a)      Borrower acknowledges and confirms that Borrower has
established, and Borrower covenants that it shall maintain, (i) pursuant to the
Lockbox Agreement, an Eligible Account into which Borrower shall, and shall
cause Manager to, deposit or cause to be deposited, all Rents and other revenue
from the Property (such account, all funds at any time on deposit therein and
any proceeds, replacements or substitutions of such account or funds therein,
are referred to herein as the "LOCKBOX ACCOUNT"), and (ii) an Eligible Account
with Lender or any Loan servicer, as applicable, into which funds in the Lockbox
Account shall be transferred pursuant to the terms of Section 10.2(b) hereof
(such account, the sub-accounts thereof, all funds at any time on deposit
therein and any proceeds, replacements or substitutions of such account or funds
therein, are referred to herein as the "CASH MANAGEMENT ACCOUNT").

         (b)      The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall each be
in the name of Borrower for the benefit of Lender, as secured party, provided
that Borrower shall be the owner of all funds on deposit in such accounts for
federal and applicable state and local tax purposes. Sums on deposit in the Cash
Management Account shall not be invested except in such Permitted Investments as
determined and directed by Lender and all income earned thereon shall be the
income of Borrower and be applied to and become part of the Cash Management
Account, to be disbursed in accordance with this Article 10. Neither Lockbox
Bank nor Lender

                                      -78-

<PAGE>

shall have any liability for any loss resulting from the investment of funds in
Permitted Investments in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

         (c)      The Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account shall be
subject to the exclusive dominion and control of Lender and, except as otherwise
expressly provided herein, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other party
claiming on behalf of, or through, Borrower or Manager, shall have any right of
withdrawal therefrom or any other right or power with respect thereto.

         (d)      Borrower agrees to pay the customary fees and expenses of
Lockbox Bank (incurred in connection with maintaining the Lockbox Account) and
Lender (incurred in connection with maintaining the Cash Management Account) and
any successors thereto in connection therewith, as separately agreed by them
from time to time.

         (e)      Lender shall be responsible for the performance only of such
duties with respect to the Cash Management Account as are specifically set forth
herein, and no duty shall be implied from any provision hereof. Lender shall not
be under any obligation or duty to perform any act which would involve it in
expense or liability or to institute or defend any suit in respect hereof, or to
advance any of its own monies. Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender and its
directors, employees, officers and agents harmless from and against any loss,
cost or damage (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements) incurred by such parties in connection with the Cash Management
Account other than such as result from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of Lender or intentional nonperformance by Lender of its obligations
under this Agreement.

         SECTION 10.2. DEPOSITS AND WITHDRAWALS

         (a)      Borrower represents, warrants and covenants that:

                  (i)      Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement,
         Borrower shall notify and advise Manager to deposit directly into the
         Lockbox Account all payments of Rents or any other item payable under
         such Leases pursuant to an instruction letter in the form of Exhibit A
         attached hereto (a "RENT DIRECTION LETTER"). If Borrower fails to
         provide any such notice (and without prejudice to Lender's rights with
         respect to such default), Lender shall have the right, and Borrower
         hereby grants to Lender a power of attorney (which power of attorney
         shall be coupled with an interest and irrevocable so long as any
         portion of the Debt remains outstanding), to sign and deliver a Rent
         Direction Letter;

                  (ii)     Borrower shall, and shall cause Manager to, instruct
         all Persons that maintain open accounts with Borrower or Manager with
         respect to the Property or with whom Borrower or Manager does business
         on an "accounts receivable" basis with respect to the Property to
         deliver all payments due under such accounts to the Lockbox Account.
         Neither Borrower nor Manager shall direct any such Person to make
         payments due under such accounts in any other manner;

                  (iii)    All Rents or other income from the Property shall (A)
         be deemed additional security for payment of the Debt and shall be held
         in trust for the benefit, and as the property, of Lender, (B) not be
         commingled with any other funds or property of

                                      -79-

<PAGE>

         Borrower or Manager, and (C) if received by Borrower notwithstanding
         the delivery of a Rent Direction Letter, be deposited in the Lockbox
         Account within one (1) Business Day of receipt;

                  (iv)     Without the prior written consent of Lender, so long
         as any portion of the Debt remains outstanding, Borrower shall not
         terminate, amend, revoke or modify any Rent Direction Letter in any
         manner whatsoever or direct or cause Manager to pay any amount in any
         manner other than as provided in the Rent Direction Letter; and

                  (v)      So long as any portion of the Debt remains
         outstanding, neither Borrower, Manager nor any other Person shall open
         or maintain any accounts other than the Lockbox Account into which
         revenues from the ownership and operation of the Property are
         deposited. The foregoing shall not prohibit Borrower from utilizing one
         or more separate accounts for the disbursement or retention of funds
         that have been transferred to Borrower pursuant to the express terms of
         this Agreement.

         (b)      Provided no Event of Default has occurred, at all times other
than during a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall, on each Business Day,
withdraw all collected and available funds in excess of $2,500 (funds are not
available if, in the reasonable determination of Lockbox Bank, such funds are
subject to a bank hold or freeze (pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements),
dispute or legal process preventing their withdrawal) held in the Lockbox
Account and disburse such funds to the Borrower Account. Upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall (and
Lender shall instruct Lockbox Bank to), on each Business Day, withdraw all
collected and available funds (funds are not available if, in the reasonable
determination of Lockbox Bank, such funds are subject to a bank hold or freeze
(pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements), dispute or legal process preventing
their withdrawal) held in the Lockbox Account and transfer by wire transfer or
other method of transfer mutually agreeable to Lockbox Bank and Lender to the
Cash Management Account to be held until disbursed by Lender pursuant to Section
10.2(c). Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the
earlier to occur of (a) payment in full of the Debt or (b) the discontinuation
of a Cash Management Period, Lockbox Bank shall no longer transfer funds in the
Lockbox Account to the Cash Management Account in accordance with this
subsection (b) and shall transfer funds (if any) in the Lockbox Account to the
Borrower Account or, upon payment in full of the Debt, as otherwise directed by
Borrower. In the event a Cash Management Period occurs three times during the
term of the Loan and if required by the Lockbox Bank, Borrower shall not be
entitled to any rights to the withdrawal of funds from the Lockbox Account
during the remaining term of the Loan, the Cash Management Period shall
continue, and Lender shall continue to have the right to the withdrawal of funds
from the Lockbox Account until the Debt is paid in full.

         (c)      During a Cash Management Period, on each Scheduled Payment
Date (and if such day is not a Business Day, then the immediately preceding day
which is a Business Day) commencing the month immediately following the month
during which the Cash Management Period commences, Borrower hereby irrevocably
authorizes Lender to withdraw or allocate to the sub-accounts of the Cash
Management Account, as the case may be, amounts received in the Cash Management
Account, in each case to the extent that sufficient funds remain therefor and
Lender may, at its option, withdraw or allocate such funds as follows:

                                      -80-

<PAGE>

                  (i)      during a Tax and Insurance Reserve Period, funds
         sufficient to pay the monthly deposits to the Tax and Insurance Reserve
         Account shall be allocated to the Tax and Insurance Reserve Account to
         be held and disbursed in accordance with Section 9.6;

                  (ii)     funds sufficient to pay the Monthly Payment Amount
         (or an amount up to the entire amount of the Debt upon an acceleration
         of the Loan in accordance with the terms hereof), shall be withdrawn
         and paid to Lender;

                  (iii)    during a Replacement Reserve Period, funds sufficient
         to pay the Replacement Reserve Monthly Deposit shall be allocated to
         the Replacement Reserve Account to be held and disbursed in accordance
         with Section 9.5;

                  (iv)     funds sufficient to pay any interest accruing at the
         Default Rate, late payment charges, if any, and any other sums due and
         payable to Lender under any of the Loan Documents, shall be withdrawn
         and paid to Lender and applied against such items;

                  (v)      funds sufficient to pay Lockbox Bank for all costs
         and expenses incurred by Lockbox Bank in connection with the
         maintenance and administration of the Lockbox Account;

                  (vi)     funds sufficient to pay Lender or any Loan servicer,
         as applicable, the customary fees and expenses incurred in connection
         with maintaining the Cash Management Account; and

         withdrawals and allocations shall be deposited in the Excess Cash

         9.7. Upon the discontinuance of a Cash Management Period, funds (if
         any) on deposit in the Excess Cash Reserve Account shall be transferred
         to Borrower's Account.

         (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Borrower
acknowledges that Borrower is responsible for monitoring the sufficiency of
funds deposited in the Cash Management Account and that Borrower is liable for
any deficiency in available funds, irrespective of whether Borrower has received
any account statement, notice or demand from Lender or Lender's servicer. If the
amount on deposit in the Cash Management Account is insufficient to make all of
the withdrawals and allocations described in Section 10.2(c)(i) through (vi)
above, Borrower shall deposit such deficiency into the Cash Management Account
within five (5) days (provided that such five day period shall not constitute a
grace period for any default or Event of Default under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document based on a failure to satisfy any monetary obligation
provided in any Loan Document).

         (e)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Borrower hereby
irrevocably authorizes Lender to make any and all withdrawals from the Lockbox
Account and Cash Management Account and transfers between any of the Reserve
Accounts as Lender shall determine in Lender's sole and absolute discretion and
Lender may use all funds contained in any such accounts for any purpose,
including but not limited to repayment of the Debt in such order, proportion and
priority

                                      -81-

withdraw and apply funds as stated herein shall be in addition to all other
rights and remedies provided to Lender under this Agreement, the Note, the
Mortgage and the other Loan Documents.

         SECTION 10.3. SECURITY INTEREST

         (a)      To secure the full and punctual payment of the Debt and
performance of all obligations of Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower hereby grants to Lender a
first-priority perfected security interest in the Lockbox Account and Cash
Management Account, all interest, cash, checks, drafts, certificates and
instruments, if any, from time to time deposited or held therein, any and all
amounts invested in Permitted Investments, and all "proceeds" (as defined in the
UCC as in effect in the state in which the Lockbox Account and Cash Management
Account are located or maintained) of any or all of the foregoing. Furthermore,
Borrower shall not, without obtaining the prior written consent of Lender,
further pledge, assign or grant any security interest in any of the foregoing or
permit any Lien to attach thereto or any levy to be made thereon or any UCC
Financing Statements to be filed with respect thereto. Borrower will maintain
the security interest created by this Section 10.3(a) as a first priority
perfected security interest and will defend the right, title and interest of
Lender in and to the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account against the
claims and demands of all Persons whomsoever.

         (b)      Borrower authorizes Lender to file any financing statement or
statements required by Lender to establish or maintain the validity, perfection
and priority of the security interest granted herein in connection with the
Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account. Borrower agrees that at any time
and from time to time, at the expense of Borrower, Borrower will promptly and
duly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents, and take all
further action, that may be necessary or desirable, or that Lender may
reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any security interest
granted or purported to be granted hereby (including, without limitation, any
security interest in and to any Permitted Investments) or to enable Lender to
exercise and enforce its rights and remedies hereunder.

         (c)      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, Lender may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies as a secured
party, pledgee and lienholder with respect to the Lockbox Account and Cash
Management Account. Without limitation of the foregoing, upon any Event of
Default, Lender may use the Lockbox Account and Cash Management Account for any
of the following purposes: (A) repayment of the Debt, including, but not limited
to, principal prepayments and the prepayment premium applicable to such full or
partial prepayment (as applicable); (B) reimbursement of Lender for all losses,
fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees)
suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event of Default; (C) payment
of any amount expended in exercising any or all rights and remedies available to
Lender at law or in equity or under this Agreement or under any of the other
Loan Documents; (D) payment of any item as required or permitted under this
Agreement; or (E) any other purpose permitted by applicable law; provided,
however, that any such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure
any Event of Default. Without limiting any other provisions hereof, each of the
remedial actions described in the immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed
to be a commercially reasonable exercise of Lender's rights and remedies as a
secured party with respect to the Lockbox Account and Cash Management

                                      -82-

Account and shall not in any event be deemed to constitute a setoff or a
foreclosure of a statutory banker's lien. Nothing in this Agreement shall
obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Lockbox Account or Cash
Management Account to effect a cure of any Event of Default, or to pay the Debt,
or in any specific order of priority. The exercise of any or all of Lender's
rights and remedies under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan
Documents shall not in any way prejudice or affect Lender's right to initiate
and complete a foreclosure under the Mortgage.

         SECTION 10.4. DEFINITIONS. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, For purposes of this Article 10 only, Business Day shall mean
a day on which Lender and Lockbox Bank are both open for the conduct of
substantially all of their respective banking business at the office in the city
in which the Note is payable, with respect to Lender and at the office in the
city where the Lockbox Account is maintained, with respect to Lockbox Bank (in
both instances, excluding Saturdays and Sundays).

                                SECONDARY MARKET

         SECTION 13.1. TRANSFER OF LOAN

         Lender may, at any time, sell, transfer or assign the Loan Documents,
or grant participations therein ("PARTICIPATIONS") or syndicate the Loan

         SECTION 13.2. DELEGATION OF SERVICING

         At the option of Lender, the Loan may be serviced by a servicer/trustee

servicer/trustee.

         SECTION 13.3. DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

         Lender may forward to each purchaser, transferee, assignee, or servicer

financial statements, whether furnished by Borrower or otherwise, as Lender
determines necessary or desirable. Borrower irrevocably waives any and all
rights it may have under applicable Legal Requirements to prohibit such
disclosure, including but not limited to any right of privacy. In the event of a
conflict between any of the provisions of this Section 13.3 and paragraph 5 of
that certain letter agreement dated as of August 25, 2003 by Banc of America

shall control.

         SECTION 13.4. COOPERATION

         At the request of the holder of the Note and, to the extent not already
required to be provided by Borrower under this Agreement, Borrower and Borrower
Principal shall use reasonable efforts to provide updates of the information (i)
delivered by Borrower under Section 3.20 hereof or (ii) required to be delivered
by Borrower under Article 5 hereof, including, without limitation, to:

                                      -90-

<PAGE>

         (a)      provide updated financial, budget and other information with

         (b)      make changes to the organizational documents of Borrower, any
SPE Component Entity and their respective principals;

         (c)      at Borrower's expense, cause counsel to render or update

be relied upon by the holder of the Note, the Rating Agencies and their
respective counsel, which shall be dated as of the closing date of the
Securitization;

         (d)      at Lender's sole cost and expense, permit site inspections in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, appraisals, market studies and
other due diligence investigations of the Property, as may be reasonably
requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or as may be
necessary or appropriate in connection with the Securitization;

         (e)      intentionally deleted;

         (f)      execute such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be
requested by the holder of the Note or the Rating Agencies or otherwise to

into two or more components and/or separate notes and/or creating a
senior/subordinate note structure; provided, however, that Borrower shall not be
required to modify or amend any Loan Document if such modification or amendment
would (i) change the interest rate, the stated maturity or the amortization of
principal set forth in the Note, except in connection with a bifurcation of the
Loan which may result in varying fixed interest rates and amortization
schedules, but which shall have the same initial weighted average coupon of the
original Note, or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of Borrower, modify or amend
any other material economic term of the Loan, or (iii) in the reasonable
judgment of Borrower, materially increase Borrower's obligations and liabilities
under the Loan Documents;

         (g)      deliver to Lender and/or any Rating Agency one or more
certificates executed by an officer of Borrower certifying as to the accuracy,
as of the closing date of the Securitization, of all representations made by
Borrower in the Loan Documents as of the Closing Date or, if such
representations are no longer accurate, certifying as to what modifications to
the representations would be required to make such representations accurate as
of the closing date of the Securitization;

         (h)      have reasonably appropriate personnel participate in a bank
meeting and/or presentation for the Rating Agencies or Investors;

         (i)      cooperate with and assist Lender in obtaining ratings of the

<PAGE>

in form and substance acceptable to such Rating Agency. Lender hereby
acknowledges that Borrower may deliver such opinions in one consolidated opinion
that, together with the Loan, addresses other Loans (made by Lender) relating to
Affiliates of Borrower, provided that such opinion adequately identifies
Borrower, the Property and other applicable matters relating to the Loan. In
addition, Borrower shall make any changes to its organizational documents to the
extent required in connection with the issuance of such opinions, provided that
such changes shall not result in an adverse economic effect to Borrower.

         All reasonable third party costs and expenses incurred by Borrower in
connection with Borrower's complying with requests made under this Section 13.4
shall be paid by Borrower. Lender shall be responsible for all of its
out-of-pocket costs in connection with a securitization.

         In the event that Borrower requests any consent or approval hereunder
and the provisions of this Agreement or any Loan Documents require the receipt
of written confirmation from each Rating Agency with respect to the rating on
the Securities, or, in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents
relating to a Securitization, such a rating confirmation is required in order
for the consent of Lender to be given, Borrower shall pay all of the costs and
expenses of Lender, Lender's servicer and each Rating Agency in connection
therewith, and, if applicable, shall pay any fees imposed by any Rating Agency
as a condition to the delivery of such confirmation. Lender agrees, upon
request, to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Borrower and
to facilitate Borrower's efforts to obtain any such rating confirmation as
required hereunder, which cooperation shall include supplying the Rating
Agencies with copies of reports, documents and other information and materials
provided to Lender by Borrower, provided however, that in no event shall (1)
Lender be required to incur any costs or expenses (other than de minimus costs
or expenses) in connection with such cooperation or (2) Lender's agreement
hereunder to cooperate with Borrower in obtaining a rating confirmation obligate
Lender to institute (or threaten to institute) or participate in (or threaten to
participate in) any litigation, suits, or proceedings at law or in equity
against any Rating Agency in connection with Borrower's efforts to obtain such
rating confirmation.

         SECTION 13.5. SECURITIZATION INDEMNIFICATION

         (a)      Borrower understands that certain of the Provided Information
may be included in disclosure documents in connection with the Securitization,
including, without limitation, a prospectus, prospectus supplement, offering
memorandum or private placement memorandum (each, a "DISCLOSURE DOCUMENT") and
may also be included in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission
pursuant to the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, or provided or made
available to investors or prospective investors in the Securities, the Rating
Agencies, and service providers relating to the Securitization. In the event
that the Disclosure Document is required to be revised prior to the sale of all
Securities, Borrower will cooperate with the holder of the Note in updating the
Disclosure Document by providing all current information required to be
delivered by Borrower under Article 5 hereof necessary to keep the Disclosure
Document accurate and complete in all material respects.

         (b)      Borrower agrees to provide in connection with each of (i) a
preliminary and a final offering memorandum or private placement memorandum or
similar document (including

                                      -92-
<PAGE>

any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Property and/or the Loan) or (ii) a preliminary and final prospectus or
prospectus supplement, as applicable, an indemnification certificate (A)
indemnifying Lender (and for purposes of this Section 13.5, Lender hereunder
shall include its officers and directors) and the Affiliate of Lender that (i)
has filed the registration statement, if any, relating to the Securitization
and/or (ii) which is acting as issuer, depositor, sponsor and/or a similar
capacity with respect to the Securitization (any Person described in (i) or
(ii), an "ISSUER PERSON") and each director and officer of any Issuer Person,
and each Person or entity who controls any Issuer Person within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act
(collectively, the "ISSUER GROUP") for any Losses to which Lender or the Issuer
Group may become subject insofar as the Losses arise out of or are based upon
any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained
in such sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or
presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or arise out of or are
based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
required to be stated in such sections (including any Investor or Rating Agency
"term sheets" or presentations relating to the Property and/or the Loan) or
necessary in order to make the statements in such sections (including any
Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Property and/or the Loan) or in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading (collectively the "SECURITIES LIABILITIES") and (B)
agreeing to reimburse Lender and the Issuer Group for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by Lender and Issuer Group in connection with
investigating or defending the Securities Liabilities; provided, however, that
Borrower will be liable in any such case under clauses (A) or (B) above only to
the extent that any such Securities Liabilities arise out of or is based upon
any such untrue statement or omission made therein in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished to Lender or any member of the Issuer
Group by or on behalf of Borrower in connection with the Provided Information.
This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability which Borrower may
otherwise have. Moreover, the indemnification provided for in Clauses (A) and
(B) above shall be effective in the event an indemnification certificate
certifying that Borrower has carefully examined any preliminary or a final
offering memorandum described above or prospectus or other document (including
any Investor or Rating Agency "term sheets" or presentations relating to the
Property and/or the Loan), as applicable, including without limitation, the
sections entitled "Special Considerations," and/or "Risk Factors," and "Certain
Legal Aspects of the Mortgage Loan," or similar sections, and all sections
relating to Borrower, Borrower Principal, Manager, their Affiliates, the Loan,
the Loan Documents and the Property, and any risks or special considerations
relating thereto, and that, to the best of Borrower's knowledge, such sections
(and any other sections reasonably requested) do not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading has been requested by Lender and has not been provided
by Borrower and shall be applicable based on information previously provided by
Borrower or its Affiliates if Borrower does not provide such requested
indemnification certificate.

         (c)      In connection with filings under the Exchange Act or any
information provided to holders of Securities on an ongoing basis, Borrower
agrees to indemnify (i) Lender and the Issuer Group for Losses to which Lender
or the Issuer Group may become subject insofar as the Securities Liabilities
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state in the
Provided Information a material fact required to be stated in the Provided
Information in

                                      -93-
<PAGE>

order to make the statements in the Provided Information, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made not misleading and (ii) reimburse
Lender or the Issuer Group for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by Lender or the Issuer Group in connection with defending or investigating the
Securities Liabilities.

         (d)      Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 13.5 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 13.5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof, but the omission to so notify the indemnifying party will
not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which the indemnifying
party may have to any indemnified party hereunder except to the extent that
failure to notify causes prejudice to the indemnifying party. In the event that
any action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be
entitled, jointly with any other indemnifying party, to participate therein and,
to the extent that it (or they) may elect by written notice delivered to the
indemnified party promptly after receiving the aforesaid notice from such
indemnified party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party
to such indemnified party under this Section 13.5 the indemnifying party shall
be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation; provided, however, if the defendants in any such action
include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there are any legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties that are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party or parties shall have the right to select separate counsel to assert such
legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense of such action on
behalf of such indemnified party or parties. The indemnifying party shall not be
liable for the expenses of more than one such separate counsel unless an
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it that are different from or additional to those
available to another indemnified party.

         (e)      In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreements provided for in Section 13.5(c)
or Section 13.5(d) is or are for any reason held to be unenforceable by an
indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
action in respect thereof) referred to therein which would otherwise be
indemnifiable under Section 13.5(c) or Section 13.5(d), the indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or action in respect
thereof); provided, however, that no Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. In determining the amount of contribution to which
the respective parties are entitled, the following factors shall be considered:
(i) the indemnified party's and Borrower's relative knowledge and access to
information concerning the matter with respect to which claim was asserted; (ii)
the opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission; and (iii) any
other equitable considerations appropriate in the circumstances. Lender and
Borrower hereby agree that it would not be equitable if the amount of such
contribution were determined by pro rata or per capita allocation.

                                      -94-
<PAGE>

         (f)      The liabilities and obligations of Borrower, and Lender under
this Section 13.5 shall survive the satisfaction of this Agreement and the
satisfaction and discharge of the Debt.

                                INDEMNIFICATIONS

         SECTION 14.1. GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified
Parties from and against any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out
of or in any way relating to any one or more of the following: (a) any accident,
injury to or death of persons or loss of or damage to property occurring in, on
or about the Property or any part thereof or on the adjoining sidewalks, curbs,
adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets or ways; (b) any use,
nonuse or condition in, on or about the Property or any part thereof or on the
adjoining sidewalks, curbs, adjacent property or adjacent parking areas, streets
or ways; (c) performance of any labor or services or the furnishing of any
materials or other property in respect of the Property or any part thereof; (d)
any failure of the Property to be in compliance with any Applicable Legal
Requirements; (e) any and all claims and demands whatsoever which may be
asserted against Lender by reason of any alleged obligations or undertakings on
its part to perform or discharge any of the terms, covenants, or agreements
contained in any Lease; (f) the holding or investing of the Reserve Accounts or
the performance of the Required Work, or Additional Replacements, or (g) the
payment of any commission, charge or brokerage fee to anyone which may be
payable in connection with the funding of the Loan (collectively, the
"INDEMNIFIED LIABILITIES"); provided, however, that Borrower shall not have any
obligation to Lender hereunder to the extent that such Indemnified Liabilities
arise from the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful misconduct of
Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it
violates any law or public policy, Borrower shall pay the maximum portion that
it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law to the payment and
satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by Lender.

         SECTION 14.2. MORTGAGE AND INTANGIBLE TAX INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses imposed upon or incurred by or asserted against any
Indemnified Parties and directly or indirectly arising out of or in any way
relating to any tax on the making and/or recording of the Mortgage, the Note or
any of the other Loan Documents, but excluding any income, franchise or other
similar taxes.

         SECTION 14.3. ERISA INDEMNIFICATION

         Borrower shall, at its sole cost and expense, protect, defend,
indemnify, release and hold harmless the Indemnified Parties from and against
any and all Losses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees
and costs incurred in the investigation, defense, and settlement of Losses
incurred in correcting any prohibited transaction or in the sale of a prohibited
loan, and in obtaining any individual prohibited transaction exemption under
ERISA

                                      -95-

directly or indirectly, as a result of a default under Section 4.8 or Section
5.18 of this Agreement.

         SECTION 14.4. SURVIVAL

         The obligations and liabilities of Borrower under this Article 14 shall
fully survive indefinitely notwithstanding any termination, satisfaction,
assignment, entry of a judgment of foreclosure, exercise of any power of sale,
or delivery of a deed in lieu of foreclosure of the Mortgage.

                                   ARTICLE 15
                                   EXCULPATION

         SECTION 15.1. EXCULPATION

         (a)      Except as otherwise provided herein or in the other Loan
Documents, Lender shall not enforce the liability and obligation of Borrower or
Borrower Principal, as applicable, to perform and observe the obligations
contained herein or in the other Loan Documents by any action or proceeding
wherein a money judgment shall be sought against Borrower or Borrower Principal,
except that Lender may, except with respect to Section 5.23 hereof, bring a
foreclosure action, action for specific performance or other appropriate action
or proceeding to enable Lender to enforce and realize upon this Agreement, the
Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, and the interest in the
Property, the Rents and any other collateral given to Lender created by this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents; provided,
however, that any judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be enforceable
against Borrower only to the extent of Borrower's interest in the Property, in
the Rents and in any other collateral given to Lender. Lender, by accepting this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, agrees that it
shall not, except as otherwise provided in this Section 15.1, sue for, seek or
demand any deficiency judgment against Borrower or Borrower Principal in any
such action or proceeding, under or by reason of or under or in connection with
this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents. The
provisions of this Section 15.1 shall not, however, (i) constitute a waiver,
release or impairment of any obligation evidenced or secured by this Agreement,
the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents; (ii) impair the right of
Lender to name Borrower or Borrower Principal as a party defendant in any action
or suit for judicial foreclosure and sale under this Agreement and the Mortgage;
(iii) affect the validity or enforceability of any indemnity (including, without
limitation, those contained in Section 12.6, with respect to Borrower or
Borrower Principal, Section 13.5, with respect to Borrower, and Article 14 of
this Agreement, with respect to Borrower), guaranty, master lease or similar
instrument made in connection with this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and
the other Loan Documents; (iv) impair the right of Lender to obtain the
appointment of a receiver; (v) impair the enforcement of the assignment of
leases provisions contained in the Mortgage; or (vi) impair the right of Lender
to obtain a deficiency judgment or other judgment on the Note against Borrower
or Borrower Principal if necessary to obtain any Insurance Proceeds or Awards to
which Lender would otherwise be entitled under this Agreement; provided however,
Lender shall only enforce such judgment to the extent of the Insurance Proceeds
and/or Awards.

         (b)      Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 15.1 to the
contrary:

                                      -96-
<PAGE>

                  (1)      Borrower and Borrower Principal shall be personally
liable to Lender on a joint and several basis for Losses due to:

                  (i)      fraud or intentional misrepresentation by Borrower,

         Principal in connection with the execution and the delivery of this
         Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage, any of the other Loan Documents, or
         any certificate, report, financial statement or other instrument or
         document furnished to Lender at the time of the closing of the Loan or
         during the term of the Loan;

                  (ii)     Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of
         Rents received by Borrower after the occurrence and during the
         continuance of an Event of Default;

                  (iii)    Borrower's misapplication or misappropriation of
         tenant security deposits or Rents collected in advance and which have
         not been applied to the operation of the Property;

                  (iv)     the misapplication or the misappropriation of
         Insurance Proceeds or Awards;

                  (v)      Borrower's failure to pay Taxes, Other Charges
         (except to the extent that sums sufficient to pay such amounts have
         been deposited in escrow with Lender pursuant to the terms hereof and
         there exists no impediment to Lender's utilization thereof) beyond any
         applicable notice and cure periods specified therein;

                  (vi)     any act of actual intentional physical waste or arson
         by Borrower, any principal, Affiliate, member or general partner
         thereof or by Borrower Principal, any principal, Affiliate, member or
         general partner thereof;

                  (vii)    the portion of any Rent paid by any Tenant more than
         thirty (30) days in advance that would have been payable by such Tenant
         from and after the occurrence of an Event of Default; or

                  (viii)   the failure by Borrower Principal to comply with the
         covenant set forth in Section 5.23 of this Agreement; and

                  (2)      Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to
Lender for Losses due to the Property, or any part thereof, becoming an asset in
(A) a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower or Borrower
Principal, or (B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower
or Borrower Principal in connection with which Borrower, Borrower Principal, SPE
Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing has or have solicited,
procured, or supported in any way with the creditors commencing or filing such
proceeding. Additionally, Borrower Principal shall be personally liable to
Lender for Losses in the event of a breach by Borrower or SPE Component Entity
of any of the covenants set forth in Article 6, except to the extent that such
breach was inadvertent, immaterial and is promptly cured in accordance with
Section 11.1(d).

         (c)      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the agreement of Lender not to
pursue recourse liability as set forth in subsection (a) above SHALL BECOME NULL
AND VOID and shall be

                                      -97-
<PAGE>

of no further force and effect and the Debt shall become fully recourse (1) to
Borrower and Borrower Principal, jointly and severally, in the event of a breach
of any of the covenants set forth in Article 7 hereof and (2) to Borrower in the
event (i) of a breach by Borrower or SPE Component Entity of any of the
covenants set forth in Article 6, except the extent that such breach was
inadvertent, immaterial and is promptly cured in accordance with Section 11.1(d)
hereof or (ii) the Property or any part thereof shall become an asset in (A) a
voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower or Borrower Principal,
or (B) an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of Borrower or
Borrower Principal in connection with which Borrower, Borrower Principal, SPE
Component Entity or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing has or have solicited,
procured, or supported in any way with the creditors commencing or filing such
proceeding.

         (d)      Nothing herein shall be deemed to be a waiver of any right
which Lender may have under Section 506(a), 506(b), 1111(b) or any other
provision of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to file a claim for the full amount of the
indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or to require that all collateral shall
continue to secure all of the indebtedness owing to Lender in accordance with
this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage or the other Loan Documents.

                               FURTHER ASSURANCES

         SECTION 17.1. REPLACEMENT DOCUMENTS

         Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of Lender as to the loss,
theft, destruction or mutilation of the Note or any other Loan Document which is
not of public record, and, in the case of any such mutilation, upon surrender
and cancellation of such Note or other Loan Document, Borrower will issue, in
lieu thereof, a replacement Note or other Loan Document, dated the date of such
lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note or other Loan Document in the same
principal amount thereof and otherwise of like tenor.

         SECTION 17.2. RECORDING OF MORTGAGE, ETC.

         Borrower forthwith upon the execution and delivery of the Mortgage and
thereafter, from time to time, will cause the Mortgage and any of the other Loan
Documents creating a lien or security interest or evidencing the lien hereof
upon the Property and each instrument of further assurance to be filed,
registered or recorded in such manner and in such places as may be required by
any present or future law in order to publish notice of and fully to protect and
perfect the lien or security interest hereof upon, and the interest of Lender
in, the Property. Borrower will pay all taxes, filing, registration or recording
fees, and all expenses incident to the preparation, execution, acknowledgment
and/or recording of the Note, the Mortgage, the other Loan Documents, any note,
deed of trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with
respect to the Property and any instrument of further assurance, and any
modification or amendment of the foregoing documents, and all federal, state,
county and municipal taxes, duties, imposts, assessments and charges arising out
of or in connection with the execution and delivery of the Mortgage, any deed of
trust or mortgage supplemental hereto, any security instrument with respect to
the Property or any instrument of further assurance, and any modification or
amendment of the foregoing documents, except where prohibited by law so to do.

         SECTION 17.3. FURTHER ACTS, ETC.

do, execute, acknowledge and deliver all and every further acts, deeds,

control agreements, notices of assignments, transfers and assurances as Lender
shall, from time to time, reasonably require, for the better

                                      -99-
<PAGE>

assuring, conveying, assigning, transferring, and confirming unto Lender the
property and rights hereby mortgaged, deeded, granted, bargained, sold,
conveyed, confirmed, pledged, assigned, warranted and transferred or intended
now or hereafter so to be, or which Borrower may be or may hereafter become
bound to convey or assign to Lender, or for carrying out the intention or
facilitating the performance of the terms of this Agreement or for filing,
registering or recording the Mortgage, or for complying with all Legal
Requirements. Borrower, on demand, will execute and deliver, and in the event it
shall fail to so execute and deliver, hereby authorizes Lender to execute in the
name of Borrower or without the signature of Borrower to the extent Lender may
lawfully do so, one or more financing statements and financing statement
amendments to evidence more effectively, perfect and maintain the priority of
the security interest of Lender in the Property. Borrower grants to Lender an
irrevocable power of attorney coupled with an interest for the purpose of
exercising and perfecting any and all rights and remedies available to Lender at
law and in equity, including without limitation, such rights and remedies
available to Lender pursuant to this Section 17.3.

         SECTION 17.4. CHANGES IN TAX, DEBT, CREDIT AND DOCUMENTARY STAMP LAWS

         (a)      If any law is enacted or adopted or amended after the date of
this Agreement which deducts the Debt from the value of the Property for the
purpose of taxation or which imposes a tax, either directly or indirectly, on
the Debt or Lender's interest in the Property, Borrower will pay the tax, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any. If Lender is advised by counsel chosen
by it that the payment of tax by Borrower would be unlawful or taxable to Lender
or unenforceable or provide the basis for a defense of usury then Lender shall
have the option by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120) days
to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without any prepayment premium.

         (b)      Borrower will not claim or demand or be entitled to any credit
or credits on account of the Debt for any part of the Taxes or Other Charges
assessed against the Property, or any part thereof, and no deduction shall
otherwise be made or claimed from the assessed value of the Property, or any
part thereof, for real estate tax purposes by reason of the Mortgage or the
Debt. If such claim, credit or deduction shall be required by law, Lender shall
have the option, by written notice of not less than one hundred twenty (120)
days, to declare the Debt immediately due and payable without any prepayment
premium.

         If at any time the United States of America, any State thereof or any
subdivision of any such State shall require revenue or other stamps to be
affixed to the Note, the Mortgage, or any of the other Loan Documents or impose
any other tax or charge on the same, Borrower will pay for the same, with
interest and penalties thereon, if any.

         SECTION 17.5. EXPENSES

         Borrower covenants and agrees to pay or, if Borrower fails to pay, to
reimburse, Lender upon receipt of written notice from Lender for all reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable, actual attorneys' fees and
disbursements reasonably incurred by Lender in accordance with this Agreement in
connection with (a) the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and all the costs of furnishing all opinions by

                                     -100-
<PAGE>

counsel for Borrower (including without limitation any opinions requested by
Lender as to any legal matters arising under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents with respect to the Property); (b) Borrower's ongoing performance of
and compliance with Borrower's respective agreements and covenants contained in
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents on its part to be performed or
complied with after the Closing Date, including, without limitation, confirming
compliance with environmental and insurance requirements; (c) following a
request by Borrower, Lender's ongoing performance and compliance with all
agreements and conditions contained in this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents on its part to be performed or complied with after the Closing Date;
(d) the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and administration of any
consents, amendments, waivers or other modifications to this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents and any other documents or matters requested by Lender; (e)
securing Borrower's compliance with any requests made pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement; (f) the filing and recording fees and expenses, title
insurance and reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for providing to Lender
all required legal opinions, and other similar expenses incurred in creating and
perfecting the Lien in favor of Lender pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Loan Documents; (g) enforcing or preserving any rights, in response to third
party claims or the prosecuting or defending of any action or proceeding or
other litigation, in each case against, under or affecting Borrower, this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the Property, or any other security given
for the Loan; and (h) enforcing any obligations of or collecting any payments
due from Borrower under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents or with respect
to the Property or in connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the
credit arrangements provided under this Agreement in the nature of a "work-out"
or of any insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings; provided, however, that Borrower
shall not be liable for the payment of any such costs and expenses to the extent
the same arise by reason of the gross negligence, illegal acts, fraud or willful
misconduct of Lender.

                                     WAIVERS

         SECTION 18.1. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE; WAIVERS

         The rights, powers and remedies of Lender under this Agreement shall be
cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which Lender
may have against Borrower or Borrower Principal pursuant to this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents, or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Lender's
rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or
otherwise, at such time and in such order as Lender may determine in Lender's
sole discretion. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power
accruing upon an Event of Default shall impair any such remedy, right or power
or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power
may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A
waiver of one Default or Event of Default with respect to Borrower shall not be
construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by
Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.

         SECTION 18.2. MODIFICATION, WAIVER IN WRITING

         No modification, amendment, extension, discharge, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement, or of the Note, or of any other Loan
Document, nor consent to any

                                     -101-
<PAGE>

departure by Borrower therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the same
shall be in a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought,
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance, and for the purpose, for which given. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, no notice to, or demand on Borrower, shall entitle Borrower to
any other or future notice or demand in the same, similar or other
circumstances.

         SECTION 18.3. DELAY NOT A WAIVER

         Neither any failure nor any delay on the part of Lender in insisting
upon strict performance of any term, condition, covenant or agreement, or
exercising any right, power, remedy or privilege hereunder, or under the Note or
under any other Loan Document, or any other instrument given as security
therefor, shall operate as or constitute a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other future exercise, or the exercise of
any other right, power, remedy or privilege. In particular, and not by way of
limitation, by accepting payment after the due date of any amount payable under
this Agreement, the Note or any other Loan Document, Lender shall not be deemed
to have waived any right either to require prompt payment when due of all other
amounts due under this Agreement, the Note or the other Loan Documents, or to
declare a default for failure to effect prompt payment of any such other amount.

         SECTION 18.4. TRIAL BY JURY

         BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER EACH HEREBY AGREES NOT TO ELECT
A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY ISSUE TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY JURY, AND WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY FULLY TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT SHALL NOW OR HEREAFTER
EXIST WITH REGARD TO THE LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR ANY CLAIM, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER
ACTION ARISING IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS
GIVEN KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY BY BORROWER, BORROWER PRINCIPAL AND LENDER, AND
IS INTENDED TO ENCOMPASS INDIVIDUALLY EACH INSTANCE AND EACH ISSUE AS TO WHICH
THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY WOULD OTHERWISE ACCRUE. EACH OF LENDER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND BORROWER IS HEREBY AUTHORIZED TO FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH IN
ANY PROCEEDING AS CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE OF THIS WAIVER BY BORROWER, BORROWER
PRINCIPAL AND LENDER.

         SECTION 18.5. WAIVER OF NOTICE

         Borrower shall not be entitled to any notices of any nature whatsoever
from Lender except with respect to matters for which this Agreement or the other
Loan Documents specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower and except with respect to matters for which Borrower is not,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, permitted to waive the giving of
notice. Borrower hereby expressly waives the right to receive any notice from
Lender with respect to any matter for which this Agreement or the other Loan

                                     -102-
<PAGE>

Documents do not specifically and expressly provide for the giving of notice by
Lender to Borrower.

         SECTION 18.6. REMEDIES OF BORROWER

         In the event that a claim or adjudication is made that Lender or its
agents have acted unreasonably or unreasonably delayed acting in any case where
by law or under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, Lender or such
agent, as the case may be, has an obligation to act reasonably or promptly,
Borrower agrees that neither Lender nor its agents shall be liable for any
monetary damages, and Borrower's sole remedies shall be limited to commencing an
action seeking injunctive relief or declaratory judgment. The parties hereto
agree that any action or proceeding to determine whether Lender has acted
reasonably shall be determined by an action seeking declaratory judgment. Lender
agrees that, in such event, it shall cooperate in expediting any action seeking
injunctive relief or declaratory judgment.

         SECTION 18.7. WAIVER OF MARSHALLING OF ASSETS

         To the fullest extent permitted by law, Borrower, for itself and its
successors and assigns, waives all rights to a marshalling of the assets of
Borrower, Borrower's partners and others with interests in Borrower, and of the
Property, and agrees not to assert any right under any laws pertaining to the
marshalling of assets, the sale in inverse order of alienation, homestead
exemption, the administration of estates of decedents, or any other matters
whatsoever to defeat, reduce or affect the right of Lender under the Loan
Documents to a sale of the Property for the collection of the Debt without any
prior or different resort for collection or of the right of Lender to the
payment of the Debt out of the net proceeds of the Property in preference to
every other claimant whatsoever.

         SECTION 18.8. WAIVER OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

         Borrower hereby expressly waives and releases, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, the pleading of any statute of limitations as a defense to
payment of the Debt or performance of its Other Obligations.

         SECTION 18.9. WAIVER OF COUNTERCLAIM

         Borrower hereby waives the right to assert a counterclaim, other than a
compulsory counterclaim, in any action or proceeding brought against it by
Lender or its agents.

                                   ARTICLE 19
                                  GOVERNING LAW

         SECTION 19.1. CHOICE OF LAW

         This Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract entered into pursuant
to the laws of the State of New York and shall in all respects be governed,
construed, applied and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York, provided however, (a) that with respect to the creation, perfection,
priority and enforcement of any Lien created by the Loan Documents, and the
determination of deficiency judgments, the laws of the state where the Property
is located

                                     -103-
<PAGE>

shall apply, and (b) with respect to the security interest in each of the
Reserve Accounts and the Lockbox Account, the laws of the state where each such
account is located shall apply.

         SECTION 19.2. SEVERABILITY

         Wherever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

         SECTION 19.3. PREFERENCES

         Lender shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply or
reverse and reapply any and all payments by Borrower to any portion of the
obligations of Borrower hereunder. To the extent Borrower makes a payment or
payments to Lender, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof are
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside
or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party under any
Creditors Rights Laws, state or federal law, common law or equitable cause,
then, to the extent of such payment or proceeds received, the obligations
hereunder or part thereof intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continue
in full force and effect, as if such payment or proceeds had not been received
by Lender.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         SECTION 20.1. SURVIVAL

         This Agreement and all covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made herein and in the certificates delivered pursuant hereto shall
survive the making by Lender of the Loan and the execution and delivery to
Lender of the Note, and shall continue in full force and effect so long as all
or any of the Debt is outstanding and unpaid unless a longer period is expressly
set forth herein or in the other Loan Documents. Whenever in this Agreement any
of the parties hereto is referred to, such reference shall be deemed to include
the legal representatives, successors and assigns of such party. All covenants,
promises and agreements in this Agreement, by or on behalf of Borrower, shall
inure to the benefit of the legal representatives, successors and assigns of
Lender.

         SECTION 20.2. LENDER'S DISCRETION

         Whenever pursuant to this Agreement, Lender exercises any right given
to it to approve or disapprove, or any arrangement or term is to be satisfactory

arrangements or terms are satisfactory or not satisfactory shall (except as is
otherwise specifically herein provided) be in the sole discretion of Lender and
shall be final and conclusive.

         SECTION 20.3. HEADINGS

         The Article and/or Section headings and the Table of Contents in this
Agreement are included herein for convenience of reference only and shall not
constitute a part of this Agreement for any other purpose.

         SECTION 20.4. COST OF ENFORCEMENT

         In the event (a) that the Mortgage is foreclosed in whole or in part,
(b) of the bankruptcy, insolvency, rehabilitation or other similar proceeding in
respect of Borrower or any of its constituent Persons or an assignment by
Borrower or any of its constituent Persons for the benefit of its creditors, or
(c) Lender exercises any of its other remedies under this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, Borrower shall be chargeable with and agrees to pay
all costs of collection and defense, including attorneys' fees and costs,
incurred by Lender or Borrower in connection therewith and in connection with
any appellate proceeding or post-judgment action involved therein, together with
all required service or use taxes.

         SECTION 20.5. SCHEDULES INCORPORATED

         The Schedules annexed hereto are hereby incorporated herein as a part
of this Agreement with the same effect as if set forth in the body hereof.

         SECTION 20.6. OFFSETS, COUNTERCLAIMS AND DEFENSES

         Any assignee of Lender's interest in and to this Agreement, the Note
and the other Loan Documents shall take the same free and clear of all offsets,
counterclaims or defenses which are unrelated to such documents which Borrower
may otherwise have against any assignor of such documents, and no such unrelated
counterclaim or defense shall be interposed or asserted by Borrower in any
action or proceeding brought by any such assignee upon such documents and any
such right to interpose or assert any such unrelated offset, counterclaim or
defense in any such action or proceeding is hereby expressly waived by Borrower.

         SECTION 20.7. NO JOINT VENTURE OR PARTNERSHIP; NO THIRD PARTY
BENEFICIARIES

         (a)      Borrower and Lender intend that the relationships created
hereunder and under the other Loan Documents be solely that of borrower and
lender. Nothing herein or therein is intended to create a joint venture,
partnership, tenancy-in-common, or joint tenancy relationship between Borrower
and Lender nor to grant Lender any interest in the Property other than that of
mortgagee, beneficiary or lender.

         (b)      This Agreement and the other Loan Documents are solely for the
benefit of Lender and Borrower and nothing contained in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents shall be deemed to confer upon anyone other than Lender and
Borrower any right to insist upon or to enforce the performance or observance of
any of the obligations contained herein or therein. All conditions to the
obligations of Lender to make the Loan hereunder are imposed solely and
exclusively for the benefit of Lender and no other Person shall have standing to
require satisfaction of such conditions in accordance with their terms or be
entitled to assume that Lender will refuse to make the Loan in the absence of
strict compliance with any or all thereof

                                     -105-
<PAGE>

and no other Person shall under any circumstances be deemed to be a beneficiary
of such conditions, any or all of which may be freely waived in whole or in part
by Lender if, in Lender's sole discretion, Lender deems it advisable or
desirable to do so.

         (c)      The general partners, members, principals and (if Borrower is
a trust) beneficial owners of Borrower are experienced in the ownership and
operation of properties similar to the Property, and Borrower and Lender are
relying solely upon such expertise and business plan in connection with the
ownership and operation of the Property. Borrower is not relying on Lender's
expertise, business acumen or advice in connection with the Property.

         (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
Lender is not undertaking the performance of (i) any obligations under the
Leases; or (ii) any obligations with respect to such agreements, contracts,
certificates, instruments, franchises, permits, trademarks, licenses and other
documents.

         (e)      By accepting or approving anything required to be observed,
performed or fulfilled or to be given to Lender pursuant to this Agreement, the
Mortgage, the Note or the other Loan Documents, including, without limitation,
any officer's certificate, balance sheet, statement of profit and loss or other
financial statement, survey, appraisal, or insurance policy, Lender shall not be
deemed to have warranted, consented to, or affirmed the sufficiency, the
legality or effectiveness of same, and such acceptance or approval thereof shall
not constitute any warranty or affirmation with respect thereto by Lender.

         (f)      Borrower recognizes and acknowledges that in accepting this
Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other Loan Documents, Lender is
expressly and primarily relying on the truth and accuracy of the representations
and warranties set forth in Article 4 of this Agreement without any obligation
to investigate the Property and notwithstanding any investigation of the
Property by Lender; that such reliance existed on the part of Lender prior to
the date hereof, that the warranties and representations are a material
inducement to Lender in making the Loan; and that Lender would not be willing to
make the Loan and accept this Agreement, the Note, the Mortgage and the other
Loan Documents in the absence of the warranties and representations as set forth
in Article 4 of this Agreement.

         SECTION 20.8. PUBLICITY

         All news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan, Lender, Banc of America Securities LLC, or any of their Affiliates
shall be subject to the prior written approval of Lender, not to be unreasonably
withheld, provided however, that Lender's consent shall not be required in
connection with any such news releases, publicity or advertising by Borrower or
its Affiliates to the extent Borrower or its Affiliates are required to make
such news releases pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements. Lender shall be
permitted to make any news, releases, publicity or advertising by Lender or its
Affiliates through any media intended to reach the general public which refers
to the Loan, the Property, Borrower, Borrower Principal and their respective
Affiliates without the approval of Borrower or any such Persons. Borrower also
agrees that Lender may share any information pertaining to the Loan with Bank of
America Corporation, including its bank subsidiaries, Banc of America Securities
LLC and any other Affiliates of the

                                     -106-
<PAGE>

foregoing, in connection with the sale or transfer of the Loan or any
Participations and/or Securities created. In the event of a conflict between any
of the provisions of this Section 20.8 and paragraph 5 of the Advisory
Agreement, the applicable provisions of the Advisory Agreement shall control.

         SECTION 20.9. CONFLICT; CONSTRUCTION OF DOCUMENTS; RELIANCE

         In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Agreement
and any of the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control. The parties hereto acknowledge that they were represented by competent
counsel in connection with the negotiation, drafting and execution of the Loan
Documents and that such Loan Documents shall not be subject to the principle of
construing their meaning against the party which drafted same. Borrower
acknowledges that, with respect to the Loan, Borrower shall rely solely on its
own judgment and advisors in entering into the Loan without relying in any
manner on any statements, representations or recommendations of Lender or any
parent, subsidiary or Affiliate of Lender. Lender shall not be subject to any
limitation whatsoever in the exercise of any rights or remedies available to it
under any of the Loan Documents or any other agreements or instruments which
govern the Loan by virtue of the ownership by it or any parent, subsidiary or
Affiliate of Lender of any equity interest any of them may acquire in Borrower,
and Borrower hereby irrevocably waives the right to raise any defense or take
any action on the basis of the foregoing with respect to Lender's exercise of
any such rights or remedies. Borrower acknowledges that Lender engages in the
business of real estate financings and other real estate transactions and
investments which may be viewed as adverse to or competitive with the business
of Borrower or its Affiliates.

         SECTION 20.10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT

         This Agreement and the other Loan Documents contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto and thereto in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, and all prior agreements among or between such
parties, whether oral or written between Borrower and Lender are superseded by

ARTICLE 21     OUT PARCEL RELEASE

         Section 21.1. Out Parcel Release. Provided no Event of Default exists
and is continuing, Borrower shall be entitled to a release from the lien of the
Mortgage of a portion of the Property (the "OUT PARCEL") more particularly
described as on Exhibit C hereof upon the following terms and conditions:

         (a)      Borrower shall deliver evidence satisfactory to Lender that
(i) the Property remaining encumbered by the lien of the Mortgage shall comply
with all Legal Requirements (including, without limitation, all zoning and
building codes), (ii) the Property remaining encumbered by the lien of the
Security Instrument shall constitute a separate lot for tax and assessment
purposes by no later than the earliest date permitted under applicable Legal
Requirements, (iii) the Out Parcel, at the time of release, remains an
unimproved parcel of land (exclusive of parking areas contained thereon), (iv)
such release shall not adversely affect ingress or egress to or from the
Property, (v) the documents with respect to such release shall not impose any
obligations or otherwise burden the Property in any way, (vi) Borrower has
obtained or caused to be obtained all necessary approvals, consents or permits
with respect to such release and (vii) the Out Parcel has been transferred to an
entity other than Borrower or any SPE Component Entity.

         (b)      Borrower shall (i) deliver to Lender (A) a revised, updated
Title Insurance Policy (or an endorsement to the existing Title Insurance
Policy) acceptable to Lender in all respects reflecting the release of the Out
Parcel and containing such endorsements as Lender shall reasonably require
(including, without limitation, a "date-down" or similar endorsement), (B) if
the Loan is part of a Securitization, Borrower shall deliver to Lender an
opinion of counsel acceptable to Lender and the Rating Agencies (issued by
counsel acceptable to Lender and the Rating Agencies) that the release of the
Out Parcel would not constitute a "significant modification" of the Loan under
Section 1001 of the Internal Revenue Code or otherwise cause a tax to be imposed
on a "prohibited transaction" by any REMIC Trust, and (C) such amendments or
modifications to the Loan Documents as Lender may reasonably require to reflect
the release of the Out Parcel (including, without limitation, an amendment to
the Mortgage substituting a revised legal description reflecting the release of
the Out Parcel), and (ii) pay all of Lender's reasonable costs and expenses in
connection with a release of the Out Parcel, including, without limitation,
reasonable counsel fees and disbursements and all recording fees and title
charges.

                              (ADVISORY AGREEMENT)

         The Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. (the "Company") agrees that all
advice given by Banc of America Securities LLC ("BAS") in connection with its
engagement hereunder is for the benefit and use of the Company in considering
its strategic situation and that no such advice shall be used for any other
purpose or be disclosed, reproduced, disseminated, quoted or referred to at any
time, in any manner or for any purpose, nor shall any public references to BAS
be made by or on behalf of the Company, in each case without BAS' prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. BAS agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of the confidential or proprietary information
("Confidential Information") provided by the Company to BAS in connection with
this engagement and to utilize or disclose the Confidential Information only in
connection with the activities and transactions contemplated by this letter
agreement (the "Permitted Use"). BAS shall only disclose the Confidential
Information (i) to its employees, officers, agents, advisors and other
representatives (collectively, its "Representatives") who need to know such
Confidential Information in connection with the Permitted Use or (ii) as
required by law, regulation or legal, governmental or regulatory process but
only after, in the case of this clause (iii), notice to the Company, unless such
notice is prohibited by law, regulation or legal, governmental or regulatory
process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not constitute
Confidential Information: (i) information which was already known to BAS prior
to its disclosure by the Company; (ii) information which is obtained by the BAS
from a third party who is not known by the BAS to be prohibited from disclosing
the information to the BAS by a contractual, legal or fiduciary obligation to
the Company; (iii) information which is or becomes publicly available (other
than as a result of disclosure by the BAS in violation of this paragraph); and
(iv) information which is independently developed, discovered or arrived at by
the BAS or any of its Representatives without use of Confidential Information.
BAS shall be liable for any beach of the provisions of this paragraph by its
Representatives. The obligations related to Confidential Information contained
in this paragraph shall terminate two years from the date of this letter
agreement and will survive any earlier termination of this letter agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, BAS and the Company
shall be permitted to disclose the tax treatment and tax structure of any
strategic alternative (including any materials, opinions or analyses relating to
such tax treatment or tax structure, but without disclosure of identifying
information or, except to the extent relating to such tax structure or tax
treatment, any nonpublic commercial or financial information) on and after the
earliest to occur of the date of (i) public announcement of discussions relating
to such strategic alternative, (ii) public announcement of such strategic
alternative or (iii) execution of a definitive agreement (with or without
conditions) to enter into such strategic alternative; provided, however, that if
such strategic alternative is not consummated for any reason, the provisions of
this sentence shall cease to apply with respect to such strategic alternative.

     2.   Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any untrue
          statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
          necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
          under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to

          cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
          this annual report;

     4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
          establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
          defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the
          registrant and have:

          a)   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
               disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
               supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
               known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
               the period in which this annual report is being prepared;

          b)   [Paragraph reserved pursuant to SEC Release No. 34-47986];

          c)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
               controls and procedures and presented in this annual report our
               conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
               and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
               annual report based on such evaluation; and

          d)   Disclosed in this annual report any change in the registrant's
               internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
               the registrant's most recent fourth quarter that has materially
               affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the
               registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

     5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed,
          based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
          financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit
          committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons
          performing the equivalent function):

          a)   All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial
               reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
               registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report
               financial information; and

          b)   Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
               internal control over financial reporting.

I, Thomas P. Heneghan, certify that:

     1.   I have reviewed this annual report on Form 10-K of Manufactured Home
          Communities, Inc;

     2.   Based on my knowledge, this annual report does not contain any untrue
          statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
          necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
          under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to
          the period covered by this annual report;

     3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
          information included in this annual report, fairly present in all

          cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in
          this annual report;

     4.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I are responsible for
          establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
          defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the
          registrant and have:

          a)   Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
               disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
               supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
               registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made
               known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
               the period in which this annual report is being prepared;

          b)   [Paragraph reserved pursuant to SEC Release No. 34-47986];

          c)   Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure
               controls and procedures and presented in this annual report our
               conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
               and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this
               annual report based on such evaluation; and

          d)   Disclosed in this annual report any change in the registrant's
               internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
               the registrant's most recent fourth quarter that has materially
               affected, or is reasonable likely to materially affect, the
               registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and

     5.   The registrant's other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based
          on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
          reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the
          registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent
          function):

          a)   all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
               design or operation of internal control over financial reporting
               which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's
               ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
               information; and

          b)   any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
               other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's
               internal control over financial reporting.
