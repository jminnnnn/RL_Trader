ITEM 1.   BUSINESS
                                  THE COMPANY

GENERAL

     Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, the "Company") is a fully integrated company which owns and
operates manufactured home communities. Manufactured home communities are
residential developments designed and improved for the placement of detached,
single-family manufactured homes which are produced off-site and installed
within the community. The owner of each home leases the site on which it is
located. Modern manufactured home communities are similar to typical residential
subdivisions containing centralized entrances, paved streets, curbs and gutters
and parkways. In addition, these communities often provide a clubhouse for
social activities and recreation and other amenities, which may include swimming
pools, shuffleboard courts, tennis courts, laundry facilities and cable
television service. Utilities are provided or arranged for by the owner of the
community. Some communities provide water and sewer service through public or
private utilities, while others provide these services to residents from on-site
facilities.

     The Company was formed to continue the property operations, business
objectives and acquisition strategies of an entity that has owned and operated
manufactured home communities since 1969. As of December 31, 1998, the Company
owned or controlled a portfolio of 154 manufactured home communities and
recreational vehicle ("RV") resorts (the "Properties") located throughout the
United States containing 53,391 residential sites. The Properties are located in
26 states (with the number of Properties in each state shown parenthetically) --
Florida (45), California (25), Arizona (19), Michigan (11), Colorado (10),
Delaware (7), Nevada (5), Indiana (4), Oregon (3), Kansas (3), Missouri (3),
Illinois (2), Iowa (2), New York (2), Utah (2), Pennsylvania (1), Maryland (1),
Minnesota (1), Montana (1), New Mexico (1), Ohio (1), Oklahoma (1), Texas (1),
Virginia (1), West Virginia (1), and Washington (1). As of December 31, 1998,
the Company also owned two commercial buildings located in California.

     The Company has approximately 800 full-time employees dedicated to carrying
out the Company's operating philosophy and strategies of value enhancement and
service to residents. The Company typically utilizes a one or two-person
management team (who reside at the Properties) for the on-site management of
each of the Properties. Typically, clerical and maintenance workers are employed
to assist these individuals in the management and care of the Properties. Direct
supervision of on-site management is the responsibility of the Company's five
regional vice presidents and five regional managers. These individuals have
significant experience in addressing the needs of residents and in finding or
creating innovative approaches to maximize value and increase cash flow from
property operations. Complementing this field management staff are approximately
50 corporate employees who assist on-site management in all property functions.

FORMATION OF THE COMPANY

     The Company, formed in March 1993, is a Maryland corporation, which has
elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The Company
generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it distributes
its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. REITs are subject to a number of
organizational and operational requirements. If the Company fails to qualify as
a REIT, its income is taxable at regular corporate rates. Even if the Company
qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company is subject to certain state and
local taxes on its income and property and Federal income and excise taxes on
its undistributed income.

     The operations of the Company are conducted through certain entities which
are owned or controlled by the Company. MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership") is the entity through which the Company conducts
substantially all of its operations. Sub-partnerships of the Operating
Partnership were created to: (i) facilitate mortgage financing (the "Financing
Partnerships"); (ii) facilitate the Company's ability to provide financing to
the owners of manufactured home communities ("Lending Partnership"); (iii) own
the management operations of the Company ("Management Partnerships"); and (iv)
own the assets and operations of certain utility companies which service the
Properties ("MHC Systems"). The financial results of the Operating Partnership
and sub-partnerships (together the "Subsidiaries") are consolidated in the
Company's consolidated financial statements.


                                       3
<PAGE>   4


     In addition, since certain activities, if performed by the Company, may not
be qualifying REIT activities under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), the Company has invested in the non-voting preferred stock
of various corporations which engage in such activities. Realty Systems, Inc.
("RSI") is engaged in the business of purchasing, selling, leasing and financing
manufactured homes that are located or will be located in properties managed by
the Company. RSI also provides brokerage services to residents at such
properties. Typically residents move from a community but do not relocate their
homes. RSI may provide brokerage services, in competition with other local
brokers, by seeking buyers for the homes. RSI also leases homes to prospective
residents with the expectation that the tenant eventually will purchase the
home. LP Management Corp. leases from the Operating Partnership certain real
property within or adjacent to certain of the Properties consisting of golf
courses, pro shops, restaurants and recreational vehicle areas. The Company
believes that RSI's and LP Management Corp.'s (collectively, "Affiliates")
activities benefit the Company by maintaining and enhancing occupancy at the
Properties. The Company accounts for its investment in and advances to
Affiliates using the equity method of accounting.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND OPERATING STRATEGIES

     The Company seeks to maximize both current income and long-term growth in
income. The Company focuses on manufactured home communities that have strong
cash flow growth potential and expects to hold such properties for long-term
investment and capital appreciation. These business objectives and their
implementation are determined by the Company's Board of Directors and may be
changed at any time. The Company's investment and operating approach includes:

     -   Aggressively managing the Properties to increase operating margins
         by maintaining competitive market rents, increasing occupancy and
         expense control;

     -   Increasing income and property values by continuing the strategic
         expansion and, where appropriate, renovation of the Properties;

     -   Utilizing management information systems to evaluate potential
         acquisitions, identify and track competing properties and monitor
         tenant satisfaction; and

     -   Selectively acquiring manufactured home communities that have potential
         for long-term cash flow growth.

     The Company is committed to enhancing its reputation as the most respected
brand name in the manufactured home community business. Its strategy is to own
and operate the highest quality communities in major metropolitan areas and
retirement destinations locations across the United States. The focus is on
creating an attractive residential environment for homeowners by providing a
well-maintained, comfortable community with a variety of organized recreational
and social activities and superior amenities. In addition, the Company regularly
surveys rental rates of competing properties and conducts satisfaction surveys
of residents to determine the factors residents consider most important in
choosing a manufactured home community.

FUTURE ACQUISITIONS

     The Company acquired or gained a controlling interest in eighty-five
properties during 1997 and 1998, more than doubling its portfolio. The Company
believes that opportunities for property acquisitions are particularly
attractive at this time because of increasing acceptability of and demand for
manufactured homes and continued constraints on development of new manufactured
home communities. The Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the
acquisition of new communities due to its experienced management, significant
presence in major real estate markets and substantial capital resources. The
Company is actively seeking to acquire additional communities and currently is
engaged in various stages of negotiations relating to the possible acquisition
of a number of communities.

                                       4
<PAGE>   5


     The Company anticipates that newly acquired properties will be located in
the United States. The Company utilizes market information systems to identify
and evaluate acquisition opportunities, including a market data base to review
the primary economic indicators of the various locations in which the Company
expects to expand its operations. Acquisitions will be financed from the most
appropriate sources of capital, which may include undistributed funds from
operations, issuance of additional equity securities, sales of investments,
collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings and issuance of debt securities.
In addition, the Company may cause the Operating Partnership to issue units of
limited partnership interests ("OP Units") to finance acquisitions. The Company
believes that an ownership structure which includes the Operating Partnership
will permit the Company to acquire additional manufactured home communities in
transactions that may defer all or a portion of the sellers' tax consequences.

     When evaluating potential acquisitions, the Company will consider such
factors as: (i) the replacement cost of the property; (ii) the geographic area
and type of property; (iii) the location, construction quality, condition and
design of the property; (iv) the current and projected cash flow of the property
and the ability to increase cash flow; (v) the potential for capital
appreciation of the property; (vi) the terms of tenant leases, including the
potential for rent increases; (vii) the potential for economic growth and the
tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is
located; (viii) the potential for expansion of the physical layout of the
property and/or the number of sites; (ix) the occupancy and demand by residents
for properties of a similar type in the vicinity and the residents profile; (x)
the prospects for liquidity through sale, financing or refinancing of the
property; and (xi) competition from existing manufactured home communities and
the potential for the construction of new communities in the area. The Company
expects to purchase manufactured home communities with physical and market
characteristics similar to the Properties in its current portfolio.

PROPERTY EXPANSIONS

     The Company will seek to increase the income generated from the Properties
and from any additional properties acquired by expanding the number of sites
available to be leased to residents if justified by local market conditions and
permitted by zoning and other applicable laws. Of the 154 Properties, ten may be
expanded consistent with existing zoning regulations. In 1999, the Company
expects to develop an additional 50 expansion sites within two of these
Properties. In addition, where appropriate, the Company will consider upgrading
or adding facilities and amenities to certain Properties in order to make those
Properties more attractive in their markets. As of December 31, 1998, the
Company had more than 1,050 expansion sites available for occupancy in eighteen
of the Properties. The Company filled 207 of the expansion sites in 1998 and
expects to fill an additional 200 to 300 sites in 1999.

LEASES

     The typical lease entered into between the tenant and one of the Company's
manufactured home communities for the rental of a site requires a security
deposit and is month-to-month or year-to-year, renewable upon the consent of
both parties or, in some instances, as provided by statute. These leases are
cancelable, depending on state law, for non-payment of rent, violation of
community rules and regulations or other specified defaults. Non-cancelable
long-term leases, with remaining terms ranging up to eleven years, are in effect
at certain sites within eight of the Properties. These leases are subject to
rental rate increases based on the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"), in some
instances taking into consideration certain floors and ceilings and allowing for
pass-throughs of certain items such as real estate taxes, utility expenses and
capital expenditures. Generally, market rate adjustments are made on an annual
basis.

REGULATIONS AND INSURANCE

     General. Manufactured home communities are subject to various laws,
ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to recreational
facilities such as swimming pools, clubhouses and other common areas. The
Company believes that each Property has the necessary permits and approvals to
operate.

                                       5
<PAGE>   6


     Rent Control Legislation. State and local rent control laws, principally in
California and Florida, limit the Company's ability to increase rents and to
recover increases in operating expenses and the costs of capital improvements.
Enactment of such laws has been considered from time to time in other
jurisdictions. The Company presently expects to continue to maintain
manufactured home communities, and may purchase additional properties, in
markets that are either subject to rent control or in which rent-limiting
legislation exists or may be enacted. For example, Florida has enacted a law
which generally provides that rental increases must be reasonable. Also, certain
jurisdictions in California in which the Company owns Properties limit rent
increases to changes in the CPI or some percentage thereof.

     Insurance. Management believes that the Properties are covered by adequate
fire, flood, property, earthquake and business interruption insurance (where
appropriate) provided by reputable companies and with commercially reasonable
deductibles and limits. The Company believes its insurance coverage is adequate
based on the Company's assessment of the risks to be insured, the probability of
loss and the relative cost of available coverage. The Company has obtained title
insurance insuring fee title to the Properties in an aggregate amount which the
Company believes to be adequate.

                                    INDUSTRY

THE MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITY INDUSTRY

     The Company believes that modern manufactured home communities, like the
Properties, provide an opportunity for increased cash flows and appreciation in
value. These may be achieved through increases in occupancy rates and rents, as
well as expense controls, expansion of existing Properties and opportunistic
acquisitions, for the following industry specific reasons:

     -  Barriers to Entry: The Company believes that the supply of new
        manufactured home communities will be constrained due to barriers to
        entry into the industry. The most significant barrier has been the
        difficulty in securing zoning from local authorities. This has been the
        result of (i) the public's historically poor perception of the business,
        and (ii) the fact that manufactured home communities generate less tax
        revenue because the homes are treated as personal property (a benefit to
        the home owner) rather than real property. Another factor that creates
        substantial barriers to entry is the length of time between investment
        in the communities' development and the attainment of stabilized
        occupancy and the generation of revenues. The initial development of the
        infrastructure may take up to two or three years. Once the community is
        ready for occupancy, it may be difficult to attract residents to an
        empty community. Substantial occupancy levels may take a number of years
        to achieve.

     -  Industry Consolidation: According to an industry analyst's manufactured
        home community industry report, there are approximately 50,000
        manufactured home communities in the United States and approximately
        24,000 of these communities have more than 60 sites. The Company
        believes that approximately 20% or 4,800 of the communities with more
        than 60 sites would be considered "investment-grade". The six public
        companies which own manufactured home communities own approximately 520
        or about 10% of the "investment-grade" communities. In addition, based
        on a report prepared by one analyst, the top 50 owners of manufactured
        home communities own approximately 38% of the "investment-grade" assets.
        The Company believes that this relatively high degree of fragmentation
        in the industry provides the Company, as a national organization with
        experienced management and substantial financial resources, the
        opportunity to purchase additional manufactured home communities at
        favorable prices.

     -  Stable Tenant Base: The Company believes that manufactured home
        communities tend to achieve and maintain a stable rate of occupancy due
        to the following factors: (i) residents own their own homes, (ii)
        manufactured home communities tend to foster a sense of community as a
        result of amenities such as club houses, recreational and social
        activities and (iii) since moving a manufactured home from one community
        to another involves substantial cost and effort, residents often sell
        their home in-place (similar to site-built residential housing) with no
        interruption of rental payments.

MANUFACTURED HOUSING

     Based on the current growth in the number of individuals living in
manufactured homes, the Company believes that manufactured homes are
increasingly viewed by the public as an attractive and economical form of
housing. According to the industry's trade association, nearly one in four new
single family homes sold in the United States today is factory-built.


                                       6

<PAGE>   7

     The Company believes that the growing popularity of manufactured housing is
primarily the result of the following factors:

     - Importance of Home Ownership. According to the Fannie Mae 1998 National
     Housing Survey ("FNMA Survey") renters' desire to own a home is stronger 
     now than at any time in the 1990's. Security and permanence are thought to
     be non-financial reasons to own a home. The commitment to home ownership is
     tempered by an awareness of the high cost of owning a home. The
     affordability of manufactured housing allows many individuals to achieve
     this goal without jeopardizing their financial security.

     - Affordability. For a significant number of persons, manufactured housing
     represents the only means of achieving home ownership. In addition, the
     total cost of housing in a manufactured home community (home cost, site 
     rent and related occupancy costs) is competitive with and often lower than
     the total cost of alternative housing, such as apartments and condominiums.

     - Lifestyle Choice. As the average age of the United States population has
     increased, manufactured housing has become an increasingly popular housing
     alternative for retirement and "empty-nest" living. According to the FNMA,
     among those people who are nearing retirement (age 40 to 54), approximately
     33% plan on moving upon retirement. Approximately 44% of adults age 40 to 
     54 and 14% of adults age 55 and over are expected to become "empty nesters"
     within the next ten years. The Company believes that manufactured housing 
     is especially attractive to such individuals when located within a 
     community that offers an appealing amenity package, close proximity to 
     local services, social activities, low maintenance and a secure 
     environment.

     - Construction Quality. Since 1976, all manufactured housing has been
     required to meet stringent Federal standards, resulting in significant
     increases in the quality of the industry's product. The Department of
     Housing and Urban Development's standards for manufactured housing
     construction quality are the only Federally regulated standards governing
     housing quality of any type in the United States. Manufactured homes
     produced since 1976 have received a "red and silver" government seal
     certifying that they were built in compliance with the Federal code. The
     code regulates manufactured home design and construction, strength and
     durability, fire resistance and energy efficiency, and the installation and
     performance of heating, plumbing, air conditioning, thermal and electrical
     systems. In newer homes, top grade lumber and dry wall materials are
     common. Also, manufacturers are required to follow the same fire codes as
     builders of site-built structures.

     - Comparability to Site-Built Homes. The manufactured housing industry has
     experienced a recent trend towards multi-section homes. Many modern
     manufactured homes are longer (up to 80 feet compared to 50 feet in the
     1960s) and wider than earlier models. Many homes have vaulted ceilings,
     fireplaces and as many as four bedrooms and closely resemble single family
     site-built homes.

ITEM 2.   PROPERTIES

    The Company believes that the Properties provide attractive amenities and
common facilities that create a comfortable and attractive community for the
residents, with most offering a clubhouse, a swimming pool, laundry facilities
and cable television service. Many also offer additional amenities such as
sauna/whirlpool spas, golf courses, tennis, shuffleboard and basketball courts
and exercise rooms. Since residents own their homes, it is their responsibility
to maintain their homes and the surrounding area. It is management's role to
insure that residents comply with community policies and to provide maintenance
of the common areas, facilities and amenities. The Company holds periodic
meetings of its property management personnel for training and implementation of
the Company's strategies. The Properties historically have had and the Company
believes they will continue to have low turnover and high occupancy rates due in
part to this strategy.

    The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects the
Company's belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the portfolio
from regional economic influences. The Company intends to target new
acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located and will also
consider acquisitions of properties outside such markets. The Company's five
largest markets of Properties owned are Florida (45 Properties), California (25
Properties), Arizona (19 Properties), Michigan (11 Properties) and Colorado (10
Properties). These markets accounted for 34%, 17%, 11%, 4%, and 8%,
respectively, of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31,
1998. The Company also has Properties located in the following markets:
Northeast, Northwest, Midwest, and Nevada/Utah/New Mexico. The Company's largest
Property, Bay Indies, located in Venice, Florida accounted for 3% of the
Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31, 1998.

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     The residents of DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates, a property located in
Santa Cruz, California (the "City") previously brought several actions opposing
certain fees and charges in connection with water service at the Property. The
trial of the ongoing utility charge dispute with the residents of this Property
concluded on January 22, 1999. This summary provides the history and reasoning
underlying the Company's defense of the residents' claims and explains the
Company's decision to continue to defend its position, which the Company
believes is fair and accurate.

     DeAnza Santa Cruz Mobile Estates is a 198 site community overlooking the
Pacific Ocean. It is subject to the City's rent control ordinance which limits
annual rent increases to 75% of CPI. The Company purchased this Property in
August 1994 from certain unaffiliated DeAnza entities ("DeAnza"). Prior to the
Company's purchase in 1994, DeAnza made the decision to submeter the Property
for both water and sewer in 1993 in the face of the City's rapidly rising
utility costs.

     Under California Civil Code Section 798.41, DeAnza was required to reduce
rent by an amount equal to the average cost of usage over the preceding 12
months. This was done. With respect to water, not looking to submit to
jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission ("PUC"), DeAnza relied on Public
Utilities Code Section 2705.5 ("PUC Section 2705.5") to determine what rates
would be charged for water on an ongoing basis without becoming a public
utility. This statute provides that in a submetered mobilehome park, the
property owner is not subject to regulation and control of the PUC so long as
the users are charged what they would be charged by the utility company if users
received their water directly from the utility company. In Santa Cruz, customers
receiving their water directly from the city's water utility were charged a
certain lifeline rate for the first 400 ccfs of water and a greater rate for
usage over 400 ccfs of water, a readiness to serve charge of $7.80 per month and
tax on the total. In reliance on PUC Section 2705.5, DeAnza implemented its
billings on this schedule notwithstanding that it did not receive the discount
for the first 400 ccfs of water because it was a commercial and not a
residential customer.

     A dispute with the residents ensued over the readiness to serve charge and
tax thereon. The residents argued that California Civil Code Section 798.41
required that the park owner could only pass through its actual costs of water
(and that the excess charges over the amount of the rent rollback were an
improper rent increase) and that PUC Section 2705.5 was not applicable. DeAnza
unbundled the utility charges from rent consistent with California Civil Code
Section 798.41 and it has generally been undisputed that the rent rollback was
accurately calculated.

     In August 1994, when the Company acquired the Property, the Company
reviewed the respective legal positions of the Santa Cruz Homeowners Association
("HOA") and DeAnza and concurred with DeAnza. Their reliance on PUC Section
2705.5 made both legal and practical sense in that residents paid only what they
would pay if they lived in a residential neighborhood within the city of Santa
Cruz and permitted DeAnza to recoup part of the expenses of operating a
submetered system through the readiness to serve charge.

     Over a period of 18 months from 1993 into May of 1995, a series of
complaints were filed by the HOA and Herbert Rossman, a resident, against
DeAnza, and later, the Company. DeAnza and the Company demurred to each of these
complaints on the grounds that the PUC had exclusive jurisdiction over the
setting of water rates and that residents under rent control had to first
exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding in a civil action. At
one point, the case was dismissed (with leave to amend) on the basis that
jurisdiction was with the PUC and, at another point, Mr. Rossman was dismissed
from the case because he had not exhausted his administrative remedies.

     On June 29, 1995, a hearing was held before a Santa Cruz rent control
officer on the submetering of both water and sewer. The Company and DeAnza
prevailed on all issues related to sewer and the rent rollback related to water,
but the hearing officer determined that the Company could only pass through its
actual cost of water, i.e., a prorated readiness to serve charge and tax
thereon. The hearing officer did not deal with the subsidy being given to
residents through the quantity charge and ordered a rebate in a fixed amount per
resident. The Company and DeAnza requested reconsideration on this issue, among
others, which reconsideration was denied by the hearing officer.

     The Company then took a writ of mandate (an appeal from an administrative
order) to the Superior Court and, pending this appeal, the residents, the
Company and the City agreed to stay the effect of the hearing officer's decision
until the Court rendered judgment.


                                       12
<PAGE>   13


     In July 1996, the Superior Court affirmed the hearing officer's decision
without addressing concerns about the failure to take the subsidy on the
quantity charge into account.

     The Company requested that the City and the HOA agree to a further stay
pending appeal to the court of appeals, but they refused and the appeals court
denied the Company's request for a stay in late November 1996. Therefore, on
January 1, 1997, the Company reduced its water charges at this Property to
reflect a pass-through of only the readiness to serve charge and tax at the
master meter (approximately $0.73) and to eliminate the subsidy on the water
charges. On their March 1, 1997 rent billings, residents were credited for
amounts previously "overcharged" for readiness to serve charge and tax. The
amount of the rebate given by the Company was $36,400. In calculating the
rebate, the Company and DeAnza took into account the previous subsidy on water
usage although this issue had not yet been decided by the court of appeals. The
Company and DeAnza felt legally safe in so doing based on language in the
hearing officer's decision that actual costs could be passed through.

     On March 12, 1997, the Company also filed an application with the PUC to
dedicate the water system at this Property to public use and have the PUC set
cost based rates for water usage. The Company believed it was obligated to take
this action because of its consistent reliance on PUC Section 2705.5 as a safe
harbor from PUC jurisdiction. That is, when the Company could no longer charge
for water as the local serving utility would charge, it was no longer exempt
from the PUC's jurisdiction and control under PUC Section 2705.5.

     On March 20, 1997, the court of appeals issued the writ of mandate
requested by the Company on the grounds that the hearing officer had improperly
calculated the amount of the rebate (meaning the Company had correctly
calculated the rent credits), but also ruling that the hearing officer was
correct when he found that the readiness to serve charge and tax thereon as
charged by DeAnza and the Company were an inappropriate rent increase. The court
of appeals further agreed with the Company that the city's hearing officer did
not have the authority under California Civil Code Section 798.41 to establish
rates that could be charged in the future.

     Following this decision, the PUC granted the Company its certificate of
convenience and necessity on December 17, 1998 and approved cost based rates and
charges for water that exceed what residents were paying under the Company's
reliance on PUC Section 2705.5. Concurrently, the PUC also issued an Order
Instituting Investigation ("OII") confirming its exclusive jurisdiction over the
issue of water rates in a submetered system and commencing an investigation into
the confusion and turmoil over billings in submetered properties. Specifically,
the OII states: "The Commission has exclusive and primary jurisdiction over the
establishment of rates for water and sewer services provided by private
entities."

     Specifically, the PUC ruling regarding the Company's application stated:
"The ultimate question of what fees and charges may or may not be assessed,
beyond external supplier pass-through charges, for in-park facilities when a
mobile home park does not adhere to the provisions of PUC Section 2705.5, must
be decided by the Commission."

     After the court of appeals decision, the HOA brought all of its members
back into the underlying civil action for the purpose of determining damages,
including punitive damages, against the Company. The trial was continued from
July 1998 to January 1999 to give the PUC time to act on the Company's
application. Notwithstanding the action taken by the PUC in issuing the OII in
December 1998, the trial court denied the Company's motion to dismiss on
jurisdictional grounds and trial commenced before a jury on January 11, 1999.

     Not only did the trial court not consider the Company's motion to dismiss,
the trial court refused to allow evidence of the OII or the Company's PUC
approval to go before the jury. Notwithstanding the Company's strenuous
objections, the judge also allowed evidence of the Company's and DeAnza's
litigation tactics to be used as evidence of bad faith and oppressive actions
(including evidence of the application to the PUC requesting a $22.00 readiness
to serve charge). The Company's motion for a mistrial based upon these
evidentiary rulings was denied. On January 22, 1999, the jury returned a verdict
awarding $6.0 million of punitive damages against the Company and DeAnza. The
Company had previously agreed to indemnify DeAnza on the matter.

     The Company is preparing to bond the judgment pending appeal in accordance 
with California procedural rules which require a bond equal to 150% of the 
amount of the judgment.  Post-judgment interest will accrue at the statutory 
rate of 10.0% per annum.

                                        
                                       13

<PAGE>   14


     The Company will participate in post trial motions including a case
management conference before March 15, 1999. The post trial motions will include
a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, new trial and remittitur (a
procedure whereby the trial judge could unilaterally reduce the punitive damages
award). To the extent the Company is unable to obtain relief in the form of
reversal or reduction of the award in the trial court pursuant to post trial
motions, relief from the verdict, if any, will have to come on appeal.

     Generally, the Company's appeal will focus on two areas: 1) lack of
jurisdiction in the trial court; and 2) trial error. Given that the PUC has
issued an OII confirming its exclusive jurisdiction over the issue of water
rates in a submetered system, that there was generally no dispute with respect
to the rent roll back to achieve relief from rent control, the magnitude of the
verdict in light of reasonable reliance on the PUC's statutory authority, use of
prejudicial evidence against the Company and denial of the Company's rights to
present the PUC decision and related evidence, the Company believes the court of
appeals will reverse or substantially reduce the punitive damage award. However,
there can be no assurances that this will occur.

     The Company's view is that the range of possible loss on this matter at
this time based on the opposing legal theories is from 0 (zero) (without
considering the Company's litigation expense which is not expected to be
material) to $6 million (plus costs which the Company expect plaintiffs' counsel
to claim, the Company's litigation expense, cost of the bond and post-judgment
interest). The HOA is also seeking to recover attorneys fees in connection with
the trial, including a multiplier of such fees which may result in an attorneys
fee award in the range of $700,000 to $900,000. This is in addition to the
$100,000 award referred to above. The Company will vigorously oppose such award
of attorney fees.

     Under the Company's theory of the case, once appropriate unbundling of the
utility service from rent has occurred, only the PUC has exclusive jurisdiction
regarding rates that may be charged for utility services on a prospective basis.
The Company believes the actions by the PUC in reiterating its exclusive
jurisdiction, agreeing with the Company's interpretation of PUC Section 2705.5,
and in certificating the Company's utility company through the establishment of
cost based rates for the Property validate its previous reliance on PUC Section
2705.5 as a means of recovering a portion of the cost of providing water at the
Property. Based on the PUC's rulings, while legal expense will be incurred in
further defense, it follows that residents did not incur any actual damages (in
the form of "overcharges") and may be liable to return amounts previously repaid
by the Company and DeAnza.

     Obviously, plaintiff's theory as described herein has resulted not only in
a refund to residents of amounts "overcharged", but also in the punitive damage
award. To avoid trying this case on the merits, plaintiffs introduced
substantial evidence of legal strategy and objected strenuously (and
successfully) to introduction of evidence supporting the Company on the merits.

     Currently, there is little or no settlement potential unless the trial
court indicates to plaintiffs at a scheduled case management conference
(February 24, 1999) that it is seriously considering granting a new trial or
other relief to the Company based on post trial motions. Estimated legal
expense, if this matter is not resolved prior to appeal, during the next 15
months could reach between $300,000 and $500,000.

     In a separate matter, on September 29, 1995, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") issued its Findings of Violations and
Order for Compliance with respect to the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System ("NPDES") Permit governing the operation of the on-site waste
water treatment plant at one of the Company's Properties. On October 6, 1995,
the USEPA issued its Findings of Violation and Order for Compliance with respect
to the NPDES Permit governing the operation of the on-site waste water treatment
plant at another of the Company's Properties. The Company and USEPA have reached
a tentative agreement to resolve the matter in which the operation of the
remaining waste water treatment plant would be subject to a consent decree that
would provide for fines and penalties in the event of future violations and the
Company would contribute monies to a supplemental environmental project and pay
a fine. The tentative agreement has not yet been reduced to writing and
therefore remains subject to change. The Company does not believe the impact of
the settlement will be material and the Company believes it has established
adequate reserves for any amounts that may be paid.

     In another matter, in connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg
Communities and pursuant to orders of the California Superior Court,
approximately $30 million of the amounts paid by the Company have been deposited
with the court appointed winding up agents (the "Winding Up Agents"). The
deposited amounts relate to claims (the "Karno Claims") of Norton S. Karno (and
related entities) who at various times has been a creditor, advisor, lawyer and
shareholder of certain of the entities related to the Ellenburg Communities. The
Winding Up Agents have disputed the claims and have filed a complaint against
Mr. Karno (and related entities) requesting that the court determine that the
claims be reduced or eliminated.

     On October 30, 1998, the Company received notice of a lawsuit filed against
the Company and certain Executive Officers of the Company in the Los Angeles
Superior Court alleging, among other causes of action, that the Company breached
certain agreements in connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg
Communities and claiming damages in excess of $50 million plus punitive damages.
Based upon jurisdictional issues, in February 1999 the claims against the
Executive Officers of the Company were dismissed. The Company believes most of
the claim relates to the disputed Karno Claims discussed above. The Company
believes the claims are without merit, intends to vigorously defend the
defendants in this matter and does not believe the impact of this matter will be
material.

     In connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities, Mr. Karno
and others have appealed various court orders on which the Company has relied.
The court of appeals has recently requested briefing on the issue of whether
certain appeals are moot. Mr. Karno has also sought before both the California
Superior Court and Court of Appeals to take control of ECC, but to date none of
his attempts have been successful.

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business.  All proceedings herein described or referred to,
taken together, are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the
Company.

     respectively.

(3)  The $265 million mortgage note payable (the "Mortgage Debt") bears interest
     at 7.015% through February 1, 2008.

     The Company has a $175 million credit facility bearing interest at the
     London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 1.125% ($145 million was
     outstanding at December 31, 1998).

     In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
     "1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate
     debt at 6.4% for the period, 1998 through 2003. By fixing the rate on $100
     million of debt, the Company avoids the general uncertainty relating to the
     floating interest rate on the Company's variable rate debt through such
     time.

(4)  The Company generally considers Funds From Operations ("FFO") to be an
     appropriate measure of the performance of an equity REIT. FFO was defined
     by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") in
     March 1995 as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted
     accounting principles ["GAAP']), before allocation to minority interests,
     excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate
     depreciation and after adjustments for significant non-recurring items, if
     any. In the first quarter of 1996, the Company adopted this new definition
     of FFO which is effective for periods ending after December 31, 1995. For
     purposes of presenting FFO, the revised definition of FFO has been given
     retroactive treatment. Prior to this adoption, FFO was defined as income
     before allocation to minority interests plus certain non-cash items,
     primarily depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that FFO is
     helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity REIT
     because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing
     activities and investing activities, it provides investors an understanding
     of the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital
     expenditures. The Company computes FFO in accordance with the NAREIT
     definition which may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO
     utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to
     such other REITs. FFO in and of itself does not represent cash generated
     from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not
     be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the
     Company's performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as
     determined by GAAP as a measure of liquidity and is not necessarily
     indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.

(5)  During 1994, 23 Properties were acquired, which had an aggregate net
     operating income of $10.3 million in 1994, which included approximately
     $3.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense. Also during 1994,
     three properties were sold; net operating income attributable to such
     properties was approximately $30,500, which included approximately $32,000
     of depreciation and amortization expense. During the year ended December
     31, 1995, two properties were sold; net operating income attributable to
     such properties was approximately $235,000, which included approximately
     $83,000 of depreciation and amortization expense. During the year ended
     December 31, 1996, four Properties were acquired; net operating income
     attributable to such Properties was approximately $1.8 million, which
     included approximately $371,000 of depreciation and amortization expense.
     During the year ended December 31, 1997, 39 Properties were acquired; net
     operating income attributable to such Properties was approximately $3.8
     million, which included approximately $1.7 million of depreciation and
     amortization expense. During the year ended December 31, 1998, 41
     Properties were acquired; net operating income attributable to such
     Properties was approximately $7.6 million, which included approximately
     $3.9 million of depreciation and amortization expense.

     The Company believes that the book value of the Properties, which reflectsx
     historical costs of such real estate assets less accumulated depreciation,
     is less than the current market value of the Properties.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

     COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997

     Since December 31, 1997, the gross investment in rental property has
increased from $936 million to $1,237 million as of December 31, 1998 due to the
acquisition of the following properties (collectively, the "1998 Acquisition
Properties"): (i) the Ellenburg Communities; (ii) Quail Meadows on January 8,
1998; (iii) Sherwood Forest RV Resort on April 30, 1998; (iv) Casa Del Sol
Resort III on May 14, 1998; (v) a portfolio of eighteen properties (the "College
Heights Communities") on June 4, 1998; and (vi) Sunset Oaks on August 13, 1998.
The total number of sites owned and controlled has increased from 44,108 as of
December 31, 1997 to 53,391 as of December 31, 1998.

     The following table summarizes certain weighted average statistics for the
years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997.  "Core Portfolio" represents an analysis
of properties owned during both periods of comparison.

</TABLE>

     Base rental income ($165 million) increased $56.3 million or 51.7%. For the
Core Portfolio, base rental income increased approximately $4.1 million or 4.1%,
reflecting an increase in base rental rates. The remaining $52.2 million
increase in base rental income was attributed to the properties acquired in 1997
and the 1998 Acquisition Properties (collectively, the "1997 and 1998
Acquisition Properties").


                                       18
<PAGE>   19


Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 1.5%, reflecting a
4.4% increase in monthly base rent per site for the Core Portfolio offset by
lower monthly base rents for the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties. Average
monthly base rent per site for the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties was $329
for the year ended December 31, 1998.

     Weighted average occupancy decreased 0.4% due to the addition of the 1997
and 1998 Acquisition Properties to the portfolio with lower occupancy
percentages, partially offset by increased occupancy at the Core Portfolio The
0.2% increase at the Core Portfolio reflects a 0.4% decrease attributed to lower
occupancy at four family properties and lower occupancy at two properties where
the Company has implemented a program to upgrade the resident profile and
housing stock. Excluding these communities, occupancy at the Core Portfolio
increased 0.6%.

     Utility and other income ($25.4 million) increased $13.6 million or 115.3%,
due to an increase of $13.1 million attributed to the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition
Properties,  including $7.2 million of RV income. The remaining $500,000
increase reflected increased  utility income, real estate tax pass-ons and other
miscellaneous income at the Core Portfolio.

     Interest income ($3.0 million) increased $1.1 million or 57.0%, primarily
due to the issuance of $14.6 million of notes receivable and an increase in
interest earned on short-term investments. Short-term investments had average
balances for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 of approximately $6.9
million and $4.7 million, respectively, which earned interest income at an
effective rate of 5.4% per annum in both years.

     Property operating and maintenance expenses ($53.0 million) increased $20.7
million or 64.1%. Of this increase $19.4 million is attributed to the 1997 and
1998 Acquisition Properties. The remaining $1.3 million increase includes
approximately $300,000 of one-time expenses associated with water main breaks,
storm damage and legal costs at the Core Portfolio. The Core Portfolio also
experienced increases in property payroll, property general and administrative
expenses and insurance and other expenses. Property operating and maintenance
expenses represented 27.2% of total revenues in 1998 and 26.2% in 1997.

     Real estate taxes ($14.5 million) increased $6.1 million or 73.3% due to
the impact of the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition Properties.  Real estate taxes
represented 7.4% of total revenues in 1998 and 6.8% in 1997.

     Property management expenses ($7.1 million) increased $2.0 million or
39.9%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in management company
payroll and incremental costs associated with self management of the 1997 and
1998 Acquisition Properties. Property management expenses represented 3.6% of
total revenues in 1998 and 4.1% of total revenues in 1997.

     General and Administrative expenses ("G&A") ($5.4 million) increased
$851,000 or 18.7%.  The increase was primarily due to increased payroll.  G&A
represented 2.8% of total revenues in 1998 and 3.7% in 1997.

     Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA")
increased $41.6 million or 56.8%.  Approximately $37.6 million of the increase
related to the 1997 and 1998 Acquisition  Properties.  The remaining increase
reflected increased base rental income at the Core Portfolio.  EBITDA
represented 58.9% of total revenues in 1998 and 59.2% in 1997.

     Interest and related amortization ($49.7 million) increased $27.9 million
or 128.4%. The increase was due to higher weighted average outstanding debt
balances during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for
the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 were $696 million and $301.3 million,
respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.2% in 1998 and 7.1% in 1997.
Interest and related amortization represented 25.5% of total revenues in 1998
and 17.6% in 1997.

     The Company has a $265.0 million mortgage note (the "Mortgage Debt")
collateralized by 29 properties beneficially owned by MHC Financing Limited
Partnership. The Mortgage Debt has a maturity date of January 2, 2028 and pays
interest only at 7.015%. There is no principal amortization until February 1,
2008 after which principal and interest are paid from available cash flow and
the interest rate is reset at a rate equal to the then 10-year U.S. Treasury
obligations plus 2.0%.

     The Company has an unsecured line of credit with a bank (the "Credit
Agreement") bearing interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus
1.125%. On April 28, 1998, the Company amended the Credit Agreement, increasing
the line of credit from $100 million to $150 million. On December 18, 1998, the
Company further amended the Credit Agreement, increasing the line of credit from
$150 million to $175 million. The Credit Agreement matures on August 17, 2000,
at which time the Company may extend the maturity date to August 17, 2002 and
the Credit Agreement would be converted to a term loan. The Company pays a fee
on the average unused amount of such credit equal to 0.15% of such amount. As of
December 31, 1998, $145 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The
Company paid fees related to the amendments which were immaterial.


                                       19
<PAGE>   20


     The Company has a term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of banks with
interest only payable monthly at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%. On April 28, 1998,
the Company amended the Term Loan to increase the borrowing from $60 million to
$100 million. The Term Loan matures on April 3, 2000 and may be extended to
April 3, 2002. The Company used the $40 million in proceeds to repay a portion
of the $50 million previously borrowed on April 7, 1998 under the Term Loan. The
Company paid fees related to this amendment which were immaterial.

     In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
"1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at
6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only
of legal costs which were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap is
impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been
entered into on December 31, 1998, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have
been 4.56%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for the
1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus its current
value by approximately $39,000. The Company accounts for the 1998 Swap as a
hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap are accounted for as an
adjustment to interest expense.

     Depreciation on corporate assets ($995,000)  increased $405,000 or 68.8%
due to fixed asset additions in 1997 and 1998 associated with the Company's
upgrade of certain computer systems  infrastructure and the wide area network.
Depreciation on corporate assets represented 0.5% of total revenues in both 1998
and 1997.

     Depreciation  on real estate  assets and other costs ($28.4  million)
increased $11.1 million or 63.7% as a result of 1997 and 1998 Acquisition
Properties.  Depreciation  on real estate assets and other costs represented
14.6% of total revenues in 1998 and 14.1% in 1997.

     COMPARISON OF YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1996

     Since December 31, 1996, the gross investment in rental property increased
from $598 million to $936 million as of December 31, 1997 due to the acquisition
of the following properties (the "1997 Acquisition Properties"): (i) California
Hawaiian on March 14, 1997; (ii) Golf Vista Estates on March 27, 1997; (iii)
Golden Terrace South on May 30, 1997; (iv) a portfolio of eighteen manufactured
home communities and two commercial properties (collectively, the "MPW
Properties") on August 29, 1997; (v) Arrowhead Village on September 16, 1997,
and (vi) seventeen of the Ellenburg Communities on December 18, 1997. The total
number of sites owned and controlled increased from 27,356 as of December 31,
1996 to 44,108 as of December 31, 1997.

     The following table summarizes certain weighted average statistics for the 
years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996.  "Core Portfolio" represents an analysis

</TABLE>

     Base rental income ($109 million) increased $15.9 million or 17.0%. For the
Core Portfolio,  base rental income increased approximately $4.7 million or
5.2%,  reflecting a 4.3% increase in base rental rates and a 0.9% increase
related to occupancy.  The remaining $11.2 million increase in base rental
income was attributed to the 1997 Acquisition Properties.

     Monthly base rent per site for the total portfolio increased 5.5%,
reflecting a 4.2% increase in monthly base rent per site for the Core Portfolio
and higher monthly base rents for the 1997 Acquisition Properties.  Average
monthly base rent per site for the 1997 Acquisition Properties was $343 for the
year ended December 31, 1997.

     Weighted average occupancy increased 0.7% due to increased occupancy at the
expansion communities and the addition of the 1997 Acquisition Properties with
higher occupancy percentages to the portfolio.

     Utility and other income ($11.8 million) increased $3.0 million or 33.6%,
primarily due to an increase of $1.2 million attributed to the 1997 Acquisition
Properties,  the collection of dividend income of $173,000 in the first quarter
of 1997, and increased utility income, real estate tax pass-ons and other
miscellaneous income at the Core Portfolio.

     Interest income ($1.9 million) decreased $479,000 or 19.8%, primarily due
to the repayment of $13 million of notes receivable in August 1997, partially
offset by an increase in interest earned on short-term investments. Short-term
investments had average balances for the years ended December 31, 1997 and 1996
of approximately $4.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively, which earned
interest income at an effective rate of 5.4% per annum in both years.

     Property operating and maintenance expenses ($32.3 million) increased $3.9
million or 13.9% due to the impact of the 1997 Acquisition Properties and an
increase in property payroll, property general and administrative expenses and
insurance and other expenses at the Core Portfolio. Partially offsetting these
increases was a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense and utility expense
at the Core Portfolio. Property operating and maintenance expenses represented
26.2% of total revenues in 1997 and 27.0% in 1996.

     Real estate taxes ($8.4 million) increased $405,000 or 5.1% due to the
impact of the 1997 Acquisition Properties, partially offset by a decrease in the
Core Portfolio due to lower than expected assessed values at certain of the
properties based on actual bills received. Real estate taxes represented 6.8% of
total revenues in 1997 and 7.6% in 1996.

     Property management expenses ($5.1 million) increased $741,000 or 17.1%.
The increase was primarily due to an increase in management company payroll and
incremental costs associated with self management of the 1997 Acquisition
Properties. Property management expenses represented 4.1% of total revenues in
both 1997 and 1996.

     G&A ($4.6 million) increased $497,000 or 12.2%.  The increase was primarily
due to increased payroll resulting from salary increases.  G&A represented 3.7%
of total revenues in 1997 and 3.9% in 1996.

     EBITDA increased $12.7 million or 21%. Approximately $7.6 million of the
increase related to the 1997 Acquisition Properties. The remaining increase
reflected increased base rental income and decreased repairs and maintenance
expense, utility expense and real estate tax expense, partially offset by
increased payroll expense, property general and administrative expense and
insurance and other expenses at the Core Portfolio. In addition, corporate G&A
and property management expenses increased. EBITDA represented 59.2% of total
revenues in 1997 and 57.5% in 1996.

     Interest and related amortization ($21.8 million) increased $4.0 million or
22.3%. The increase was due to higher weighted average outstanding debt balances
during the period. The weighted average outstanding debt balances for the years
ended December 31, 1997 and 1996 were $301.3 million and $234.9 million,
respectively. The effective interest rate was 7.1% in 1997 and 7.2% in 1996.
Interest and related amortization represented 17.6% of total revenues in 1997
and 16.9% in 1996.

     On December 12, 1997, the Company refinanced the $100.0 million mortgage
note (the "Original Mortgage Debt") with a $265.0 million mortgage note (see
discussion above). In October 1996, the Company entered into an interest rate
swap agreement (the "1997 Swap") fixing LIBOR on the Original Mortgage Debt at
5.57% effective January 10, 1997 through March 3, 1998. The Company sold the
1997 Swap in December 1997 for approximately $26,000 in connection with the
refinancing.

     Depreciation on corporate assets ($590,000) increased $102,000 or 20.9% due
to fixed asset additions in 1996 associated with the Company's conversion to a
new accounting software system. Depreciation on corporate assets represented
0.5% of total revenues in both 1997 and 1996.

     Depreciation on real estate assets and other costs ($17.4 million)
increased $2.1 million or 13.9% as a result of the 1997 Acquisition Properties.
In addition, the Company recognized a one-time gain of $18,000 representing
gains on the prepayment of notes receivable and the sale of certain assets
related to the Chateau Communities, Inc. merger attempt, partially offset by the
write-off of certain deferred compensation.  Depreciation on real estate assets
and other costs represented 14.1% of total revenues in 1997 and  14.5% in 1996.

     In the fourth quarter of 1997, the Company recognized an extraordinary item
for early extinguishment of the Original Mortgage Debt of $556,000.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Net cash provided by operating activities increased $17.4 million from
$54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $72.0 million for the same
period in 1998. This increase reflected a $13.3 million increase in FFO, which
reflected increases in rental income as discussed in "Results of Operations"
above, and an increase in accounts payable and real estate tax accruals and
rents received in advance related to the property acquisitions, partially offset
by increased prepaid expenses.

     Net cash provided by operating activities increased $4.9 million from $49.7
million for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $54.6 million for the same
period in 1997. This increase reflected an $8.6 million increase in FFO, which
reflected increases in rental income and decreases of certain expenses as
discussed in "Results of Operations" above, and an increase in collection of
rents received in advance and security deposits related to the property
acquisitions, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and rents
receivable and decreased accounts payable accruals.

     FFO was defined by NAREIT in March 1995 as net income (computed in
accordance with GAAP), before allocation to minority interests, excluding gains
(or losses) from sales of property, plus real estate depreciation and after
adjustments for significant non-recurring items, if any. In the first quarter of
1996, the Company adopted this new definition of FFO which was effective for
periods ending after December 31, 1995. The Company computes FFO in accordance
with the NAREIT definition which may differ from the methodology for calculating
FFO utilized by other equity REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to
such other REITs. Funds available for distribution ("FAD") is defined as FFO
less non-revenue producing capital expenditures. The Company believes that FFO
and FAD are useful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity
REIT because, along with cash flows from operating activities, financing
activities and investing activities, they provide investors an understanding of
the ability of the Company to incur and service debt and to make capital
expenditures. FFO and FAD in and of themselves do not represent cash generated
from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and therefore should not be
considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the Company's
performance or to net cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP
as a measure of liquidity and are not necessarily indicative of cash available
to fund cash needs.

     The following table presents a calculation of FFO and FAD for the years
ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 (amounts in thousands):

     Net cash used in investing activities increased $23.3 million from $239.4
million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $262.8 million for the year
ended December 31, 1998, primarily due to the funding of notes receivable,
improvements made to acquisition properties, and collection of escrow proceeds
related to the acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities, partially offset by the
sale of project related assets in 1997.

     Net cash used in investing activities increased $178.4 million from $61
million for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $239.4 million for the year
ended December 31, 1997, primarily due to increased payments for acquisitions in
1997 and the Company's investment in partnerships, partially offset by the
collection of principal payments on notes receivable, net proceeds from the sale
of project related assets and decreased purchases of short-term investments, all
of which had maturitites of three months or less.

     On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase
agreement (as amended by a supplemental agreement on December 17, 1997) to
acquire 38 manufactured home communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from
partnerships having Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general partner
for a purchase price in excess of $300 million. From December 17, 1997 through
December 31, 1998, the Company closed on the acquisition of thirty-one of the
Ellenburg Communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $278
million and gained control of an additional five Ellenburg Communities with
acquisition advances of approximately $57 million to the partnerships which own
such Ellenburg Communities. The Company funded the acquisition advances with
borrowings under the Company's line of credit and term bank facilities. In
addition, the Company assumed debt of approximately $32 million and issued OP
Units of approximately $4.9 million in connection with this transaction.

     During 1998, the Company received approximately $14.3 million, including
approximately $365,000 of interest income, which was being held subject to the
completion of due diligence procedures on the Ellenburg Communities. The persons
appointed to windup the affairs of ECC have released the funds and have
presented a status report to the court. The $14.3 million has been recorded as a
liability until certain related issues are finalized at which point the final
liability will be relieved and the purchase price of the Ellenburg Communities
adjusted accordingly.

     On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3 million loan (the "Meadows
Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan is collateralized by The
Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida,
bears interest at a nominal rate of 9%, subject to adjustment based on cash flow
of the property, and matures on April 30, 1999.

     On January 8, 1998, the Company acquired Quail Meadows, located in 
Riverbank, California, for a purchase price of approximately $4.7 million. The 
acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit. 
Quail Meadows consists of approximately 146 developed sites.

     On April 30, 1998, the Company acquired Sherwood Forest RV Resort, located
adjacent to one of the Ellenburg Communities in Kissimmee, Florida, for a
purchase price of approximately $7.0 million. The acquisition was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sherwood Forest RV Resort consists
of approximately 512 developed sites and a 33 acre expansion parcel.

     On May 14, 1998, the Company acquired Casa Del Sol Resort III, located 
adjacent to one of the Company's communities in Peoria, Arizona, for a purchase 
price of approximately $9.8 million.  The acquisition was funded with a 
borrowing under the Company's line of credit.  Casa Del Sol Resort III consists 
of 238 developed sites.

     On June 4, 1998, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with
Wolverine Investors L.L.C. to acquire the College Heights Communities. The
aggregate purchase price for the College Heights Communities was approximately
$89 million. The Company contributed approximately $19 million to the joint
venture, Wolverine Investors L.L.C. contributed approximately $2.0 million to
the joint venture and the remainder of the acquisition was funded with a
borrowing from a financial institution of approximately $68 million. The
Company's $19 million contribution to the joint venture was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Due to the Company's ability to
control the joint venture through its ownership percentage, the joint venture
has been consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.

     On August 13, 1998, the Company acquired Sunset Oaks, located in Plant 
City, Florida,  adjacent to one of the Company's existing properties, for a 
purchase price of approximately $3.6 million. The acquisition was funded with a 
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sunset Oaks consists of 168 
developed sites.

                                       23

     Capital expenditures for improvements were approximately $14.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998 compared to $6.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997. Of the $14.2 million, approximately $8 million represented
improvements to existing sites including $3.5 million related to newly acquired
properties. The Company anticipates spending approximately $6.7 million on
improvements to existing sites during 1999. The Company believes these
improvements are necessary in order to increase and/or maintain occupancy levels
and maintain competitive market rents for new and renewing residents. The
remaining $6.2 million represented costs to develop expansion sites at certain
of the Company's Properties and other corporate headquarter costs.

     Net cash provided by financing activities increased $18.1 million from
$185.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997 to $203.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 primarily due to the issuance of common stock in
the second quarter of 1998, partially offset by decreased net proceeds from the
line of credit, term loan and mortgage notes payable.

     Net cash provided by financing activities increased $174.6 million from
$10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1996 to $185.4 million for the
year ended December 31, 1997 primarily due to the addition of the New Mortgage
Debt whereby the Company borrowed an additional $165 million, increased
borrowings on the line of credit, and an increase in proceeds from the exercise
of stock options and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase
plan, partially offset by the purchase of 330,300 shares of the Company's common
stock under the common stock repurchase plan, increased distributions to common
stockholders and the payment of debt issuance costs related to the Debt
Refinancing.

     On April 23, 1998, the Company completed an offering of 1,048,059 shares of
common stock (the "Unit Trust Offering") and sold the shares to Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (the "Underwriter"). The offering price per
share was $25.4375, the closing price for shares of the Company's common stock
on April 23, 1998, resulting in gross offering proceeds of approximately $26.7
million. Net of the Underwriter's discount and offering expenses, the Company
received approximately $25 million. The Underwriter deposited the shares of
common stock with the trustee of the Equity Investor Fund Cohen & Steers Realty
Majors Portfolio, a unit investment trust (the "Trust"), in exchange for units
in the Trust.

     For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company declared and paid
quarterly distributions totaling $1.45 per share. For the year ended December
31, 1997, the Company declared and paid quarterly distributions totaling $1.32
per share. Return of capital on a GAAP basis was $0.33, $0.15 and $0.24 for the
years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

     Substantially all of the leases at the Properties allow for monthly or 
annual rent increases which provide the Company with the opportunity to achieve 
increases, where justified by the market, in rental income as each lease 
matures.  Such types of leases generally minimize the risk of inflation to the 
Company.

     The Company expects to meet its short-term liquidity requirements,
including its distributions, generally through its working capital, net cash
provided by operating activities and availability under the existing line of
credit. The Company expects to meet certain long-term liquidity requirements
such as scheduled debt maturities, property acquisitions and capital
improvements by long-term collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings
including borrowings under its existing line of credit and the issuance of debt
securities or additional equity securities in the Company, in addition to
working capital.

     In June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No.
133 ("SFAS No. 133"), "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging
Activities", which is required to be adopted in years beginning after June 15,
1999. SFAS No. 133 permits early adoption as of the beginning of any fiscal
quarter after its issuance. The Company has not yet determined the date at which
it will adopt SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 133 will require the Company to recognize
all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives that are not
hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a
hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of
derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged
assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other
comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The
Company has not yet determined what the effect of SFAS No. 133 will be on the
earnings and financial position of the Company.

YEAR 2000

     The year 2000 issue ("Year 2000") is the result of computer programs and
embedded processors ("Systems") failing to properly account for the end of 1999
and the rollover to the year 2000. The Year 2000 issue comes from three
date-related problems and practices. First some Systems define the year-portion
of date fields with two digits instead of four. As a result, programs and
equipment that have time-sensitive functions may interpret a date using "00" as
being 1900 rather than 2000. Second, the year 2000 is a leap year. There is a
possibility that some Systems may fail to account for the leap day properly.
Third, in practice, an artificial date of "9/9/99" is sometimes used as a
fictitious date when testing Systems. It is possible that some Systems will
reject the actual date of "September 9, 1999" as fictitious. Problems arising
from one or more of these problems and practices could result in failure of one
or more Systems causing a disruption of operations, including, among other
things, a temporary inability to process transactions, collect rents, or engage
in similar normal business activities.

     Utilizing purchasing records, inventory listings, and direct communication
with employees, the Company is in the process of identifying all of its
information technology ("IT") and non-IT systems and assessing them for Year
2000 readiness. Critical systems include, but are not limited to: accounts
receivable, sales and inventory, human resources and payroll, accounts payable
and general ledger, Lotus Notes, Microsoft Office, tax preparation and filing
software, computers, data networking equipment, telephone systems, fax machines
and photocopiers, security and life safety systems (elevators, alarm systems),
process control systems (pool pumps and chlorine systems, sprinkler systems),
cable television systems, lift stations, and drinking water and waste water
treatment plants. The Company has completed the inventory and research phases of
its preparations for the Year 2000. Review of the research material continues in
the first quarter of 1999, as does on-site inspections of the utilities
(drinking water and waste water treatment plants, lift stations, and cable
television systems). The Company has retained consultants to handle assessment
of its drinking water, waste water treatment, lift station and cable television
facilities for which it is responsible. The Company has initiated formal
communications with all of its significant suppliers to determine the extent to
which the Company's interface systems are vulnerable to those third parties'
failure to remediate their own Year 2000 issues. The Company anticipates that
scheduled system upgrades to its accounts receivable system, accounts payable
and general ledger system, and payroll system will remediate current Year 2000
concerns. Remediation steps and development of contingency plans will be
completed in the second quarter of 1999. The Company has set a deadline for Year
2000 readiness of June 30, 1999. There can be no guarantee that the systems of
other companies on which the Company's Systems rely will be timely converted and
will not have an adverse effect on the Company's Systems.

     Through December 31, 1998, the Company's costs associated with remediation
efforts have been immaterial. In 1998, the Company retained a full-time contract
employee to perform Year 2000 research and documentation at an annual fee of
approximately $45,000 and has budgeted to retain the employee through 1999. The
cost to retain a consultant to assess the waste water treatment and cable
television facilities has been budgeted at less than $50,000. The Company
expects that replacement of approximately 75 computers will be required with a
capital budget of approximately $200,000. The Company's total Year 2000 project
costs and estimates to complete do not include the estimated costs and time
associated with the impact of third-party Year 2000 issues. The total cost of
the Year 2000 project is estimated to be immaterial assuming third parties
remediate their own Year 2000 issues. This assumption is based on management's
best estimates, which were derived utilizing numerous assumptions of future
events, and there can be no guarantee that these estimates will be achieved and
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated.

     The Company has commenced its contingency planning for critical operational
areas that might be affected by the Year 2000 issue if compliance is delayed.
Aside from catastrophic failure of banks, governmental agencies, etc., the
Company believes that it could continue operations. For example, rent can be
collected and recorded by manual methods using hardcopy reports from previous
months; payroll can be processed by issuing manual checks relying on existing
payroll registers; bills can be paid as long as banks can process checks; and
basic financial statements can be prepared manually.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

    The Company's earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a
portion of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is at variable rates based on
LIBOR. The Company's $175 million line of credit ($145 million outstanding at
December 31, 1998) bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.125% and the Company's $100
million Term Loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 1.0%. The Company has the 1998
Swap which fixes LIBOR at 6.4% on $100 million of the Company's floating rate
debt for the period 1998 through 2003. If LIBOR increased/decreased by 1.0%
during 1998, interest expense would have increased/decreased by approximately
$1.0 million based on the average balance outstanding under the Company's line
of credit for the year ended December 31, 1998. Information relating to
quantitive and qualitive disclosure about market risk as it relates to the 1998
Swap is set forth in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations, and in Note 9 "Long Term Borrowings" in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Such information is incorporated
herein.

                         Report of Independent Auditors





To the Board of Directors of
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc.


     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 1998 and 1997, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
1998. We have also audited the related financial statement schedules listed in
the accompanying index. These financial statements and schedules are the
responsibility of the management of Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedules based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Manufactured
Home Communities, Inc. as of December 31, 1998 and 1997 and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1998 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedules,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

                       MANUFACTURED HOME COMMUNITIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

     Manufactured Home Communities, Inc. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, the "Company"), formed in March 1993, is a Maryland corporation
which has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"). The
Company owns or has a controlling interest in 154 manufactured home communities
(the "Properties") located in 26 states, consisting of 53,391 sites. The Company
generally will not be subject to Federal income tax to the extent it distributes
its REIT taxable income to its stockholders.

     The operations of the Company are conducted through certain entities which
are owned or controlled by the Company. MHC Operating Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership") is the entity through which the Company conducts
substantially all of its operations. The Company contributed the proceeds from
its initial public offering to the Operating Partnership for a general
partnership interest. The limited partners of the Operating Partnership (the
"Minority Interests") receive an allocation of net income which is based on
their respective ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership which is
shown on the Consolidated Financial Statements as Minority Interests. As of
December 31, 1998, the Minority Interests represented 5,976,701 units of limited
partnership interest ("OP Units") which are convertible into an equivalent
number of shares of the Company's stock. The issuance of additional shares of
common stock or OP Units changes the respective ownership of the Operating
Partnership for both the Minority Interests and the Company.

     Sub-partnerships of the Operating Partnership were created to (i)
facilitate mortgage financing (the "Financing Partnerships"); (ii) facilitate
the Company's ability to provide financing to manufactured home communities
("Lending Partnership"); (iii) own the management operations of the Company
("Management Partnerships"); and (iv) own the assets and operations of certain
utility companies which service the Company's properties ("MHC Systems").

     The accompanying financial statements represent the consolidated financial
information of the Company and its subsidiaries. Due to the Company's ability as
general partner to control either through ownership or by contract the Operating
Partnership, the Financing Partnerships, the Lending Partnerships, the
Management Partnerships and MHC Systems, each such subsidiary has been
consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.

     In 1998, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"
("SFAS No. 131") which was effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 1997. SFAS No. 131 supersed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise". SFAS No. 131
establishes standards for the way that public business enterprises report
information about operating segments in annual financial statements and requires
that those enterprises report selected information about operating segments in
interim financial reports. SFAS No. 131 also establishes standards for related
disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers.
The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not affect results of operations or financial
position of the Company. The Company has one reportable segment which is the
operation of manufactured home communities. The Company has concentrations of
Properties within the following states: Florida (45 Properties), California (25
Properties), Arizona (19 Properties), Michigan (11 Properties) and Colorado (10
Properties). These concentrations of Properties accounted for 34%, 17%, 11%, 4%,
and 8%, respectively, of the Company's total revenues for the year ended
December 31, 1998. The Company also has Properties located in the following
areas of the United States: Northeast, Northwest, Midwest, and Nevada/Utah/New
Mexico. The Company's largest Property, Bay Indies, located in Venice, Florida,
accounted for 3% of the Company's total revenues for the year ended December 31,
1998. The distribution of the Properties throughout the United States reflects
the Company's belief that geographic diversification helps insulate the
portfolio from regional economic influences. The Company intends to target new
acquisitions in or near markets where the Properties are located and will also
consider acquisitions of properties outside such markets.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     (a)Use of Estimates

     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
     assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
     disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
     financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
     during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
     estimates.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (b)Rental Property

     Rental property is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. The
     Company evaluates rental properties for impairment when conditions exist
     which may indicate that it is probable that the sum of expected future cash
     flows (undiscounted) from a rental property is less than its carrying
     value. Upon determination that a permanent impairment has occurred, rental
     properties are reduced to fair value. For the year ended December 31, 1998
     and 1997, permanent impairment conditions did not exist at any of the
     Company's properties.

     Depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis over the estimated
     useful lives of the assets. The Company uses a 30-year estimated life for
     buildings acquired and structural and land improvements, a ten-to-fifteen
     year estimated life for building upgrades and a three-to-seven year
     estimated life for furniture, fixtures and equipment. Expenditures for
     ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as incurred and
     significant renovations and improvements which improve the asset and extend
     the useful life of the asset are capitalized over their estimated useful
     life. Initial direct leasing costs are expensed as incurred. Total
     depreciation expense was $29.1 million, $18.0 million, and $15.3 million
     for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

     (c)Cash and Cash Equivalents

     The Company considers all demand and money market accounts and certificates
     of deposit with a maturity when purchased of three months or less, to be
     cash equivalents.

     (d)Notes Receivable

     Notes receivable generally are stated at their outstanding unpaid principal
     balances net of any deferred fees or costs on originated loans, or
     unamortized discounts. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal
     balance. Discounts are amortized to income using the interest method.

     (e)Fair Value of Financial Instruments

     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About
     Fair Value of Financial Instruments" requires disclosures about the fair
     value of financial instruments whether or not such instruments are
     recognized in the balance sheet. The Company's financial instruments
     include short-term investments, notes receivable, accounts receivable,
     accounts payable, other accrued expenses, mortgage notes payable and
     interest rate hedge arrangements. The fair value of all financial
     instruments, including notes receivable, were not materially different from
     their carrying values at December 31, 1998 and 1997, except the fair market
     value of certain derivatives related to mortgage debt (see Note 10).

     (f)Deferred Financing Costs

     Deferred financing costs include fees and costs incurred to obtain
     long-term financing. The costs are being amortized over the terms of the
     respective loans on a level yield basis. Unamortized deferred financing
     fees are written-off when debt is retired before the maturity date.
     Accumulated amortization for such costs was $1,199,221 and $717,112 at
     December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.

     (g) Revenue Recognition

     Rental income attributable to leases is recorded when earned from tenants.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

     (h)Minority Interests

     Net income is allocated to Minority Interests based on their respective
     ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. An ownership percentage
     is represented by dividing the number of OP Units held by the Minority
     Interests (5,976,701 and 5,733,815 at December 31, 1998 and 1997,
     respectively) by OP Units and common stock outstanding. Issuance of
     additional shares of common stock or OP Units changes the percentage
     ownership of both the Minority Interests and the Company. Due in part to
     the exchange rights, such transactions and the proceeds therefrom are
     treated as capital transactions and result in an allocation between
     stockholders' equity and Minority Interests to account for the change in
     the respective percentage ownership of the underlying equity of the
     Operating Partnership.

     (i)Income Taxes

     Due to the structure of the Company as a REIT, the results of operations
     contain no provision for Federal income taxes. However, the Company may be
     subject to certain state and local income, excise or franchise taxes. The
     Company paid state and local taxes of approximately $78,000 and $40,000
     during the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. As of December 31, 1998,
     net investment in rental property and notes receivable had a federal tax
     basis of approximately $747 million and $70 million, respectively.

     (j)Reclassifications

     Certain 1997 and 1996 amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 1998
     financial presentation. Such reclassifications have no effect on the
     operations or equity as originally presented.

NOTE 3 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

   Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during each year. In 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board issued Statement No. 128, "Earnings Per Share" ("SFAS No. 128"). SFAS No.
128 replaces the calculation of primary and fully diluted earnings per share
with basic and diluted earnings per share. Unlike primary earnings per share,
basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants and
convertible securities. Diluted earnings per share is very similar to the
previously reported fully diluted earnings per share. All earnings per share
amounts for all periods have been presented, and where appropriate, restated to
conform to the SFAS No. 128 requirements. The conversion of OP Units has been
excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation. The conversion of an OP
Unit to common stock will have no material effect on earnings per common share 
since the allocation of earnings to an OP Unit is equivalent to earnings 
allocated to a share of common stock.

     The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share (amounts in thousands):

     As of December 31, 1998, the Company's percentage ownership of the
Operating Partnership was 81%. The remaining 19% is owned by the Minority
Interests.

     The Company paid a $.3625 per share distribution on April 10, 1998, July
10, 1998, October 9, 1998 and December 30, 1998, for the quarters ended March
31, 1998, June 30, 1998, September 30, 1998 and December 31, 1998, respectively,
to stockholders of record on March 27, 1998, June 26, 1998, September 25, 1998
and December 16, 1998, respectively.

     In March 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a common stock
repurchase plan whereby the Company is authorized to repurchase and retire up to
1,000,000 shares of its common stock. Shares of common stock repurchased and
retired under the plan for the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 were
21,800 and 330,300 respectively.

     The Company adopted, effective July 1, 1997, the 1997 Non Qualified
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("ESPP"). Pursuant to the ESPP, certain employees
and directors of the Company may each annually acquire up to $100,000 of common
stock of the Company. The aggregate number of shares of common stock available
under the ESPP shall not exceed 1,000,000, subject to adjustment by the Board of
Directors. The common stock may be purchased quarterly at a price equal to 85%
of the lesser of: (a) the closing price for a share on the last day of such
quarter; and (b) the greater of: (i) the closing price for a share on the first
day of such quarter, and (ii) the average closing price for a share for all the
business days in the quarter. Shares of common stock issued through the ESPP for
the years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997 were 44,804 and 27,608 respectively.

     On August 29, 1997, the Company, as general partner of the Operating
Partnership, approved the addition of new limited partners (the "MPW Limited
Partners") to the Operating Partnership in connection with the acquisition of
properties from limited partners and joint ventures affiliated with Mobileparks
West, a California limited partnership. The MPW Limited Partners received
3,018,926 OP Units which are exchangeable on a one-for-one basis for shares of
the Company's common stock.

     During 1998, the Company, as general partner of the Operating Partnership,
approved the admission of new limited partners (the "1998 Acquisition Partners")
to the Operating Partnership in connection with certain acquisitions of rental
property and investments in joint ventures (see Notes 5 and 6). The 1998
Acquisition Partners received 342,438 OP Units which are exchangeable on a
one-for-one basis for shares of the Company's common stock.

NOTE 5 - RENTAL PROPERTY

     Land improvements consist primarily of improvements made to land such as
landscaping and infrastructure. Depreciable property consists of permanent
buildings in the communities such as clubhouses, laundry facilities, maintenance
storage facilities, and furniture, fixtures and equipment.

     During the year ended December 31, 1996, the Company acquired three
communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $38 million and
funded a recourse first mortgage real estate loan for approximately $6 million
to the partnership which owned one community. For financial accounting purposes,
the Company accounts for the loan as an investment in real estate. These four
communities consist of 1,618 sites and 183 expansion sites. The acquisitions and
loan funding were funded with approximately $41.6 million in borrowings under
the Company's line of credit and $2.4 million in existing available cash.

     During the year ended December 31, 1997, the Company acquired twenty-two
communities for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $156.4 million.
These acquisitions were funded with approximately $60.6 million in borrowings
under the Company's line of credit, issuance of approximately $64 million of OP
Units, assumption of approximately $13 million in debt, approximately $7.4
million of existing available cash, issuance of installment notes totaling
approximately $6 million and entry into a lease, accounted for as a capital
lease, valued at approximately $2.4 million. In connection with the acquisition
of one of the communities the Company issued an additional $1.1 million of OP
units in 1998.

     On September 4, 1997, the Company entered into a portfolio purchase
agreement (as amended by a supplemental agreement on December 17, 1997) to
acquire 38 manufactured home communities (the "Ellenburg Communities") from
partnerships having Ellenburg Capital Corporation ("ECC") as the general partner
for a purchase price in excess of $300 million. During 1997 and 1998, the
Company closed on the acquisition of thirty-one of the Ellenburg Communities for
an aggregate purchase price of approximately $278 million and gained control of
an additional five Ellenburg Communities with acquisition advances of
approximately $57 million to the partnerships which own such Ellenburg
Communities. The Company funded the acquisition advances with borrowings under
the Company's line of credit and term bank facilities. In addition, the Company
assumed debt of approximately $32 million and issued OP Units of approximately
$4.9 million in connection with this transaction.

     In connection with the supplemental agreement entered into in December
1997, on February 12, 1998, the Company exercised its right of first refusal to
purchase five of the Ellenburg Communities. A third party, backed by one of the
Company's competitors upon denial of a stay of the sale, has appealed certain
orders of the Superior Court for the State of California, County of Los Angeles
related to the Company's acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities, including the
order approving the supplemental agreement. The Company does not expect the
appeals to be successful, or if successful, to have a material impact on the
Company's acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities.

     During 1998, the Company received approximately $14.3 million, including
approximately $365,000 of interest income, which was being held subject to the
completion of due diligence procedures on the Ellenburg Communities. The persons
appointed to windup the affairs of ECC have released the funds and have
presented a status report to the court. The $14.3 million has been recorded as a
liability until certain related issues are finalized at which point the final
liability will be relieved and the purchase price of the Ellenburg Communities
adjusted accordingly.

     On January 8, 1998, the Company acquired Quail Meadows, located in
Riverbank, California, for a purchase price of approximately $4.7 million. The
acquisition was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of credit.
Quail Meadows consists of approximately 146 developed sites.

     On April 30, 1998, the Company acquired Sherwood Forest RV Resort, located
adjacent to one of the Ellenburg Communities in Kissimmee, Florida, for a
purchase price of approximately $7.0 million. The acquisition was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sherwood Forest RV Resort consists
of approximately 512 developed sites and a 33 acre expansion parcel.

NOTE 5 - RENTAL PROPERTY (CONTINUED)

     On May 14, 1998, the Company acquired Casa Del Sol Resort III, located
adjacent to one of the Company's communities in Peoria, Arizona, for a purchase
price of approximately $9.8 million. The acquisition was funded with a borrowing
under the Company's line of credit. Casa Del Sol Resort III consists of 238
developed sites.

     On June 4, 1998, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with
Wolverine Investors L.L.C. to acquire eighteen manufactured home communities
(the "College Heights Communities"). The aggregate purchase price for the
College Heights Communities was approximately $89 million. The Company
contributed approximately $19 million to the joint venture, Wolverine Investors
L.L.C. contributed approximately $2.0 million to the joint venture and the
remainder of the acquisition was funded with a borrowing from a financial
institution of approximately $68 million. The Company's $19 million contribution
to the joint venture was funded with a borrowing under the Company's line of
credit. Due to the Company's ability to control the joint venture through its
approximate 95% interest, the joint venture properties and related operations
have been consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

     On August 13, 1998, the Company acquired Sunset Oaks, located in Plant
City, Florida, adjacent to one of the Company's existing properties, for a
purchase price of approximately $3.6 million. The acquisition was funded with a
borrowing under the Company's line of credit. Sunset Oaks consists of 168
developed sites.

     The acquisitions have been accounted for utilizing the purchase method of
accounting and, accordingly, the results of operations of acquired assets are
included in the statement of operations from the dates of acquisitions. The
Company acquired all of the communities from unaffiliated third parties.

     The Company is actively seeking to acquire additional communities and
currently is engaged in negotiations relating to the possible acquisition of a
number of communities. At any time these negotiations are at varying stages
which may include contracts outstanding to acquire certain manufactured home
communities which are subject to satisfactory completion of the Company's due
diligence review.

     The following unaudited summarized pro forma financial information presents

NOTE 6 - INVESTMENT IN JOINT VENTURE

     On March 18, 1998, the Company joined Plantation Company, LLC and Trails
Associates, LLC, two 49% joint venture investments with Meadows Management
Company to own two manufactured home communities known as "Plantation on the
Lake" and "Trails West", for approximately $6.5 million. Plantation on the Lake
is located in Riverside, California and consists of 385 developed sites and 122
expansion sites. Trails West is located in Tucson, Arizona and consists of 488
developed sites and 294 expansion sites. The Company's investments were funded
with a $3.9 million borrowing under the Company's line of credit and with the
issuance of approximately $2.6 million in OP Units. Due to the Company's
inability to control over the joint ventures, the Company accounts for its
investment in the joint ventures on the equity method.

and $1.1 million in notes receivable, respectively. The Company has $1.1 million
in purchase money notes with monthly principal and interest payments at 7.0%,
maturing on July 31, 2001. On January 6, 1998, the Company funded a $12.3
million loan (the "Meadows Loan") to Meadows Preservation, Inc. The Meadows Loan
is collateralized by The Meadows manufactured home community located in Palm

NOTE 10 - LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

     As of December 31, 1998 and 1997, the Company had outstanding mortgage
indebtedness of approximately $500.6 million and $403.7 million, respectively,
encumbering 72 and 43 of the Company's properties, respectively. As of December
31, 1998 and 1997, the carrying value of such properties was approximately $634
million and $493 million, respectively.

     The outstanding mortgage indebtedness consists in part of a $265.0 million
mortgage note (the "Mortgage Debt") collateralized by 29 properties beneficially
owned by MHC Financing Limited Partnership. The Mortgage Debt has a maturity
date of January 2, 2028 and pays interest at 7.015%. There is no principal
amortization until February 1, 2008, after which principal and interest are paid
from available cash flow and the interest rate is reset at a rate equal to the
then 10-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.0%. In connection with the
acquisition of the College Heights Communities, the joint venture formed by the
Company and Wolverine Investors L.L.C. borrowed approximately $68 million (the
"College Heights Debt") at an interest rate of 7.19%, maturing July 1, 2008. The
Company also has outstanding debt on 23 properties in the aggregate amount of
approximately $169 million, which was recorded at fair market value with the
related discount or premium being amortized over the life of the loan using the
effective interest rate. In addition, the Company recorded a $2.4 million loan
in connection with a direct financing lease entered into in May 1997. Scheduled
maturities for the outstanding indebtedness, excluding the Mortgage Debt and
College Heights Debt, are at various dates through November 30, 2020, and fixed
interest rates range from 7.25% to 9.05%.

     The Company has an unsecured line of credit with a bank (the "Credit
Agreement") bearing interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus
1.125%. On April 28, 1998, the Company amended the Credit Agreement, increasing
the line of credit from $100 million to $150 million. On December 18, 1998, the
Company amended the Credit Agreement, increasing the line of credit from $150
million to $175 million. The Credit Agreement matures on August 17, 2000, at
which time the Company may extend the maturity date to August 17, 2002 and the
Credit Agreement would be converted to a term loan. The Company pays a fee on
the average unused amount of such credit equal to 0.15% of such amount. As of
December 31, 1998, $145 million was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The
Company paid fees related to the amendments which were immaterial.

     The Company has a term loan (the "Term Loan") with a group of banks with
interest only payable monthly at a rate of LIBOR plus 1.0%. On April 28, 1998,
the Company amended the Term Loan to increase the borrowing from $60 million to
$100 million. The Term Loan matures on April 3, 2000 and may be extended to
April 3, 2002. The Company used the $40 million in proceeds to repay a portion
of the $50 million previously borrowed on April 7, 1998 under the Term Loan. The
Company paid fees related to this amendment which were immaterial.

     The Company has approximately $5.3 million of installment notes payable,
secured by a letter of credit with interest rates of 7.5%, maturing September 1,
2002. Approximately $4 million of the notes pay principal annually and interest
quarterly and the remaining $1.3 million of the notes pay interest quarterly.

     In July 1995, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement (the
"1998 Swap") fixing LIBOR on $100 million of the Company's floating rate debt at
6.4% for the period 1998 through 2003. The cost of the 1998 Swap consisted only
of legal costs which were deemed immaterial. The value of the 1998 Swap is
impacted by changes in the market rate of interest. Had the 1998 Swap been
entered into on December 31, 1998, the applicable LIBOR swap rate would have
been 4.56%. Each 0.01% increase or decrease in the applicable swap rate for the
1998 Swap increases or decreases the value of the 1998 Swap versus its current
value by approximately $39,000. The Company accounts for the 1998 Swap as a
hedge. Payments and receipts under the 1998 Swap are accounted for as an
adjustment to interest expense.

the consent of the parties or, in some instances as provided by statute.
Non-cancelable long-term leases, with remaining terms up to eleven years, are in

these properties are primarily a function of increases in the Consumer Price
Index taking into consideration certain floors and ceilings. Additionally,
periodic market rate adjustments are made as deemed necessary. Future minimum

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN

     A Stock Option Plan (the "Plan") was adopted by the Company in December
1992. Pursuant to the Plan, certain officers, directors, employees and
consultants of the Company may be offered the opportunity to acquire shares of
common stock through the grant of stock options ("Options"), including
non-qualified stock options and, for key employees, incentive stock options
within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. The Compensation Committee will
determine the vesting schedule, if any, of each Option and the term, which term
shall not exceed ten years from the date of grant. As to the Options that have
been granted through December 31, 1998, generally, one-third are exercisable one
year after the initial grant, one-third are exercisable two years following the
date such Options were granted and the remaining one-third are exercisable three
years following the date such Options were granted. The Plan allows for 10,000
Options to be granted annually to each director. The common stock with respect
to which the Options may be granted during any calendar year to any grantee
shall not exceed 250,000 shares. In addition, the Plan provides for the granting
of stock appreciation rights ("SARs") and restricted stock awards ("Stock
Awards"). A maximum of 4,000,000 shares of common stock were available for grant
under the Plan as of December 31, 1998.

     In 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company issued 18,238, 14,777 and 13,144 shares
related to Stock Awards, respectively, which represented a portion of certain
employees bonuses. The shares related to the Stock Awards shall be restricted
for a period of two years from the date of grant. The fair market value of these
Stock Awards of approximately $445,000 $394,361 and $289,000 at the date of
grant was recorded as compensation expense by the Company in 1998, 1997 and
1996, respectively.

     In 1996, the Company awarded 198,000 Stock Awards to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Awards vest over five years, but
may be restricted for a period of up to fifteen years depending upon certain
performance benchmarks tied to increases in funds from operations being met. The
fair market value of these Stock Awards of approximately $4.4 million as of the
date of grant was treated in 1996 as deferred compensation. The Company
amortized approximately $616,000, $1.6 million and $871,000 related to these
Stock Awards in 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively.

     In 1997, the Company awarded 77,750 Stock Awards to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Awards vest over three years and
are dependent upon certain performance benchmarks tied to total returns to
shareholders being met. The fair market value of these Stock Awards of
approximately $2.1 million as of the date of grant was treated in 1997 as
deferred compensation. The Company amortized approximately $519,000 and $1.0
million related to these performance units in 1998 and 1997 respectively.

     In 1998, the Company awarded 233,500 Stock Awards to certain members of
senior management of the Company. These Stock Awards vest over five years and
are dependent upon certain performance benchmarks tied to total returns to
shareholders being met. The fair market value of these Stock Awards of
approximately $5.7 million as of the date of grant was treated in 1998 as
deferred compensation.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN (CONTINUED)

     The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.
25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and related
Interpretations in accounting for its Options and Stock Awards because, as
discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under FASB
Statement No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," ("SFAS No. 123")
requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in
valuing employee stock options. Under APB 25, because the exercise price of the
Company's Options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of
grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Additionally, the amount
recognized as expense for the Stock Awards during any given year of the
performance period is dependent on certain performance benchmarks being met.

     Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123, and has been determined as if the Company had
accounted for its Options and Restricted Stock Awards under the fair value
method of that Statement. The fair value for the Options was estimated at the
date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions for 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively: risk-free
interest rates of 5.7%, 6.3% and 6.6%; dividend yields of 5.8%, 5.5% and 6.4%;
volatility factors of the expected market price of the Company's common stock of
 .23, .24 and .27; and a weighted-average expected life of the Options of 5
years. The fair value of the Stock Awards granted in 1996, 1997 and 1998 has
been estimated as approximately 30% below the fair market value on the date of
grant because these Stock Awards may remain restricted even after they become
fully vested.

     The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company's Options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single
measure of the fair value of its Options.

     For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
Options is amortized to expense over the Options' vesting period and the
estimated fair value of the Restricted Stock Awards is amortized to expense over
the same period. The pro forma effect of SFAS No. 123 on the Company's net
income for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $225,000 ($0.01
per share), $0 ($0 per share), and $66,000 ($0 per share), respectively.

for the years ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996 follows:

NOTE 14 - STOCK OPTION PLAN (CONTINUED)

     As of December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, 1,075,091 shares, 1,755,532 shares
and 116,957 shares remained available for grant, respectively, and 1,269,982
shares 1,071,890 shares and 874,353 shares were exercisable, respectively.
Exercise prices for Options outstanding as of December 31, 1998 ranged from
$12.875 to $26.750, with the substantial majority of the exercise prices
exceeding $17.25. The remaining weighted-average contractual life of those
Options was 7.4 years.

NOTE 15 - PREFERRED STOCK

     The Company's Board of Directors is authorized under the Company's charter,
without further stockholder approval, to issue, from time to time, in one or
more series, 10,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock (the "Preferred
Stock"), with specific rights, preferences and other attributes as the Board may
determine, which may include preferences, powers and rights that are senior to
the rights of holders of the Company's common stock. However, under certain
circumstances, the issuance of preferred stock may require stockholder approval
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange. As of
December 31, 1998 and 1997, no Preferred Stock was issued by the Company.

NOTE 16 - SAVINGS PLAN

     The Company has a qualified retirement plan, with a salary deferral feature
designed to qualify under Section 401 of the Code (the "401(k) Plan"), to cover
its employees and those of its Subsidiaries, if any. The 401(k) Plan permits
eligible employees of the Company and those of any Subsidiary to defer a portion
of their compensation up to 16% of their eligible compensation on a pre-tax
basis subject to certain maximum amounts. In addition, the Company will match
dollar-for-dollar the participant's contribution up to 4% of the participant's
eligible compensation.

     In addition, amounts contributed by the Company will vest, on a prorated
basis, according to the participant's vesting schedule. After five years of
employment with the Company, the participants will be 100% vested for all
amounts contributed by the Company. Additionally, a discretionary profit sharing
component of the 401(k) Plan provides for a contribution to be made annually for
each participant in an amount, if any, as determined by the Company. All
employee contributions are 100% vested. The Company's contribution to the 401(k)
Plan was approximately $256,000, $262,000, and $201,000 and for the years ended
December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. The Company's anticipated plan
contribution for the profit sharing component of the 401(k) Plan was
approximately $204,000 for the year ended December 31, 1998.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

     The residents of DeAnza Santa Cruz, a Property located in Santa Cruz,
California (the "City") previously brought several actions opposing certain fees
and charges in connection with water service at the Property, specifically
opposing a monthly "readiness to serve" charge and tax thereon. One group of
residents, who have elected to be covered under the City's rent control
ordinance ("Ordinance"), had their case heard before the City's rent control
board. On June 29, 1995, the City's hearing officer found that the Company may
charge only its actual costs. In connection with the hearing officer's decision,
in 1997 the residents were awarded costs of approximately $100,000 and the
Company rebated amounts overcharged since its acquisition of the Property in
August, 1994 of approximately $36,400. The Company believed its actual costs
exceeded the amount of the monthly readiness to serve charge and appealed the
hearing officer's decision. Also, in March 1997 the Company filed an application
with the California Public Utilities Commission ("PUC") requesting the PUC to
set cost based rates for water at this Property. In March 1997, the court of
appeals issued a writ of mandate requested by the Company ruling that the
hearing officer had improperly calculated the amount of the rebate, but was
correct when he found that the readiness to serve charge and tax thereon were an
inappropriate rent increase. The court of appeals further agreed with the
Company that the hearing officer did not have the authority to establish rates
that could be charged in the future. In December 1998, the PUC granted the
Company its certificate of convenience and necessity and approved cost based
rates and charges for water that exceed what residents were paying. The PUC also
issued an Order Instituting Investigation confirming its exclusive jurisdiction
over the issue of water rates in a submetered system and commencing an
investigation into the confusion and turmoil over billings in submetered
properties.

NOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

     The Santa Cruz Homeowners Association ("HOA"), representing approximately
fifteen residents not covered by the Ordinance, separately filed suit in the
Superior Court of the State of California (Case Number 128001) opposing the same
fees and charges in connection with water service and seeking damages, including
punitive damages, arising out of the imposition of the readiness to serve
charge. After the court of appeals decision discussed above, the HOA brought all
of its members back into the underlying civil action for the purpose of
determining damages, including punitive damages, against the Company. A trial
was held before a jury in the Santa Cruz Superior Court commencing on January
11, 1999. On January 22, 1999, the jury returned a verdict awarding $6 million
of punitive damages against the Company. The Company is preparing to bond the
judgment pending appeal in accordance with California procedural rules which
require a bond equal to 150% of the amount of the judgment which will accrue
interest at the statutory rate of 10.0% per annum. The Company will appeal this
decision and due to the uncertainty of the ultimate outcome because of the
competing legal theories, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of loss,
if any, and therefore no adjustments have been made to the accompanying
financial statements. The HOA is also seeking to recover attorneys fees in 
connection with the trial, including a multiplier of such fees which may result
in an attorneys fee award in the range of $700,000 to $900,000. This is in 
addition to the $100,000 award referred to above. The Company will vigorously 
oppose such award of attorney fees. The Company expects to incur $300,000 to 
$500,000 in costs and expenses over the next 15 months in connection with this 
appeal.

     In a separate matter, on September 29, 1995, the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA") issued its Findings of Violations and
Order for Compliance with respect to the National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System ("NPDES") Permit governing the operation of the on-site waste
water treatment plant at one of the Company's properties. On October 6, 1995,
the USEPA issued its Findings of Violation and Order for Compliance with respect
to the NPDES Permit governing the operation of the on-site waste water treatment
plant at another of the Company's properties. The Company and USEPA have reached
a tentative agreement to resolve the matter in which the operation of the
remaining waste water treatment plant would be subject to a consent decree that
would provide for fines and penalties in the event of future violations and the
Company would contribute monies to a supplemental environmental project and pay
a fine. The tentative agreement has not yet been reduced to writing and
therefore remains subject to change. The Company does not believe the impact of
the settlement will be material and the Company believes it has established
adequate reserves for any amounts that may be paid.

     In another matter, in connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg
Communities and pursuant to orders of the California Superior Court,
approximately $30 million of the amounts paid by the Company have been deposited
with the court appointed winding up agents (the "Winding Up Agents"). The
deposited amounts relate to claims (the "Karno Claims") of Norton S. Karno (and
related entities) who at various times has been a creditor, advisor, lawyer and
shareholder of certain of the entities related to the Ellenburg Communities. The
Winding Up Agents have disputed the claims and have filed a complaint against
Mr. Karno (and related entities) requesting that the court determine that the
claims be reduced or eliminated.

     On October 30, 1998, the Company received notice of a lawsuit filed against
the Company and certain Executive Officers of the Company in the Los Angeles
Superior Court alleging, among other causes of action, that the Company breached
certain agreements in connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg
Communities and claiming damages in excess of $50 million plus punitive damages.
Based upon jurisdictional issues, in February 1999 the claims against the
Executive Officers of the Company were dismissed. The Company believes most of
the claim relates to the disputed Karno Claims discussed above. The Company
believes the claims are without merit, intends to vigorously defend the
defendants in this matter and does not believe the impact of this matter will be
material.

     In connection with the acquisition of the Ellenburg Communities, Mr. Karno
and others have appealed various court orders on which the Comany has relied.
The court of appeals has recently requested briefing on the issue of whether
certain appeals are moot. Mr. Karno has also sought before both the California
Superior Court and Court of Appeals to take control of ECC, but to date none of
his attempts have been successful.

     The Company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the
ordinary course of business. All proceedings herein described or referred to,
taken together, are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the
Company.
