ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
OVERVIEW
 
     Chesapeake Energy Corporation ("Chesapeake" or the "Company") is an
independent energy company which utilizes advanced drilling and completion
technologies to explore for and produce oil and natural gas. The Company has
traditionally been among the most active drillers of new wells in the United
States.
 
     From inception in 1989 through June 30, 1997, Chesapeake drilled and
participated in a total of 736 gross (294 net) wells, of which 691 gross (276
net) wells were completed. From its first full fiscal year of operation ended
June 30, 1990 to the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, the Company's estimated
proved reserves increased to 403 Bcfe from 11 Bcfe, annual production increased
to 79 Bcfe from 0.2 Bcfe, total revenue increased to $280 million from $0.6
million, and total assets increased to $949 million from $8 million. Despite
this overall favorable record of growth, in fiscal 1997 the Company incurred a
net loss of $183 million primarily as a result of a $236 million impairment of
its oil and gas properties. The impairment was the result of its capitalized
costs of oil and gas properties exceeding the estimated present value of future
net revenues from the Company's proved reserves at June 30, 1997.
 
     In response to the fiscal 1997 loss, Chesapeake has revised its fiscal 1998
business strategy. These revisions include slowing its exploration pace in the
Louisiana Austin Chalk Trend ("Louisiana Trend") and concentrating its Louisiana
Trend drilling activities in Masters Creek; utilizing more extensive use of 3-D
seismic prior to conducting drilling operations; reducing the acquisition of
additional unproven leasehold; and selectively acquiring proved reserves as a
complement to its primary strategy of developing reserves through the drillbit.
 
     Reference is made to the "Glossary" that appears at the end of this Item 1
for definitions of certain terms used in this Form 10-K.
 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
     Since its inception, Chesapeake's primary business strategy has been growth
through the drillbit. Using this strategy, the Company has expanded its reserves
and production through the acquisition and subsequent development of large
blocks of acreage.
 
     From inception through fiscal 1994, the Company concentrated its
undeveloped leasehold acquisitions and associated drilling in the Giddings Field
of southern Texas and the Golden Trend Field of southern Oklahoma. Beginning in
fiscal 1995, Chesapeake initiated development of new project areas that were
either extensions of the Company's historical focus in the Giddings and Golden
Trend Fields or new areas in which the Company believed had similar
characteristics. These additional project areas included the Knox Field in
southern Oklahoma, the Sholem Alechem Field in southern Oklahoma, the Louisiana
Trend, the Arkoma Basin in southeastern Oklahoma, the Lovington area in eastern
New Mexico, and the Williston Basin in eastern Montana and western North Dakota.
In fiscal 1997, the Company also added a large exploration project in Wharton
County, Texas.
 
     The Company invested approximately $179 million, including capitalized
interest, to acquire over one million acres of leasehold in the Louisiana Trend
from fiscal 1995 through fiscal 1997, and an additional $163 million in drilling
to explore this leasehold in fiscal 1996 and 1997. Of the Company's six project
areas identified in the Louisiana Trend, only in the Masters Creek area has the
Company consistently found commercial quantities of oil and gas in the Austin
Chalk formation.
 
     As of June 30, 1997 the Company owned over two million net undeveloped
acres in its leasehold inventory. The Company expects that its inventory of
proved and unproved drilling locations will continue to be an important source
of new reserves, production and cash flow over the next few years. The Louisiana
Trend continues to be a key element of this existing inventory.

</TABLE>
 
PRIMARY OPERATING AREAS
 
     The Company's activities are concentrated in three primary operating areas:
(i) the Louisiana Trend, (ii) the Knox, Sholem Alechem, Golden Trend, and Arkoma
Basin areas of Oklahoma, and (iii) the Navasota River and Independence areas of
the downdip Giddings Field in southern Texas.
 
     Louisiana Austin Chalk Trend. The Louisiana Trend is the newest of the
Company's three primary operating areas and is budgeted to represent
approximately 50% of the Company's exploration and development activities in
fiscal 1998. In late 1994, Occidental Petroleum Corporation ("Occidental")
completed a horizontal Austin Chalk discovery well in the Masters Creek area of
central Louisiana. Occidental's well was drilled 200 miles east of the Company's
activity in the downdip Giddings Field and 60 miles east of the nearest previous
commercial multi-well horizontal Austin Chalk production in the Brookeland Field
of southeast Texas.
 
     Following the announcement of Occidental's discovery well, the Company
extensively reviewed and analyzed vertical drilling reports, electric logs, mud
logs, seismic data and vertical Austin Chalk production records to arrive at a
geological conclusion that the Austin Chalk could be productive across a large
portion of central and southeastern Louisiana. Accordingly, and in competition
with Union Pacific Resources Company, Sonat, Inc., Occidental, Amoco Production
Company, Helmerich & Payne, Inc., Belco Oil & Gas Corporation and others,
Chesapeake invested approximately $179 million from fiscal 1995 through fiscal
1997 to acquire over one million acres of leasehold in the Louisiana Trend.
Beginning in fiscal 1996 and accelerating substantially by the end of fiscal
1997, Chesapeake expended an additional $163 million to initiate drilling
efforts on 56 gross (34 net) wells to evaluate this leasehold position.
 
     From December 1996 through April 1997, the Company initiated drilling
efforts on 15 new operated wells in the Louisiana Trend. Between April 1997 and
July 1997, the Company completed operations on ten exploratory wells in areas of
the Louisiana Trend outside of Masters Creek. Of these wells, one was completed
on April 15, 1997, one on May 3, 1997 and eight were completed after June 1,
1997. Based upon the results from these wells, which primarily became known to
the Company in late June 1997, the Company made the determination that a
significant amount of leasehold previously classified as unevaluated had become
evaluated. This determination, in combination with development in the Masters
Creek area, resulted in a transfer of approximately $91 million of previously
unevaluated leasehold costs to the full cost pool which, and in conjunction with
disappointing drilling results and the related costs thereof and lower oil and
gas prices, was the primary cause of the full cost ceiling writedown.
 
     The Company believes that some portion of the Louisiana Trend outside of
the Masters Creek area, and specifically certain areas of East Baton Rouge and
Point Coupee Parishes that are prospective for the Tuscaloosa formation, may
ultimately be successfully exploited. It is the Company's intent to focus its
 
                                        3
<PAGE>   4
 
Louisiana drilling in fiscal 1998 primarily in the Masters Creek area and to
allow others to lead the continued exploration of areas outside of Masters
Creek.
 
     The Masters Creek area, where as of September 30, 1997 the Company and the
Company's competitors have completed approximately 36 out of 40 wells as
commercially productive with approximately 25 additional wells currently
drilling, has generally been much more successful than the other areas within
the Louisiana Trend. As of September 30, 1997, the Company had eight rigs
operating in this area and is participating in more than 10 non-operated wells.
For fiscal 1998, the Company has budgeted $125 million to drill approximately 25
net wells targeting the Austin Chalk formation and $13 million to drill two net
wells targeting the Tuscaloosa formation. These planned expenditures, in
combination with anticipated seismic costs, represent approximately 50% of the
Company's planned exploration and development capital expenditures for all
areas. There can be no assurance that the Louisiana Trend drilling will yield
substantial economic returns. Failure of the wells to produce significant
quantities of economically attractive reserves and production could have a
material adverse impact on the Company's future financial condition and results
of operations, and could result in a future ceiling limitation under rules of
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
     Oklahoma. Chesapeake's largest concentration of proved reserves is located
in Oklahoma and is comprised of the Knox, Golden Trend, Sholem Alechem, and
Arkoma Basin areas. These areas are generally characterized by relatively long
lived production from multiple pay zones. The Company has conducted and is
evaluating 3-D seismic surveys over significant portions of its Oklahoma
leasehold in an effort to enhance its future drilling efforts. In fiscal 1997,
the Company invested approximately $68 million to drill 51 gross (32 net) wells
in Oklahoma. The Company has budgeted approximately $28 million in fiscal 1998
to drill 36 gross (21 net) wells in Oklahoma.
 
     Giddings Field. Chesapeake's second largest concentration of proved
reserves and its highest concentration of present value is located in the
Giddings Field, Texas. The primary producing formation in Giddings is the Austin
Chalk formation, a fractured carbonate reservoir found at depths ranging from
7,000 feet to 17,000 feet along a 15,000 square mile trend in southeastern Texas
and central Louisiana. Chesapeake has concentrated its drilling efforts in the
gas prone downdip portion of the Giddings Field, where the Austin Chalk is
located at depths below 11,000 feet.
 
     The Giddings Field contributed approximately 44.6 Bcfe, or 57% of the
Company's total production in fiscal 1997, compared to 47.2 Bcfe or 78% in 1996.
The Company expects production to decline in this relatively mature area in
fiscal 1998. In fiscal 1997, the Company invested approximately $57 million to
drill 36 gross (19 net) wells in Giddings. The Company has budgeted
approximately $17 million to drill 18 gross (eight net) wells in Giddings during
fiscal 1998.
 
OTHER OPERATING AREAS
 
     Williston Basin. During fiscal 1996, Chesapeake began acquiring leasehold
in the Williston Basin, located in eastern Montana and western North Dakota, and
as of June 30, 1997 owned more than 700,000 gross (500,000 net) acres. During
fiscal 1997, the Company drilled and successfully completed four vertical wells
targeting the Red River formation on the northern portion of its leasehold. On
the southern portion of its leasehold, the Company was unsuccessful in an
attempt to establish horizontally drilled Red River production. Also during
fiscal 1997, the Company tested a third large area of its Williston acreage with
a successful horizontal Nesson well. Currently, the Company is focusing its
Williston efforts on continuing to develop the Nesson formation. The Company has
budgeted $6 million to drill six gross and net wells during fiscal 1998 in the
Williston Basin.
 
     Permian Basin. In fiscal 1995, the Company initiated activity in the
Permian Basin in the Lovington area of Lea County, New Mexico. In this project,
the Company is utilizing 3-D seismic technology to search for algal reef
buildups that management believes have been overlooked in this portion of the
Permian Basin because of inconclusive results provided by traditional 2-D
seismic technology.
 
                                        4
<PAGE>   5
 
     During fiscal 1997 the Company initiated eight wells in this project area,
seven of which were successfully completed. The Company has budgeted
approximately $14 million to drill 14 gross and net wells in this area during
fiscal 1998.
 
     Wharton County, Texas. During fiscal 1997 the Company acquired
approximately 25,000 net acres at a cost of approximately $29 million in Wharton
County, Texas. This exploration project is seeking gas production from the
shallower Frio and Yegua sands and from the Deep Wilcox at depths of up to
19,000 feet. The Company intends to participate with a 55% interest in a 55,000
acre 3-D seismic program with Coastal Oil & Gas Corporation, Seagull Energy
Corporation and other industry partners during fiscal 1998 to delineate
potential future drillsites in the vicinity of Coastal's recently completed
Zeidman Trust #2 well.
 
STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS
 
     During fiscal 1997, the Company invested in a number of oil and gas related
businesses and projects. The most significant of these was the Company's May
1997 initial investment in Bayard Drilling Technologies, Inc. ("Bayard"),
consisting of an $18 million subordinated loan and the purchase of $7 million of
common stock. In August 1997, the Company agreed to invest up to an additional
$9 million and convert certain options, warrants and note amounts that will
facilitate a potential initial public offering by Bayard. On August 27, 1997
Bayard filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of its
common stock. Chesapeake, subsequent to the completion of the transaction noted
above, will own 4,194,000 shares of Bayard common stock (30.4% of the common
stock outstanding) and anticipates selling substantially all of its ownership in
Bayard in the IPO (assuming the over-allotment option is exercised) and
receiving repayment of the subordinated loan. If successful, assuming the sale
of all of the Company's Bayard stock and based on the initial filing price of
Bayard at $15 per share, the Company would receive total proceeds of
approximately $74 million (net of offering costs) and realize a pre-tax gain of
approximately $40 million. No assurance can be given, however, that Bayard will
successfully complete the initial public offering of its common stock, at what
price, or that the net proceeds or pre-tax gain discussed above will be realized
by the Company.
 
     Also during fiscal 1997 the Company invested approximately $12 million for
its 50% interest in the Louisiana Austin Chalk Gathering System (a joint venture
with Mitchell Energy and Development Corporation) and $5 million for its 15.5%
interest in the Masters Creek Gas Plant (a joint venture among Union Pacific,
Sonat, Helmerich & Payne, and OXY). The Company has budgeted $4 million for its
share of the expansion of these assets during fiscal 1998. The Company considers
these mid-stream gas assets to be non-core and therefore may seek to sell them
in fiscal 1998.

MARKETING
 
     The Company's oil production is sold under market sensitive or spot price
contracts. The Company's natural gas production is sold to purchasers under
varying percentage-of-proceeds and percentage-of-index contracts. By the terms
of these contracts, the Company receives a percentage of the resale price
received by the purchaser for sales of residue gas and natural gas liquids
recovered after gathering and processing the Company's gas. The residue gas and
natural gas liquids sold by these purchasers are sold primarily based on spot
market prices. The revenue received by the Company from the sale of natural gas
liquids is included in natural gas sales. During fiscal 1997, the following
three customers individually accounted for 10% or more of the Company's total
oil and gas sales:

     Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc., ("CEMI") a wholly-owned subsidiary,
provides oil and natural gas marketing services including commodity price
structuring, contract administration and nomination services for the Company,
its partners and other oil and natural gas producers in the geographical areas
in which the Company is active.
 
HEDGING ACTIVITIES
 
     Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of
a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include (1)
swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which the Company
pays the counterparty and below which the Company is paid by the counterparty,
(2) the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor" price below
which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by which the price of the
Commodity is below the contracted floor, (3) the sale of index-related calls
that provide for a "ceiling" price above which the Company pays the counterparty
the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling,
and (4) basis protection swaps. Results from hedging transactions are reflected
in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas
production. The Company has not entered into hedging transactions unrelated to
the Company's oil and gas production or physical purchase or sale commitments.
 
     As of June 30, 1997, the Company had the following oil swap arrangements
for periods after June 1997:

     The Company entered into gas swap arrangements to cancel the effect of the
swaps for the months of July through October at an average price of $2.133 per

     The Company entered into a curve lock for approximately 4.9 Bcf of gas
which allows the Company the option to hedge April 1999 through November 1999
gas based upon a negative $0.285 differential to December 1998 gas any time
between the strike date and December 1998.
 
     The Company estimates that had all of the crude oil and natural gas swap
agreements in effect for production periods beginning July 1, 1997 terminated on
June 30, 1997, based on the closing prices for NYMEX futures contracts as of
that date, the Company would have paid the various counterparties a net amount
of approximately $185,000, which would have represented the "fair value" at that
date. These agreements were not terminated.

     Periodically, CEMI enters into various hedging transactions designed to
hedge against physical purchase commitments made by CEMI. Gains or losses on
these transactions are recorded as adjustments to Oil and Gas Marketing Sales in
the consolidated statements of operations and are not considered by management
to be material.
 
COMPETITION
 
     The oil and gas industry is highly competitive. The Company competes with
major and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of leasehold,
proven oil and gas properties, as well as for the services and labor required to
explore, develop and produce such properties. Many of these competitors have
financial, technical and other resources substantially greater than those of the
Company.
 
SEASONAL NATURE OF BUSINESS
 
     Historically the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months
and increases during the winter months. However, pipelines, utilities, local
distribution companies and industrial users may more effectively utilize natural
gas storage capacity by purchasing some of the winter load in the summer at
reduced prices.
 
REGULATION
 
  General
 
     Numerous departments and agencies, federal, state and local, issue rules
and regulations binding on the oil and gas industry, some of which carry
substantial penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil
and gas industry increases the Company's cost of doing business and,
consequently, affects its profitability.
 
  Exploration and Production
 
     The Company's operations are subject to various types of regulation at the
federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for
the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or
operate wells and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and
casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are
drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used or
obtained in connection with operations. The Company's operations are also
subject to various conservation regulations. These include the regulation of the
size of drilling and spacing units and the density of wells which may be drilled
and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some
states (such as Oklahoma) allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to
facilitate exploration while other states (such as Texas) rely on voluntary
pooling of lands and leases. In areas where pooling is voluntary, it may be more
difficult to form units and, therefore, more difficult to develop a prospect if
the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state
conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells,
generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements
regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to
limit the amount of oil and gas the Company can produce from its wells and to
limit the number of wells or the locations at which the Company can drill. The
extent of any impact on the Company of such restrictions cannot be predicted.
 
  Environmental and Occupational Regulation
 
     General. The Company's activities are subject to existing federal, state
and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution
control. It is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary
event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and
regulations concerning the protection of the environment and human health will
not have a material effect upon the operations, capital expenditures, earnings
or the competitive position of the Company. The Company cannot predict what
effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies thereunder and
claims for damages for injuries to property, employees, other persons and the
environment resulting from the Company's operations could have on its
activities.

     Activities of the Company with respect to the exploration, development and
production of oil and natural gas are subject to stringent environmental
regulation by state and federal authorities including the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). Such regulation has increased the cost
of planning, designing, drilling, operating and in some instances, abandoning
wells. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and
disposal of drilling and production waste products and waste created by water
and air pollution control procedures. Although the Company believes that
compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse
effect on operations or earnings, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are
inherent in oil and gas operations, and there can be no assurance that
significant costs and liabilities, including criminal penalties, will not be
incurred. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter
environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages for injuries to
property or persons resulting from the Company's operations could result in
substantial costs and liabilities.
 
     Waste Disposal. The Company currently owns or leases, and has in the past
owned or leased, numerous properties that for many years have been used for the
exploration and production of oil and gas. Although the Company has utilized
operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time,
hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under
the properties owned or leased by the Company or on or under other locations
where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these
properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or
release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under the Company's control.
State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes and properties
have gradually become more strict. Under such laws, the Company could be
required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes
disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination
(including groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging operations
to prevent future contamination.
 
     The Company generates wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are subject
to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable
state statutes. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal
options for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and are considering the
adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous wastes. Furthermore,
certain wastes generated by the Company's oil and natural gas operations that
are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be
designated as hazardous wastes, and therefore be subject to considerably more
rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.
 
     Superfund. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability,
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain
classes of persons with respect to the release of a "hazardous substance" into
the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a site and
persons that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous
substances found at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some cases,
third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the
environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of persons the costs
of such action. In the course of its operations, the Company may have generated
and may generate wastes that fall within CERCLA's definition of "hazardous
substances." The Company may also be or have been an owner of sites on which
"hazardous substances" have been released. The Company may be responsible under
CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such wastes have
been released. To date, however, neither the Company nor, to its knowledge, its
predecessors or successors have been named a potentially responsible party under
CERCLA or similar state superfund laws affecting property owned or leased by the
Company.
 
     Air Emissions. The operations of the Company are subject to local, state
and federal regulations for the control of emissions of air pollution. Legal and
regulatory requirements in this area are increasing, and there can be no
assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the
future as a result of new regulatory developments. In particular, regulations
promulgated under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 may impose additional
compliance requirements that could affect the Company's operations. However, it
is impossible to predict accurately the effect, if any, of the Clean Air Act
Amendments on the Company at this time. The Company may in the future be subject
to civil or administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly
with air regulations or permits. These enforcement actions are generally
resolved by
 
                                       10
<PAGE>   11
 
payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies.
Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require the Company to forego
construction or operation of certain air emission sources.
 
     OSHA. The Company is subject to the requirements of the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes. The
OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations
under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and
similar state statutes require the Company to organize information about
hazardous materials used, released or produced in its operations. Certain of
this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental
authorities and local citizens. The Company is also subject to the requirements
and reporting set forth in OSHA workplace standards. The Company provides safety
training and personal protective equipment to its employees.
 
     OPA and Clean Water Act. Federal regulations require certain owners or
operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil, such as the Company,
to prepare and implement spill prevention control plans, countermeasure plans
and facilities response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into
surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") amends certain provisions
of the federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, commonly referred to as the
Clean Water Act ("CWA"), and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of
and response to oil spills into navigable waters. The OPA subjects owners of
facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup
costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited
to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. The CWA
provides penalties for any discharges of petroleum product in reportable
quantities and imposes substantial liability for the costs of removing a spill.
State laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and
criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of releases of petroleum or its
derivatives into surface waters or into the ground. Regulations are currently
being developed under OPA and state laws concerning oil pollution prevention and
other matters that may impose additional regulatory burdens on the Company. In
addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require permits to be obtained to
authorize discharges into surface waters or to construct facilities in wetland
areas. With respect to certain of its operations, the Company is required to
maintain such permits or meet general permit requirements. The EPA recently
adopted regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program
requires covered facilities to obtain individual permits, participate in a group
permit or seek coverage under an EPA general permit. The Company believes that
it will be able to obtain, or be included under, such permits, where necessary,
with minor modifications to existing facilities and operations that would not
have a material effect on the Company.
 
     NORM. Oil and gas exploration and production activities have been
identified as generators of concentrations of low-level naturally-occurring
radioactive materials ("NORM"). NORM regulations have recently been adopted in
several states. The Company is unable to estimate the effect of these
regulations, although based upon the Company's preliminary analysis to date, the
Company does not believe that its compliance with such regulations will have a
material adverse effect on its operations or financial condition.
 
     Safe Drinking Water Act. The Company's operations involve the disposal of
produced saltwater and other nonhazardous oil-field wastes by reinjection into
the subsurface. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), oil and gas
operators, such as the Company, must obtain a permit for the construction and
operation of underground Class II injection wells. To protect against
contamination of drinking water, periodic mechanical integrity tests are often
required to be performed by the well operator. The Company has obtained such
permits for the Class II wells it operates. The Company also has disposed of
wastes in facilities other than those owned by the Company (commercial Class II
injection wells).
 
     Toxic Substances Control Act. The Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") was
enacted to control the adverse effects of newly manufactured and existing
chemical substances. Under the TSCA, the EPA has issued specific rules and
regulations governing the use, labeling, maintenance, removal from service and
disposal of PCB items, such as transformers and capacitors used by oil and gas
companies. The Company may own such PCB items but does not believe compliance
with TSCA has or will have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations
or financial condition.

TITLE TO PROPERTIES
 
     Title to properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net
profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements
customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due
and to other encumbrances. As is customary in the industry in the case of
undeveloped properties, little investigation of record title is made at the time
of acquisition (other than a preliminary review of local records). Drilling
title opinions are always prepared before commencement of drilling operations.
From time to time the Company's title to oil and gas properties is challenged
through legal proceedings. The Company is routinely involved in litigation
involving title to certain of its oil and gas properties, none of which
management believes will be materially adverse to the Company, individually or
in the aggregate.
 
OPERATING HAZARDS AND INSURANCE
 
     The oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including
the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured
formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or
discharges of toxic gases, the occurrence of any of which could result in
substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, severe damage
to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or
other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation
and penalties and suspension of operations. The Company's horizontal drilling
activities involve greater risk of mechanical problems than conventional
vertical drilling operations.
 
     The Company maintains a $50 million oil and gas lease operator policy that
insures the Company against certain sudden and accidental risks associated with
drilling, completing and operating its wells. There can be no assurance that
this insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure to liability.
The Company also carries comprehensive general liability policies and a $60
million umbrella policy. The Company and its subsidiaries carry workers'
compensation insurance in all states in which they operate and a $35 million
employment practice liability policy. While the Company believes these policies
are customary in the industry, they do not provide complete coverage against all
operating risks.
 
EMPLOYEES
 
     The Company had 362 full-time employees as of June 30, 1997. No employees
are represented by organized labor unions. The Company considers its employee
relations to be good.
 
FACILITIES
 
     The Company owns 12 buildings totaling approximately 80,000 square feet in
an office complex in Oklahoma City that comprise its headquarters' offices and
also owns a field office in Lindsay, Oklahoma. The Company leases field office
space in College Station and Navasota, Texas, Lafayette, Louisiana and Calgary,
Canada.
 
REINCORPORATION
 
     On December 31, 1996, the Company changed its state of incorporation from
Delaware to Oklahoma by the merger of Chesapeake Energy Corporation, a Delaware
corporation, with and into its newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Chesapeake
Oklahoma Corporation. The surviving corporation changed its name to Chesapeake
Energy Corporation. Each outstanding share of Common Stock, par value $.10, of
the merged Delaware corporation was converted into one share of Common Stock,
par value $.01, of the surviving corporation. As a result of the merger, the
surviving corporation succeeded to all of the assets and is responsible for all
of the liabilities of the merged Delaware corporation. On matters of corporate
governance, the rights of the Company's security holders are now governed by
Oklahoma law, which is similar to the corporate law of Delaware.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
 
OIL AND GAS RESERVES
 
     The tables below set forth information as of June 30, 1997 with respect to
the Company's estimated net proved reserves, the estimated future net revenue
therefrom and the present value thereof at such date. Williamson Petroleum
Consultants, Inc. ("Williamson") evaluated most of the Company's Texas oil and
gas reserves and all of its Louisiana oil and gas reserves, together
representing approximately 50% of the Company's total proved reserves. The
Company internally evaluated the remaining reserves, which were subsequently
evaluated by Williamson with a variance of approximately 4% of total proved
reserves. The estimates were prepared based upon a review of production
histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and engineering data developed
by the Company. The present value of estimated future net revenue shown is not
intended to represent the current market value of the estimated oil and gas
reserves owned by the Company.

- ---------------
 
(a) Estimated future net revenue represents estimated future gross revenue to be
    generated from the production of proved reserves, net of estimated
    production and future development costs, using prices and
 
                                       14
<PAGE>   15
 
    costs in effect at June 30, 1997. The amounts shown do not give effect to
    non-property related expenses, such as general and administrative expenses,
    debt service and future income tax expense or to depreciation, depletion and
    amortization. The prices used in the Williamson and internal reports yield
    average prices of $18.38 per barrel of oil and $2.12 per Mcf of gas.
 
     The future net revenue attributable to the Company's estimated proved
undeveloped reserves of $275.5 million at June 30, 1997, and the $188.6 million
present value thereof, have been calculated assuming that the Company will
expend approximately $146.9 million to develop these reserves through June 30,
2000. The amount and timing of these expenditures will depend on a number of
factors, including actual drilling results, product prices and the availability
of capital.
 
     No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have
been included in reports to any federal agency other than the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
 
     The Company's interest used in calculating proved reserves and the
estimated future net revenue therefrom was determined after giving effect to the
assumed maximum participation by other parties to the Company's farmout and
participation agreements. The prices used in calculating the estimated future
net revenue attributable to proved reserves do not reflect market prices for oil
and gas production sold subsequent to June 30, 1997. There can be no assurance
that all of the estimated proved reserves will be produced and sold at the
assumed prices or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially
enforced.
 
     There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of
proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of
development expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the
producer. The reserve data set forth herein represent only estimates. Reserve
engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of
oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact way, and the accuracy of any
reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of
engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates
made by different engineers often vary. In addition, results of drilling,
testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify
revision of such estimates, and such revisions may be material. Accordingly,
reserve estimates are often different from the actual quantities of oil and gas
that are ultimately recovered. Furthermore, the estimated future net revenue
from proved reserves and the present value thereof are based upon certain
assumptions, including prices, future production levels and cost, that may not
prove correct. Predictions about prices and future production levels are subject
to great uncertainty, and this is particularly true as to proved undeveloped
reserves, which are inherently less certain than proved developed reserves and
which comprise a significant portion of the Company's proved reserves. In fiscal
1997, such uncertainties resulted in a $236 million impairment of the Company's
oil and gas properties. (See "Results of Operations -- Impairment of Oil and Gas
Properties" in Item 7).
 
     See Item 1 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 for a description of the Company's primary and other
operating areas, production and other information regarding its oil and gas
properties.

     McClendon, Thomas L. Ward, Marcus C. Rowland, Shannon T. Self, Walter C.
     Wilson, Henry J. Hood, Steven C. Dixon, and J. Mark Lester, filed in the
     U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on September 25,
     1997.
 
     The plaintiffs assert that the defendants made materially false and
misleading statements and failed to disclose material facts about the success of
the Company's exploration efforts, principally in the Louisiana Trend. As a
result, the complaints allege, the price of the Company's common stock was
artificially inflated during periods beginning as early as January 25, 1996 and
ending on June 27, 1997, when the Company issued a press release announcing
disappointing drilling results in the Louisiana Trend and a full-cost ceiling
writedown to be reflected in its June 30, 1997 financial statements. The
plaintiffs further allege that certain of the named individual defendants sold
common stock during the class period when they knew or should have known adverse
nonpublic information. Each case seeks a determination that the suit is a proper
class action, certification of the plaintiff as a class representative and
damages in an unspecified amount, together with costs of litigation, including
attorneys' fees. The Company and the individual defendants believe that these
actions are without merit, and intend to defend against them vigorously.
 
     On October 15, 1996, Union Pacific Resources Company ("UPRC") filed suit
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Texas, Fort Worth Division alleging (a) infringement and inducing infringement
of UPRC's claim to a patent (the "UPRC Patent") for an invention involving a
method of maintaining a borehole in a stratigraphic zone during drilling, and
(b) tortious interference with certain business relations between UPRC and
certain of its former employees. UPRC's claims against the Company are based on
services provided by a third party vendor to the Company. UPRC is seeking
injunctive relief, damages of an unspecified amount, including actual, enhanced,
consequential and punitive damages, interest, costs and attorneys' fees. The
Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to UPRC's
 
                                       16
<PAGE>   17
 
allegations and has requested the court to declare the UPRC Patent invalid. The
Company has also filed a motion to limit the scope of UPRC's claims and for
summary judgment. No prediction can be made as to the outcome of the matter.

DIVIDENDS
 
     The Company initiated a quarterly dividend with the payment of $0.02 per
common share on July 15, 1997. The payment of future cash dividends, if any,
will be reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors and will depend upon,
among other things, the Company's financial condition, funds from operations,
the level of its capital and development expenditures, its future business
prospects and any contractual restrictions.
 
     Certain of the Indentures governing the Company's outstanding Senior Notes
contain certain restrictions on the Company's ability to declare and pay
dividends. Under the Indentures, the Company may not pay any cash dividends in
respect of its Common Stock if (i) a default or an event of default has occurred
and is continuing at the time of or immediately after giving effect to the
dividend payment, (ii) the Company would not be able to incur at least $1 of
additional indebtedness under the terms of the Indentures, or (iii) immediately
after giving effect to the dividend payment, the aggregate of all Restricted
Payments (as defined) declared or made after the respective issue dates of the
notes exceeds the sum of specified income, proceeds from the issuance of stock
and debt by the Company and other amounts from the quarter in which the
respective note issuances occurred to the quarter immediately preceding the date
of the dividend payment.

ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS
 
OVERVIEW
 
     Chesapeake's revenue, operating cash flow (exclusive of changes in working
capital) and production reached record levels in fiscal 1997. However,
significant expenditures for acreage acquisition and drilling costs followed by
unfavorable exploration and production results, together with increases in
drilling and equipment costs and declines in oil and gas prices as of June 30,
1997, resulted in downward revisions in estimates of the Company's proved oil
and gas reserves and the present value of the estimated future net revenues from
these reserves. Such excess caused the Company to record a $236 million asset
writedown during the fourth quarter of the year and caused the Company to report
a net loss of $183 million for the year.
 
     Chesapeake's strategy during fiscal 1997, and particularly in the third and
fourth quarters of the year, was to identify the potential of the various areas
of the Louisiana Trend by exploratory drilling. In several large areas outside
of the Masters Creek portion of the Louisiana Trend, this exploration program
was unsuccessful. In these areas significant leasehold and drilling costs were
added to the evaluated oil and gas property pool while insignificant quantities
of oil and gas reserves were added to the Company's proved reserve base.
 
     During fiscal 1997, the Company participated in 171 gross (107 net) wells,
of which 129 wells were operated by the Company. A summary of the Company's
drilling activities and capital expenditures by primary operating area is as
follows ($ in thousands):

     The Company's proved reserves decreased 5% to an estimated 403 Bcfe at June
30, 1997, down 22 Bcfe from 425 Bcfe of estimated proved reserves at June 30,
1996 (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and
"Results of Operations -- Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties"). Due to the
numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and
in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures,
including many factors beyond the control of the Company, there can be no
assurance that the Company's estimated proved reserves will not decrease in the
future.
 
     The Company's business strategy in fiscal 1997 continued to emphasize the
acquisition of large prospective leasehold positions which potentially provide a
multi-year inventory of drilling locations. As of June 30, 1997, the Company had
approximately 277,000 gross acres of developed leasehold and 2.7 million gross
acres of undeveloped leasehold. The fiscal 1997 drilling program, particularly
in Louisiana, consisted of more exploratory drilling than in previous years. The
Company's strategy for fiscal 1998 is to reduce its capital expenditure program
to approximately $250-$275 million, concentrate its Louisiana Trend drilling
activities in Masters Creek, utilize more 3-D seismic prior to conducting
drilling operations, reduce the acquisition of additional unproven leasehold,
and selectively acquire proved reserves. This strategy will likely have the
effect of reducing the Company's anticipated production growth rate from
exploration and development drilling to between 10% and 15% per year.
 
     To assist the Company in reducing exploratory risks and increasing economic
returns the Company has increased its use of 3-D seismic. The Company has
conducted, participated in, or is actively pursuing more than 25 3-D seismic
programs to more fully evaluate the Company's acreage inventory.

     The Company completed an offering of 8,972,000 shares of common stock in
December 1996 resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $288.1
million. Additionally, the Company issued $300 million in Senior Notes in March
1997. The Company used the net proceeds from these offerings, along with cash
flow from operations, to fund its net capital expenditures of $524 million,
repay all amounts outstanding under its commercial bank credit facilities, and
retire $47.5 million of Senior Notes.
 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
 
     General. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, the Company realized a
net loss of $183.4 million, or a loss of $2.79 per common share, on total
revenues of $280.3 million. This compares to net income of $23.4 million, or
$0.40 per common share, on total revenues of $149.4 million in 1996, and net
income of $11.7 million, or $0.21 per common share, on total revenues of $67.3
million in fiscal 1995. The loss in fiscal 1997 as compared to significantly
higher earnings in fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995 was largely the result of a $236
million asset writedown recorded in the fourth quarter under the full cost
method of accounting. (See "Results of Operations -- Impairment of Oil and Gas
Properties").
 
     Oil and Gas Sales. During fiscal 1997, oil and gas sales increased 74% to
$192.9 million versus $110.8 million for fiscal 1996 and 238% from the fiscal
1995 amount of $57 million. The increase in oil and gas sales resulted primarily
from strong growth in production volumes and significantly higher average oil
and gas prices. For fiscal 1997, the Company produced 78.6 Bcfe, at a weighted
average price of $2.45 per Mcfe, compared to 60.2 Bcfe produced in fiscal 1996
at a weighted average price of $1.84 per Mcfe, and 31.9 Bcfe produced in fiscal
1995 at a weighted average price of $1.78 per Mcfe. This represents production
growth of 31% for fiscal 1997 compared to fiscal 1996 and 146% compared to
fiscal 1995.

</TABLE>
 
     The Company's gas production represented approximately 79% of the Company's
total production volume on an equivalent basis in fiscal 1997. This compares to
86% in fiscal 1996 and 79% in fiscal 1995. This decrease in gas production as a
percentage of total production in fiscal 1997 was the result of drilling in the
Louisiana Trend, which tends to produce more oil than gas.
 
     For fiscal 1997, the Company realized an average price per barrel of oil of
$20.93, compared to $17.85 in fiscal 1996 and $17.36 in fiscal 1995. The Company
markets its oil on monthly average equivalent spot price contracts and typically
receives a premium to the price posted for West Texas Intermediate crude oil.
 
     Gas price realizations increased from fiscal 1996 to 1997 from $1.66 per
Mcf to $2.18 per Mcf, or 31%, generally as the result of market conditions. Gas
prices in fiscal 1995 averaged $1.48 per Mcf. The Company's gas price
realizations in fiscal 1997 were also higher due to the increase in Louisiana
Trend gas production, which generally receives premium prices at least
equivalent to Henry Hub indexes due to the high Btu content and favorable market
location of the production.
 
     The Company's hedging activities resulted in decreases in oil and gas
revenues of $7.4 million, $5.9 million, and none in fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.
 
     Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. In December 1995, the Company entered into the
oil and gas marketing business by establishing a subsidiary to provide primarily
natural gas marketing services including commodity price structuring, contract
administration and nomination services for the Company, its partners and other
oil and natural gas producers in the geographical areas in which the Company is
active. The Company realized $76.2 million in oil and gas marketing sales for
third parties in fiscal 1997, with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses
of $75.1 million, resulting in a gross margin of $1.1 million. This compares to
sales of $28.4 million, expenses of $27.5 million, and a margin of $0.9 million
in fiscal 1996. There were no comparable marketing activities in fiscal 1995.
 
     Oil and Gas Service Operations. On June 30, 1996, Peak USA Energy Services,
Ltd., a limited partnership ("Peak"), was formed by Peak Oilfield Services
Company (a joint venture between Cook Inlet Region, Inc. and Nabors Industries,
Inc.) and Chesapeake for the purpose of purchasing the Company's oilfield
service assets and providing rig moving, transportation and related site
construction services to the Company and others in the industry. The Company
sold its service company assets to Peak for $6.4 million, and simultaneously
invested $2.5 million in exchange for a 33.3% partnership interest in Peak. This
transaction resulted in recognition of a $1.8 million pre-tax gain during the
fourth fiscal quarter of 1996 (reported in Interest and other revenues). A
deferred gain from the sale of service company assets of $0.9 million was
recorded as a reduction in the Company's investment in Peak and is being
amortized to income over the estimated useful lives of the Peak assets. The
Company's investment in Peak is accounted for using the equity method, and
resulted in $0.5 million of income being included in Interest and other revenues
in fiscal 1997.
 
     Revenues from oil and gas service operations were $6.3 million in fiscal
1996, down 28% from $8.8 million in fiscal 1995. The related costs and expenses
of these operations were $4.9 million and $7.7 million for the two years ended
June 30, 1996 and 1995 respectively. The gross profit margin of 22% in fiscal
1996 was up from the 12% margin in fiscal 1995. The gross profit margin derived
from these operations is
 
                                       22
<PAGE>   23
 
a function of drilling activities in the period, costs of materials and supplies
and the mix of operations between lower margin trucking operations versus higher
margin labor oriented service operations.
 
     Interest and Other. Interest and other revenues for fiscal 1997 were $11.2
million which compares to $3.8 million in fiscal 1996 and $1.5 million in fiscal
1995. During fiscal 1997, the Company realized $8.7 million in interest, $1.6
million of other investment income, $0.5 million from its investment in Peak,
and $0.4 million in other income. During fiscal 1996, the Company realized $3.7
million of interest and other investment income, and a $1.8 million gain related
to the sale of certain service company assets, offset by a $1.7 million loss due
to natural gas basis changes in April 1996 as a result of the Company's hedging
activities. During 1995, the Company did not incur any such gains on sale of
assets or basis losses.
 
     Production Expenses and Taxes. Production expenses and taxes, which include
lifting costs and production and excise taxes, increased to $15.1 million in
fiscal 1997, as compared to $8.3 million in fiscal 1996 and $4.3 million in
fiscal 1995. These increases on a year-to-year basis were primarily the result
of increased production. On an Mcfe production unit basis, production expenses
and taxes increased to $0.19 per Mcfe as compared to $0.14 per Mcfe in fiscal
1996 and $0.13 per Mcfe in fiscal 1995. During fiscal 1996 and 1995, a high
proportion of the Company's production was from the Giddings Field, much of
which qualified for Texas severance tax exemptions. The Company expects that
operating costs per Mcfe will continue to increase in fiscal 1998 based on the
Company's expected production mix and drilling activities in oil prone areas
which generally have higher operating costs than gas prone areas and because a
higher percentage of the Company's production will not qualify for severance tax
exemptions as compared to the past.
 
     Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. The Company utilizes the full cost
method to account for its investment in oil and gas properties. Under this
method, all costs of acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
reserves (including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs, geological and
geophysical expenditures, certain capitalized internal costs, dry hole costs and
tangible and intangible development costs) are capitalized as incurred. These
oil and gas property costs along with the estimated future capital expenditures
to develop proved undeveloped reserves are depleted and charged to operations
using the unit-of-production method based on the ratio of current production to
proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by the Company's independent
engineering consultants and Company engineers. Costs directly associated with
the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the
amortization computation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves
can be assigned to the property or whether impairment has occurred. To the
extent that capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated
depreciation, depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes,
exceed the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and gas properties, such
excess costs are charged to operations.
 
     Prior to January 1997, the Company completed operations on one exploratory
well in each of three separate areas outside Masters Creek in the Louisiana
Trend. Between April 1997 and July 1997, the Company completed operations on ten
Company operated exploratory wells located outside Masters Creek in the
Louisiana Trend that resulted in the addition of only 0.5 Bcfe of proved
reserves. Cumulative well costs on these non-Masters Creek properties were
approximately $43 million as of June 30, 1997. Of the 10 wells, one was
completed on April 15, 1997, one on May 3, 1997 and eight after June 1, 1997.
Based upon this information and similar data which had become available from
outside operated properties in these non-Masters Creek areas of the Louisiana
Trend in late June 1997, management determined that a significant portion of its
leasehold in the Louisiana Trend outside of Masters Creek was impaired. During
the quarters ended March 31, 1997 and June 30, 1997 the Company transferred $7.6
million and $86.3 million, respectively, of non-Masters Creek Louisiana Trend
leasehold costs to the amortization base of the full cost pool.
 
     Oil and gas prices declined from $20.90 per Bbl and $2.41 per Mcf at June
30, 1996 to $18.38 per Bbl and $2.12 per Mcf at June 30, 1997. Drilling and
equipment costs escalated rapidly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 due
primarily to higher day-rates for drilling rigs, thus increasing the estimated
future capital expenditures to be incurred to develop the Company's proved
undeveloped reserves. The oil and gas price declines and the increased costs to
drill and equip wells caused the Company to eliminate 35 gross proved
undeveloped locations in the Knox Field which contained an estimated 45 net Bcfe
of proved undeveloped
 
                                       23
<PAGE>   24
 
reserves. Similar factors combined with unfavorable drilling and production
results eliminated approximately 93 Bcfe of proved reserves in the Giddings, and
Louisiana Trend areas.
 
     In the Independence area of the Giddings Field of Texas, a single well
completed in late March 1997 which the Company had estimated to contain 15.7
Bcfe of Company reserves at March 31, 1997, was significantly and adversely
affected by another operator's offset well which damaged the reservoir and
reduced the Company's estimated ultimate recovery to 8.0 Bcfe of reserves.
 
     In late June 1997, management reviewed its March 31, 1997 internal
estimates of proved reserves and related estimated discounted future net
revenues from its proved reserves, and giving effect to fourth quarter 1997
drilling and production results, oil and gas prices, higher drilling and
completion costs, and additional leasehold acquisition costs and delay rentals
incurred in areas subsequently determined to have less reserve potential than
had previously been estimated. After considering all of these factors,
management estimated that at June 30, 1997 it would have capitalized costs of
oil and gas properties which would exceed its full cost ceiling by approximately
$150 million to $200 million and on June 27, 1997, issued a press release which
included this estimate. Subsequently, based on the Company's final year-end
estimates of its proved reserves and related estimated future net revenues,
which took into account additional drilling and production results, management
determined that as of June 30, 1997, its capitalized costs exceeded its full
cost ceiling by approximately $236 million.
 
     No such writedown was experienced by the Company in fiscal 1996 or fiscal
1995.
 
     Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas properties for fiscal 1997
was $103.3 million, $52.4 million higher than fiscal 1996's expense of $50.9
million, and $77.9 million higher than fiscal 1995's expense of $25.4 million.
The expense in fiscal 1997 excluded the effects of the asset writedown. The
average DD&A rate per Mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future
development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented,
increased to $1.31 in fiscal 1997 compared to $0.85 in fiscal 1996 and $0.80 in
fiscal 1995. The Company's DD&A rate in the future will be a function of the
results of future acquisition, exploration, development and production results,
but the Company's rate is expected to trend upward in fiscal 1998 based on
projected higher finding costs for the Louisiana Trend and higher drilling,
completing, and equipping expenses throughout the oil and gas industry.
 
     Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and
amortization ("D&A") of other assets increased to $3.8 million in fiscal 1997,
compared to $3.2 million in fiscal 1996, and $1.8 million in fiscal 1995. This
increase in fiscal 1997 was caused by an increase in D&A as a result of
increased investments in depreciable buildings and equipment, and increased
amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of Senior Notes
in May 1995, April 1996 and March 1997. The Company anticipates an increase in
D&A in fiscal 1998 as a result of a full year of debt issuance cost amortization
on the Senior Notes issued in March 1997 and higher building depreciation
expense on the Company's corporate offices.
 
     General and Administrative. General and administrative ("G&A") expenses,
which are net of capitalized internal payroll and non-payroll expenses (see Note
11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were $8.8 million in fiscal
1997, up 83% from $4.8 million in fiscal 1996, and up from $3.6 million in
fiscal 1995. The increases in fiscal 1997 as compared to fiscal 1996 and 1995
result primarily from increased personnel expenses required by the Company's
growth and industry wage inflation. The Company capitalized $3.9 million of
internal costs in fiscal 1997 directly related to the Company's oil and gas
exploration and development efforts, as compared to $1.7 million in 1996 and
$0.6 million in 1995. The Company anticipates that G&A costs for fiscal 1998
will continue to increase as the result of wage inflation in the oil and gas
industry and legal fees associated with the UPRC and shareholder litigation.
 
     Interest and Other. Interest and other expense increased to $18.6 million
in fiscal 1997 as compared to $13.7 million in 1996 and $6.6 million in fiscal
1995. Interest expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 was $8.7 million,
reflecting the issuance of the 7.875% Senior Notes and the 8.5% Senior Notes in
March 1997. In addition to the interest expense reported, the Company
capitalized $12.9 million of interest during fiscal 1997, as compared to $6.4
million capitalized in fiscal 1996 and $1.6 million in fiscal 1995. Interest
expense will
 
                                       24
<PAGE>   25
 
increase significantly in fiscal 1998 as compared to fiscal 1997 as a result of
the $300 million Senior Notes issued in March 1997 and reduced levels of
capitalized interest expected in fiscal 1998.
 
     Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. The Company recorded an income tax
benefit of $3.6 million for fiscal 1997, before consideration of the $3.8
million tax benefit associated with the extraordinary loss from the early
extinguishment of debt, as compared to income tax expense of $12.9 million in
1996 and $6.3 million in 1995. All of the income tax expense in 1996 and 1995
was deferred due to tax net operating losses and carryovers resulting from the
Company's drilling program.
 
     The Company's loss before income taxes and extraordinary item of $180.3
million created a tax benefit for financial reporting purposes of $67.7 million.
However, due to limitations on the recognition of deferred tax assets, the total
tax benefit was reduced to $3.6 million.
 
     At June 30, 1997 the Company had a net operating loss carryforward of
approximately $300 million for regular federal income taxes which will expire in
future years beginning in 2007. Management believes that it cannot be
demonstrated at this time that it is more likely than not that the deferred
income tax assets, comprised primarily of the net operating loss carryforward,
will be realizable in future years, and therefore a valuation allowance of $64.1
million has been recorded in fiscal 1997. A deferred tax benefit related to the
exercise of employee stock options of approximately $4.8 million was allocated
directly to additional paid-in capital in 1997, compared to $7.9 million in 1996
and $1.2 million in fiscal 1995.
 
     The Company does not expect to record any net income tax expense in fiscal
1998 based on information available at this time.
 
     Hedging. Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the
price of a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies
include (1) swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which
the Company pays the counterparty and below which the Company is paid by the
counterparty, (2) the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor"
price below which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by which the
price of the commodity is below the contracted floor, (3) the sale of
index-related calls that provide for a "ceiling" price above which the Company
pays the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above
the contracted ceiling, and (4) basis protection swaps. Results from hedging
transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the
Company's oil and gas production. entered into hedging transactions unrelated to
the Company's oil and gas production or physical purchase or sale commitments.
 
     As of June 30, 1997, the Company had the following oil swap arrangements
for periods after June 1997:

     The Company had entered into gas swap arrangements to cancel the effect of
the swaps for the months of July through October at an average price of $2.133
per MMBtu.
 
     The Company has entered into a curve lock for 4.9 Bcf of gas which allows
the Company the option to hedge April 1999 through November 1999 gas based upon
a negative $0.285 differential to December 1998 gas any time between the strike
date and December 1998.
 
     Gains or losses on the crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are
recognized as price adjustments in the month of related production. The Company
estimates that had all of the crude oil and natural gas swap agreements in
effect for production periods beginning July 1, 1997 terminated on June 30,
1997, based on the closing prices for NYMEX futures contracts as of that date,
the Company would have paid the counterparty approximately $185,000, which would
have represented the "fair value" at that date. These agreements were not
terminated.
 
     Periodically, the Company's oil and gas marketing subsidiary CEMI enters
into various hedging transactions designed to hedge against physical purchase
commitments made by CEMI. Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded as
adjustments to Oil and Gas Marketing Sales in the consolidated statements of
operations and are not considered by management to be material.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
     Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities
(inclusive of changes in components of working capital) decreased to $84.1
million in fiscal 1997, as compared to $121.0 million in fiscal 1996 and $54.7
million in fiscal 1995. The primary reason for the decrease from fiscal 1996 to
1997 was significant changes in the components of current assets and
liabilities, specifically $102.8 million of short-term investments at June 30,
1997. Cash provided by operating activities is expected to be a significant
source for meeting forecasted cash requirements for fiscal 1998.
 
     Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Significantly higher cash was used in
fiscal 1997 for development, exploration and acquisition of oil and gas
properties as compared to fiscal 1996 and 1995. Approximately $524 million was
expended by the Company in fiscal 1997 (net of proceeds from sale of leasehold,
equipment and other), as compared to $344 million in fiscal 1996, an increase of
$180 million, or approximately 52%. In fiscal 1995 the Company expended $113
million (net of proceeds from sale of leasehold, equipment and other). Net cash
proceeds received by the Company for sales of oil and gas equipment, leasehold
and other decreased to approximately $3.1 million in fiscal 1997 as compared to
$6.2 million in fiscal 1996 and $12.0 million in fiscal 1995. In fiscal 1997,
other property and equipment additions were $34 million primarily as a result of
its $16.8 million investment in the Louisiana Chalk Gathering System and Masters
Creek Gas Plant as well as the purchase of additional office buildings,
improvements and related equipment in Oklahoma City.
 
     Cash Flows from Financing Activities. On December 2, 1996, the Company
completed a public offering of 8,972,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of
$33.63 per share resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately
$288.1 million. Approximately $55.0 million of the proceeds was used to defease
the Company's $47.5 million Senior Notes due 2001, and $11.2 million of the
proceeds was used to retire all amounts outstanding under the Company's
commercial bank credit facilities.
 
                                       26

     On March 17, 1997, the Company concluded the sale of $150 million of 7.875%
Senior Notes due 2004 (the "7.875% Senior Notes"), and $150 million of 8.5%
Senior Notes due 2012 (the "8.5% Senior Notes"), which offering resulted in net
proceeds to the Company of approximately $292.6 million. The 7.875% Senior Notes
were issued at 99.92% of par and the 8.5% Senior Notes were issued at 99.414% of
par. The 7.875% Senior Notes and the 8.5% Senior Notes are redeemable at the
option of the Company at any time at the redemption or make-whole prices set
forth in the respective Indentures. In April 1997 the Company terminated its
commercial bank facilities.
 
     In fiscal 1996, cash flows from financing activities were $219.5 million,
largely as the result of the issuance of 5,989,500 shares of Common Stock (net
proceeds to the Company of approximately $99.4 million) and $120 million of
9.125% Senior Notes due 2006 (the "9.125% Senior Notes"). The Company may, at
its option, redeem prior to April 15, 1999 up to $42 million principal amount of
the 9.125% Senior Notes at 109.125% of the principal amount thereof from equity
offering proceeds. The 9.125% Senior Notes are redeemable at the option of the
Company at any time at the redemption or make-whole prices set forth in the
Indenture.
 
     Financial Flexibility and Liquidity. The Company had working capital of
approximately $151.3 million at June 30, 1997. During fiscal 1997, the Company
invested in a number of oil and gas related businesses and projects. The most
significant of these was the Company's initial investment made in Bayard,
consisting of an $18 million subordinated note and $7 million of common stock.
In August 1997, the Company entered into an agreement with Bayard to invest up
to an additional $9 million and convert certain options, warrants and note
amounts that will facilitate a potential initial public offering by Bayard. On
August 27, 1997 Bayard filed a registration statement for an initial public
offering of its common stock. Chesapeake, subsequent to the completion of the
transaction noted above, will own 4,194,000 shares of Bayard common stock (30.4%
of the common stock outstanding) and anticipates selling substantially all of
its ownership in Bayard in the IPO (assuming the over-allotment option is
exercised) and receiving repayment of the subordinated note. If successful,
assuming the sale of all of the Company's Bayard stock, and based on the initial
filing price of Bayard at $15 per share, the Company would receive total
proceeds of approximately $74 million (net of offering costs) and realize a
pre-tax gain of approximately $40 million. No assurance can be given, however,
that Bayard will successfully complete the initial public offering of its common
stock, at what price, or that the net proceeds or pre-tax gain discussed above
will be realized by the Company.
 
     The Company also made investments in Louisiana Trend gas gathering and
processing facilities which it may sell during fiscal 1998. These investments
include a 50% interest in the Louisiana Austin Chalk Gathering System, and a
15.5% interest in the Masters Creek Gas Plant. If the Company decides to sell
these investments, the Company expects that the proceeds should exceed the
Company's cost basis of $16.8 million as of June 30, 1997.
 
     The Company currently maintains no commercial bank credit facilities
because of its substantial working capital position, anticipated proceeds from
the sale of the investments described above, and expected cash flows from
operations as compared to the fiscal 1998 capital expenditure budget. Although
the Senior Note Indentures contain various restrictions on additional
indebtedness, based on asset values as of June 30, 1997, the Company estimates
it could borrow up to approximately $100 million of commercial bank debt within
these restrictions.
 
     Debt ratings for the Senior Notes are Ba3 by Moody's Investors Service and
BB- by Standard & Poors Corporation as of September 30, 1997. The Company's
long-term debt represented approximately 64% of total capital at June 30, 1997.
There are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the Senior Notes
until June 2002. The Company's goal is to achieve an equity to capital ratio of
at least 50% and to increase its credit ratings, ultimately achieving an
investment grade debt rating.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
 
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
of Chesapeake Energy Corporation
 
     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chesapeake
Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 1997 and 1996, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
 
     We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
 
     In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Chesapeake
Energy Corporation and its subsidiaries as of June 30, 1997 and 1996, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
  Description of Company
 
     The Company is a U.S. petroleum exploration and production company engaged
in the acquisition, exploration, and development of properties for the
production of crude oil and natural gas from underground reservoirs. The
Company's properties are located primarily in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma,
Montana, North Dakota and New Mexico.
 
  Principles of Consolidation
 
     The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Chesapeake Energy
Corporation (the "Company" or "Parent") include the accounts of Chesapeake
Operating, Inc. ("COI"), Chesapeake Exploration Limited Partnership ("CEX"), a
limited partnership, Chesapeake Louisiana, L.P. ("CLLP"), a limited partnership,
Chesapeake Gas Development Corporation ("CGDC"), Chesapeake Energy Marketing,
Inc. ("CEMI"), Chesapeake Canada Corporation ("CCC"), Chesapeake Energy
Louisiana Corporation ("CELC"), Lindsay Oil Field Supply, Inc.("LOF"), Sander
Trucking Company, Inc. ("STCO") and subsidiaries of those entities. As of June
30, 1997, CGDC had been merged into CEX and LOF and STCO had been dissolved. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.
 
  Accounting Estimates
 
     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
  Cash Equivalents
 
     For purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the Company
considers investments in all highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of
three months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.
 
  Investments
 
     The Company invests in various equity securities and short-term debt
instruments including corporate bonds and auction preferreds, commercial paper
and government agency notes. The Company has classified all of its short-term
investments in equity and debt instruments as trading securities, which are
carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in
earnings. At June 30, 1997, the Company had an unrealized holding loss of $0.6
million included in interest and other revenue. At June 30, 1996 the Company had
no trading securities. Investments in equity securities and limited partnerships
that do not have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost and are
included in noncurrent other assets. In determining realized gains and losses,
the cost of securities sold is based on the average cost method.
 
  Inventory
 
     Inventory consists primarily of tubular goods and other lease and well
equipment which the Company plans to utilize in its ongoing exploration and
development activities and is carried at the lower of cost or market using the
specific identification method.
 
  Oil and Gas Properties
 
     The Company follows the full cost method of accounting under which all
costs associated with property acquisition, exploration and development
activities are capitalized. The Company capitalizes internal costs
 
                                       37

           NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
 
that can be directly identified with its acquisition, exploration and
development activities and does not include any costs related to production,
general corporate overhead or similar activities (see Note 11). Capitalized
costs are amortized on a composite unit-of-production method based on proved oil
and gas reserves. The Company's oil and gas reserves are estimated annually by
independent petroleum engineers as well as the Company's internal engineers. The
average composite rates used for depreciation, depletion and amortization were
$1.31, $0.85 and $0.80 per equivalent Mcf in 1997, 1996, and 1995, respectively.
Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions to
capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the
relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying
value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The
costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties
are evaluated. The Company reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas
properties under the full cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange
Commission on a quarterly basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs, less
accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, shall not exceed an
amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues
less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing
the proved reserves, less any related income tax effects. At June 30, 1997,
capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the estimated present value
of future net revenues from the Company's proved reserves, net of related income
tax considerations, resulting in a fourth quarter writedown in the carrying
value of oil and gas properties of $236 million.
 
  Other Property and Equipment
 
     Other property and equipment consists primarily of gas gathering and
processing facilities, vehicles, land, office buildings and equipment, and
software. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized while the costs of
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of assets
retired or otherwise disposed of and the applicable accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in
operations. Other property and equipment costs are depreciated on both
straight-line and accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which range from three to 30 years.
 
  Leases
 
     The Company has various operating leases primarily for transportation
equipment and field offices. Minimum lease payments under these operating leases
are as follows ($ in thousands):

  Capitalized Interest
 
     During fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, interest of approximately $12,935,000,
$6,428,000 and $1,574,000 was capitalized on significant investments in unproved
properties that are not being currently depreciated, depleted, or amortized and
on which exploration activities are in progress.
 
  Service Operations
 
     Certain subsidiaries of the Company performed contractual services on wells
the Company operated as well as for third parties until June 30, 1996. Oil and
gas service operations revenues and costs and expenses reflected in the
accompanying consolidated statements of operations include amounts derived from
certain of

the contractual services provided. The Company's economic interest in its oil
and gas properties is not affected by the performance of these contractual
services and all intercompany profits have been eliminated.
 
     On June 30, 1996, Peak USA Energy Services, Ltd., a limited partnership
("Peak"), was formed by Peak Oilfield Services Company (a joint venture between
Cook Inlet Region, Inc. and Nabors Industries, Inc.) and the Company for the
purpose of purchasing the Company's oilfield service assets and providing rig
moving, transportation and related site construction services. The Company sold
its service company assets to Peak for $6.4 million, and simultaneously invested
$2.5 million in exchange for a 33.3% partnership interest in Peak. This
transaction resulted in recognition of a $1.8 million pre-tax gain during the
fourth fiscal quarter of 1996 reported in Interest and other. A deferred gain
from the sale of service company assets of $0.9 million was recorded as a
reduction in the Company's investment in Peak and will be amortized to income
over the estimated useful lives of the Peak assets. The Company's investment in
Peak is accounted for using the equity method.
 
  Income Taxes
 
     The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes ("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109 requires deferred tax
liabilities or assets to be recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of
temporary differences that arise as a result of the differences in the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.
 
  Net Income (Loss) Per Share
 
     Primary and fully diluted earnings (loss) per share for all periods have
been computed based upon the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock
outstanding after giving retroactive effect to all stock splits and the issuance
of common stock equivalents when their effect is dilutive. Dilutive options or
warrants which are issued during a period or which expire or are cancelled
during a period are reflected in both primary and fully diluted earnings per
share computations for the time they were outstanding during the period being
reported upon.
 
     In February 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share ("SFAS 128"). SFAS
128 requires presentation of "basic" and "diluted" earnings per share, as
defined, on the face of the statement of operations for all entities with
complex capital structures. SFAS 128 is effective for financial statements
issued for periods ending after December 15, 1997 and requires restatement of
all prior period earnings per share amounts. The Company does not believe that
SFAS 128 will have a material impact on its earnings per share when adopted.
 
Gas Imbalances -- Revenue Recognition
 
     Revenues from the sale of oil and gas production are recognized when title
passes, net of royalties. The Company follows the "sales method" of accounting
for its gas revenue whereby the Company recognizes sales revenue on all gas sold
to its purchasers, regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to the
Company's ownership in the property. A liability is recognized only to the
extent that the Company has a net imbalance in excess of the reserves on the
underlying properties. The Company's net imbalance positions at June 30, 1997
and 1996 were not material.
 
  Hedging
 
     The Company periodically uses certain instruments to hedge its exposure to
price fluctuations on oil and natural gas transactions. Recognized gains and
losses on hedge contracts are reported as a component of the related
transaction. Results for hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales
to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas production (see Note 10).

  Debt Issue Costs
 
     Other assets include debt issue costs associated with the issuance of the
10.5% Senior Notes on May 25, 1995, the 9.125% Senior Notes on April 9, 1996,
and the 7.875% and 8.5% Senior Notes on March 17, 1997 (see Note 2). The
remaining unamortized costs on these issuances of Senior Notes at June 30, 1997
totaled $12.5 million and are being amortized over the life of the Senior Notes.
 
  Stock Options
 
     In October 1995, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation". As permitted by
SFAS 123, the Company has continued its previous method of accounting for stock
compensation and has adopted the disclosure requirements of this Statement in
fiscal 1997.
 
  Reclassifications
 
     Certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial
statements for the years ended June 30, 1996 and 1995 to conform to the
presentation used for the June 30, 1997 consolidated financial statements.
 
2. SENIOR NOTES
 
     On March 17, 1997, the Company issued $150 million principal amount of
7.875% Senior Notes due 2004 ("7.875% Senior Notes"). The 7.875% Senior Notes

determined in accordance with the indenture.
 
     On March 17, 1997, the Company issued $150 million principal amount of 8.5%
Senior Notes due 2012 ("8.5% Senior Notes"). The 8.5% Senior Notes are
redeemable at the option of the Company at any time at the make-whole prices

the redemption price set forth therein.
 
     On April 9, 1996, the Company issued $120 million principal amount of
9.125% Senior Notes due 2006 ("9.125% Senior Notes"). The 9.125% Senior Notes
are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time prior to April 15, 2001
at the make-whole prices determined in accordance with the indenture and on or
after April 15, 2001, at the redemption prices set forth therein. The Company
may also redeem at its option at any time on or prior to April 15, 1999 up to
$42 million of the 9.125% Senior Notes at 109.125% of the principal amount
thereof with the proceeds of an equity offering.
 
     On May 25, 1995, the Company issued $90 million principal amount of 10.5%
Senior Notes due 2002 ("10.5% Senior Notes"). The 10.5% Senior Notes are
redeemable at the option of the Company at any time on or after June 1, 1999.
The Company may also redeem at its option at any time on or prior to June 1,
1998 up to $30 million of the 10.5% Senior Notes at 110% of the principal amount
thereof with the proceeds of an equity offering.
 
     The Company is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no
significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. The Company's
obligations under the 10.5% Senior Notes, the 9.125% Senior Notes, the 7.875%
Senior Notes and the 8.5% Senior Notes have been fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each of the Company's "Restricted
Subsidiaries" (as defined in the respective indentures governing the Senior
Notes) (collectively, the "Guarantor Subsidiaries"). Each of the Guarantor
Subsidiaries is a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
     The 10.5%, 9.125%, 7.875% and 8.5% Senior Note Indentures contain certain
covenants, including covenants limiting the Company and the Guarantor
Subsidiaries with respect to asset sales; restricted payments; the incurrence of
additional indebtedness and the issuance of preferred stock; liens; sale and
 
                                       40

leaseback transactions; lines of business; dividend and other payment
restrictions affecting Guarantor Subsidiaries; mergers or consolidations; and
transactions with affiliates. The Company is obligated to repurchase the 10.5%
and 9.125% Senior Notes in the event of a change of control or certain asset
sales.
 
     Set forth below are condensed consolidating financial statements of the
Guarantor Subsidiaries, the Company's subsidiaries which are not guarantors of
the Senior Notes (the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries") and the Company. Separate
audited financial statements of each Guarantor Subsidiary have not been provided
because management has determined that they are not material to investors.
 
     As of and for the year ended June 30, 1997, the Guarantor Subsidiaries were
COI, CEX, CLLP, CELC and CGDC, and the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were CEMI and
CCC. Prior to fiscal 1997, the Guarantor Subsidiaries were COI, CEX and two
service company subsidiaries the assets of which were sold effective June 30,
1996, and the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries were CGDC and CEMI (which was acquired
in December 1995).

4. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS
 
     The Company and certain of its officers and directors are currently
involved in various purported class actions alleging violations of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The plaintiffs assert that the defendants made
materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material facts
about the success of the Company's exploration efforts, principally in the
Louisiana Trend. As a result, the complaints allege, the price of the Company's
common stock was artificially inflated during periods beginning as early as
January 25, 1996 and ending on June 27, 1997, when the Company issued a press
release announcing disappointing drilling results in the Louisiana Trend and a
full-cost ceiling writedown to be reflected in its June 30, 1997 financial
statements. The plaintiffs further allege that certain of the named individual
defendants sold common stock during the class period when they knew or should
have known adverse nonpublic information. Each case seeks a determination that
the suit is a proper class action, certification of the plaintiff as a class
representative and damages in an unspecified amount, together with costs of
litigation, including attorneys' fees. The Company and the individual defendants
believe that these actions are without merit, and intend to defend against them
vigorously.
 
     On October 15, 1996, Union Pacific Resources Company ("UPRC") filed suit
against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Texas, Fort Worth Division alleging (a) infringement and inducing infringement
of UPRC's claim to a patent (the "UPRC Patent") for an invention involving a
method of maintaining a borehole in a stratigraphic zone during drilling, and
(b) tortious interference with certain business relations between UPRC and
certain of its former employees. UPRC's claims against the Company are based on
services provided by a third party vendor to the Company. UPRC is seeking
injunctive relief, damages of an unspecified amount, including actual, enhanced,
consequential and punitive damages, interest, costs and attorneys' fees. The
Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to UPRC's allegations and has
requested the court to declare the UPRC Patent invalid. The Company has also
filed a motion to limit the scope of UPRC's claims and for summary judgment. No
prediction can be made as to the outcome of the matter.
 
     The Company is currently involved in various other routine disputes
incidental to its business operations. While it is not possible to determine the
ultimate disposition of these matters, management, after consultation with legal
counsel, is of the opinion that the final resolution of all such currently
pending or threatened litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect
on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.
 
     The Company has employment contracts with its two principal shareholders
and its chief financial officer and various other senior management personnel
which provide for annual base salaries, bonus compensation and various benefits.
The contracts provide for the continuation of salary and benefits for the
respective terms of the agreements in the event of termination of employment
without cause. These agreements expire at various times from June 30, 1998
through June 30, 2000.
 
     Due to the nature of the oil and gas business, the Company and its
subsidiaries are exposed to possible environmental risks. The Company has
implemented various policies and procedures to avoid environmental contamination
and risks from environmental contamination. The Company is not aware of any
potential material environmental issues or claims.
 
     As of June 30, 1997, the Company had guaranteed $1.3 million of debt owed
by Peak.

</TABLE>
 
     SFAS 109 requires that the Company record a valuation allowance when it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997, the Company recorded a
$236 million write-down related to the impairment of oil and gas properties.
This write-down and significant tax net operating loss carryforwards (caused
primarily by expensing intangible drilling costs for tax purposes) result in a
net deferred tax asset at June 30, 1997. Management believes it is more likely
than not that the Company will generate future tax net operating losses for at
least the next five years, based in part on the Company's continued drilling
efforts. Therefore, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance equal to the
net deferred tax asset.

     At June 30, 1997, the Company had regular tax net operating loss
carryforwards of approximately $300 million and alternative minimum tax net
operating loss carryforwards of approximately $45 million. These loss
carryforward amounts will expire during the years 2007 through 2012. The Company
also had a percentage depletion carryforward of approximately $2.8 million at
June 30, 1997, which is available to offset future federal income taxes payable
and has no expiration date.
 
     In accordance with certain provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, a
change of greater than 50% of the beneficial ownership of the Company within a
three-year period (an "Ownership Change") would place an annual limitation on
the Company's ability to utilize its existing tax carryforwards. Under
regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the Company has had an
Ownership Change. However, management believes this will not result in a
significant limitation of the utilization of the tax carryforwards.
 
6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
     Certain directors, shareholders and employees of the Company have acquired
working interests in certain of the Company's oil and gas properties. The owners
of such working interests are required to pay their proportionate share of all
costs. As of June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995 the Company had accounts receivable
for these costs of $7.4 million, $2.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
 
     During fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995 the Company incurred legal expenses of
$207,000, $347,000 and $516,000, respectively, for legal services provided by
the law firm of which a director is a member.
 
7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
 
     The Company maintains the Chesapeake Energy Corporation Savings and
Incentive Stock Bonus Plan, a 401(k) profit sharing plan. Eligible employees may
make voluntary contributions to the plan which are matched by the Company up to
10% of the employees' annual salary with the Company's common stock. The amount
of employee contributions is limited as specified in the plan. The Company may,
at its discretion, make additional contributions to the plan. The Company
contributed $603,000, $187,000 and $95,000 to the plan during the fiscal years
ended June 30, 1997, 1996 and 1995, respectively.

9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION
 
     On December 2, 1996, the Company completed a public offering of 8,972,000
shares of Common Stock at a price of $33.63 per share, which resulted in net
proceeds to the Company of approximately $288.1 million.
 
     On April 12, 1996 the Company completed a public offering of 5,989,500
shares of Common Stock at a price of $17.67 per share, resulting in net proceeds
to the Company of approximately $99.4 million.
 
     A 2-for-1 stock split of the Common Stock in December 1994, a 3-for-2 stock
split of the Common Stock in December 1995 and June 1996, and a 2-for-1 stock
split of the Common Stock in December 1996 have been given retroactive effect in
these financial statements.
 
  Stock Option Plans
 
     Under the Company's 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "ISO Plan"),
options to purchase Common Stock may be granted only to employees of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Subject to any adjustment as provided by the ISO Plan, the
aggregate number of shares which may be issued and sold may not exceed 3,762,000
shares. The maximum period for exercise of an option may not be more than ten
years (or five years for an optionee who owns more than 10% of the Common Stock)
from the date of grant, and the exercise price may not be less than the fair
market value of the shares underlying the options on the date of grant (or 110%
of such value for an optionee who owns more than 10% of the Common Stock).
Options granted become exercisable at dates determined by the Stock Option
Committee of the Board of Directors. No options may be granted under the ISO
Plan after December 16, 1994.
 
     Under the Company's 1992 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (the "NSO Plan"),
non-qualified options to purchase Common Stock may be granted only to directors
and consultants of the Company. Subject to any adjustment as provided by the NSO
Plan, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued and sold may not exceed
3,132,000 shares. The maximum period for exercise of an option may not be more
than ten years from the date of grant, and the exercise price may not be less
than the fair market value of the shares underlying the options on the date of
grant. Options granted become exercisable at dates determined by the Stock
Option Committee of the Board of Directors. No options may be granted under the
NSO Plan after December 10, 2002.
 
     Under the Company's 1994 Stock Option Plan (the "1994 Plan"), and its 1996
Stock Option Plan (the "1996 Plan"), incentive and nonqualified stock options to
purchase Common Stock may be granted to employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Subject to any adjustment as provided by the respective plans, the
aggregate number of shares which may be issued and sold may not exceed 4,886,910
shares under the 1994 Plan and 6,000,000 shares under the 1996 Plan. The maximum
period for exercise of an option may not be more than ten years from the date of
grant, and the exercise price may not be less than the fair market value of the
shares underlying the options on the date of grant. Options granted become
exercisable at dates determined by the Stock Option Committee of the Board of
Directors. No options may be granted under the 1994 Plan after December 16, 2004
or under the 1996 Plan after October 14, 2006.
 
     The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued
to Employees and related Interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
options. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recognized for the difference
between the option price and market value on the measurement date. No
compensation expense has been recognized because the exercise price of the stock
options equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant.
 
     Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of the Statement. The
fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for fiscal 1997 and 1996, respectively:

interest rates (zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining life equal
to the expected term of the options) of 6.74% and 6.21%; dividend yields of 0.9%
and 0.9%; volatility factors of the expected market price of the Company's
common stock of .60 and .60; and weighted-average expected life of the options
of four years.
 
     The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in
estimating the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions
and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the
input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price
volatility. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics
significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the
subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in
management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable
single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.
 
     The Company's pro forma information follows:

     For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period, which is four
years. Because the Company's stock options vest generally over four years and
additional awards are typically made each year, the above pro forma disclosures
are not likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma net income for
future years. A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related

     The exercise of certain stock options results in state and federal income
tax benefits to the Company related to the difference between the market price
of the Common Stock at the date of disposition (or sale) and the option price.
During fiscal 1997, 1996 and 1995, $4,808,000, $7,950,000 and $1,229,000,
respectively, were recorded as adjustments to additional paid-in capital and
deferred income taxes with respect to such tax benefits.
 
10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
 
     The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial
instruments, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119
"Disclosure About Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial
Instruments" and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company's objective
is to hedge a portion of its exposure to price volatility from producing crude
oil and natural gas. These arrangements may expose the Company to credit risk
from its counterparties and to basis risk. The Company does not expect that the
counterparties will fail to meet their obligations given their high credit
ratings.
 
  Hedging Activities
 
     Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of
a portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include (1)
swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which the Company
pays the counterparty and below which the Company is paid by the counterparty,
(2) the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor" price below
which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by which the price of the
commodity is below the contracted floor, (3) the sale of index-related calls
that provide for a "ceiling" price above which the Company pays the counterparty
the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling,
and (4) basis protection swaps. Results from hedging transactions are reflected
in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas
production. The Company has not entered into hedging transactions unrelated to
the Company's oil and gas production or physical purchase or sale commitments.

     The Company entered into gas swap arrangements to cancel the effect of the
swaps for the months of July through October at an average price of $2.133 per
MMBtu.
 
     The Company has entered into a curve lock for 4.9 Bcf of gas which allows
the Company the option to hedge April 1999 through November 1999 gas based upon
a negative $0.285 differential to December 1998 gas any time between the strike
date and December 1998.
 
     Gains or losses on the crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are
recognized as price adjustments in the month of related production. The Company
estimates that had all of the crude oil and natural gas swap agreements in
effect for production periods beginning July 1, 1997 terminated on June 30,
1997, based on the closing prices for NYMEX futures contracts as of that date,
the Company would have paid the counterparty approximately $185,000, which would
have represented the "fair value" at that date. These agreements were not
terminated. The fair value of hedging instruments at June 30, 1996 was a loss of
approximately $4.6 million.
 
     Periodically, the Company's oil and gas marketing subsidiary CEMI enters
into various hedging transactions designed to hedge against physical purchase
commitments made by CEMI. Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded as
adjustments to Oil and Gas Marketing Sales in the consolidated statements of
operations and are not considered by management to be material.
 
  Concentration of Credit Risk
 
     Other financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, short-term
investments in debt instruments and trade receivables. The Company's accounts
receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas products and
exploration and production companies which own interests in properties operated
by the Company. The industry concentration has the potential to impact the
Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in
that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or
other conditions. The Company generally requires letters of credit for
receivables from customers which are not considered

investment grade, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. The cash
and investments in debt securities are with major banks or institutions with
high credit ratings.
 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
     The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial
instruments is made in accordance with the requirements of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of
Financial Instruments". The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by
the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies.
Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions or valuation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.
 
     The carrying values of items comprising current assets and current
liabilities approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of these
instruments. The carrying value of financial instruments included in noncurrent
other assets approximates fair value at June 30, 1997. The Company estimates the
fair value of its long-term, fixed-rate debt using quoted market prices. The
Company's carrying amount for such debt at June 30, 1997 and 1996 was $508.9
million and $255.6 million, respectively, compared to approximate fair values of
$514.1 million and $261.2 million, respectively. The carrying value of other
long-term debt approximates its fair value as interest rates are primarily
variable, based on prevailing market rates.

     Unproved properties not subject to amortization at June 30, 1997 and 1996
consisted mainly of lease acquisition costs. The Company capitalized
approximately $12,935,000 and $6,428,000 of interest during the years ended June
30, 1997 and 1996 on significant investments in unproved properties that were
not being depreciated, depleted, or amortized and on which exploration or
development activities were not in progress. The Company will continue to
evaluate its unevaluated properties, however, the timing of the ultimate
evaluation and disposition of the properties has not been determined.

approximately 50.0%, 0.6% and 0.5% of total proved reserves as of June 30, 1997,
1996 and 1995, respectively. The information is presented in accordance with
regulations prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company
emphasizes that reserve estimates are inherently imprecise. The Company's
reserve estimates were generally based upon extrapolation of historical
production trends, analogy to similar properties and volumetric calculations.
Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change, and such changes could be
material, as future information becomes available.
 
     Proved oil and gas reserves represent the estimated quantities of crude
oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved
developed oil and gas reserves are those expected to be recovered through
existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. All of the
Company's oil and gas reserves are located in the United States.
 
     Presented below is a summary of changes in estimated reserves of the
Company based upon the reports prepared by Williamson and the Company's
petroleum engineers for 1997, 1996 and 1995:

     As of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, the Company recorded revisions
to the previous years' reserve estimates of approximately six million barrels of
oil and 138 million Mcf, or approximately 174 Bcfe. The reserve revisions are
primarily attributable to the decrease in oil and gas pricing between periods,
escalating development costs at June 30, 1997, and unfavorable developmental
drilling and production results during fiscal 1997. Specifically, the Company
recorded downward adjustments to proved reserves of 159 Bcfe in the Knox,
Giddings and Louisiana Trend areas.
 
     On April 30, 1996, the Company purchased interests in certain producing and
non-producing oil and gas properties, including approximately 14,000 net acres
of unevaluated leasehold, from Amerada Hess Corporation for $37.8 million. The
properties are located in the Knox and Golden Trend fields of southern Oklahoma,
most of which are operated by the Company. In fiscal 1996 the reserves acquired
from Amerada Hess Corporation were included in both "Extensions, discoveries and
other additions" and "Purchase of reserves in-place". The fiscal 1996
presentation has been restated in the current year to remove the acquired
reserves from "Extensions, discoveries and other additions" with a corresponding
offset to "Revisions of previous estimate". This revision resulted in no net
change to total oil and gas reserves.
 
     In prior years, the Company reported "Extensions, discoveries and other
additions" net of current year production related thereto. The Company began
reporting this category inclusive of current year production in fiscal 1997 and
restated fiscal 1996 and fiscal 1995 quantities accordingly. A corresponding
change in fiscal

1996 and fiscal 1995 was recorded to "Revisions of previous estimate" with no
net change to year-end reserve quantities.
 
  Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (unaudited)
 
     Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69 ("SFAS 69") prescribes
guidelines for computing a standardized measure of future net cash flows and
changes therein relating to estimated proved reserves. The Company has followed
these guidelines which are briefly discussed below.
 
     Future cash inflows and future production and development costs are
determined by applying year-end prices and costs to the estimated quantities of
oil and gas to be produced. Estimates are made of quantities of proved reserves
and the future periods during which they are expected to be produced based on
year-end economic conditions. Estimated future income taxes are computed using
current statutory income tax rates including consideration for the current tax
basis of the properties and related carryforwards, giving effect to permanent
differences and tax credits. The resulting future net cash flows are reduced to
present value amounts by applying a 10% annual discount factor.
 
     The assumptions used to compute the standardized measure are those
prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and, as such, do not
necessarily reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenue to be derived
from those reserves nor their present worth. The limitations inherent in the
reserve quantity estimation process, as discussed previously, are equally
applicable to the standardized measure computations since these estimates are
the basis for the valuation process.
 
     The following summary sets forth the Company's future net cash flows
relating to proved oil and gas reserves based on the standardized measure
prescribed in SFAS 69:

(a) Total revenue excluding interest and other income, less total costs and
    expenses excluding interest and other expense.
 
     Capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred
income taxes, can not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of
estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred
in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax
effects. At June 30, 1997, capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded
the estimated present value of future net revenues for the Company's proved
reserves, net of related income tax considerations, resulting in a fourth
quarter writedown in the carrying value of oil and gas properties of $236
million.

                         CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION
                             1996 STOCK OPTION PLAN

                    WHEREAS, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (the "Company")
presently has in existence the Chesapeake Energy Corporation 1996 Stock Option
Plan (the "Plan"); and

                    WHEREAS, the Plan provides in Section 3.1 that it will
consist of two separate stock option plans, a "Non-Executive Officer
Participant Plan" which is limited to Non-Executive Officer Participants and
administered by the Regular Stock Option Committee together with an "Executive
Officer Participant Plan" which is limited to Executive Officer Participants
and administered by the Special Stock Option Committee; and

                    WHEREAS, the Board of Directors has previously administered
the Executive Officer Participant Plan by authorizing option grants to Aubrey
K. McClendon and Tom L. Ward, the first of such option grants being made on
December 13, 1996; and

                    WHEREAS, the Board has the authority to amend the Plan to
permit administration of the Executive Officer Plan, previously exercised such
authority by its actual administration of the Executive Officer Plan but did
not formalize such amendment to the Plan; and

                    WHEREAS, the Board deems it advisable to formalize an
amendment to the Plan effective as of December 13, 1996, to permit
administration of the Executive Officer Plan by either the Special Stock Option
Committee or the full Board of Directors; and

                    WHEREAS the Board of Directors of the Company has
authorized and approved this Amendment to the Plan pursuant to resolutions
adopted on August 21, 1997;

<PAGE>   2
                    The Non-Executive Officer Participant Plan shall be
                    administered by the Regular Stock Option Committee and the
                    Executive Officer Participant Plan shall be administered by
                    either (1) the Special Stock Option Committee or (ii) the
                    Board.  Accordingly, with respect to decisions relating to
                    Non-Executive Officer Participants, including the grant of
                    Options, the term "Committee" shall mean only the Regular
                    Stock Option Committee; and, with respect to all decisions
                    relating to the Executive Officer Participants, including
                    the grant of Options, the term "Committee" shall mean
                    either the Special Stock Option Committee or the Board.

2.       Effective Date.  Except as provided in this Amendment, in all other
respects the Plan is hereby ratified and confirmed.  The effective date of this
Amendment shall be as of December 13, 1996.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         THIS AGREEMENT is made effective July 1, 1997, between CHESAPEAKE
ENERGY CORPORATION, an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), and J. MARK
LESTER, an individual (the "Executive") and replaces and supersedes that
certain Employment Agreement between Company and Executive dated July 1, 1995.

                             W I T N E S S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to retain the services of the Executive
and the Executive desires to make the Executive's services available to the
Company.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein
contained, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:

1.       Employment.  The Company hereby employs the Executive and the
Executive hereby accepts such employment subject to the terms and conditions
contained in this Agreement.  The Executive is engaged as an employee of the
Company, and the Executive and the Company do not intend to create a joint
venture, partnership or other relationship which might impose a fiduciary
obligation on the Executive or the Company in the performance of this
Agreement.

2.       Executive's Duties.  The Executive is employed on a full-time basis.
Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Executive will use the Executive's
best efforts and due diligence to assist the Company in achieving the most
profitable operation of the Company and the Company's affiliated entities
consistent with developing and maintaining a quality business operation.

         2.1     Specific Duties.  The Executive will serve as Senior Vice
                 President - Exploration for the Company.  The Executive will
                 perform all of the services required to fully and faithfully
                 execute the office and position to which the Executive is
                 appointed and such other services as may be reasonably
                 requested by the Executive's supervisor. During the term of
                 this Agreement, the Executive may be nominated for election or
                 appointed to serve as a director or officer of the Company's
                 subsidiaries as determined in the board of directors' sole
                 discretion.

         2.2     Supervision.  The services of the Executive will be requested
                 and directed by the President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr.
                 Tom L. Ward,  and the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Aubrey K.
                 McClendon.

         2.3     Rules and Regulations.  The Company currently has an
                 Employment Policies Manual which addresses frequently asked
                 questions regarding the

                                      1
<PAGE>   5
                 Company. The Executive agrees to comply with the Employment
                 Policies Manual except to the extent inconsistent with this
                 Agreement.  The Employment Policies Manual is subject to
                 change without notice in the sole discretion of the Company at
                 any time.

         2.4     Stock Investment. For each calendar year during which this
                 Agreement is in effect, the Executive agrees to hold shares of
                 the Company's common stock having aggregate Investment Value
                 equal to fifteen percent (15%) of the compensation paid to the
                 Executive under paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement
                 during such calendar year.  For purposes of this section, the
                 "Investment Value" of each share of stock will be the higher
                 of either (a) the price paid by the Executive for such share
                 as part of an open market purchase; or (b) the fair market
                 value on the date of exercise for shares acquired through the
                 exercise of employee stock options.  Any shares of common
                 stock acquired by the Executive prior to the date of this
                 Agreement and still owned by the Executive during the term of
                 this Agreement may be used to satisfy this requirement to
                 acquire common stock.  The Investment Value for previously
                 acquired stock shall be calculated using the average stock
                 price during the first six months of this Agreement.

                 The stock acquired or owned pursuant to this paragraph 2.4
                 must be held by the Executive at all times during the
                 Executive's employment by the Company or the Company's
                 affiliated entities.  In order to administer this provision,
                 the Executive agrees to return to the Company's Chief
                 Executive Officer a semi-annual report of purchases and
                 ownership in a form prepared by the Company.  This paragraph
                 will become null and void if the Company's common stock ceases
                 to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on the National
                 Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System.
                 The Company has no obligation to sell or to purchase from the
                 Executive any of the Company's stock in connection with this
                 paragraph 2.4 and has made no representations or warranties
                 regarding the Company's stock, operations or financial
                 condition.

3.       Other Activities.  Unless the Executive has obtained the prior written
approval of the board of directors of the Company, the Executive will not: (a)
engage in business independent of the Executive's employment by the Company;
(b) serve as an officer, general partner or member in any corporation,
partnership, company, or firm; (c) directly or indirectly invest in,
participate in or acquire an interest in any oil and gas business, including,
without limitation, (i) producing oil and gas,  (ii) drilling, owning or
operating oil and gas leases or wells, (iii) providing services or materials to
the oil and gas industry, (iv) marketing or refining oil or gas, or (v) owning
any interest in any corporation, partnership, company or entity which conducts
any of the foregoing activities. The limitation in this paragraph 3 will not
prohibit an investment by the Executive in publicly traded securities; or the
continued direct ownership and operation of oil and gas interests and leases to
the extent such interests were owned by the Executive on July 1, 1995. The
Executive agrees not to directly or indirectly acquire any additional oil

                                      2
<PAGE>   6
and gas interests or increase ownership of any oil and gas interests owned by
the Executive on July 1, 1995.

4.       Executive's Compensation.  The Company agrees to compensate the
Executive as follows:

         4.1     Base Salary.  A base salary (the "Base Salary"), at the
                 initial annual rate of not less than One Hundred Sixty
                 Thousand Dollars ($160,000.00), will be paid to the Executive
                 in equal semi-monthly installments beginning July 15, 1997
                 during the term of this Agreement.

         4.2     Bonus.  In addition to the Base Salary described at paragraph
                 4.1 of this Agreement, the Company may periodically pay bonus
                 compensation to the Executive.  Any bonus compensation will be
                 at the absolute discretion of the Company in such amounts and
                 at such times as the board of directors of the Company may
                 determine.

         4.3     Stock Options.  In addition to the compensation set forth in
                 paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement, the Executive may
                 periodically receive grants of stock options from the
                 Company's various stock option plans, subject to the terms and
                 conditions thereof.

         4.4     Benefits.  The Company will provide the Executive such
                 retirement benefits, reimbursement of reasonable expenditures
                 for dues, travel and entertainment and such other benefits as
                 are customarily provided by the Company and as are set forth
                 in the Company's Employment Policies Manual.  The Company will
                 also provide the Executive the opportunity to apply for
                 coverage under the Company's medical, life and disability
                 plans, if any.  If the Executive is accepted for coverage
                 under such plans, the Company will provide such coverage on
                 the same terms as is customarily provided by the Company to
                 the plan participants as modified from time to time.  The
                 following specific benefits will also be provided to the
                 Executive at the expense of the Company:

                 4.4.1    Vacation.  The Executive will be entitled to take
                          three (3) weeks of paid vacation each twelve (12)
                          months during the term of this Agreement.  No
                          additional compensation will be paid for failure to
                          take vacation and no vacation may be carried forward

                          Oklahoma City area selected by the Executive in an

                          limitation, any initiation costs, initial membership
                          costs, personal use and business entertainment
                          unrelated to the Company will be the sole obligation
                          of the Executive and the Company will have no
                          liability with respect to such amounts.

                 4.4.3    Compensation Review.  The compensation of the
                          Executive will be reviewed not less frequently than
                          annually by the board of directors of the Company.

5.       Term.  The employment relationship evidenced by this Agreement is an
"at will" employment relationship and the Company reserves the right to
terminate the Executive at any time with or without cause.  In the absence of
such termination, this Agreement will extend for a term of three (3) years
commencing on July 1, 1997, and ending on June 30, 2000 (the "Expiration
Date").

6.       Termination.  This Agreement will continue in effect until the
expiration of the term stated at paragraph 5 of this Agreement unless earlier
terminated pursuant to this paragraph 6.

         6.1     Termination by Company.  The Company will have the following
                 rights to terminate this Agreement:

                 6.1.1    Termination without Cause.  The Company may terminate
                          this Agreement without cause at any time by the
                          service of written notice of termination to the
                          Executive specifying an effective date of such
                          termination not sooner than sixty (60) business days
                          after the date of such notice (the "Termination
                          Date").  In the event the Executive is terminated
                          without cause, or the Company elects not to renew the
                          contract, the Executive will receive as termination
                          compensation: (a) Base Salary for a period of ninety
                          (90) days; (b) any benefits payable by operation of
                          paragraph 4.4 of this Agreement; and (c) any vacation
                          pay accrued through the Termination Date.  The
                          termination compensation in (a) shall be paid only if
                          the Executive executes the Company's standard
                          termination agreement releasing all legally waivable
                          claims arising from the Executive's employment.

                 6.1.2    Termination for Cause.  The Company may terminate
                          this Agreement for cause if the Executive: (a)
                          misappropriates the property of the Company or
                          commits any other act of dishonesty; (b) engages in
                          personal misconduct which materially injures the
                          Company; (c) willfully violates any law or regulation
                          relating to the business of the Company which results
                          in injury to the Company; or (d) willfully and
                          repeatedly fails to perform the Executive's duties
                          hereunder.  In the event this Agreement is terminated
                          for cause, the Company will not have any obligation
                          to provide any further

                                      4
<PAGE>   8
                          payments or benefits to the Executive after the
                          effective date of such termination.

                 6.1.3    Termination After Change in Control.  If, during the
                          term of this Agreement, there is a "Change of
                          Control" and within one (1) year thereafter:  (a)
                          this Agreement expires and is not extended; or (b)
                          the Executive is terminated other than under
                          paragraphs 6.1.2, 6.3 or 6.4 based on adequate
                          grounds; or (c) the Executive resigns as a result of
                          a reassignment of duties inconsistent with the
                          Executive's position, a reduction in the Executive's
                          then current compensation under paragraph 4 of this
                          Agreement, or a required relocation more than 25
                          miles from the Executive's then current place of
                          employment, then the Executive will be entitled to a
                          severance payment (in addition to any other amounts
                          payable to the Executive under this Agreement or
                          otherwise) in an amount equal to twelve (12) months
                          of Base Salary as set forth in paragraph 4.1 of this
                          Agreement.  The term "Change of Control" means any
                          action of a nature that would be required to be
                          reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of
                          Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of
                          1934 with respect to the Company including, without
                          limitation (i) the direct or indirect acquisition by
                          any person after the date hereof of beneficial
                          ownership of the right to vote or securities of the
                          Company representing the right to vote thirty five
                          percent (35%) or more of the combined voting power of
                          the Company's then outstanding securities having the
                          right to vote for the election of directors, or (ii)
                          within two years of a tender offer or exchange offer
                          for the voting stock of the Company or as a result of
                          a merger, consolidation, sale of assets or contested
                          election (or any combination of the foregoing), a
                          majority of the members of the Company's board of
                          directors is replaced by directors who were not
                          nominated and approved by the board of directors.

         6.2     Termination by Executive.  The Executive may voluntarily
                 terminate this Agreement with or without cause by the service
                 of written notice of such termination to the Company
                 specifying an effective date of such termination thirty (30)
                 days after the date of such notice, during which time
                 Executive may use remaining accrued vacation days, or at the
                 Company's option, be paid for such days.  In the event this
                 Agreement is terminated by the Executive, neither the Company
                 nor the Executive will have any further obligations hereunder
                 including, without limitation, any obligation of the Company
                 to provide any further payments or benefits to the Executive
                 after the effective date of such termination.

         6.3     Incapacity of Executive.  If the Executive suffers from a
                 physical or mental condition which in the reasonable judgment
                 of the Company's management


                                      5
<PAGE>   9
                 prevents the Executive in whole or in part from performing the
                 duties specified herein for a period of three (3) consecutive
                 months, the Executive may be terminated. Although the
                 termination shall be deemed as a termination with cause, any
                 compensation payable under paragraph 4 of this Agreement will
                 be continued for ninety (90) days. Notwithstanding the
                 foregoing, the Executive's Base Salary specified in paragraph
                 4.1 of this Agreement will be reduced by any benefits payable
                 under any disability plans.

         6.4     Death of Executive.  If the Executive dies during the term of
                 this Agreement, the Company may thereafter terminate this
                 Agreement without compensation to the Executive's estate
                 except: (a) the obligation to continue the Base Salary
                 payments under paragraph 4.1 of this Agreement for ninety (90)
                 days; and (b) the benefits described in paragraph 4.4 of this
                 Agreement accrued through the effective date of such
                 termination.

         6.5     Effect of Termination.  The termination of this Agreement will
                 terminate all obligations of the Executive to render services
                 on behalf of the Company, provided that the Executive will
                 maintain the confidentiality of all information acquired by
                 the Executive during the term of his employment in accordance
                 with paragraph 7 of this Agreement.  Except as otherwise
                 provided in paragraph 6 of this Agreement, no accrued bonus,
                 severance pay or other form of compensation will be payable by
                 the Company to the Executive by reason of the termination of
                 this Agreement.  All keys, entry cards, credit cards, files,
                 records, financial information, furniture, furnishings,
                 equipment, supplies and other items relating to the Company
                 will remain the property of the Company.  The Executive will
                 have the right to retain and remove all personal property and
                 effects which are owned by the Executive and located in the
                 offices of the Company.  All such personal items will be
                 removed from such offices no later than two (2) days after the
                 effective date of termination, and the Company is hereby
                 authorized to discard any items remaining and to reassign the
                 Executive's office space after such date.  Prior to the
                 effective date of termination, the Executive will render such
                 services to the Company as might be reasonably required to
                 provide for the orderly termination of the Executive's
                 employment.


7.       Confidentiality. The Executive recognizes that the nature of the
Executive's services are such that the Executive will have access to
information which constitutes trade secrets, is of a confidential nature, is of
great value to the Company or is the foundation on which the business of the
Company is predicated.  The Executive agrees not to disclose to any person
other than the Company's employees or the Company's legal counsel nor use for
any purpose, other than the performance of this Agreement, any confidential
information ("Confidential Information").  Confidential Information includes
data or material (regardless of form) which is:  (a) a trade secret; (b)
provided, disclosed or delivered to Executive by the Company, any officer,
director, employee, agent, attorney, accountant, consultant, or other


                                      6
<PAGE>   10
person or entity employed by the Company in any capacity, any customer,
borrower or business associate of the Company or any public authority having
jurisdiction over the Company of any business activity conducted by the
Company; or (c) produced, developed, obtained or prepared by or on behalf of
Executive or the Company (whether or not such information was developed in the
performance of this Agreement) with respect to the Company or any assets oil
and gas prospects, business activities, officers, directors, employees,
borrowers or customers of the foregoing.  However, Confidential Information
shall not include any information, data or material which at the time of
disclosure or use was generally available to the public other than by a breach
of this Agreement, was available to the party to whom disclosed on a non-
confidential basis by disclosure or access provided by the Company or a third
party, or was otherwise developed or obtained independently by the person to
whom disclosed without a breach of this Agreement.  On request by the Company,
the Company will be entitled to a copy of any Confidential Information in the
possession of the Executive. The Executive also agrees that the provisions of
this paragraph 7 will survive the termination, expiration or cancellation of
this Agreement for a period of five (5) years.  The Executive will deliver to
the Company all originals and copies of the documents or materials containing
Confidential Information.  For purposes of paragraphs 7, 8, and 9 of this
Agreement, the Company expressly includes any of the Company's affiliated
corporations, partnerships or entities.

8.       Noncompetition.  For a period of twelve (12) months after Executive is
no longer employed by the Company as a result of either the resignation by the
Executive pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above, or Termination for Cause pursuant to
paragraph 6.1.2 above, Executive will not: (a) acquire, attempt to acquire or
aid another in the acquisition or attempted acquisition of an interest in oil
and gas assets, oil and gas production, oil and gas leases, mineral interests,
oil and gas wells or other such oil and gas exploration, development or
production activities within five (5) miles of any operations or ownership
interests of the Company or its affiliated corporations, partnerships or
entities, provided, however, this provision shall not apply to acquisitions
within said five (5) mile radius of assets or activities of a successor entity
resulting from a "Change in Control" as described in paragraph 6.1.3., which
assets were owned or activities were being conducted (1) prior to the date of
such Change in Control, or (2) after such Change in Control but for which the
Executive had no material responsibility; and; (b) for the Executive's own
account or for the benefit of another party solicit, induce, entice or attempt
to entice any employee, contractor, customer, vendor or subcontractor to
terminate or breach any relationship with the Company or the Company's
affiliates.  The Executive further agrees that the Executive will not
circumvent or attempt to circumvent the foregoing agreements by any future
arrangement or through the actions of a third party.

9.       Proprietary Matters.  The Executive expressly understands and agrees
that any and all improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or know-how
that are generated or conceived by the Executive during the term of this
Agreement, whether generated or conceived during the Executive's regular
working hours or otherwise, will be the sole and exclusive property of the
Company.  Whenever requested by the Company (either during the term of this
Agreement or thereafter), the Executive will assign or execute any and all


                                      7
<PAGE>   11
applications, assignments and or other instruments and do all things which the
Company deems necessary or appropriate in order to permit the Company to:  (a)
assign and convey or otherwise make available to the Company the sole and
exclusive right, title, and interest in and to said improvements, inventions,
discoveries, processes, know-how, applications, patents, copyrights, trade
names or trademarks; or (b) apply for, obtain, maintain, enforce and defend
patents, copyrights, trade names, or trademarks of the United States or of
foreign countries for said improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or
know-how. However, the improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or
know-how generated or conceived by the Executive and referred to above (except
as they may be included in the patents, copyrights or registered trade names or
trademarks of the Company, or corporations, partnerships or other entities
which may be affiliated with the Company) shall not be exclusive property of
the Company at any time after having been disclosed or revealed or have
otherwise become available to the public or to a third party on a
non-confidential basis other than by a breach of this Agreement, or after they
have been independently developed or discussed without a breach of this
Agreement by a third party who has no obligation to the Company or its
affiliates.

10.      Arbitration.  The parties will attempt to promptly resolve any dispute
or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or termination of
the Executive by the Company.  Any negotiations pursuant to this paragraph 10
are confidential and will be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations
for all purposes.  If the parties are unable to reach a settlement amicably,
the dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator
in accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American
Arbitration Association.  The arbitrator will be instructed and empowered to
take reasonable steps to expedite the arbitration and the arbitrator's judgment
will be final and binding upon the parties subject solely to challenge on the
grounds of fraud or gross misconduct.  Except for damages arising out of a
breach of paragraphs 7, 8 or 9 of this Agreement, the arbitrator is not
empowered to award total damages (including compensatory damages) which exceed
300% of compensatory damages and each party hereby irrevocably waives any
damages in excess of that amount.  The arbitration will be held in Oklahoma
County, Oklahoma.  Judgment upon any verdict in arbitration may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction and the parties hereby consent to the
jurisdiction of, and proper venue in, the federal and state courts located in
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma.  Each party will bear its own costs in connection
with the arbitration and the costs of the arbitrator will be borne by the party
who the arbitrator determines did not prevail in the matter.  Unless otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the procedures specified in this
paragraph 10 will be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of
disputes and controversies between the parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may seek a preliminary
injunction or other provisional judicial relief if in such party's judgment
such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status
quo.


11.      Miscellaneous.  The parties further agree as follows:

         11.1    Time.    Time is of the essence of each provision of this
                 Agreement.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

         THIS AGREEMENT is made effective July 1, 1997, between CHESAPEAKE
ENERGY CORPORATION, an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), and HENRY J. HOOD,
an individual (the "Executive") and replaces and supersedes that certain
Employment Agreement between Company and Executive dated July 1, 1995.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

         WHEREAS, the Company desires to retain the services of the Executive
and the Executive desires to make the Executive's services available to the
Company.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein
contained, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:

1.    Employment. The Company hereby employs the Executive and the Executive
hereby accepts such employment subject to the terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement. The Executive is engaged as an employee of the Company, and the
Executive and the Company do not intend to create a joint venture, partnership
or other relationship which might impose a fiduciary obligation on the
Executive or the Company in the performance of this Agreement.

2.    Executive's Duties. The Executive is employed on a full-time basis.
Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Executive will use the Executive's
best efforts and due diligence to assist the Company in achieving the most
profitable operation of the Company and the Company's affiliated entities
consistent with developing and maintaining a quality business operation.

      2.1   Specific Duties. The Executive will serve as Senior Vice President
            - Land and Legal for the Company. The Executive will perform all of
            the services required to fully and faithfully execute the office
            and position to which the Executive is appointed and such other
            services as may be reasonably requested by the Executive's
            supervisor. During the term of this Agreement, the Executive may be
            nominated for election or appointed to serve as a director or
            officer of the Company's subsidiaries as determined in the board of
            directors' sole discretion.

      2.2   Supervision. The services of the Executive will be requested and
            directed by the President and Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Tom L.
            Ward, and the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Aubrey K. McClendon.

      2.3   Rules and Regulations. The Company currently has an Employment
            Policies Manual which addresses frequently asked questions
            regarding the




                                       1

<PAGE>   5


            Company. The Executive agrees to comply with the Employment
            Policies Manual except to the extent inconsistent with this
            Agreement. The Employment Policies Manual is subject to change
            without notice in the sole discretion of the Company at any time.

      2.4   Stock Investment. For each calendar year during which this
            Agreement is in effect, the Executive agrees to hold shares of the
            Company's common stock having aggregate Investment Value equal to
            ten percent (10%) of the compensation paid to the Executive under
            paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement during such calendar year.
            For purposes of this section, the "Investment Value" of each share
            of stock will be the higher of either (a) the price paid by the
            Executive for such share as part of an open market purchase; or (b)
            the fair market value on the date of exercise for shares acquired
            through the exercise of employee stock options. Any shares of
            common stock acquired by the Executive prior to the date of this
            Agreement and still owned by the Executive during the term of this
            Agreement may be used to satisfy this requirement to acquire common
            stock. The Investment Value for previously acquired stock shall be
            calculated using the average stock price during the first six
            months of this Agreement.

            The stock acquired or owned pursuant to this paragraph 2.4 must be
            held by the Executive at all times during the Executive's
            employment by the Company or the Company's affiliated entities. In
            order to administer this provision, the Executive agrees to return
            to the Company's Chief Executive Officer a semi-annual report of
            purchases and ownership in a form prepared by the Company. This
            paragraph will become null and void if the Company's common stock
            ceases to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on the
            National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
            System. The Company has no obligation to sell or to purchase from
            the Executive any of the Company's stock in connection with this
            paragraph 2.4 and has made no representations or warranties
            regarding the Company's stock, operations or financial condition.

3. Other Activities. Unless the Executive has obtained the prior written
approval of the board of directors of the Company, the Executive will not: (a)
engage in business independent of the Executive's employment by the Company;
(b) serve as an officer, general partner or member in any corporation,
partnership, company, or firm; (c) directly or indirectly invest in,
participate in or acquire an interest in any oil and gas business, including,
without limitation, (i) producing oil and gas, (ii) drilling, owning or
operating oil and gas leases or wells, (iii) providing services or materials to
the oil and gas industry, (iv) marketing or refining oil or gas, or (v) owning
any interest in any corporation, partnership, company or entity which conducts
any of the foregoing activities. The limitation in this paragraph 3 will not
prohibit an investment by the Executive in publicly traded securities; or the
continued direct ownership and operation of oil and gas interests and leases to
the extent such interests were owned by the Executive on July 1, 1995. The
Executive agrees not to directly 



                                       2
<PAGE>   6


or indirectly acquire any additional oil and gas interests or increase
ownership of any oil and gas interests owned by the Executive on July 1, 1995.

4.    Executive's Compensation. The Company agrees to compensate the Executive
as follows:

      4.1   Base Salary. A base salary (the "Base Salary"), at the initial
            annual rate of not less than One Hundred Fifty Five Thousand Dollars
            ($155,000.00), will be paid to the Executive in equal semi-monthly
            installments beginning July 15, 1997 during the term of this
            Agreement.

      4.2   Bonus. In addition to the Base Salary described at paragraph 4.1 of
            this Agreement, the Company may periodically pay bonus compensation
            to the Executive. Any bonus compensation will be at the absolute
            discretion of the Company in such amounts and at such times as the
            board of directors of the Company may determine.

      4.3   Stock Options. In addition to the compensation set forth in
            paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement, the Executive may
            periodically receive grants of stock options from the Company's
            various stock option plans, subject to the terms and conditions
            thereof.

      4.4   Benefits. The Company will provide the Executive such retirement
            benefits, reimbursement of reasonable expenditures for dues, travel
            and entertainment and such other benefits as are customarily
            provided by the Company and as are set forth in the Company's
            Employment Policies Manual. The Company will also provide the
            Executive the opportunity to apply for coverage under the Company's
            medical, life and disability plans, if any. If the Executive is
            accepted for coverage under such plans, the Company will provide
            such coverage on the same terms as is customarily provided by the
            Company to the plan participants as modified from time to time. The
            following specific benefits will also be provided to the Executive
            at the expense of the Company:

            4.4.1       Vacation. The Executive will be entitled to take three
                        (3) weeks of paid vacation each twelve months during
                        the term of this Agreement. No additional compensation
                        will be paid for failure to take vacation and no
                        vacation may be carried forward from one twelve month
                        period to another.

            4.4.2       Membership Dues. The Company will reimburse the
                        Executive for: (a) the monthly dues necessary to
                        maintain a full membership in a country club in the
                        Oklahoma City area selected by the Executive in an
                        amount not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per



                                       3
<PAGE>   7


                        month; and (b) the reasonable cost of any qualified
                        business entertainment at such country club. All other
                        costs, including, without implied limitation, any
                        initiation costs, initial membership costs, personal
                        use and business entertainment unrelated to the Company
                        will be the sole obligation of the Executive and the
                        Company will have no liability with respect to such
                        amounts.

            4.4.3       Compensation Review. The compensation of the Executive
                        will be reviewed not less frequently than annually by
                        the board of directors of the Company.

5.    Term. The employment relationship evidenced by this Agreement is an "at
will" employment relationship and the Company reserves the right to terminate
the Executive at any time with or without cause. In the absence of such
termination, this Agreement will extend for a term of three (3) years
commencing on July 1, 1997, and ending on June 30, 2000 (the "Expiration
Date").

6.    Termination. This Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration
of the term stated at paragraph 5 of this Agreement unless earlier terminated
pursuant to this paragraph 6.

      6.1   Termination by Company. The Company will have the following rights
            to terminate this Agreement:

            6.1.1       Termination without Cause. The Company may terminate
                        this Agreement without cause at any time by the service
                        of written notice of termination to the Executive
                        specifying an effective date of such termination not
                        sooner than sixty (60) business days after the date of
                        such notice (the "Termination Date"). In the event the
                        Executive is terminated without cause, or the Company
                        elects not to renew the contract, the Executive will
                        receive as termination compensation: (a) Base Salary
                        for a period of ninety (90) days; (b) any benefits
                        payable by operation of paragraph 4.4 of this
                        Agreement; and (c) any vacation pay accrued through the
                        Termination Date. The termination compensation in (a)
                        shall be paid only if the Executive executes the
                        Company's standard termination agreement releasing all
                        legally waivable claims arising from the Executive's
                        employment.

            6.1.2       Termination for Cause. The Company may terminate this
                        Agreement for cause if the Executive: (a)
                        misappropriates the property of the Company or commits
                        any other act of dishonesty; (b) engages in personal
                        misconduct which materially injures the Company; (c)
                        willfully violates any law or regulation relating to


                                       4
<PAGE>   8


                        the business of the Company which results in injury to
                        the Company; or (d) willfully and repeatedly fails to
                        perform the Executive's duties hereunder. In the event
                        this Agreement is terminated for cause, the Company
                        will not have any obligation to provide any further
                        payments or benefits to the Executive after the
                        effective date of such termination.

            6.1.3       Termination After Change in Control. If, during the
                        term of this Agreement, there is a "Change of Control"
                        and within one (1) year thereafter: (a) this Agreement
                        expires and is not extended; or (b) the Executive is
                        terminated other than under paragraphs 6.1.2, 6.3 or
                        6.4 based on adequate grounds; or (c) the Executive
                        resigns as a result of a reassignment of duties
                        inconsistent with the Executive's position, a reduction
                        in the Executive's then current compensation under
                        paragraph 4 of this Agreement, or a required relocation
                        more than 25 miles from the Executive's then current
                        place of employment, then the Executive will be
                        entitled to a severance payment (in addition to any
                        other amounts payable to the Executive under this
                        Agreement or otherwise) in an amount equal to twelve
                        (12) months of Base Salary as set forth in paragraph
                        4.1 of this Agreement. The term "Change of Control"
                        means any action of a nature that would be required to
                        be reported in response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of
                        Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of
                        1934 with respect to the Company including, without
                        limitation (i) the direct or indirect acquisition by
                        any person after the date hereof of beneficial
                        ownership of the right to vote or securities of the
                        Company representing the right to vote thirty five
                        percent (35%) or more of the combined voting power of
                        the Company's then outstanding securities having the
                        right to vote for the election of directors, or (ii)
                        within two years of a tender offer or exchange offer
                        for the voting stock of the Company or as a result of a
                        merger, consolidation, sale of assets or contested
                        election (or any combination of the foregoing), a
                        majority of the members of the Company's board of
                        directors is replaced by directors who were not
                        nominated and approved by the board of directors.

      6.2   Termination by Executive. The Executive may voluntarily terminate
            this Agreement with or without cause by the service of written
            notice of such termination to the Company specifying an effective
            date of such termination thirty (30) days after the date of such
            notice, during which time Executive may use remaining accrued
            vacation days, or at the Company's option, be paid for such days.
            In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Executive, neither
            the Company nor the Executive will have any further obligations



                                       5
<PAGE>   9

            hereunder including, without limitation, any obligation of the
            Company to provide any further payments or benefits to the
            Executive after the effective date of such termination.

      6.3   Incapacity of Executive. If the Executive suffers from a physical
            or mental condition which in the reasonable judgment of the
            Company's management prevents the Executive in whole or in part
            from performing the duties specified herein for a period of three
            (3) consecutive months, the Executive may be terminated. Although
            the termination shall be deemed as a termination with cause, any
            compensation payable under paragraph 4 of this Agreement will be
            continued for ninety (90) days. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
            Executive's Base Salary specified in paragraph 4.1 of this
            Agreement will be reduced by any benefits payable under any
            disability plans.

      6.4   Death of Executive. If the Executive dies during the term of this
            Agreement, the Company may thereafter terminate this Agreement
            without compensation to the Executive's estate except: (a) the
            obligation to continue the Base Salary payments under paragraph 4.1
            of this Agreement for ninety (90) days; and (b) the benefits
            described in paragraph 4.4 of this Agreement accrued through the
            effective date of such termination.

      6.5   Effect of Termination. The termination of this Agreement will
            terminate all obligations of the Executive to render services on
            behalf of the Company, provided that the Executive will maintain
            the confidentiality of all information acquired by the Executive
            during the term of his employment in accordance with paragraph 7 of
            this Agreement. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 6 of this
            Agreement, no accrued bonus, severance pay or other form of
            compensation will be payable by the Company to the Executive by
            reason of the termination of this Agreement. All keys, entry cards,
            credit cards, files, records, financial information, furniture,
            furnishings, equipment, supplies and other items relating to the
            Company will remain the property of the Company. The Executive will
            have the right to retain and remove all personal property and
            effects which are owned by the Executive and located in the offices
            of the Company. All such personal items will be removed from such
            offices no later than two (2) days after the effective date of
            termination, and the Company is hereby authorized to discard any
            items remaining and to reassign the Executive's office space after
            such date. Prior to the effective date of termination, the
            Executive will render such services to the Company as might be
            reasonably required to provide for the orderly termination of the
            Executive's employment.

7.    Confidentiality. The Executive recognizes that the nature of the
Executive's services are such that the Executive will have access to
information which constitutes trade secrets, 



                                       6
<PAGE>   10

is of a confidential nature, is of great value to the Company or is the
foundation on which the business of the Company is predicated. The Executive
agrees not to disclose to any person other than the Company's employees or the
Company's legal counsel nor use for any purpose, other than the performance of
this Agreement, any confidential information ("Confidential Information").
Confidential Information includes data or material (regardless of form) which
is: (a) a trade secret; (b) provided, disclosed or delivered to Executive by
the Company, any officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, accountant,
consultant, or other person or entity employed by the Company in any capacity,
any customer, borrower or business associate of the Company or any public
authority having jurisdiction over the Company of any business activity
conducted by the Company; or (c) produced, developed, obtained or prepared by
or on behalf of Executive or the Company (whether or not such information was
developed in the performance of this Agreement) with respect to the Company or
any assets oil and gas prospects, business activities, officers, directors,
employees, borrowers or customers of the foregoing. However, Confidential
Information shall not include any information, data or material which at the
time of disclosure or use was generally available to the public other than by a
breach of this Agreement, was available to the party to whom disclosed on a
non-confidential basis by disclosure or access provided by the Company or a
third party, or was otherwise developed or obtained independently by the person
to whom disclosed without a breach of this Agreement. On request by the
Company, the Company will be entitled to a copy of any Confidential Information
in the possession of the Executive. The Executive also agrees that the
provisions of this paragraph 7 will survive the termination, expiration or
cancellation of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years. The Executive
will deliver to the Company all originals and copies of the documents or
materials containing Confidential Information. For purposes of paragraphs 7, 8,
and 9 of this Agreement, the Company expressly includes any of the Company's
affiliated corporations, partnerships or entities.

8.    Noncompetition. For a period of twelve (12) months after Executive is no
longer employed by the Company as a result of either the resignation by the
Executive pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above, or Termination for Cause pursuant to
paragraph 6.1.2 above, Executive will not: (a) acquire, attempt to acquire or
aid another in the acquisition or attempted acquisition of an interest in oil
and gas assets, oil and gas production, oil and gas leases, mineral interests,
oil and gas wells or other such oil and gas exploration, development or
production activities within five (5) miles of any operations or ownership
interests of the Company or its affiliated corporations, partnerships or
entities, provided, however, this provision shall not apply to acquisitions
within said five (5) mile radius of assets or activities of a successor entity
resulting from a "Change in Control" as described in paragraph 6.1.3., which
assets were owned or activities were being conducted (1) prior to the date of
such Change in Control, or (2) after such Change in Control but for which the
Executive had no material responsibility; and (b) for the Executive's own
account or for the benefit of another party solicit, induce, entice or attempt
to entice any employee, contractor, customer, vendor or subcontractor to
terminate or breach any relationship with the Company or the Company's
affiliates. The Executive further agrees that the Executive will not


                                       7
<PAGE>   11

circumvent or attempt to circumvent the foregoing agreements by any future
arrangement or through the actions of a third party.

9.    Proprietary Matters. The Executive expressly understands and agrees that
any and all improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or know-how that
are generated or conceived by the Executive during the term of this Agreement,
whether generated or conceived during the Executive's regular working hours or
otherwise, will be the sole and exclusive property of the Company. Whenever
requested by the Company (either during the term of this Agreement or
thereafter), the Executive will assign or execute any and all applications,
assignments and or other instruments and do all things which the Company deems
necessary or appropriate in order to permit the Company to: (a) assign and
convey or otherwise make available to the Company the sole and exclusive right,
title, and interest in and to said improvements, inventions, discoveries,
processes, know-how, applications, patents, copyrights, trade names or
trademarks; or (b) apply for, obtain, maintain, enforce and defend patents,
copyrights, trade names, or trademarks of the United States or of foreign
countries for said improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or
know-how. However, the improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or
know-how generated or conceived by the Executive and referred to above (except
as they may be included in the patents, copyrights or registered trade names or
trademarks of the Company, or corporations, partnerships or other entities
which may be affiliated with the Company) shall not be exclusive property of
the Company at any time after having been disclosed or revealed or have
otherwise become available to the public or to a third party on a
non-confidential basis other than by a breach of this Agreement, or after they
have been independently developed or discussed without a breach of this
Agreement by a third party who has no obligation to the Company or its
affiliates.

10.    Arbitration. The parties will attempt to promptly resolve any dispute or
controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or termination of the
Executive by the Company. Any negotiations pursuant to this paragraph 10 are
confidential and will be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for
all purposes. If the parties are unable to reach a settlement amicably, the
dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator in
accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator will be instructed and empowered to
take reasonable steps to expedite the arbitration and the arbitrator's judgment
will be final and binding upon the parties subject solely to challenge on the
grounds of fraud or gross misconduct. Except for damages arising out of a
breach of paragraphs 7, 8 or 9 of this Agreement, the arbitrator is not
empowered to award total damages (including compensatory damages) which exceed
300% of compensatory damages and each party hereby irrevocably waives any
damages in excess of that amount. The arbitration will be held in Oklahoma
County, Oklahoma. Judgment upon any verdict in arbitration may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction and the parties hereby consent to the
jurisdiction of, and proper venue in, the federal and state courts located in
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma. Each party will bear its own costs in connection
with the arbitration and the costs of the arbitrator will be borne by the party
who the arbitrator determines did not prevail in the matter. Unless otherwise




                                       8
<PAGE>   12

expressly set forth in this Agreement, the procedures specified in this
paragraph 10 will be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of
disputes and controversies between the parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may seek a preliminary
injunction or other provisional judicial relief if in such party's judgment
such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status
quo.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

       THIS AGREEMENT is made effective July 1, 1997, between CHESAPEAKE ENERGY
CORPORATION, an Oklahoma corporation (the "Company"), and RONALD A. LEFAIVE, an
individual (the "Executive") and replaces and supersedes that certain
Employment Agreement between Company and Executive dated May 1, 1995.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

       WHEREAS, the Company desires to retain the services of the Executive and
the Executive desires to make the Executive's services available to the
Company.

       NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein
contained, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:

1.     Employment.  The Company hereby employs the Executive and the Executive
hereby accepts such employment subject to the terms and conditions contained in
this Agreement.  The Executive is engaged as an employee of the Company, and
the Executive and the Company do not intend to create a joint venture,
partnership or other relationship which might impose a fiduciary obligation on
the Executive or the Company in the performance of this Agreement.

2.     Executive's Duties.  The Executive is employed on a full-time basis.
Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Executive will use the Executive's
best efforts and due diligence to assist the Company in achieving the most
profitable operation of the Company and the Company's affiliated entities
consistent with developing and maintaining a quality business operation.

       2.1    Specific Duties.  The Executive will serve as Controller for the
              Company. The Executive will perform all of the services required
              to fully and faithfully execute the office and position to which
              the Executive is appointed and such other services as may be
              reasonably requested by the Executive's supervisor. During the
              term of this Agreement, the Executive may be nominated for
              election or appointed to serve as a director or officer of the
              Company's subsidiaries as determined in the board of directors'
              sole discretion.

       2.2    Supervision.  The services of the Executive will be requested and
              directed by the Vice President - Finance, Mr. Marcus C. Rowland
              and the Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Aubrey K. McClendon.

       2.3    Rules and Regulations.  The Company currently has an Employment
              Policies Manual which addresses frequently asked questions
              regarding the





                                       1
<PAGE>   5
              Company. The Executive agrees to comply with the Employment
              Policies Manual except to the extent inconsistent with this
              Agreement.  The Employment Policies Manual is subject to change
              without notice in the sole discretion of the Company at any time.

       2.4    Stock Investment. For each calendar year during which this
              Agreement is in effect, the Executive agrees to hold shares of
              the Company's common stock having aggregate Investment Value
              equal to ten percent (10%) of the compensation paid to the
              Executive under paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement during
              such calendar year.  For purposes of this section, the
              "Investment Value" of each share of stock will be the higher of
              either (a) the price paid by the Executive for such share as part
              of an open market purchase; or (b) the fair market value on the
              date of exercise for shares acquired through the exercise of
              employee stock options.  Any shares of common stock acquired by
              the Executive prior to the date of this Agreement and still owned
              by the Executive during the term of this Agreement may be used to
              satisfy this requirement to acquire common stock.  The Investment
              Value for previously acquired stock shall be calculated using the
              average stock price during the first six months of this
              Agreement.

              The stock acquired or owned pursuant to this paragraph 2.4 must
              be held by the Executive at all times during the Executive's
              employment by the Company or the Company's affiliated entities.
              In order to administer this provision, the Executive agrees to
              return to the Company's Chief Executive Officer a semi-annual
              report of purchases and ownership in a form prepared by the
              Company.  This paragraph will become null and void if the
              Company's common stock ceases to be listed on the New York Stock
              Exchange or on the National Association of Securities Dealers
              Automated Quotation System. The Company has no obligation to sell
              or to purchase from the Executive any of the Company's stock in
              connection with this paragraph 2.4 and has made no
              representations or warranties regarding the Company's stock,
              operations or financial condition.

3.     Other Activities.  Unless the Executive has obtained the prior written
approval of the board of directors of the Company, the Executive will not: (a)
engage in business independent of the Executive's employment by the Company;
(b) serve as an officer, general partner or member in any corporation,
partnership, company, or firm; (c) directly or indirectly invest in,
participate in or acquire an interest in any oil and gas business, including,
without limitation, (i) producing oil and gas,  (ii) drilling, owning or
operating oil and gas leases or wells, (iii) providing services or materials to
the oil and gas industry, (iv) marketing or refining oil or gas, or (v) owning
any interest in any corporation, partnership, company or entity which conducts
any of the foregoing activities. The limitation in this paragraph 3 will not
prohibit an investment by the Executive in publicly traded securities; or the
continued direct ownership and operation of oil and gas interests and leases to
the extent such interests were owned by the Executive on July 1, 1995. The
Executive agrees not to directly





                                       2
<PAGE>   6
or indirectly acquire any additional oil and gas interests or increase
ownership of any oil and gas interests owned by the Executive on May 1, 1993.

4.     Executive's Compensation.  The Company agrees to compensate the
Executive as follows:

       4.1    Base Salary.  A base salary (the "Base Salary"), at the initial
              annual rate of not less than One Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars
              ($140,000.00), will be paid to the Executive in equal semi-
              monthly installments beginning July 15, 1997 during the term of
              this Agreement.

       4.2    Bonus.  In addition to the Base Salary described at paragraph 4.1
              of this Agreement, the Company may periodically pay bonus
              compensation to the Executive.  Any bonus compensation will be at
              the absolute discretion of the Company in such amounts and at
              such times as the board of directors of the Company may
              determine.

       4.3    Stock Options.  In addition to the compensation set forth in
              paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement, the Executive may
              periodically receive grants of stock options from the Company's
              various stock option plans, subject to the terms and conditions
              thereof.

       4.4    Benefits.  The Company will provide the Executive such retirement
              benefits, reimbursement of reasonable expenditures for dues,
              travel and entertainment and such other benefits as are
              customarily provided by the Company and as are set forth in the
              Company's Employment Policies Manual.  The Company will also
              provide the Executive the opportunity to apply for coverage under
              the Company's medical, life and disability plans, if any.  If the
              Executive is accepted for coverage under such plans, the Company
              will provide such coverage on the same terms as is customarily
              provided by the Company to the plan participants as modified from
              time to time.  The following specific benefits will also be
              provided to the Executive at the expense of the Company:

              4.4.1  Vacation.  The Executive will be entitled to take three
                     (3) weeks of paid vacation each twelve months during the
                     term of this Agreement.  No additional compensation will
                     be paid for failure to take vacation and no vacation may
                     be carried forward from one twelve month period to
                     another.

              4.4.2  Membership Dues. The Company will reimburse the Executive 
                     for: (a) the monthly dues necessary to maintain a full
                     membership in a country club in the Oklahoma City area
                     selected by the Executive in an amount not to exceed Five
                     Hundred Dollars ($500.00) per





                                       3
<PAGE>   7
                     month; and (b) the reasonable cost of any qualified
                     business entertainment at such country club.  All other
                     costs, including, without implied limitation, any
                     initiation costs, initial membership costs, personal use
                     and business entertainment unrelated to the Company will
                     be the sole obligation of the Executive and the Company
                     will have no liability with respect to such amounts.

              4.4.3  Compensation Review.  The compensation of the Executive 
                     will be reviewed not less frequently than annually by the 
                     board of directors of the Company.

5.     Term.  The employment relationship evidenced by this Agreement is an "at
will" employment relationship and the Company reserves the right to terminate
the Executive at any time with or without cause.  In the absence of such
termination, this Agreement will extend for a term of three (3) years
commencing on July 1, 1997, and ending on June 30, 2000 (the "Expiration
Date").

6.     Termination.  This Agreement will continue in effect until the
expiration of the term stated at paragraph 5 of this Agreement unless earlier
terminated pursuant to this paragraph 6.

       6.1    Termination by Company.  The Company will have the following
              rights to terminate this Agreement:

              6.1.1  Termination without Cause.  The Company may terminate this
                     Agreement without cause at any time by the service of
                     written notice of termination to the Executive specifying
                     an effective date of such termination not sooner than
                     sixty (60) business days after the date of such notice
                     (the "Termination Date").  In the event the Executive is
                     terminated without cause, or the Company elects not to
                     renew the contract, the Executive will receive as
                     termination compensation: (a) Base Salary for a period of
                     ninety (90) days; (b) any benefits payable by operation of
                     paragraph 4.4 of this Agreement; and (c) any vacation pay
                     accrued through the Termination Date.  The termination
                     compensation in (a) shall be paid only if the Executive
                     executes the Company's standard termination agreement
                     releasing all legally waivable claims arising from the
                     Executive's employment.

              6.1.2  Termination for Cause.  The Company may terminate this
                     Agreement for cause if the Executive: (a) misappropriates
                     the property of the Company or commits any other act of
                     dishonesty; (b) engages in personal misconduct which
                     materially injures the Company; (c) willfully violates any
                     law or regulation relating to the





                                       4
<PAGE>   8
                     business of the Company which results in injury to the
                     Company; or (d) willfully and repeatedly fails to perform
                     the Executive's duties hereunder.  In the event this
                     Agreement is terminated for cause, the Company will not
                     have any obligation to provide any further payments or
                     benefits to the Executive after the effective date of such
                     termination.

              6.1.3  Termination After Change in Control.  If, during the term
                     of this Agreement, there is a "Change of Control" and
                     within one (1) year thereafter:  (a) this Agreement
                     expires and is not extended; or (b) the Executive is
                     terminated other than under paragraphs 6.1.2, 6.3 or 6.4
                     based on adequate grounds; or (c) the Executive resigns as
                     a result of a reassignment of duties inconsistent with the
                     Executive's position, a reduction in the Executive's then
                     current compensation under paragraph 4 of this Agreement,
                     or a required relocation more than 25 miles from the
                     Executive's then current place of employment, then the
                     Executive will be entitled to a severance payment (in
                     addition to any other amounts payable to the Executive
                     under this Agreement or otherwise) in an amount equal to
                     twelve (12) months of Base Salary as set forth in
                     paragraph 4.1 of this Agreement.  The term "Change of
                     Control" means any action of a nature that would be
                     required to be reported in response to Item 6(e) of
                     Schedule 14A of Regulation 14A under the Securities
                     Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to the Company
                     including, without limitation (i) the direct or indirect
                     acquisition by any person after the date hereof of
                     beneficial ownership of the right to vote or securities of
                     the Company representing the right to vote thirty five
                     percent (35%) or more of the combined voting power of the
                     Company's then outstanding securities having the right to
                     vote for the election of directors, or (ii) within two
                     years of a tender offer or exchange offer for the voting
                     stock of the Company or as a result of a merger,
                     consolidation, sale of assets or contested election (or
                     any combination of the foregoing), a majority of the
                     members of the Company's board of directors is replaced by
                     directors who were not nominated and approved by the board
                     of directors.

       6.2    Termination by Executive.  The Executive may voluntarily
              terminate this Agreement with or without cause by the service of
              written notice of such termination to the Company specifying an
              effective date of such termination thirty (30) days after the
              date of such notice, during which time Executive may use
              remaining accrued vacation days, or at the Company's option, be
              paid for such days.  In the event this Agreement is terminated by
              the Executive, neither the Company nor the Executive will have
              any further obligations hereunder including, without limitation,
              any obligation of the





                                       5
<PAGE>   9
              Company to provide any further payments or benefits to the
              Executive after the effective date of such termination.

       6.3    Incapacity of Executive.  If the Executive suffers from a
              physical or mental condition which in the reasonable judgment of
              the Company's management prevents the Executive in whole or in
              part from performing the duties specified herein for a period of
              three (3) consecutive months, the Executive may be terminated.
              Although the termination shall be deemed as a Termination With
              Cause, any compensation payable under paragraph 4 of this
              Agreement will be continued for ninety (90) days. Notwithstanding
              the foregoing, the Executive's Base Salary specified in paragraph
              4.1 of this Agreement will be reduced by any benefits payable
              under any disability plans.

       6.4    Death of Executive.  If the Executive dies during the term of
              this Agreement, the Company may thereafter terminate this
              Agreement without compensation to the Executive's estate except:
              (a) the obligation to continue the Base Salary payments under
              paragraph 4.1 of this Agreement for ninety (90) days; and (b) the
              benefits described in paragraph 4.4 of this Agreement accrued
              through the effective date of such termination.

       6.5    Effect of Termination.  The termination of this Agreement will
              terminate all obligations of the Executive to render services on
              behalf of the Company, provided that the Executive will maintain
              the confidentiality of all information acquired by the Executive
              during the term of his employment in accordance with paragraph 7
              of this Agreement.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 6
              of this Agreement, no accrued bonus, severance pay or other form
              of compensation will be payable by the Company to the Executive
              by reason of the termination of this Agreement.  All keys, entry
              cards, credit cards, files, records, financial information,
              furniture, furnishings, equipment, supplies and other items
              relating to the Company will remain the property of the Company.
              The Executive will have the right to retain and remove all
              personal property and effects which are owned by the Executive
              and located in the offices of the Company.  All such personal
              items will be removed from such offices no later than two (2)
              days after the effective date of termination, and the Company is
              hereby authorized to discard any items remaining and to reassign
              the Executive's office space after such date.  Prior to the
              effective date of termination, the Executive will render such
              services to the Company as might be reasonably required to
              provide for the orderly termination of the Executive's
              employment.


7.     Confidentiality. The Executive recognizes that the nature of the
Executive's services are such that the Executive will have access to
information which constitutes trade secrets,





                                       6
<PAGE>   10
is of a confidential nature, is of great value to the Company or is the
foundation on which the business of the Company is predicated.  The Executive
agrees not to disclose to any person other than the Company's employees or the
Company's legal counsel nor use for any purpose, other than the performance of
this Agreement, any confidential information ("Confidential Information").
Confidential Information includes data or material (regardless of form) which
is:  (a) a trade secret; (b) provided, disclosed or delivered to Executive by
the Company, any officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, accountant,
consultant, or other person or entity employed by the Company in any capacity,
any customer, borrower or business associate of the Company or any public
authority having jurisdiction over the Company of any business activity
conducted by the Company; or (c) produced, developed, obtained or prepared by
or on behalf of Executive or the Company (whether or not such information was
developed in the performance of this Agreement) with respect to the Company or
any assets oil and gas prospects, business activities, officers, directors,
employees, borrowers or customers of the foregoing.  However, Confidential
Information shall not include any information, data or material which at the
time of disclosure or use was generally available to the public other than by a
breach of this Agreement, was available to the party to whom disclosed on a
non-confidential basis by disclosure or access provided by the Company or a
third party, or was otherwise developed or obtained independently by the person
to whom disclosed without a breach of this Agreement.  On request by the
Company, the Company will be entitled to a copy of any Confidential Information
in the possession of the Executive. The Executive also agrees that the
provisions of this paragraph 7 will survive the termination, expiration or
cancellation of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years.  The Executive
will deliver to the Company all originals and copies of the documents or
materials containing Confidential Information.  For purposes of paragraphs 7,
8, and 9 of this Agreement, the Company expressly includes any of the Company's
affiliated corporations, partnerships or entities.

8.     Noncompetition.  For a period of twelve (12) months after Executive is
no longer employed by the Company as a result of either the resignation by the
Executive pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above, or Termination for Cause pursuant to
paragraph 6.1.2 above, Executive will not: (a) acquire, attempt to acquire or
aid another in the acquisition or attempted acquisition of an interest in oil
and gas assets, oil and gas production, oil and gas leases, mineral interests,
oil and gas wells or other such oil and gas exploration, development or
production activities within five (5) miles of any operations or ownership
interests of the Company or its affiliated corporations, partnerships or
entities, provided, however, this provision shall not apply to acquisitions
within said five (5) mile radius of assets or activities of a successor entity
resulting from a "Change in Control" as described in paragraph 6.1.3., which
assets were owned or activities were being conducted (1) prior to the date of
such Change in Control, or (2) after such Change in Control but for which the
Executive had no material responsibility; and; (b) for the Executive's own
account or for the benefit of another party solicit, induce, entice or attempt
to entice any employee, contractor, customer, vendor or subcontractor to
terminate or breach any relationship with the Company or the Company's
affiliates.  The Executive further agrees that the Executive

<PAGE>   11
will not circumvent or attempt to circumvent the foregoing agreements by any
future arrangement or through the actions of a third party.

9.     Proprietary Matters.  The Executive expressly understands and agrees
that any and all improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or know-how
that are generated or conceived by the Executive during the term of this
Agreement, whether generated or conceived during the Executive's regular
working hours or otherwise, will be the sole and exclusive property of the
Company.  Whenever requested by the Company (either during the term of this
Agreement or thereafter), the Executive will assign or execute any and all
applications, assignments and or other instruments and do all things which the
Company deems necessary or appropriate in order to permit the Company to:  (a)
assign and convey or otherwise make available to the Company the sole and
exclusive right, title, and interest in and to said improvements, inventions,
discoveries, processes, know-how, applications, patents, copyrights, trade
names or trademarks; or (b) apply for, obtain, maintain, enforce and defend
patents, copyrights, trade names, or trademarks of the United States or of
foreign countries for said improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or
know-how.  However, the improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or
know-how generated or conceived by the Executive and referred to above (except
as they may be included in the patents, copyrights or registered trade names or
trademarks of the Company, or corporations, partnerships or other entities
which may be affiliated with the Company) shall not be exclusive property of
the Company at any time after having been disclosed or revealed or have
otherwise become available to the public or to a third party on a non-
confidential basis other than by a breach of this Agreement, or after they have
been independently developed or discussed without a breach of this Agreement by
a third party who has no obligation to the Company or its affiliates.

10.    Arbitration.  The parties will attempt to promptly resolve any dispute
or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or termination of
the Executive by the Company.  Any negotiations pursuant to this paragraph 10
are confidential and will be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations
for all purposes.  If the parties are unable to reach a settlement amicably,
the dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator
in accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American
Arbitration Association.  The arbitrator will be instructed and empowered to
take reasonable steps to expedite the arbitration and the arbitrator's judgment
will be final and binding upon the parties subject solely to challenge on the
grounds of fraud or gross misconduct.  Except for damages arising out of a
breach of paragraphs 7, 8 or 9 of this Agreement, the arbitrator is not
empowered to award total damages (including compensatory damages) which exceed
300% of compensatory damages and each party hereby irrevocably waives any
damages in excess of that amount.  The arbitration will be held in Oklahoma
County, Oklahoma.  Judgment upon any verdict in arbitration may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction and the parties hereby consent to the
jurisdiction of, and proper venue in, the federal and state courts located in
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma.  Each party will bear its own costs in connection
with the arbitration and the costs of the arbitrator will be borne by the party
who the arbitrator determines did not prevail in the matter.  Unless otherwise





                                       8
<PAGE>   12
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the procedures specified in this
paragraph 10 will be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of
disputes and controversies between the parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may seek a preliminary
injunction or other provisional judicial relief if in such party's judgment
such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status
quo.

and the Executive desires to make the Executive's services available to the
Company.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises herein
contained, the Company and the Executive agree as follows:

1.       Employment.  The Company hereby employs the Executive and the
Executive hereby accepts such employment subject to the terms and conditions
contained in this Agreement.  The Executive is engaged as an employee of the
Company, and the Executive and the Company do not intend to create a joint
venture, partnership or other relationship which might impose a fiduciary
obligation on the Executive or the Company in the performance of this
Agreement.

2.       Executive's Duties.  The Executive is employed on a full-time basis.
Throughout the term of this Agreement, the Executive will use the Executive's
best efforts and due diligence to assist the Company in achieving the most
profitable operation of the Company and the Company's affiliated entities
consistent with developing and maintaining a quality business operation.

         2.1       Specific Duties.  The Executive will serve as Treasurer and
                   Director of Human Resources for the Company.  The Executive
                   will perform all of the services required to fully and
                   faithfully execute the office and position to which the
                   Executive is appointed and such other services as may be
                   reasonably requested by the Executive's supervisor. During
                   the term of this Agreement, the Executive may be nominated
                   for election or appointed to serve as a director or officer
                   of the Company's subsidiaries as determined in the board of
                   directors' sole discretion.

         2.2       Supervision.  The services of the Executive will be
                   requested and directed by the Vice President - Finance and
                   Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Marcus C. Rowland.

         2.3       Rules and Regulations.  The Company currently has an
                   Employment Policies Manual which addresses frequently asked
                   questions regarding the





                                       1
<PAGE>   5
                   Company. The Executive agrees to comply with the Employment
                   Policies Manual except to the extent inconsistent with this
                   Agreement.  The Employment Policies Manual is subject to
                   change without notice in the sole discretion of the Company
                   at any time.

         2.4       Stock Investment. For each calendar year during which this
                   Agreement is in effect, the Executive agrees to hold shares
                   of the Company's common stock having aggregate Investment
                   Value equal to ten percent (10%) of the compensation paid to
                   the Executive under paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement
                   during such calendar year.  For purposes of this section,
                   the "Investment Value" of each share of stock will be the
                   higher of either (a) the price paid by the Executive for
                   such share as part of an open market purchase; or (b) the
                   fair market value on the date of exercise for shares
                   acquired through the exercise of employee stock options.
                   Any shares of common stock acquired by the Executive prior
                   to the date of this Agreement and still owned by the
                   Executive during the term of this Agreement may be used to
                   satisfy this requirement to acquire common stock.  The
                   Investment Value for previously acquired stock shall be
                   calculated using the average stock price during the first
                   six months of this Agreement.

                   The stock acquired or owned pursuant to this paragraph 2.4
                   must be held by the Executive at all times during the
                   Executive's employment by the Company or the Company's
                   affiliated entities.  In order to administer this provision,
                   the Executive agrees to return to the Company's Chief
                   Executive Officer a semi-annual report of purchases and
                   ownership in a form prepared by the Company.  This paragraph
                   will become null and void if the Company's common stock
                   ceases to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange or on the
                   National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
                   Quotation System.  The Company has no obligation to sell or
                   to purchase from the Executive any of the Company's stock in
                   connection with this paragraph 2.4 and has made no
                   representations or warranties regarding the Company's stock,
                   operations or financial condition.

3.       Other Activities.  Unless the Executive has obtained the prior written
approval of the board of directors of the Company, the Executive will not: (a)
engage in business independent of the Executive's employment by the Company;
(b) serve as an officer, general partner or member in any corporation,
partnership, company, or firm; (c) directly or indirectly invest in,
participate in or acquire an interest in any oil and gas business, including,
without limitation, (i) producing oil and gas,  (ii) drilling, owning or
operating oil and gas leases or wells, (iii) providing services or materials to
the oil and gas industry, (iv) marketing or refining oil or gas, or (v) owning
any interest in any corporation, partnership, company or entity which conducts
any of the foregoing activities. The limitation in this paragraph 3 will not
prohibit an investment by the Executive in publicly traded securities; or the
continued direct ownership and operation of oil and gas interests and leases to
the extent such interests were owned by the Executive on July 1, 1995. The
Executive agrees not to directly





                                       2
<PAGE>   6
or indirectly acquire any additional oil and gas interests or increase
ownership of any oil and gas interests owned by the Executive on July 1, 1995.

4.       Executive's Compensation.  The Company agrees to compensate the
Executive as follows:

         4.1       Base Salary.  A base salary (the "Base Salary"), at the
                   initial annual rate of not less than One Hundred Ten Thousand
                   Dollars ($110,000.00), will be paid to the Executive in
                   equal semi-monthly installments beginning July 15, 1997
                   during the term of this Agreement.

         4.2       Bonus.  In addition to the Base Salary described at
                   paragraph 4.1 of this Agreement, the Company may
                   periodically pay bonus compensation to the Executive.  Any
                   bonus compensation will be at the absolute discretion of the
                   Company in such amounts and at such times as the board of
                   directors of the Company may determine.

         4.3       Stock Options.  In addition to the compensation set forth in
                   paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of this Agreement, the Executive may
                   periodically receive grants of stock options from the
                   Company's various stock option plans, subject to the terms
                   and conditions thereof.

         4.4       Benefits.  The Company will provide the Executive such
                   retirement benefits, reimbursement of reasonable
                   expenditures for dues, travel and entertainment and such
                   other benefits as are customarily provided by the Company
                   and as are set forth in the Company's Employment Policies
                   Manual.  The Company will also provide the Executive the
                   opportunity to apply for coverage under the Company's
                   medical, life and disability plans, if any.  If the
                   Executive is accepted for coverage under such plans, the
                   Company will provide such coverage on the same terms as is
                   customarily provided by the Company to the plan participants
                   as modified from time to time.  The following specific
                   benefits will also be provided to the Executive at the
                   expense of the Company:

                   4.4.1       Vacation.  The Executive will be entitled to
                               take three (3) weeks of paid vacation each
                               twelve months during the term of this Agreement.
                               No additional compensation will be paid for
                               failure to take vacation and no vacation may be
                               carried forward from one twelve month period to
                               another.

                   4.4.2       Membership Dues. The Company will reimburse the
                               Executive for: (a) the monthly dues necessary to
                               maintain a full membership in a country club in
                               the Oklahoma City area selected by the Executive
                               in an amount not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars
                               ($500.00) per

                               month; and (b) the reasonable cost of any
                               qualified business entertainment at such country
                               club.  All other costs, including, without
                               implied limitation, any initiation costs,
                               initial membership costs, personal use and
                               business entertainment unrelated to the Company
                               will be the sole obligation of the Executive and
                               the Company will have no liability with respect
                               to such amounts.


                   4.4.3       Compensation Review.  The compensation of the
                               Executive will be reviewed not less frequently
                               than annually by the board of directors of the
                               Company.

5.       Term.  The employment relationship evidenced by this Agreement is an
"at will" employment relationship and the Company reserves the right to
terminate the Executive at any time with or without cause.  In the absence of
such termination, this Agreement will extend for a term of three (3) years
commencing on July 1, 1997, and ending on June 30, 1999 (the "Expiration
Date").

6.       Termination.  This Agreement will continue in effect until the
expiration of the term stated at paragraph 5 of this Agreement unless earlier
terminated pursuant to this paragraph 6.

         6.1       Termination by Company.  The Company will have the following
                   rights to terminate this Agreement:

                   6.1.1       Termination without Cause.  The Company may
                               terminate this Agreement without cause at any
                               time by the service of written notice of
                               termination to the Executive specifying an
                               effective date of such termination not sooner
                               than sixty (60) business days after the date of
                               such notice (the "Termination Date").  In the
                               event the Executive is terminated without cause,
                               or the Company elects not to renew the contract,
                               the Executive will receive as termination
                               compensation: (a) Base Salary for a period of
                               ninety (90) days; (b) any benefits payable by
                               operation of paragraph 4.4 of this Agreement;
                               and (c) any vacation pay accrued through the
                               Termination Date.  The termination compensation
                               in (a) shall be paid only if the Executive
                               executes the Company's standard termination
                               agreement releasing all legally waivable claims
                               arising from the Executive's employment.

                   6.1.2       Termination for Cause.  The Company may
                               terminate this Agreement for cause if the
                               Executive: (a) misappropriates the property of
                               the Company or commits any other act of
                               dishonesty; (b) engages in personal misconduct
                               which materially injures the Company; (c)
                               willfully violates any law or regulation
                               relating to the





                                       4
<PAGE>   8
                               business of the Company which results in injury
                               to the Company; or (d) willfully and repeatedly
                               fails to perform the Executive's duties
                               hereunder.  In the event this Agreement is
                               terminated for cause, the Company will not have
                               any obligation to provide any further payments
                               or benefits to the Executive after the effective
                               date of such termination.

                   6.1.3       Termination After Change in Control.  If, during
                               the term of this Agreement, there is a "Change
                               of Control" and within one (1) year thereafter:
                               (a) this Agreement expires and is not extended;
                               or (b) the Executive is terminated other than
                               under paragraphs 6.1.2, 6.3 or 6.4 based on
                               adequate grounds; or (c) the Executive resigns
                               as a result of a reassignment of duties
                               inconsistent with the Executive's position, a
                               reduction in the Executive's then current
                               compensation under paragraph 4 of this
                               Agreement, or a required relocation more than 25
                               miles from the Executive's then current place of
                               employment, then the Executive will be entitled
                               to a severance payment (in addition to any other
                               amounts payable to the Executive under this
                               Agreement or otherwise) in an amount equal to
                               twelve (12) months of Base Salary as set forth
                               in paragraph 4.1 of this Agreement.  The term
                               "Change of Control" means any action of a nature
                               that would be required to be reported in
                               response to Item 6(e) of Schedule 14A of
                               Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act
                               of 1934 with respect to the Company including,
                               without limitation (i) the direct or indirect
                               acquisition by any person after the date hereof
                               of beneficial ownership of the right to vote or
                               securities of the Company representing the right
                               to vote thirty five percent (35%) or more of the
                               combined voting power of the Company's then
                               outstanding securities having the right to vote
                               for the election of directors, or (ii) within
                               two years of a tender offer or exchange offer
                               for the voting stock of the Company or as a
                               result of a merger, consolidation, sale of
                               assets or contested election (or any combination
                               of the foregoing), a majority of the members of
                               the Company's board of directors is replaced by
                               directors who were not nominated and approved by
                               the board of directors.

         6.2       Termination by Executive.  The Executive may voluntarily
                   terminate this Agreement with or without cause by the
                   service of written notice of such termination to the Company
                   specifying an effective date of such termination thirty (30)
                   days after the date of such notice, during which time
                   Executive may use remaining accrued vacation days, or at the
                   Company's option, be paid for such days.  In the event this
                   Agreement is terminated by the Executive, neither the
                   Company nor the Executive will have any further obligations
                   hereunder including, without limitation, any obligation of
                   the

                   Company to provide any further payments or benefits to the
                   Executive after the effective date of such termination.

         6.3       Incapacity of Executive.  If the Executive suffers from a
                   physical or mental condition which in the reasonable
                   judgment of the Company's management prevents the Executive
                   in whole or in part from performing the duties specified
                   herein for a period of three (3) consecutive months, the
                   Executive may be terminated. Although the termination shall
                   be deemed as a termination with cause, any compensation
                   payable under paragraph 4 of this Agreement will be
                   continued for ninety (90) days.  Notwithstanding the
                   foregoing, the Executive's Base Salary specified in
                   paragraph 4.1 of this Agreement will be reduced by any
                   benefits payable under any disability plans.

         6.4       Death of Executive.  If the Executive dies during the term
                   of this Agreement, the Company may thereafter terminate this
                   Agreement without compensation to the Executive's estate
                   except: (a) the obligation to continue the Base Salary
                   payments under paragraph 4.1 of this Agreement for ninety
                   (90) days; and (b) the benefits described in paragraph 4.4
                   of this Agreement accrued through the effective date of such
                   termination.

         6.5       Effect of Termination.  The termination of this Agreement
                   will terminate all obligations of the Executive to render
                   services on behalf of the Company, provided that the
                   Executive will maintain the confidentiality of all
                   information acquired by the Executive during the term of her
                   employment in accordance with paragraph 7 of this Agreement.
                   Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 6 of this
                   Agreement, no accrued bonus, severance pay or other form of
                   compensation will be payable by the Company to the Executive
                   by reason of the termination of this Agreement.  All keys,
                   entry cards, credit cards, files, records, financial
                   information, furniture, furnishings, equipment, supplies and
                   other items relating to the Company will remain the property
                   of the Company.  The Executive will have the right to retain
                   and remove all personal property and effects which are owned
                   by the Executive and located in the offices of the Company.
                   All such personal items will be removed from such offices no
                   later than two (2) days after the effective date of
                   termination, and the Company is hereby authorized to discard
                   any items remaining and to reassign the Executive's office
                   space after such date.  Prior to the effective date of
                   termination, the Executive will render such services to the
                   Company as might be reasonably required to provide for the
                   orderly termination of the Executive's employment.


7.       Confidentiality. The Executive recognizes that the nature of the
Executive's services are such that the Executive will have access to
information which constitutes trade secrets,





                                       6
<PAGE>   10
is of a confidential nature, is of great value to the Company or is the
foundation on which the business of the Company is predicated.  The Executive
agrees not to disclose to any person other than the Company's employees or the
Company's legal counsel nor use for any purpose, other than the performance of
this Agreement, any confidential information ("Confidential Information").
Confidential Information includes data or material (regardless of form) which
is:  (a) a trade secret; (b) provided, disclosed or delivered to Executive by
the Company, any officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, accountant,
consultant, or other person or entity employed by the Company in any capacity,
any customer, borrower or business associate of the Company or any public
authority having jurisdiction over the Company of any business activity
conducted by the Company; or (c) produced, developed, obtained or prepared by
or on behalf of Executive or the Company (whether or not such information was
developed in the performance of this Agreement) with respect to the Company or
any assets oil and gas prospects, business activities, officers, directors,
employees, borrowers or customers of the foregoing.  However, Confidential
Information shall not include any information, data or material which at the
time of disclosure or use was generally available to the public other than by a
breach of this Agreement, was available to the party to whom disclosed on a
non-confidential basis by disclosure or access provided by the Company or a
third party, or was otherwise developed or obtained independently by the person
to whom disclosed without a breach of this Agreement.  On request by the
Company, the Company will be entitled to a copy of any Confidential Information
in the possession of the Executive. The Executive also agrees that the
provisions of this paragraph 7 will survive the termination, expiration or
cancellation of this Agreement for a period of five (5) years.  The Executive
will deliver to the Company all originals and copies of the documents or
materials containing Confidential Information.  For purposes of paragraphs 7,
8, and 9 of this Agreement, the Company expressly includes any of the Company's
affiliated corporations, partnerships or entities.

8.       Noncompetition.  For a period of twelve (12) months after Executive is
no longer employed by the Company as a result of either the resignation by the
Executive pursuant to paragraph 6.2 above, or Termination for Cause pursuant to
paragraph 6.1.2 above, Executive will not: (a) acquire, attempt to acquire or
aid another in the acquisition or attempted acquisition of an interest in oil
and gas assets, oil and gas production, oil and gas leases, mineral interests,
oil and gas wells or other such oil and gas exploration, development or
production activities within five (5) miles of any operations or ownership
interests of the Company or its affiliated corporations, partnerships or
entities, provided, however, this provision shall not apply to acquisitions
within said five (5) mile radius of assets or activities of a successor entity
resulting from a "Change in Control" as described in paragraph 6.1.3., which
assets were owned or activities were being conducted (1) prior to the date of
such Change in Control, or (2) after such Change in Control but for which the
Executive had no material responsibility; and (b) for the Executive's own
account or for the benefit of another party solicit, induce, entice or attempt
to entice any employee, contractor, customer, vendor or subcontractor to
terminate or breach any relationship with the Company or the Company's
affiliates.  The Executive further agrees that the Executive





                                       7
<PAGE>   11
will not circumvent or attempt to circumvent the foregoing agreements by any
future arrangement or through the actions of a third party.

9.       Proprietary Matters.  The Executive expressly understands and agrees
that any and all improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or know-how
that are generated or conceived by the Executive during the term of this
Agreement, whether generated or conceived during the Executive's regular
working hours or otherwise, will be the sole and exclusive property of the
Company.  Whenever requested by the Company (either during the term of this
Agreement or thereafter), the Executive will assign or execute any and all
applications, assignments and or other instruments and do all things which the
Company deems necessary or appropriate in order to permit the Company to:  (a)
assign and convey or otherwise make available to the Company the sole and
exclusive right, title, and interest in and to said improvements, inventions,
discoveries, processes, know-how, applications, patents, copyrights, trade
names or trademarks; or (b) apply for, obtain, maintain, enforce and defend
patents, copyrights, trade names, or trademarks of the United States or of
foreign countries for said improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or
know-how.  However, the improvements, inventions, discoveries, processes or
know-how generated or conceived by the Executive and referred to above (except
as they may be included in the patents, copyrights or registered trade names or
trademarks of the Company, or corporations, partnerships or other entities
which may be affiliated with the Company) shall not be exclusive property of
the Company at any time after having been disclosed or revealed or have
otherwise become available to the public or to a third party on a
non-confidential basis other than by a breach of this Agreement, or after they
have been independently developed or discussed without a breach of this
Agreement by a third party who has no obligation to the Company or its
affiliates.

10.      Arbitration.  The parties will attempt to promptly resolve any dispute
or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or termination of
the Executive by the Company.  Any negotiations pursuant to this paragraph 10
are confidential and will be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations
for all purposes.  If the parties are unable to reach a settlement amicably,
the dispute will be submitted to binding arbitration before a single arbitrator
in accordance with the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American
Arbitration Association.  The arbitrator will be instructed and empowered to
take reasonable steps to expedite the arbitration and the arbitrator's judgment
will be final and binding upon the parties subject solely to challenge on the
grounds of fraud or gross misconduct.  Except for damages arising out of a
breach of paragraphs 7, 8 or 9 of this Agreement, the arbitrator is not
empowered to award total damages (including compensatory damages) which exceed
300% of compensatory damages and each party hereby irrevocably waives any
damages in excess of that amount.  The arbitration will be held in Oklahoma
County, Oklahoma.  Judgment upon any verdict in arbitration may be entered in
any court of competent jurisdiction and the parties hereby consent to the
jurisdiction of, and proper venue in, the federal and state courts located in
Oklahoma County, Oklahoma.  Each party will bear its own costs in connection
with the arbitration and the costs of the arbitrator will be borne by the party
who the arbitrator determines did not prevail in the matter.  Unless otherwise





                                       8
<PAGE>   12
expressly set forth in this Agreement, the procedures specified in this
paragraph 10 will be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of
disputes and controversies between the parties arising out of or relating to
this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party may seek a preliminary
injunction or other provisional judicial relief if in such party's judgment
such action is necessary to avoid irreparable damage or to preserve the status
quo.


11.      Miscellaneous.  The parties further agree as follows:

         11.1      Time.  Time is of the essence of each provision of this
                   Agreement.

                   parties to this Agreement.

                   application thereof to any person or circumstances is

         11.5      Entire Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire
                   agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
                   subject matter herein contained, and no modification hereof
                   will be effective unless made by a supplemental written
                   agreement executed by all of the parties hereto.

                   representatives and permitted assigns.  In the event of a
                   merger, consolidation, combination, dissolution or
                   liquidation of the Company, the performance of this

                   and the Executive, the relationship between the Company and
                   the Executive will be bound by the terms of this Agreement
                   and the Employment Policies Manual and not by any other
                   agreements or otherwise.  In the event of a conflict between

                              -------                           ------

                           <S>                                <C>      
                           General Partner                    $  100.00
                           Limited Partner                    $9,900.00
</TABLE>

               Although the General Partner will be liable for the obligations
               of the Partnership to the same extent that the Partnership is
               liable for such obligations, the General Partner will have no
               obligation to lend money to the Partnership or to make any
               additional Capital Contribution.

    6.2        Limited Liability. The Limited Partner will not be bound by or 
               personally liable for: (a) the expenses, liabilities or
               obligations of the Partnership; or (b) any advances or
               additional Capital Contributions. Without limitation on the
               generality of the foregoing: (i) the Limited Partner will have
               no obligation or liability to make any Capital Contributions to
               the Partnership, lend any funds to the Partnership or assume
               any liability on behalf of the Partnership with
        

                                      -2-
<PAGE>   7

               respect to any financing of the Partnership or with respect to
               any matter or thing; and (ii) the Limited Partner will have no
               obligation or liability on account of any negative balance in
               the Limited Partner's capital account.

     6.3       Optional Capital Contributions. If the General Partner 
               determines that additional Capital Contributions are necessary,
               the General Partner may elect to make or not make all or part of
               the additional Capital Contributions. If the General Partner
               elects not to make all or part of the additional Capital
               Contributions, the General Partner will provide notice of such
               election to the Limited Partner setting forth the amount of the
               recommended Capital Contribution, the proposed use of the
               Capital Contribution and the amount of the additional Capital
               Contribution not made by the General Partner. The Limited
               Partner is permitted, but not required, to make an additional
               Capital Contribution in the amount set forth in such notice.
               Each Capital Contribution made hereunder will be credited to the
               appropriate capital account of the contributing Partner as
               determined in the reasonable discretion of the General Partner.

     6.4       No Interest. Capital Contributions will not bear interest.

     6.5       Nonpriority. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this 
               Agreement, no Partner will have the right to withdraw or reduce
               a Partner's Capital Contribution prior to the dissolution of the
               Partnership. No Partner will have the right to demand or receive
               property other than cash in return for such Partner's Capital
               Contribution or with respect to any distribution of the
               Partnership.

7.   Capital Accounts and Allocations. With respect to each Partner, the 
Partnership will establish and maintain a separate capital account for the
Partnership. Each Partner's capital account will be the amount of all Capital
Contributions made by the Partner increased by the following amounts: (a) the
amount of the Partner's distributive share of income or gain allocated to the
Partner; and (b) the amount of any Partnership liabilities that are assumed by
such Partner or that are secured by any Partnership property distributed to
such Partner and decreased by (x) the amount of the Partner's distributive
share of loss allocated to the Partner, (y) the amount of cash distributed and
the net fair market value of all property distributed by the Partnership to the
Partner, and (z) the amount of any liabilities of such Partner that are assumed
by the Partnership or that are secured by property contributed by such Partner
to the Partnership. The allocation of income, expenses, gain, profit and loss
will be as follows:

     7.1       Allocations. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph 7, 
               the profits, losses, income, gain and expenses of the
               Partnership will be allocated to the Partners in accordance with
               the Partnership Percentages. Any allocation to a Partner of a
               portion of the net profits or net losses of the Partnership will
               be deemed to be an allocation to that Partner of the same
               proportional part of each



                                      -3-
<PAGE>   8

               item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit that is earned,
               realized or available for or to the Partnership for federal
               income tax purposes.

     7.2       Contributed Property.  Notwithstanding paragraph 7.1 of this 
               Agreement, any income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to
               property contributed by a Partner to the Partnership which has a
               fair market value different from its adjusted basis for federal
               income tax purposes will be allocated among the Partners in
               accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code.

     7.3       Limitation on Allocations. Notwithstanding  anything to the
               contrary contained herein, no allocation of net loss will be
               made to the Limited Partner to the extent that such allocation
               would create or increase a negative balance in Limited Partner's
               capital account. To the extent that an allocation of net loss to
               the Limited Partner is prohibited under this paragraph 7.3, the
               net loss will be allocated one hundred percent (100%) to the
               General Partner until such time as the allocation of the net
               loss will not create or increase a negative balance in the
               Limited Partner's capital account. Any special allocations of
               net loss pursuant to this paragraph 7.3 will be taken into
               account in computing subsequent allocations of net losses so
               that the net losses allocated to each Partner pursuant to this
               paragraph 7.3 will, to the extent possible, be equal to the net
               amount that would have been allocated to each such Partner if
               such allocations had not occurred.

     7.4       Qualified Income Offset. Any Partner who unexpectedly receives an
               adjustment, allocation or distribution which creates or
               increases a deficit balance in that Partner's capital account
               will be allocated items of income and gain (in that order)
               attributable to the appropriate portion of the Properties in an
               amount and manner sufficient to eliminate or reduce the deficit
               balance in that Partner's capital account as quickly as
               possible. Any special allocations of items of income or gain
               pursuant to this paragraph 7.4 will be taken into account in
               computing subsequent allocations of net profits so that the net
               amount of any items so allocated and the net profits, net losses
               and all other items allocated to each Partner pursuant to this
               paragraph 7.4 will, to the extent possible, be equal to the net
               amount that would have been allocated to each such Partner if
               such unexpected adjustments, allocations or distributions had
               not occurred.

8.   Distributions. Proceeds and Net Cash Flow will be distributed to the 
Partners at least annually. Within forty-five (45) days after the close of each
fiscal year, the General Partner will determine, in the General Partner's sole
discretion, whether there is Net Cash Flow or Proceeds available for
distribution. In computing Proceeds and Net Cash Flow, the General Partner may
establish a Reserve for anticipated capital costs, a reasonable working capital
Reserve and any other Reserves deemed necessary by the General Partner. The
Proceeds and Net Cash Flow (if any) will be distributed to the Partners in
accordance with each Partner's Partnership Percentage.



                                      -4-

9.   Fiscal Matters. With respect to the financial affairs of the Partnership, 
it is agreed that: (a) the fiscal year will be the period commencing on each
July 1 and ending on each subsequent June 30; (b) the books of the Partnership
will be maintained at the principal office of the General Partner in Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied as determined by the General Partner; (c) annual balance
sheets and statements of income and expenses will be rendered to each Partner
within ninety (90) days after the close of each fiscal year reflecting the
performance of the Partnership as a whole; (d) the funds of the Partnership
will be maintained in a bank account or accounts on deposit with a bank or
banks designated by the General Partner; (e) each Partner will have the right
to examine and copy the books and records of the Partnership at all reasonable
times; and (f) all tax returns and books of account of the Partnership will be
prepared and maintained by the General Partner.

10.  Tax Matters. The Partners acknowledge that the Partnership is subject to 
the partnership provisions of the Code and agree to file all necessary
documents to be taxed as a partnership and agree not to elect pursuant to
Section 761(a) of the Code to be excluded from the application of the
provisions of Subchapter K of Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code. The Partners
further agree as follows:

     10.1      Allocation on Transfer. If a  Partnership Interest is 
               transferred, the profit and loss for the fiscal year in which
               the transfer occurs which is attributable to the Partnership
               Interest transferred will be allocated between the transferor
               and the transferee of such Partnership Interest as such parties
               might agree, provided written notice of such allocation is given
               to the General Partner by the transferee prior to the January 15
               following the date of such transfer and such allocation is
               consistent with Section 706 of the Code. In the event the
               transferee fails to specify a method of allocation on or before
               July 15 of the year following the year in which the transfer
               occurs, the General Partner is authorized to allocate the net
               profit and loss in accordance with the Code.

     10.2      Tax Elections. If there is a distribution of property of the 
               Partnership as described in Section 734 of the Code, or if there
               is a transfer of a Partnership Interest as described in Section
               743 of the Code, the Partnership may, but is not required to,
               file an election under Section 754 of the Code to provide for an
               optional adjustment to the basis of the Partnership property. In
               addition to the foregoing election, the General Partner, after
               consultation with the Limited Partner, will make such other
               elections on behalf of the Partnership as the General Partner
               determines to be in the best interest of the Partnership.

     10.3      Tax Returns. The General Partner will cause to be prepared and 
               filed all tax returns on behalf of the Partnership required by
               each jurisdiction in which the Partnership operates. Each
               Partner agrees to furnish to the General Partner such
               information as might be reasonably required for the proper
               preparation of such tax returns.

     10.4      Tax Matters Partner. The General Partner is hereby designated 
               the tax matters partner and will in good faith represent the
               Partnership in all administrative and judicial proceedings
               involving federal income tax matters. As the tax matters
               partner, the powers of the General Partner will include, but not
               be limited to, the power to: (a) appoint an attorney-in-fact to
               represent the Partnership in such proceedings; (b) engage in any
               activities enumerated in the Code; and (c) employ attorneys,

               such Capital Contributions so returned plus interest, necessary
               to discharge the Partnership's liabilities to all creditors who
               extended credit or whose claims arose before such amount was
               returned. All of the Partnership's assets will be subject to the
               Partnership's debts and liabilities.

     12.2      Participation in Management. The Limited Partner will not take 
               part in, or interfere in any manner with, the management,

               right, power or authority to act for or bind the Partnership.
               The Limited Partner will not have the right to bring an action
               for partition against the Partnership.

13.  Conveyances. The assets of the Partnership will be held in the name of the

authority executed by the General Partner. The Partnership may sell, transfer,
convey or otherwise dispose of any of the Properties at any time to any Person,
including, without limitation, any Affiliate.

hereby instructs his Representative to cooperate with the Remaining Partner
and, on the exercise of any of the foregoing options, to consummate the
transactions with regard to the Partnership Interest of the Departing Partner
as provided in this paragraph 15.

16.  Default; Remedies. The failure by a Partner to perform any obligation 
incumbent on such Partner under this Agreement within thirty (30) days after
written demand for such performance by the Remaining Partner will constitute a
default in the performance of this Agreement by such Partner. On the occurrence
of a default, the Remaining Partner will have the option to dissolve the
Partnership and wind up the Partnership's affairs in accordance with paragraph
17 of this Agreement. The Defaulting Partner will execute or cause to be
executed all documents necessary to effect dissolution and winding up and will
have only the right to receive, on a final winding up of the affairs of the
Partnership, the distributive share to which the Defaulting Partner would have
been entitled on a winding up had such default not occurred, less: (a) all
damages, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, resulting

A reasonable period of time will be allowed for the orderly termination of the
Partnership business, discharge of the Partnership's liabilities and
distribution or liquidation of the remaining assets so as to enable the
Partnership to minimize the losses from the liquidation process. A full
accounting of the assets and liabilities of the Partnership will be prepared
and furnished to each Partner within thirty (30) days after completion. The
Partnership property and assets and/or the Proceeds from the liquidation
thereof will be paid, applied and/or distributed in the following order of
priority:

     17.1      Creditors' Claims. To the payment of the debts and liabilities 
               of the Partnership and the expenses of liquidation including,
               but not limited to, any loans or 



                                      -8-
<PAGE>   13

               advancements made by any Partner to the Partnership and any
               management fees to the General Partner, the General Partner's
               Affiliates, or any other Person managing the Partnership
               business.

     17.2      Reserve. To the creation of any Reserves which the General 
               Partner deems reasonably necessary for any liabilities of the
               Partnership or of the Partners arising out of the Partnership.
               Such Reserves will be paid over by the General Partner to a
               Person satisfactory to the General Partner to be held in escrow
               for such period as the General Partner deems advisable and for
               distribution at the expiration of such term in the manner
               hereinafter provided.

     17.3      Capital Account Balance. To the Partners in accordance with the 
               Partnership Percentages, adjusted to the date of distribution.
               For the purpose of the application of paragraph of this
               Agreement and determining the Partnership Percentages on
               liquidation, all unrealized gains, losses and accrued income and
               deductions will be treated as realized and recognized
               immediately before the date of distribution.

     17.4      Distributions in Kind. Any non-cash assets to be distributed in 
               kind will first be valued at their fair market value to
               determine the gain or loss that would have resulted if such
               assets were sold for such value. Such gain or loss will then be
               allocated pursuant to paragraph of this Agreement, and the
               Partnership Percentages will be adjusted to reflect such gain or
               loss. The amount distributed and charged to the capital account
               of each Partner receiving an interest in such distributed assets
               will be the fair market value of such interest.

     17.5      Balancing of Accounts. The General Partner will not be required 
               to make Capital Contributions or advance funds to the
               Partnership or the Limited Partner as a result of the inability
               of the Partnership to make the payments described in the
               foregoing paragraphs. The sole obligation of the General Partner
               with respect to such payments will be to apply Partnership funds
               to the extent the same are available in the order and manner
               provided in such paragraphs.

18.  Indemnification. The Partnership will indemnify and hold each Partner 
harmless from all liability, loss and expense, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and litigation expenses, which any Partner might incur by reason of any
action which is not in violation of this Agreement and is performed by such
Partner in good faith in furtherance of the Partnership's business interests,
including, without limitation, the execution of Contracts of Indebtedness.

19.  Miscellaneous. It is further agreed that:

     19.2      Right to Partition. The Partners agree that during the term of 
               the Partnership and during the period of its dissolution, no
               Partner will have any right to ask for partition of the assets
               now owned or hereafter acquired by the Partnership or to
               maintain any action for partition with respect to any property
               of the Partnership.

     19.3      Approvals. When approval by any Partner is required hereunder, 
               such approval will not be unreasonably withheld except as
               specifically permitted under this Agreement. Unless provision is
               made for a specific period of time, the period of time in which
               the right of approval will be exercised will be thirty (30)
               days. If the Partner whose approval is required neither approves
               nor disapproves a proposed action within the applicable period,
               the Partner will be deemed to have given approval. If a Partner
               disapproves any action proposed by any other Partner hereunder,
               such disapproval will not be effective unless the reasons for
               such disapproval are stated in writing and provided to the
               Partner proposing the action.

     19.4      Binding Effect. This instrument constitutes the entire agreement

               writing, signed by all of the Partners. This Agreement will be
               binding on each of the Partners and their respective successors
               and permitted assigns. If any part of this Agreement is held to
               be unenforceable, the balance will nevertheless be carried into
               effect. All Persons to whom any Partnership Interest might be
               transferred in accordance with this Agreement will, by accepting
               such transfer, be bound by this Agreement to the same extent as
               if such Person had been an original party hereto.

               or permitted to be given by any provision of this Agreement will

               Agreement are cumulative and will not exclude any other remedy
               to which any Partner might be lawfully entitled. Failure by the
               Partnership or any Partner to insist on strict performance of
               the obligations created by this Agreement will not be a waiver
