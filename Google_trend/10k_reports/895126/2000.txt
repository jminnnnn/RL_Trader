ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

    Chesapeake Energy Corporation ("Chesapeake" or the "Company") is an
independent oil and gas company engaged in the development, exploration,
acquisition and production of onshore natural gas and oil reserves in the United
States and Canada. Chesapeake began operations in 1989 and completed its initial
public offering in 1993. Its common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol CHK. The Company's principal offices are located at 6100 North
Western Avenue, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73118 (telephone 405/848-8000 and
website address of chkenergy.com).

    Chesapeake owns interests in approximately 4,700 producing oil and gas wells
concentrated in three primary operating areas: the Mid-Continent region of
Oklahoma, western Arkansas, southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle; the
Gulf Coast region consisting primarily of the Austin Chalk Trend in Texas and
Louisiana and the Tuscaloosa Trend in Louisiana; and the Helmet area of
northeastern British Columbia. During 1999, the Company produced 133.5 Bcfe,
making Chesapeake one of the 15 largest public independent oil and gas producers
in the United States.

    Business Strategy. From inception as a start-up in 1989 through today,
Chesapeake's business strategy has been to aggressively build and develop one of
the largest onshore natural gas resource bases in the U.S. The Company has
executed its strategy through a combination of active drilling and acquisition
programs during the past 10 years. Based on its view that natural gas will
become the fuel of choice in the 21st century to meet growing power demand and
increasing environmental concerns, Chesapeake believes its strategy will deliver
attractive returns and substantial growth opportunities in the years ahead.

    1999 Highlights. In the challenging oil and gas environment of 1999, the
Company focused its efforts on drilling lower risk developmental wells,
acquiring reserves at the lowest possible cost, divesting of higher cost and
non-strategic properties and maintaining a capital expenditure budget closely
tied to operating cash flow and proceeds from asset sales. Despite experiencing
20-year lows in oil and gas pricing during the first half of 1999, Chesapeake
achieved considerable operating and financial progress during the year. Listed
below are a few of Chesapeake's accomplishments in 1999 compared to 1998's
results:

    -   net income of $33 million, compared to a net loss of $934 million

    -   cash flow from operations (before changes in working capital) of $139
        million, an increase of 18%

    -   proved oil and gas reserves of 1,206 Bcfe, an increase of 11%

    -   oil and natural gas production of 133.5 Bcfe, an increase of 3%

    -   reserve replacement of 186% at a cost of $0.65 per Mcfe

    In addition, Chesapeake's operating cost structure remained among the lowest
of all publicly traded independent energy producers during 1999. The Company's
per unit operating costs (consisting of general and administrative expenses,
production expenses, production taxes, and depreciation, depletion and
amortization of oil and gas properties) were $1.26 per Mcfe of production,
resulting in an operating margin of $0.84 per Mcfe. The Company's low costs are
attributable to its focus on developing highly productive natural gas
properties, its efficient and motivated employees, and the successful
integration of advanced drilling and completion expertise with its large
inventory of undeveloped leasehold.

    During 1999 and early 2000, Chesapeake was successful in defeating two
material pieces of litigation against the Company. First, in the 1996 Union
Pacific Resources Corporation patent infringement litigation involving
horizontal drilling, the U.S. District Court in Ft. Worth dismissed the lawsuit,
ruling in September 1999 that a patent previously granted to UPRC was invalid
and therefore Chesapeake could not have infringed upon it. Second, in March
2000, the U.S. District Court in Oklahoma City dismissed a class action
securities suit which had been pending against the Company since 1997.


                                      -2-

    2000 Outlook. Chesapeake's strategy remains unchanged for 2000: maintain a
superior operating cost structure, fund a capital expenditure budget in balance
with operating cash flow, and deliver attractive financial returns from its
assets during a time of strengthening natural gas fundamentals.

MARKETING

    The Company's oil production is sold under market sensitive or spot price
contracts. The Company's natural gas production is sold to purchasers under
varying percentage-of-proceeds and percentage-of-index contracts or by direct
marketing to end users or aggregators. By the terms of the
percentage-of-proceeds contracts, the Company receives a percentage of the
resale price received by the purchaser for sales of residue gas and natural gas
liquids recovered after gathering and processing the Company's gas. The residue
gas and natural gas liquids sold by these purchasers are sold primarily based on
spot market prices. The revenue received by the Company from the sale of natural
gas liquids is included in natural gas sales. During 1999, only sales to Aquila
Southwest Pipeline Corporation of $31.5 million accounted for more than 10% of
the Company's total oil and gas sales. Management believes that the loss of this
customer would not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of
operations or its financial position.

    Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. ("CEMI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary,
provides oil and natural gas marketing services, including commodity price
structuring, contract administration and nomination services for the Company,
its partners and other oil and natural gas producers in certain geographical
areas in which the Company is active.

HEDGING ACTIVITIES

    Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a
portion of its future oil and gas production and to manage fixed interest rate
exposure. See Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.

RISK FACTORS

Substantial Debt Levels Could Affect Operations.

    As of December 31, 1999, we had long-term indebtedness of $964.1 million
(which included bank indebtedness of $43.5 million) and stockholders' equity was
a deficit of $217.5 million. Our ability to meet our debt service requirements
throughout the life of the senior notes and our ability to meet our preferred
stock obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be subject
to oil and gas prices, our production levels of oil and gas, general economic
conditions, and various financial, business and other factors affecting our
operations. Our level of indebtedness may have the following effects on future
operations:

        o   a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations may be
            dedicated to the payment of interest on indebtedness and will not be
            available for other purposes,

        o   restrictions in our debt instruments limit our ability to borrow
            additional funds or to dispose of assets and may affect our
            flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in the energy
            industry, and


                                      -5-
<PAGE>   6

        o   our ability to obtain additional capital in the future may be
            impaired.

As a result of our high level of indebtedness and poor conditions in the energy
industry, Standard & Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investors Service reduced
the credit ratings on our senior notes to "B" and "B3", respectively, in late
1998. These ratings were removed from credit review in 1999. Our credit ratings
could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets.

The Volatility of Oil and Gas Prices Creates Uncertainties.

    Our revenues, operating results and future rate of growth are highly
dependent on the prices we receive for our oil and gas. Historically, the
markets for oil and gas have been volatile and may continue to be volatile in
the future. Various factors which are beyond our control will affect prices of
oil and gas. These factors include:

        o   worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and gas,

        o   weather conditions,

        o   the ability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum
            Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain oil price and
            production controls,

        o   political instability or armed conflict in oil-producing regions,

        o   the price and level of foreign imports,

        o   the level of consumer demand,

        o   the price and availability of alternative fuels,

        o   the availability of pipeline capacity, and

        o   domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes.

We are unable to predict the long-term effects of these and other conditions on
the prices of oil and gas. Lower oil and gas prices may reduce the amount of oil
and gas we produce, which may adversely affect our revenues and operating
income. Because in 2000 we plan to match as nearly as possible our capital
expenditures for drilling and acquisition activities to cash flow from
operations, significant reductions in oil and gas prices may require us to
reduce our capital expenditures. Reducing drilling will make it more difficult
for us to replace the reserves we produce.

We Must Replace Reserves to Sustain Production.

    As is customary in the oil and gas exploration and production industry, our
future success depends largely upon our ability to find, develop or acquire
additional oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. Unless we
replace the reserves we produce through successful development, exploration or
acquisition, our proved reserves will decline over time. In addition,
approximately 28% by volume, or 20% by value, of our total estimated proved
reserves at December 31, 1999 were undeveloped. By their nature, undeveloped
reserves are less certain. Recovery of such reserves will require significant
capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. We cannot assure you
that we can successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future.

Significant Capital Expenditures Will be Required to Exploit Reserves.

    We have made and intend to make substantial capital expenditures in
connection with the exploration, development and production of our oil and gas
properties. Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures through a
combination of internally generated funds, equity issuances and long-term debt
financing arrangements and sale of non-core assets. From time to time, we have
used short-term bank debt, generally as a working capital facility. Future cash
flows are subject to a number of variables, such as the level of production from
existing wells, prices of oil and gas, and our success in developing and
producing new reserves and in selling non-core assets. If revenue were to
decrease as a result of lower oil and gas prices or decreased production, and
our access to capital were limited, we would have a reduced ability to replace
our reserves. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to fund our
capital expenditure budget, there can be no assurance that additional debt or
equity financing will be available to meet these requirements.




                                      -6-
<PAGE>   7

We May Have Full-Cost Ceiling Writedowns if Oil and Gas Prices Decline or if
Drilling Results are Unfavorable.

    We reported full-cost ceiling writedowns of $826 million, $110 million, and
$236 million during the year ended December 31, 1998, the six-month transition
period ended December 31, 1997 (the "Transition Period"), and the year ended
June 30, 1997 ("fiscal 1997"), respectively. These writedowns were caused by
significant declines in oil and gas prices during all three periods and by poor
drilling results in fiscal 1997 and during the Transition Period. Additionally,
significant declines in prices can cause proved undeveloped reserves to become
uneconomic, and long-lived production to become "economically truncated",
further reducing proved reserves and increasing any writedown. Our reserve
values were calculated using weighted average prices at December 31, 1999 of
$24.72 per barrel of oil and $2.25 per Mcf of natural gas. If prices in future
periods are below the prices of $10.48 per barrel of oil and $1.68 per mcf of
natural gas used at December 31, 1998, the last period during which Chesapeake
recorded an impairment to its oil and gas properties, future impairment charges
could be incurred. Although we have taken steps to reduce drilling risk, reduce
operating costs, and reduce investment in unproved leasehold, these steps may
not be sufficient to enhance future economic results or prevent additional
leasehold impairment and full-cost ceiling writedowns, which are highly
dependent on future oil and gas prices.

Drilling and Oil and Gas Operations Present Unique Risks.

    Drilling activities are subject to many risks, including well blowouts,
cratering, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires,
formations with abnormal pressures, pollution, releases of toxic gases and other
environmental hazards and risk, any of which could result in substantial losses.
In addition, we incur the risk that we will not encounter any commercially
productive reservoirs through our drilling operations. We cannot assure you that
the new wells we drill will be productive or that we will recover all or any
portion of our investment in wells drilled. Drilling for oil and gas may involve
unprofitable efforts, not only from dry wells, but from wells that are
productive but do not produce enough reserves to return a profit after drilling,
operating and other costs.

Existing Debt Covenants Restrict Our Operations.

    The indentures which govern our senior notes contain covenants which
restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries other than CEMI, to
engage in the following activities:

        o   incurring additional debt,

        o   creating liens,

        o   paying dividends and making other restricted payments,

        o   merging or consolidating with any other entity,

        o   selling, assigning, transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of
            all or substantially all of our assets, and

        o   guaranteeing indebtedness.

    At December 31, 1999, we did not meet a debt incurrence test contained in
two of the senior note indentures. Thus, we will be unable to incur unsecured
non-bank debt or resume the payment of dividends on our preferred stock until we
meet the debt incurrence test.

Canadian Operations Present the Risks Associated with Conducting Business
Outside the U.S.

    A portion of our business is conducted in Canada. You may review the amounts
of revenue, operating income (loss) and identifiable assets attributable to our
Canadian operations in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8. Also, Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements provides
disclosures about our Canadian oil and gas producing activities. Our operations
in Canada are subject to the risks associated with operating outside of the
United States. These risks include the following:

        o   adverse local political or economic developments,

        o   exchange controls,


                                      -7-
<PAGE>   8

        o   currency fluctuations,

        o   royalty and tax increases,

        o   retroactive tax claims,

        o   negotiations of contracts with governmental entities, and

        o   import and export regulations.

In addition, in the event of a dispute, we may be required to litigate the
dispute in Canadian courts since we may not be able to sue foreign persons in a
United States court.

The Loss of Either the CEO or the COO Could Adversely Affect Operations.

    Our operations are dependent upon our Chief Executive Officer, Aubrey K.
McClendon, and our Chief Operating Officer, Tom L. Ward. The unexpected loss of
the services of either of these executive officers could have a detrimental
effect on our operations. We maintain $20 million key man life insurance
policies on the life of each of Messrs. McClendon and Ward.

Transactions with Executive Officers May Create Conflicts of Interest.

    Messrs. McClendon and Ward have the right to participate in certain wells we
drill, subject to certain limitations outlined in their employment contracts. As
a result of their participation, they routinely have significant accounts
payable to Chesapeake for joint interest billings and other related advances. As
of December 31, 1999, Messrs. McClendon and Ward had payables to Chesapeake of
$2.5 million and $1.8 million, respectively, in connection with such
participation. These amounts were reduced to $2.2 million and $1.2 million,
respectively, as of March 22, 2000. The rights to participate in wells we drill
could present a conflict of interest with respect to Messrs. McClendon and Ward.

The Ownership of a Significant Percentage of Stock by Insiders Could Influence
the Outcome of Shareholder Votes.

    At March 22, 2000, our Board of Directors and senior management beneficially
owned an aggregate of 25,788,818 shares of common stock (including outstanding
vested options), which represented approximately 24% of our outstanding shares.
The beneficial ownership of Messrs. McClendon and Ward accounted for 21% of the
outstanding common stock. As a result, Messrs. McClendon and Ward, together with
other officers and directors of Chesapeake, are in a position to significantly
influence matters requiring the vote or consent of our shareholders.

REGULATION

General

    Numerous departments and agencies, federal, state and local, issue rules and
regulations binding on the oil and gas industry, some of which carry substantial
penalties for failure to comply. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas
industry increases the Company's cost of doing business and, consequently,
affects its profitability.

Exploration and Production

    The Company's operations are subject to various types of regulation at the
federal, state and local levels. Such regulation includes requiring permits for
the drilling of wells, maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or
operate wells and regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling and
casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are
drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the disposal of fluids used or
obtained in connection with operations. The Company's operations are also
subject to various conservation regulations. These include the regulation of the
size of drilling and spacing units and the density of wells which may be drilled
and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties. In this regard, some
states (such as Oklahoma) allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to
facilitate exploration while other states (such as Texas) rely on voluntary
pooling of lands and leases. In areas where pooling is voluntary, it may be more



                                      -8-
<PAGE>   9

difficult to form units and, therefore, more difficult to develop a prospect if
the operator owns less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state
conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells,
generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements
regarding the ratability of production. The effect of these regulations is to
limit the amount of oil and gas the Company can produce from its wells and to
limit the number of wells or the locations at which the Company can drill. The
extent of any impact on the Company of such restrictions cannot be predicted.

Environmental and Occupational Regulation

    General. The Company's activities are subject to existing federal, state and
local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution
control. It is anticipated that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary
event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, rules and
regulations concerning the protection of the environment and human health will
not have a material effect upon the operations, capital expenditures, earnings
or the competitive position of the Company. The Company cannot predict what
effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies thereunder and
claims for damages for injuries to property, employees, other persons and the
environment resulting from the Company's operations could have on its
activities.

    Activities of the Company with respect to the exploration, development and
production of oil and natural gas are subject to stringent environmental
regulation by state and federal authorities including the United States
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"). Such regulation has increased the cost
of planning, designing, drilling, operating and in some instances, abandoning
wells. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and
disposal of drilling and production waste products and waste created by water
and air pollution control procedures. Although the Company believes that
compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse
effect on operations or earnings, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are
inherent in oil and gas operations, and there can be no assurance that
significant costs and liabilities, including criminal penalties, will not be
incurred. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as stricter
environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages for injuries to
property or persons resulting from the Company's operations could result in
substantial costs and liabilities.

    Waste Disposal. The Company currently owns or leases, and has in the past
owned or leased, numerous properties that for many years have been used for the
exploration and production of oil and gas. Although the Company has utilized
operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time,
hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under
the properties owned or leased by the Company or on or under other locations
where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, many of these
properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or
release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under the Company's control.
State and federal laws applicable to oil and natural gas wastes and properties
have gradually become more strict. Under such laws, the Company could be
required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes
disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination
(including groundwater contamination) or to perform remedial plugging operations
to prevent future contamination.

    The Company generates wastes, including hazardous wastes, that are subject
to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and comparable
state statutes. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the disposal
options for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes and are considering the
adoption of stricter disposal standards for nonhazardous wastes. Furthermore,
certain wastes generated by the Company's oil and natural gas operations that
are currently exempt from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be
designated as hazardous wastes, and therefore be subject to considerably more
rigorous and costly operating and disposal requirements.

    Superfund. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and
Liability Act ("CERCLA"), also known as the "Superfund" law, imposes liability,
without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain
classes of persons with respect to the release of a "hazardous substance" into
the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a site and
persons that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the


                                      -9-
<PAGE>   10

hazardous substances found at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in
some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public
health or the environment and to seek to recover from responsible classes of
persons the costs of such action. In the course of its operations, the Company
may have generated and may generate wastes that fall within CERCLA's definition
of "hazardous substances". The Company may also be or have been an owner of
sites on which "hazardous substances" have been released. The Company may be
responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which
such wastes have been released. To date, however, neither the Company nor, to
its knowledge, its predecessors or successors have been named a potentially
responsible party under CERCLA or similar state superfund laws affecting
property owned or leased by the Company.

    Air Emissions. The operations of the Company are subject to local, state and
federal regulations for the control of emissions of air pollution. Legal and
regulatory requirements in this area are increasing, and there can be no
assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred in the
future as a result of new regulatory developments. In particular, regulations
promulgated under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 may impose additional
compliance requirements that could affect the Company's operations. However, it
is impossible to predict accurately the effect, if any, of the Clean Air Act
Amendments on the Company at this time. The Company may in the future be subject
to civil or administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly
with air regulations or permits. These enforcement actions are generally
resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified
deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could require the Company to
forego construction or operation of certain air emission sources.

    OSHA. The Company is subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational
Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard
communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title
III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and similar state
statutes require the Company to organize information about hazardous materials
used, released or produced in its operations. Certain of this information must
be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local
citizens. The Company is also subject to the requirements and reporting set
forth in OSHA workplace standards. The Company provides safety training and
personal protective equipment to its employees.

    OPA and Clean Water Act. Federal regulations require certain owners or
operators of facilities that store or otherwise handle oil, such as the Company,
to prepare and implement spill prevention control plans, countermeasure plans
and facilities response plans relating to the possible discharge of oil into
surface waters. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA") amends certain provisions
of the federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, commonly referred to as the
Clean Water Act ("CWA"), and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of
and response to oil spills into navigable waters. The OPA subjects owners of
facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup
costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited
to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. The CWA
provides penalties for any discharges of petroleum product in reportable
quantities and imposes substantial liability for the costs of removing a spill.
State laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and
criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of releases of petroleum or its
derivatives into surface waters or into the ground. Regulations are currently
being developed under OPA and state laws concerning oil pollution prevention and
other matters that may impose additional regulatory burdens on the Company. In
addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require permits to be obtained to
authorize discharges into surface waters or to construct facilities in wetland
areas. With respect to certain of its operations, the Company is required to
maintain such permits or meet general permit requirements. The EPA has adopted
regulations concerning discharges of storm water runoff. This program requires
covered facilities to obtain individual permits, participate in a group permit
or seek coverage under an EPA general permit. The Company believes that with
respect to existing properties it has obtained, or is included under, such
permits and with respect to future operations it will be able to obtain, or be
included under, such permits, where necessary. Compliance with such permits is
not expected to have a material effect on the Company.

    NORM. Oil and gas exploration and production activities have been identified
as generators of concentrations of low-level naturally-occurring radioactive
materials ("NORM"). NORM regulations have recently been adopted in several
states. The Company is unable to estimate the effect of these regulations,
although based upon the


                                      -10-
<PAGE>   11

Company's preliminary analysis to date, the Company does not believe that its
compliance with such regulations will have a material adverse effect on its
operations or financial condition.

    Safe Drinking Water Act. The Company's operations involve the disposal of
produced saltwater and other nonhazardous oilfield wastes by reinjection into
the subsurface. Under the Safe Drinking Water Act ("SDWA"), oil and gas
operators, such as the Company, must obtain a permit for the construction and
operation of underground Class II injection wells. To protect against
contamination of drinking water, periodic mechanical integrity tests are often
required to be performed by the well operator. The Company has obtained such
permits for the Class II wells it operates. The Company also has disposed of
wastes in facilities other than those owned by the Company which are commercial
Class II injection wells.

    Toxic Substances Control Act. The Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA") was
enacted to control the adverse effects of newly manufactured and existing
chemical substances. Under the TSCA, the EPA has issued specific rules and
regulations governing the use, labeling, maintenance, removal from service and
disposal of PCB items, such as transformers and capacitors used by oil and gas
companies. The Company may own such PCB items but does not believe compliance
with TSCA has or will have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations
or financial condition.

TITLE TO PROPERTIES

    Title to properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net
profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements
customary in the oil and gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due
and to other encumbrances. As is customary in the industry in the case of
undeveloped properties, only cursory investigation of record title is made at
the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before
commencement of drilling operations. From time to time, the Company's title to
oil and gas properties is challenged through legal proceedings. The Company is
routinely involved in litigation involving title to certain of its oil and gas
properties, some of which management believes could be adverse to the Company,
individually or in the aggregate. See Item 3 - Legal Proceedings.

OPERATING HAZARDS AND INSURANCE

    The oil and gas business involves a variety of operating risks, including
the risk of fire, explosions, blow-outs, pipe failure, abnormally pressured
formations and environmental hazards such as oil spills, gas leaks, ruptures or
discharges of toxic gases, the occurrence of any of which could result in
substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, severe damage
to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or
other environmental damage, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigation
and penalties and suspension of operations. The Company's horizontal and deep
drilling activities involve greater risk of mechanical problems than vertical
and shallow drilling operations.

    The Company maintains a $50 million oil and gas lease operator policy that
insures the Company against certain sudden and accidental risks associated with
drilling, completing and operating its wells. There can be no assurance that
this insurance will be adequate to cover any losses or exposure to liability.
The Company also carries comprehensive general liability policies and a $75
million umbrella policy. The Company and its subsidiaries carry workers'
compensation insurance in all states in which they operate and a $75 million
employment practice liability policy. While the Company believes these policies
are customary in the industry, they do not provide complete coverage against all
operating risks.

EMPLOYEES

    The Company had 424 full-time employees as of December 31, 1999. No
employees are represented by organized labor unions. The Company considers its
employee relations to be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

    The Company focuses its natural gas exploration, development and acquisition
efforts in three areas: (i) the Mid-Continent (consisting of Oklahoma, western
Arkansas, southwestern Kansas and the Texas Panhandle), (ii) the onshore Gulf
Coast in Texas and Louisiana, and (iii) the Helmet area in northeastern British
Columbia. In addition, Chesapeake has active oil exploration and development
programs in southeast New Mexico; and in portions of North Dakota; Montana; and
Saskatchewan, Canada which comprise the Williston Basin.

    During the year ended December 31, 1999 ("1999"), the Company participated
in 211 gross (119.7 net) wells, 135 of which were Company operated. A summary of
the Company's drilling activities, capital expenditures and property sales by

    The Company's proved reserves increased 11% to an estimated 1,206 Bcfe at
December 31, 1999, compared to 1,091 Bcfe of estimated proved reserves at
December 31, 1998 (see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8).

    The Company's strategy for 2000 is to continue developing its natural gas
assets by drilling, selective acquisitions and miscellaneous property
divestitures. Accordingly, the Company has established a capital expenditure
budget of $170-$190 million, including approximately $130-$140 million allocated
to drilling, acreage acquisition, seismic and related capitalized internal
costs, and $40-$50 million for acquisitions, debt repayment and general
corporate purposes. This budget is subject to adjustment based on drilling
results, oil and gas prices, and other factors.

PRIMARY OPERATING AREAS

    Mid-Continent Region. The Company's Mid-Continent proved reserves of 758
Bcfe represented 63% of the Company's total proved reserves as of December 31,
1999 and this area produced 70 Bcfe, or 52% of the Company's 1999 production.

    During 1999, the Company invested approximately $56 million to drill 169
gross (95.3 net) wells in the Mid-Continent. The Company anticipates spending
approximately 55%-60% of its total budget for exploration and development
activities in the Mid-Continent region during 2000. The Company anticipates the
Mid-Continent will contribute approximately 79 Bcfe of production during 2000,
or 56% of expected total production.

    Gulf Coast. The Company's Gulf Coast proved reserves, consisting of the
Austin Chalk Trend in Texas and Louisiana, the Wharton County area in Texas, and
the Tuscaloosa Trend in Louisiana, represented 190 Bcfe, or 15% of the Company's
total proved reserves as of December 31, 1999. During 1999, the Gulf Coast
assets produced 45 Bcfe, or 34% of the Company's total production. The Company
anticipates the Gulf Coast will contribute approximately 39 Bcfe of production
during 2000, or 28% of expected total production.

    During 1999, the Company invested approximately $22 million to drill 10
gross (3.7 net) wells in the Gulf Coast. For 2000, the Company anticipates
spending approximately 15%-20% of its total budget for exploration and
development activities in the Gulf Coast region.

    Helmet Area. The Company's Canadian proved reserves of 178 Bcfe represented
15% of the Company's total proved reserves at December 31, 1999. During 1999,
production from Canada was 12 Bcfe, or 9% of the


                                      -14-
<PAGE>   15


Company's total production. During 1999, the Company invested approximately $27
million to drill 12 gross (7.5 net) wells, install various pipelines and
compressors, and to perform capital workovers in Canada. The Company anticipates
spending approximately 10% of its total budget for exploration and development
activities in Canada during 2000, and expects production of 12 Bcfe in Canada,
or 9% of the Company's estimated total production for 2000.

OTHER OPERATING AREAS

    In addition to the primary operating areas described above which are focused
on natural gas properties, the Company maintains operations in the Permian Basin
in New Mexico, and the Williston Basin in North Dakota; Montana; and
Saskatchewan, Canada which are focused on developing oil properties. In 1999,
these areas contributed 7 Bcfe, or 5% of the Company's total production. In
2000, production levels should increase to approximately 11 Bcfe as a result of
the Company allocating approximately 10% of its total budget for exploration and
development activities in these areas.

OIL AND GAS RESERVES

    The tables below set forth information as of December 31, 1999 with respect
to the Company's estimated proved reserves, the estimated future net revenue
therefrom and the present value thereof at such date. Williamson Petroleum
Consultants, Inc. evaluated 50% and Ryder Scott Company evaluated 16% of the
Company's combined discounted future net revenues from the Company's estimated
proved reserves at December 31, 1999. The remaining properties were evaluated
internally by the Company's engineers. All estimates were prepared based upon a
review of production histories and other geologic, economic, ownership and
engineering data developed by the Company. The present value of estimated future
net revenue shown is not intended to represent the current market value of the
estimated oil and gas reserves owned by the Company.

(a)      Estimated future net revenue represents estimated future gross revenue
         to be generated from the production of proved reserves, net of
         estimated production and future development costs, using prices and
         costs in effect at December 31, 1999. The amounts shown do not give
         effect to non-property related expenses, such as general and
         administrative expenses, debt service and future income tax expense or
         to depreciation, depletion and amortization. The prices used in the
         external and internal reports yield weighted average prices of $24.72
         per barrel of oil and $2.25 per Mcf of gas.


    The future net revenue attributable to the Company's estimated proved
undeveloped reserves of $420.9 million at December 31, 1999, and the $221.5
million present value thereof, have been calculated assuming that the Company
will expend approximately $212.5 million to develop these reserves. The amount
and timing of these expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including
actual drilling results, product prices and the availability of capital.

    No estimates of proved reserves comparable to those included herein have
been included in reports to any federal agency other than the Securities and
Exchange Commission.


                                      -15-
<PAGE>   16

    The Company's ownership interest used in calculating proved reserves and the
estimated future net revenue therefrom was determined after giving effect to the
assumed maximum participation by other parties to the Company's farmout and
participation agreements. The prices used in calculating the estimated future
net revenue attributable to proved reserves do not reflect market prices for oil
and gas production sold subsequent to December 31, 1999. There can be no
assurance that all of the estimated proved reserves will be produced and sold at
the assumed prices or that existing contracts will be honored or judicially
enforced.

    There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved
reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development
expenditures, including many factors beyond the control of the Company. The
reserve data set forth herein represent only estimates. Reserve engineering is a
subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that
cannot be measured in an exact way, and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is
a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological
interpretation and judgment. As a result, estimates made by different engineers
often vary. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production subsequent
to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimates, and such
revisions may be material. Accordingly, reserve estimates are often different
from the actual quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered.
Furthermore, the estimated future net revenue from proved reserves and the
present value thereof are based upon certain assumptions, including prices,
future production levels and cost, that may not prove correct. Predictions about
prices and future production levels are subject to great uncertainty, and the
foregoing uncertainties are particularly true as to proved undeveloped reserves,
which are inherently less certain than proved developed reserves and which
comprise a significant portion of the Company's proved reserves.

    See Item 1 and Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
included in Item 8 for a description of the Company's primary and other
operating areas, production and other information regarding its oil and gas
properties.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

         The Company is subject to ordinary routine litigation incidental to its
business. In addition, the following matters are pending or were recently
terminated:

         Securities Litigation. On March 3, 2000, the U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Oklahoma dismissed a consolidated class action complaint
styled In re Chesapeake Energy Corporation Securities Litigation. The complaint,
which consolidated twelve purported class action suits filed in August and
September 1997, alleged violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 by the Company and certain of its officers and directors.
The action was brought on behalf of purchasers of the Company's common stock and
common stock options between January 25, 1996 and June 27, 1997. The complaint
alleged that the defendants made material misrepresentations and failed to
disclose material facts about the Company's exploration and drilling activities
in the Louisiana Trend. The Court ruled that Chesapeake had disclosed the
precise risks of its Louisiana Trend activities.

         Bayard Drilling Technologies, Inc. On July 30, 1998, the plaintiffs in
Yuan, et al. v. Bayard, et al. filed an amended class action complaint in the
U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma alleging violations of
Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 408 of the Oklahoma
Securities Act by the Company and others. The action, originally filed in
February 1998, was brought purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased
Bayard common stock in, or traceable to, Bayard's initial public offering in
November 1997. The defendants include officers and directors of Bayard who
signed the registration statement, selling shareholders (including the Company)
and underwriters of the offering. Total proceeds of the offering were $254
million, of which the Company received net proceeds of $90 million.

         Plaintiffs allege that the Company, which owned 30.1% of Bayard's
outstanding common stock prior to the offering, was a controlling person of
Bayard. Plaintiffs also allege that the Company had established an interlocking
financial relationship with Bayard and was a customer of Bayard's drilling
services under allegedly below-market terms. Plaintiffs assert that the Bayard
prospectus contained material omissions and misstatements relating to (i) the
Company's financial "problems" and their impact on Bayard's operating results,
(ii) increased


                                      -16-
<PAGE>   17


costs associated with Bayard's growth strategy, (iii) undisclosed pending
related-party transactions between Bayard and third parties other than the
Company, (iv) Bayard's planned use of offering proceeds and (v) Bayard's capital
expenditures and liquidity. The alleged defective disclosures are claimed to
have resulted in a decline in Bayard's share price following the public
offering. Plaintiffs seek a determination that the suit is a proper class action
and damages in an unspecified amount or rescission, together with interest and
costs of litigation, including attorneys' fees.

         On August 24, 1999, the District Court entered an order granting in
part and denying in part defendants' motion to dismiss the action. The court
dismissed plaintiffs' claims against the Company under Section 15 of the
Securities Act of 1933 alleging that Chesapeake was a "controlling person" of
Bayard. The Court denied that portion of defendants' motion seeking dismissal of
plaintiffs' claims under Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933
and Section 408 of the Oklahoma Securities Act. Of these, only the Section 11
claim and the Section 408 claim are asserted against the Company. The court has
also entered an order setting September 15, 2000 as the cutoff for merits
discovery, November 1, 2000 for the filing of any dispositive motions and
February 1, 2001 as the trial date.

         The Company believes that it has meritorious defenses to these claims
and intends to defend this action vigorously. No estimate of loss or range of
estimate of loss, if any, can be made at this time. Bayard, which was acquired
by Nabors Industries, Inc. in April 1999, has been reimbursing the Company for
its costs of defense as incurred.

         Patent Litigation. In Union Pacific Resources Company v. Chesapeake, et
al., filed in October 1996 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District
of Texas, Fort Worth Division, UPRC asserted that the Company had infringed
UPRC's patent covering a "geosteering" method utilized in drilling horizontal
wells. Following a trial to the court in June 1999, the court ruled on September
21, 1999 that the patent was invalid. Because the patent was declared invalid,
the court held that the Company could not have infringed the patent, dismissed
all of UPRC's claims with prejudice and assessed court costs against UPRC. The
court concluded that the UPRC patent was invalid for failure to definitively
describe the patented method in the patent claims and for failure to provide
sufficient disclosure in the patent to enable one of ordinary skill in the art
to practice the patented method. Appeals of the judgment by both the Company and
UPRC are pending in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. Management is unable
to predict the outcome of these appeals but believes the invalidity of the
patent will be upheld on appeal. The Company has appealed the trial court's
ruling denying the Company's request for attorneys' fees.

         West Panhandle Field Cessation Cases. A subsidiary of the Company,
Chesapeake Panhandle Limited Partnership ("CP") (f/k/a MC Panhandle, Inc.), and
two subsidiaries of Kinder Morgan, Inc. are defendants in 13 lawsuits filed
between June 1997 and January 1999 by royalty owners seeking the cancellation of
oil and gas leases in the West Panhandle Field in Texas. MC Panhandle, Inc.,
which the Company acquired in April 1998, has owned the leases since January 1,
1997. The co-defendants are prior lessees.

         Plaintiffs claim the leases terminated upon the cessation of production
for various periods primarily during the 1960s. In addition, plaintiffs seek to
recover conversion damages, exemplary damages, attorneys' fees and interest.
Defendants assert that any cessation of production was excused and have pled
affirmative defenses of limitations, waiver, temporary estoppel, laches and
title by adverse possession. Four of the 13 cases have been tried; two are
scheduled to be tried in May and June 2000; and trial dates have not been set
for the other cases.

         Following are the cases pending or tried in the District Court of Moore
County, Texas, 69th Judicial District:

         Lois Law, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 97-70, filed December 22, 1997,
jury trial in June 1999, verdict for Company and co-defendants. The jury found
plaintiffs' claims were barred by adverse possession, laches and revivor. On
January 19, 2000, the court granted plaintiffs' motion for judgment
notwithstanding verdict and entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs. In addition
to quieting title to the lease (including existing gas wells and all attached
equipment) in plaintiffs, the court awarded actual damages against CP in the
amount of $716,400 and


                                      -17-
<PAGE>   18

exemplary damages in the amount of $25,000. The court further awarded, jointly
and severally from all defendants, $160,000 in attorneys' fees and interest and
court costs. CP and the other defendants have filed a motion to reconsider, a
motion for new trial, and a notice of appeal.

         Joseph H. Pool, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-30, first filed December
17, 1997, refiled May 11, 1998, jury trial in June 1999, verdict for Company and
co-defendants. The jury found plaintiffs' claims were barred by laches and
adverse possession. On September 28, 1999, the court granted plaintiffs' motion
for judgment notwithstanding verdict and entered judgment in favor of
plaintiffs. In addition to quieting title to the lease (including existing gas
wells and all attached equipment) in plaintiffs, the court awarded actual
damages as of June 28, 1999 of $545,000 from CP and $235,000 jointly and
severally from the other two defendants. The court further awarded, jointly and
severally from all defendants, $77,500 of attorneys' fees in the event of an
appeal, $1,900 of sanctions, interest and court costs. CP and the other two
defendants filed an appeal of the judgment in the Court of Appeals for the
Seventh District of Texas in Amarillo on October 12, 1999, and they have each
posted a supersedeas bond.

         Joseph H. Pool, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-36, first filed February
2, 1998, refiled May 20, 1998, jury trial in July 1999, verdict for plaintiffs.
The jury found that the defendants were bad-faith trespassers and produced gas
from the leases as a result of fraud. On September 28, 1999, the court entered
final judgment for plaintiffs terminating the lease, quieting title to the lease
(including existing gas wells and all attached equipment) in plaintiffs as of
June 1, 1999 and awarding actual damages of $1.5 million, attorneys' fees of
$97,500 in the event of an appeal, interest and court costs. CP's liability for
this award is joint and several with the other two defendants. The court also
awarded exemplary damages of $1.2 million against each of CP and the other two
defendants. CP and the other two defendants filed an appeal of the judgment in
the Court of Appeals for the Seventh District of Texas in Amarillo on October
12, 1999, and they have each posted a supersedeas bond.

         A. C. Smith, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-47, first filed January 26,
1998, refiled May 29, 1998. On June 18, 1999, the court granted plaintiffs'
motion for summary judgment in part, finding that the lease had terminated due
to the cessation of production, subject to the defendants' affirmative defenses.
A jury trial is scheduled in May 2000.

         Joseph H. Pool, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-35, first filed February
2, 1998, refiled May 20, 1998. On December 3, 1999, the Court entered a partial
summary judgment finding the lease had terminated and that defendants'
affirmative defenses all failed as a matter of law except with respect to the
defense of revivor against certain of the plaintiffs. CP and the other
defendants filed a motion to reconsider on December 22, 1999.

         Joseph H. Pool, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-49, first filed March
10, 1998, refiled May 29, 1998.

         Joseph H. Pool, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-50, first filed March
18, 1998, refiled May 29, 1998.

         Joseph H. Pool, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-51, first filed December
2, 1997, refiled May 29, 1998.

         Joseph H. Pool, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-48, first filed February
2, 1998, refiled May 29, 1998.

         Joseph H. Pool, et al. v. NGPL, et al., No. 98-70, first filed March
23, 1998, refiled October 22, 1998.

         The Pool cases listed above were first filed in the U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Texas, Amarillo Division. Other related cases
pending are the following:

         Phillip Thompson, et al. v. NGPL, et al, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Texas, Amarillo Division, Nos. 2:98-CV-012 and 2:98-CV-106, filed
January 8, 1998 and March 18, 1998, respectively (actions consolidated), jury
trial in May 1999, verdict for Company and co-defendants. The jury found
plaintiffs' claims were barred by the payment of shut-in royalties, laches, and
revivor. Plaintiffs have filed a motion for a new trial.

         Craig Fuller, et al. v. NGPL, et al., District Court of Carson County,
Texas, 100th Judicial District, No. 8456, filed June 23, 1997, cross motions for
summary judgment pending. No trial date has been set.

         Pace v. NGPL et al., U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas,
Amarillo Division, filed January 29, 1999. Defendants' motion for summary
judgment pending. Trial date in June 2000.

         Ralph W. Coon, et al. v. MC Panhandle, Inc., et al., U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Texas, Lufkin Division, No. 2:98-CV-63, filed March
27, 1998. All lease termination claims have been withdrawn. Only royalty
calculation issues remain.

         The Company has previously established an accrued liability that
management believes will be sufficient to cover the estimated costs of
litigation for each of these cases. Because of the inconsistent verdicts reached
by the juries in the four cases tried to date and because the amount of damages
sought is not specified in all of the other cases, the outcome of the remaining
trials and the amount of damages that might ultimately be awarded could differ
from management's estimates. Management believes, however, that the leases are
valid, there is no basis for exemplary damages and that any findings of fraud or
bad faith will be overturned on appeal. CP and the other defendants intend to
vigorously defend against the plaintiffs' claims.

DIVIDENDS

    The Company paid quarterly dividends of $0.02 per common share from July
1997 to July 1998. In September 1998 the Board of Directors determined that
because of low oil and natural gas prices the payment of cash dividends on the
common stock should be cancelled. The payment of future cash dividends, if any,
will be reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors and will depend upon,
among other things, the Company's financial condition, funds from operations,
the level of its capital and development expenditures, its future business
prospects and any contractual restrictions.

    Two of the indentures governing the Company's outstanding senior notes
contain restrictions on the Company's ability to declare and pay dividends.
Under these indentures, the Company may not pay any cash dividends on its common
or preferred stock if (i) a default or an event of default has occurred and is
continuing at the time of or immediately after giving effect to the dividend
payment, (ii) the Company would not be able to incur at least $1 of additional
indebtedness under the terms of the indentures, or (iii) immediately after
giving effect to the dividend payment, the aggregate of all dividends and other
restricted payments declared or made after the respective issue dates of the
notes exceeds the sum of specified income, proceeds from the issuance of stock
and debt by the Company and other amounts from the quarter in which the
respective note issuances occurred to the quarter immediately preceding the date
of the dividend payment. From December 31, 1998 through December 31, 1999, the
Company did not meet the debt incurrence tests under these indentures and was
not able to pay dividends on its preferred stock.

    Subsequent to December 31, 1999, the Company entered into a number of
unsolicited transactions whereby the Company issued approximately 8.8 million
shares of the Company's common shares in exchange for 625,000 shares of the
Company's preferred stock. This reduced the liquidation amount of preferred
stock outstanding by $31.3 million to $198.7 million, and reduced the amount of
preferred dividends in arrears by $2.9 million to $19.3 million as of February
29, 2000.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

    The following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data of the
Company for each of the two fiscal years ended June 30, 1997, the six-month
Transition Period ended December 31, 1997, the six months ended December 31,
1996 and the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997. The data are
derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company,
although the periods for the year ended December 31, 1997 and the six months
ended December 31, 1996 have not been audited. Acquisitions made by the Company
during the first and second quarters of 1998 materially affect the comparability
of the selected financial data for 1997 and 1998. Each of the acquisitions was
accounted for using the purchase method. The table should be read in conjunction
with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" and the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes
thereto, appearing in Items 7 and 8 of this report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Years Ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

    General. In 1999, the Company had net income of $33.3 million, or $0.16 per
diluted common share, on total revenues of $354.9 million. This compares to a
net loss of $933.9 million, or a loss of $9.97 per diluted common share, on
total revenues of $377.9 million during the year ended December 31, 1998
("1998"), and a net loss of $233.4 million, or a loss of $3.30 per diluted
common share, on total revenues of $302.8 million during the year ended December
31, 1997 ("1997"). The loss in 1998 was caused primarily by an $826.0 million
oil and gas property writedown recorded under the full-cost method of accounting
and a $55.0 million writedown of other assets. The loss in 1997 was caused
primarily by a $346 million oil and gas property writedown. See "Impairment of

    Natural gas production represented approximately 81% of the Company's total
production volume on an equivalent basis in 1999, compared to 72% in 1998 and
74% in 1997.

    For 1999, the Company realized an average price per barrel of oil of $16.01,
compared to $12.70 in 1998 and $19.39 in 1997. Gas price realizations fluctuated
from an average of $1.92 per Mcf in 1998 and $2.20 in 1997 to $1.97 per Mcf in
1999. The Company's hedging activities resulted in a decrease in oil and gas
revenues of $1.7 million in 1999, an increase in oil and gas revenues of $11.3
million in 1998, and a decrease in oil and gas revenues of $4.6 million in 1997.

    Oil and Gas Marketing Sales. The Company realized $74.5 million in oil and
gas marketing sales for third parties in 1999, with corresponding oil and gas
marketing expenses of $71.5 million, for a net margin of $3.0 million. This
compares to sales of $121.1 million and $104.4 million, expenses of $119.0
million and $103.8 million, and a margin of $2.1 million and $0.6 million in
1998 and 1997, respectively.

    Production Expenses and Taxes. Production expenses and taxes, which include
lifting costs, production taxes and ad valorem taxes, were $59.6 million in
1999, compared to $59.5 million and $19.3 million in 1998 and 1997,
respectively. On a unit of production basis, production expenses and taxes were
$0.45 per Mcfe in 1999 and 1998, and $0.24 per Mcfe in 1997. The Company expects
that lease operating expenses per Mcfe will generally remain at current levels
throughout 2000, although production taxes will increase as a result of
increased oil and gas prices.

    Impairment of Oil and Gas Properties. The Company utilizes the full-cost
method to account for its investment in oil and gas properties. Under this
method, all costs of acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas
reserves (including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs, geological and
geophysical expenditures, certain capitalized internal costs, dry hole costs and
tangible and intangible development costs) are capitalized as incurred. These
oil and gas property costs, along with the estimated future capital expenditures
to develop proved undeveloped reserves, are depleted and charged to operations
using the unit-of-production method based on the ratio of current production to
proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by the Company's independent
engineering consultants and Company engineers. Costs directly associated with
the acquisition and evaluation of unproved properties are excluded from the
amortization computation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves
can be assigned to the property or whether impairment has occurred. The excess
of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation,
depletion and amortization and related deferred income taxes, over the
discounted future net revenues of proved oil and gas properties is charged to
operations.

    The Company incurred an impairment of oil and gas properties charge of $826
million in 1998. No such charge was incurred in 1999. The 1998 writedown was
caused by a combination of several factors, including the acquisitions completed
by the Company during 1998, which were accounted for using the purchase method,
and the significant decreases in oil and gas prices throughout 1998. Oil and gas
prices used to value the Company's proved reserves decreased from $17.62 per Bbl
of oil and $2.29 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 1997, to $10.48 per Bbl of oil
and $1.68 per Mcf of gas at December 31, 1998. Higher drilling and completion
costs and the evaluation of certain leasehold, seismic and other
exploration-related costs that were previously unevaluated were the remaining
factors which contributed to the writedown in 1998.

    The Company incurred an impairment of oil and gas properties charge of $346
million during 1997. The writedown in 1997 was caused by several factors,
including declining oil and gas prices during the year, escalating drilling and
completion costs, and poor drilling results primarily in Louisiana.

    Impairment of Other Assets. The Company incurred a $55 million impairment
charge during 1998. Of this amount, $30 million related to the Company's
investment in preferred stock of Gothic Energy Corporation, and the remainder
was related to certain of the Company's gas processing and transportation assets
located in Louisiana. No such charge was recorded in 1999 or 1997.

    Oil and Gas Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation,
depletion and amortization ("DD&A") of oil and gas properties was $95.0 million,
$146.6 million and $127.4 million during 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively. The
average DD&A rate per Mcfe, which is a function of capitalized costs, future
development costs, and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented,
was $0.71 ($0.73 in U.S. and $0.52 in Canada), $1.13


                                      -24-
<PAGE>   25

($1.17 in U.S. and $0.43 in Canada) and $1.59 (U.S. only) in 1999, 1998 and
1997, respectively. The Company expects the 2000 DD&A rate to be between $0.75
and $0.80 per Mcfe.

    Depreciation and Amortization of Other Assets. Depreciation and amortization
("D&A") of other assets was $7.8 million in 1999, compared to $8.1 million in
1998 and $4.4 million in 1997. The increase in 1998 compared to 1997 was caused
by increased investments in depreciable buildings and equipment and increased
amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the issuance of senior notes
in April 1998.

    General and Administrative. General and administrative ("G&A") expenses,
which are net of capitalized internal payroll and non-payroll expenses (see Note
11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were $13.5 million in 1999,
$19.9 million in 1998 and $10.9 million in 1997. The decrease in 1999 compared
to 1998 was due primarily to various actions taken to lower corporate overhead,
including staff reductions and office closings which occurred in late 1998 and
early 1999. The increase in 1998 compared to 1997 is due primarily to increased
personnel expenses required by the Company's growth and industry wage inflation.
The Company capitalized $2.7 million, $5.3 million and $5.3 million of internal
costs in 1999, 1998 and 1997, respectively, directly related to the Company's
oil and gas exploration and development efforts. The Company anticipates that
G&A costs for 2000 per Mcfe will remain at approximately the same level as 1999.

    Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income for 1999 was $8.6
million compared to $3.9 million in 1998, and $87.7 million in 1997. The
increase from 1998 to 1999 was due primarily to gains on sales of various
non-core assets during 1999. During 1997, the Company realized a gain on the
sale of its Bayard common stock of $73.8 million, the most significant component
of interest and other income.

    Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $81.1 million in 1999,
compared to $68.2 million in 1998 and $29.8 million in 1997. The increase in
1999 is due primarily to a full year of interest on the Company's $500 million
senior notes. The increase in 1998 compared to 1997 was due primarily to the
issuance of $500 million of senior notes in April 1998. In addition to the
interest expense reported, the Company capitalized $3.5 million of interest
during 1999, compared to $6.5 million capitalized in 1998, and $10.4 million
capitalized in 1997. The Company anticipates that capitalized interest for 2000
will be between $3 million and $4 million.

    Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes. The Company recorded income taxes of
$1.8 million in 1999 compared to $0 in 1998 and an income tax benefit of $17.9
million in 1997. The income tax expense recorded in 1999 is related entirely to
the Company's Canadian operations.

    At December 31, 1999, the Company had a U.S. net operating loss carryforward
of approximately $613 million for regular federal income taxes which will expire
in future years beginning in 2007. Management believes that it cannot be
demonstrated at this time that it is more likely than not that the deferred
income tax assets, comprised primarily of the net operating loss carryforwards
generated for U.S. purposes, will be realizable in future years, and therefore a
valuation allowance of $442 million has been recorded. The Company does not
expect to record any net income tax expense related to its U.S. operations in
2000 based on information available at this time.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Years Ended December 31, 1999, 1998 and 1997

    Cash Flows from Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities
(inclusive of changes in working capital) was $145.0 million in 1999, compared
to $94.6 million in 1998 and $181.3 million in 1997. The increase of $50.4
million from 1998 to 1999 was due primarily to increased oil and gas revenues.
The decrease of $86.7 million from 1997 to 1998 was due primarily to reduced
operating income resulting from significant decreases in average oil and gas
prices between periods, as well as significant increases in G&A expenses and
interest expense.


                                      -25-
<PAGE>   26

    Cash Flows from Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities
decreased to $159.8 million in 1999, compared to $548.1 million in 1998 and
$476.2 million in 1997. During 1999, the Company invested $153.3 million for
exploration and development drilling, $49.9 million for the acquisition of oil
and gas properties, and received $45.6 million related to divestitures of oil
and gas properties. During 1998, $279.9 million was used to acquire certain oil
and gas properties and companies with oil and gas reserves. However, the
increase in cash used to acquire oil and gas properties was partially offset by
reduced expenditures during 1998 for exploratory and developmental drilling.
During 1998 and 1997, the Company invested $259.7 million and $471.0 million,
respectively, for exploratory and developmental drilling. Also during 1998, the
Company sold its 19.9% stake in Pan East Petroleum Corp. to Poco Petroleums,
Ltd. for approximately $21.2 million. During 1997 the Company received net
proceeds from the sale of its investment in Bayard common stock of approximately
$90.4 million.

    Cash Flows from Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities
decreased to $19.0 million in 1999, compared to $363.8 million in 1998, and
$278.0 million in 1997. During 1999, the Company made additional borrowings
under its commercial bank credit facility of $116.5 million, and had payments
under this facility of $98.0 million. During 1998, the Company retired $85
million of debt assumed at the completion of the DLB Oil & Gas, Inc.
acquisition, $120 million of debt assumed at the completion of the Hugoton
Energy Corporation acquisition, $90 million of senior notes, and $170 million of
borrowings made under its commercial bank credit facilities. Also during 1998,
the Company issued $500 million in senior notes and $230 million in preferred
stock. During 1997, the Company issued $300 million of senior notes.

Financial Flexibility and Liquidity

    The Company had working capital of $9.4 million at December 31, 1999 and a
cash balance of $38.7 million. The Company has a $50 million revolving bank
credit facility which matures in January 2001, with an initial committed
borrowing base of $50 million. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had borrowed
$43.5 million under this facility. Borrowings under the facility are secured by
certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at a variable rate,
which was 9.75% per annum as of December 31, 1999.

    At December 31, 1999, the Company's senior notes represented $919.2 million
of its $964.1 million of long-term debt. Debt ratings for the senior notes are
B3 by Moody's Investors Service and B by Standard & Poor's Corporation as of
March 22, 2000. There are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the
senior notes until March 2004, when $150 million is due.

    The senior note indentures restrict the ability of the Company and its
restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness. As of December 31,
1999, the Company estimates that secured commercial bank indebtedness of $147
million could have been incurred within these restrictions. The indenture
restrictions do not apply to borrowings incurred by CEMI, an unrestricted
subsidiary.

    The senior note indentures also limit the Company's ability to make
restricted payments (as defined), including the payment of preferred stock
dividends, unless certain tests are met. From December 31, 1998 through December
31, 1999, the Company was unable to meet the requirements to incur additional
unsecured indebtedness, and consequently was not able to pay cash dividends on
its 7% cumulative convertible preferred stock. The Company had accumulated
dividends in arrears of $19.3 million related to its preferred stock as of
February 29, 2000. Subsequent payments will be subject to the same restrictions
and are dependent upon variables that are beyond the Company's ability to
predict. This restriction does not affect the Company's ability to borrow under
or expand its secured commercial bank facility. If the Company fails to pay
dividends for six quarterly periods, the holders of preferred stock will be
entitled to elect two new directors to the Board. Based on current projections
of cash flow and fixed charges, the Company does not expect to be able to pay a
dividend on the preferred stock on May 1, 2000, which would be the sixth
consecutive dividend payment date on which dividends have not been paid.

    In January and February 2000, the Company engaged in five separate
transactions with two institutional investors in which the Company exchanged a
total of 8.8 million shares of common stock (both newly issued and treasury
shares) for 625,000 shares of its issued and outstanding preferred stock with a
liquidation value of $31.3


                                      -26-
<PAGE>   27

million plus dividends in arrears of $2.9 million. All preferred shares acquired
in these transactions were cancelled and retired and will have the status of
authorized but unissued shares of undesignated preferred stock.

    The Company believes it has adequate resources, including cash on hand,
budgeted cash flow from operations and proceeds from miscellaneous asset sales,
to fund its capital expenditure budget for exploration and development
activities during 2000, which are currently estimated to be approximately
$130-$140 million. However, low oil and gas prices or unfavorable drilling
results could cause the Company to reduce its drilling program, which is largely
discretionary.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

    On June 15, 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("FAS 133").
FAS 133 establishes a new model for accounting for derivatives and hedging
activities and supersedes and amends a number of existing standards. FAS 133 (as
amended by FAS 137) is effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years
beginning after June 15, 2000.

    FAS 133 standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring
that all derivatives be recognized as assets and liabilities and measured at
fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives (gains
and losses) depends on (i) whether the derivative is designated and qualifies as
a hedge, and (ii) the type of hedging relationship that exists. Changes in the
fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges or that do not meet
the hedge accounting criteria in FAS 133 are required to be reported in
earnings. In addition, all hedging relationships must be designated, reassessed
and documented pursuant to the provisions of FAS 133. The Company has not yet
determined the impact that adoption of FAS 133 will have on the financial
statements. However, the Company believes that all of its derivative instruments
will be designated as hedges in accordance with the relevant accounting
criteria, and therefore the impact of the adoption of FAS 133 is not expected to
have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

    This Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

    The Company's results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices
received for oil and natural gas production.

HEDGING ACTIVITIES

    Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a
portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include:

    (i)    swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above which
           the Company pays the counterparty and below which the Company is paid
           by the counterparty,

    (ii)   the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor" price
           below which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by which the
           price of the commodity is below the contracted floor,

    (iii)  the sale of index-related calls that provide for a "ceiling" price
           above which the Company pays the counterparty the amount by which the
           price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling, and

    (iv)   basis protection swaps, which are arrangements that guarantee the
           price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point or
           points.

    Results from commodity hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas
sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas production. The Company
only enters into commodity hedging transactions related to the Company's oil and
gas production volumes or CEMI's physical purchase or sale commitments. Gains or
losses on crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are recognized as price
adjustments in the months of related production.

    As of December 31, 1999, the Company had the following open natural gas swap
arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the Company's domestic gas
production for periods after December 1999:

    If the swap arrangements listed above had been settled on December 31, 1999,
the Company would have incurred a gain of $0.5 million.

    As of December 31, 1999, the Company had no open oil swap arrangements.

    The Company has also closed transactions designed to hedge a portion of the
Company's domestic oil and natural gas production. The net unrecognized losses
resulting from these transactions, $3.9 million as of December 31, 1999, will be
recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production. These
hedging gains and losses are set forth below ($ in thousands):

Subsequent to December 31, 1999, the Company entered into the following natural

    In addition to commodity hedging transactions related to the Company's oil
and gas production, CEMI periodically enters into various hedging transactions
designed to hedge against physical purchase and sale commitments made by CEMI.
Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas
marketing sales in the consolidated statements of operations and are not
considered by management to be material.

INTEREST RATE RISK

    The Company also utilizes hedging strategies to manage fixed-interest rate
exposure. Through the use of a swap arrangement, the Company believes it can
benefit from stable or falling interest rates and reduce its current interest
expense. During 1999, the Company's interest rate swap resulted in a $2.0
million reduction of interest expense. The terms of the swap agreement are as
follows:

If the floating rate is less than the fixed rate, the counterparty will pay the
Company accordingly. If the floating rate exceeds the fixed rate, the Company
will pay the counterparty.

interest rates by expected maturity dates. The fair value of the long-term debt

SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULE OF NON-CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES:

    In November 1999, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer of
Chesapeake tendered to Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. ("CEMI") 2,320,107
shares of Chesapeake common stock in full satisfaction of two notes payable to
CEMI with a combined outstanding balance of $7.6 million.

    During 1999, the Company issued a $2.2 million note payable as consideration
for the acquisition of certain oil and gas properties.

    The Company had a financing arrangement with a vendor to supply certain oil
and gas equipment inventory, which was terminated during the Transition Period.
The total amount owed at June 30, 1997 was $1,380,000. No cash consideration is
exchanged for inventory under this financing arrangement until actual draws on
the inventory are made.

    In fiscal 1997, the Company recognized income tax benefits of $4,808,000
related to the disposition of stock options by directors and employees of the
Company. The tax benefits were recorded as an adjustment to deferred income
taxes and paid-in capital.

    Proceeds from the issuance of $500 million of 9.625% senior notes in April
1998 and $300 million of senior notes ($150 million of 7.875% senior notes and
$150 million of 8.5% senior notes) in March 1997, are net of $11.7 million and
$6.4 million, respectively, in offering fees and expenses which were deducted
from the actual cash received.

    On December 22, 1997, the Company declared a dividend of $0.02 per common
share, or $1,486,000, which was paid on January 15, 1998. On June 13, 1997 the
Company declared a dividend of $0.02 per common share, or $1,405,000, which was
paid on July 15, 1997.

              The accompanying notes are an integral part of these
                       consolidated financial statements.

                 CHESAPEAKE ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Description of Company

    The Company is an oil and natural gas exploration and production company
engaged in the acquisition, exploration, and development of properties for the
production of crude oil and natural gas from underground reservoirs. The
Company's properties are located in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Kansas, Montana, Colorado, North Dakota, New Mexico and British Columbia and
Saskatchewan, Canada.

    These consolidated financial statements relate to the years ended December
31, 1999 ("1999"), December 31, 1998 ("1998") and June 30, 1997 ("fiscal 1997").
The Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31 in 1997. The
Company's results of operations and cash flows for the six months ended December
31, 1997 (the "Transition Period") are also included in these consolidated
financial statements.

Principles of Consolidation

    The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Chesapeake Energy
Corporation include the accounts of its direct and indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries (the "Company"). All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies and partnerships
which give the Company significant influence, but not control, over the investee
are accounted for using the equity method.

Accounting Estimates

    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents

    For purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the Company considers
investments in all highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of three
months or less at date of purchase to be cash equivalents.

Investments in Securities

    The Company invests in various equity securities and short-term debt
instruments including corporate bonds and auction preferreds, commercial paper
and government agency notes. The Company has classified all of its short-term
investments in equity and debt instruments as trading securities, which are
carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in
earnings. Investments in equity securities and limited partnerships that do not
have readily determinable fair values are stated at cost and are included in
noncurrent other assets. In determining realized gains and losses, the cost of
securities sold is based on the average cost method.

Inventory

    Inventory consists primarily of tubular goods and other lease and well
equipment which the Company plans to utilize in its ongoing exploration and
development activities and is carried at the lower of cost or market using the
specific identification method.


                                      -37-
<PAGE>   38

Oil and Gas Properties

    The Company follows the full-cost method of accounting under which all costs
associated with property acquisition, exploration and development activities are
capitalized. The Company capitalizes internal costs that can be directly
identified with its acquisition, exploration and development activities and does
not include any costs related to production, general corporate overhead or
similar activities (see Note 11). Capitalized costs are amortized on a composite
unit-of-production method based on proved oil and gas reserves. As of December
31, 1999, approximately 66% of the Company's proved reserve value (based on SEC
PV10%) was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers, with the balance
evaluated by the Company's engineers. In addition, the company's engineers
evaluate all properties quarterly. The average composite rates used for
depreciation, depletion and amortization were $0.71 ($0.73 in U.S. and $0.52 in
Canada) per equivalent Mcf in 1999, $1.13 ($1.17 in U.S. and $0.43 in Canada)
per equivalent Mcf in 1998, $1.57 per equivalent Mcf in the Transition Period
and $1.31 per equivalent Mcf in fiscal 1997. The Company did not have operations
in Canada prior to 1998.

    Proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions to
capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the
relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying
value of unproved properties, in which case a gain or loss is recognized. The
costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties
are evaluated. The Company reviews all of its unevaluated properties quarterly
to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been
assigned to the properties, and otherwise if impairment has occurred.
Unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual
property costs are not significant, and assessed individually when individual
costs are significant.

    The Company reviews the carrying value of its oil and gas properties under
the full-cost accounting rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission on a
quarterly basis. Under these rules, capitalized costs, less accumulated
amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount equal
to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated
future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved
reserves, less any related income tax effects. During 1998, capitalized costs of
oil and gas properties exceeded the estimated present value of future net
revenues from the Company's proved reserves, net of related income tax
considerations, resulting in writedowns in the carrying value of oil and gas
properties of $826 million. During the Transition Period, capitalized costs of
oil and gas properties exceeded the estimated present value of future net
revenues from the Company's proved reserves, net of related income tax
considerations, resulting in a writedown in the carrying value of oil and gas
properties of $110 million. During fiscal 1997, capitalized costs of oil and gas
properties exceeded the estimated present value of future net revenues from the
Company's proved reserves, net of related income tax considerations, resulting
in a writedown in the carrying value of oil and gas properties of $236 million.

Other Property and Equipment

    Other property and equipment consists primarily of gas gathering and
processing facilities, vehicles, land, office buildings and equipment, and
software. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized while the costs of
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. The costs of assets
retired or otherwise disposed of and the applicable accumulated depreciation are
removed from the accounts, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in
operations. Other property and equipment costs are depreciated on both
straight-line and accelerated methods. Buildings are depreciated on a
straight-line basis over 31.5 years. All other property and equipment are
depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from five
to seven years.

Capitalized Interest

    During 1999, 1998, the Transition Period and fiscal 1997, interest of
approximately $3.5 million, $6.5 million, $5.1 million and $12.9 million,
respectively, was capitalized on significant investments in unproved properties
that were not being currently depreciated, depleted, or amortized and on which
exploration activities were in progress.

Income Taxes

    The Company has adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting for Income Taxes ("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109 requires deferred tax
liabilities or assets to be recognized for the anticipated future tax effects of
temporary differences that arise as a result of the differences in the carrying
amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 128, Earnings Per Share
("SFAS 128") requires presentation of "basic" and "diluted" earnings per share,
as defined, on the face of the statement of operations for all entities with
complex capital structures. SFAS 128 requires a reconciliation of the numerator
and denominator of the basic and diluted EPS computations. For 1998, the
Transition Period and fiscal 1997, there was no difference between actual
weighted average shares outstanding, which are used in computing basic EPS, and
diluted weighted average shares, which are used in computing diluted EPS.
Options to purchase 12.9 million, 11.3 million, 8.3 million and 7.9 million
shares of common stock at weighted average exercise prices of $1.76, $1.86,
$5.49 and $7.09 were outstanding during 1999, 1998, the Transition Period and
fiscal 1997 but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because the
effect of these outstanding options would be antidilutive. A reconciliation for
1999 is as follows:

</TABLE>

Gas Imbalances -- Revenue Recognition

    Revenues from the sale of oil and gas production are recognized when title
passes, net of royalties. The Company follows the "sales method" of accounting
for its gas revenue whereby the Company recognizes sales revenue on all gas sold
to its purchasers, regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to the
Company's ownership in the property. A liability is recognized only to the
extent that the Company has a net imbalance in excess of the remaining gas
reserves on the underlying properties. The Company's net imbalance positions at
December 31, 1999 and 1998 were not material.

Hedging

    The Company periodically uses certain instruments to hedge its exposure to
price fluctuations on oil and natural gas transactions and interest rates.
Recognized gains and losses on hedge contracts are reported as a component of
the related transaction. Results of oil and gas hedging transactions are
reflected in oil and gas sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and
gas production, in oil and gas marketing sales to the extent related to the
Company's marketing activities, and in interest expense to the extent so
related.

Debt Issue Costs

    Included in other assets are costs associated with the issuance of the
senior notes. The remaining unamortized costs on these issuances of senior notes
at December 31, 1999 totaled $16.6 million and are being amortized over the life
of the senior notes.

Comprehensive Income

    In 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting Comprehensive Income.
This statement establishes rules for the reporting of comprehensive income and
its components. Comprehensive income consists of net income and foreign currency
translation adjustments and is presented in the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) and Comprehensive Income (Loss). The adoption of
SFAS 130 had no impact on total stockholders' equity. Prior year financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the SFAS 130 requirements. All
balance sheet accounts of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at
the year-end rate of exchange and statement of operations items are translated
at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.

Reclassifications

    Certain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial
statements for 1998, the Transition Period, and fiscal 1997 to conform to the
presentation used for the 1999 consolidated financial statements.

2. SENIOR NOTES

    On April 22, 1998, the Company issued $500 million principal amount of
9.625% Senior Notes due 2005 ("9.625% Senior Notes"). The 9.625% Senior Notes
are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time on or after May 1, 2002
at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture or at the make-whole prices,
as set forth in the indenture, if redeemed prior to May 1, 2002. The Company may
also redeem at its option up to $167 million of the 9.625% Senior Notes at
109.625% of their principal amount with the proceeds of an equity offering
completed prior to May 1, 2001.

    On March 17, 1997, the Company issued $150 million principal amount of
7.875% Senior Notes due 2004 ("7.875% Senior Notes"). The 7.875% Senior Notes
are redeemable at the option of the Company at any time prior to March 15, 2004
at the make-whole prices determined in accordance with the indenture.

    Also on March 17, 1997, the Company issued $150 million principal amount of
8.5% Senior Notes due 2012 ("8.5% Senior Notes"). The 8.5% Senior Notes are
redeemable at the option of the Company at any time prior to March 15, 2004 at
the make-whole prices determined in accordance with the indenture and, on or
after March 15, 2004 at the redemption prices set forth therein.

    On April 9, 1996, the Company issued $120 million principal amount of 9.125%
Senior Notes due 2006 ("9.125% Senior Notes"). The 9.125% Senior Notes are
redeemable at the option of the Company at any time prior to April 15, 2001 at
the make-whole prices determined in accordance with the indenture and, on or
after April 15, 2001 at the redemption prices set forth therein.

    On May 25, 1995, the Company issued $90 million principal amount of 10.5%
Senior Notes due 2002 ("10.5% Senior Notes"). In April 1998, the Company
purchased all of its 10.5% Senior Notes for approximately $99 million. The early
retirement of these notes resulted in an extraordinary charge of $13.3 million.

    The Company is a holding company and owns no operating assets and has no
significant operations independent of its subsidiaries. The Company's
obligations under the 9.625% Senior Notes, the 9.125% Senior Notes, the 7.875%
Senior Notes and the 8.5% Senior Notes have been fully and unconditionally
guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, by each of the Company's "Restricted
Subsidiaries" (as defined in the respective indentures governing the Senior
Notes) (collectively, the "Guarantor Subsidiaries"). Each of the Guarantor
Subsidiaries is a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

    The senior note indentures contain certain covenants, including covenants
limiting the Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries with respect to asset sales;
restricted payments; the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the issuance
of preferred stock; liens; sale and leaseback transactions; lines of business;
dividend and other payment restrictions affecting Guarantor Subsidiaries;
mergers or consolidations; and transactions with affiliates.



                                      -40-
<PAGE>   41

The Company is obligated to repurchase the 9.625% and 9.125% Senior Notes in the
event of a change of control or certain asset sales.

    The senior note indentures also limit the Company's ability to make
restricted payments (as defined), including the payment of preferred stock
dividends, unless certain tests are met. From December 31, 1998 through December
31, 1999, the Company was unable to meet the requirements to incur additional
unsecured indebtedness, and consequently was not able to pay cash dividends on
its 7% cumulative convertible preferred stock. The Company had accumulated
dividends in arrears of $19.3 million related to its preferred stock as of
February 29, 2000. Subsequent payments will be subject to the same restrictions
and are dependent upon variables that are beyond the Company's ability to
predict. This restriction does not affect the Company's ability to borrow under
or expand its secured commercial bank facility. If the Company fails to pay
dividends for six quarterly periods, the holders of preferred stock will be
entitled to elect two new directors to the Board. Based on current projections
of cash flow and fixed charges, the Company does not expect to be able to pay a
dividend on the preferred stock on May 1, 2000, which would be the sixth
consecutive dividend payment date on which dividends have not been paid.

    Set forth below are condensed consolidating financial statements of the
Guarantor Subsidiaries, the Company's subsidiaries which are not guarantors of
the Senior Notes (the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries") and the Company. Separate
audited financial statements of each Guarantor Subsidiary have not been provided
because management has determined that they are not material to investors.

    Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. ("CEMI") was a Non-Guarantor Subsidiary
for all periods presented. The following were additional Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries: Chesapeake Acquisition Corporation during the Transition Period
and Chesapeake Canada Corporation during fiscal 1997. All of the Company's other
subsidiaries were Guarantor Subsidiaries during all periods presented.

4. CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS

Bayard Securities Litigation

    A purported class action alleging violations of the Securities Act of 1933
and the Oklahoma Securities Act was first filed in February 1998 against the
Company and others on behalf of investors who purchased common stock of Bayard
Drilling Technologies, Inc. ("Bayard") in, or traceable to, its initial public
offering in November 1997. Total proceeds of the offering were $254 million, of
which the Company received net proceeds of $90 million as a selling shareholder.
Plaintiffs allege that the Company, a major customer of Bayard's drilling
services and the owner of 30.1% of Bayard's common stock outstanding prior to
the offering, was a controlling person of Bayard. Alleged defective disclosures
are claimed to have resulted in a decline in Bayard's share price following the
public offering. Plaintiffs seek a determination that the suit is a proper class
action and damages in an unspecified amount or rescission, together with
interest and costs of litigation, including attorneys' fees.

    On August 24, 1999, the court dismissed plaintiffs' claims against the
Company under Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 alleging that the Company
was a "controlling person" of Bayard. Claims under Section 11 of the Securities
Act of 1933 and Section 408 of the Oklahoma Securities Act continue to be
asserted against the Company. The Company believes that it has meritorious
defenses to these claims and intends to defend this action vigorously. No
estimate of loss or range of estimate of loss, if any, can be made at this time.
Bayard, which was acquired by Nabors Industries, Inc. in April 1999, has been
reimbursing the Company for its costs of defense as incurred.

Patent Litigation

    On September 21, 1999, judgment was entered in favor of the Company in a
patent infringement lawsuit tried to the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Texas, Fort Worth Division. Filed in October 1996, the lawsuit
asserted that the Company had infringed a patent belonging to Union Pacific
Resources Company. The court declared the patent invalid, held that the Company
could not have infringed the patent, dismissed all of UPRC's claims with
prejudice and assessed court costs against UPRC. Appeals of the judgment by both
the Company and UPRC are pending in the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. The
Company has appealed the trial


                                      -49-
<PAGE>   50

court's ruling denying the Company's request for attorneys' fees. Management is
unable to predict the outcome of these appeals but believes the invalidity of
the patent will be upheld on appeal.

West Panhandle Field Cessation Cases

    A subsidiary of the Company, Chesapeake Panhandle Limited Partnership ("CP")
(f/k/a MC Panhandle, Inc.), and two subsidiaries of Kinder Morgan, Inc. are
defendants in 13 lawsuits filed between June 1997 and January 1999 by royalty
owners seeking the cancellation of oil and gas leases in the West Panhandle
Field in Texas. The Company acquired MC Panhandle, Inc. on April 28, 1998. MC
Panhandle, Inc. has owned the leases since January 1, 1997, and the
co-defendants are prior lessees. Plaintiffs claim the leases terminated upon the
cessation of production for various periods primarily during the 1960s. In
addition, plaintiffs seek to recover conversion damages, exemplary damages,
attorneys' fees and interest. Defendants assert that any cessation of production
was excused and have pled affirmative defenses of limitations, waiver, temporary
estoppel, laches and title by adverse possession.

    Of the ten cases filed in the District Court of Moore County, Texas, 69th
Judicial District, three have been tried to a jury. Judgment has been entered
against CP and its co-defendants in all three cases, although there was a jury
verdict in two of the cases in favor of defendants. The Company's aggregate
liability for these judgments is $1.3 million of actual damages and $1.2 million
of exemplary damages and, jointly and severally with the other two defendants,
$1.5 million of actual damages and $337,000 of attorneys' fees in the event of
an appeal, sanctions, interest and court costs. The court also quieted title to
the leases in dispute in plaintiffs. CP and the other defendants have each
appealed the judgments and posted supersedeas bonds in two of these cases and
post-trial motions are pending in the other one. One of the other Moore County,
Texas cases has been set for trial in May 2000. There are three related cases
pending in other courts. One is set for trial in June 2000, and another, in the
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, Amarillo Division, resulted in
a jury verdict for CP and its co-defendants. Judgment has not yet been entered
in this case.

    The Company has previously established an accrued liability that management
believes will be sufficient to cover the estimated costs of litigation for each
of these cases. Because of the inconsistent verdicts reached by the juries in
the four cases tried to date and because the amount of damages sought is not
specified in all of the other cases, the outcome of the remaining trials and the
amount of damages that might ultimately be awarded could differ from
management's estimates. Management believes, however, that the leases are valid,
there is no basis for exemplary damages and that any findings of fraud or bad
faith will be overturned on appeal. CP and the other defendants intend to
vigorously defend against the plaintiffs' claims.

    The Company is currently involved in various other routine disputes
incidental to its business operations. While it is not possible to determine the
ultimate disposition of these matters, management, after consultation with legal
counsel, is of the opinion that the final resolution of all such currently
pending or threatened litigation is not likely to have a material adverse effect
on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company.

    The Company has employment contracts with its two principal shareholders and
its chief financial officer and various other senior management personnel which
provide for annual base salaries, bonus compensation and various benefits. The
contracts provide for the continuation of salary and benefits for varying terms
in the event of termination of employment without cause. These agreements expire
at various times from June 30, 2000 through June 30, 2003.

    Due to the nature of the oil and gas business, the Company and its
subsidiaries are exposed to possible environmental risks. The Company has
implemented various policies and procedures to avoid environmental contamination
and risks from environmental contamination. The Company is not aware of any
potential material environmental issues or claims.

5. INCOME TAXES

    The components of the income tax provision (benefit) for each of the periods
are as follows:

</TABLE>

    SFAS 109 requires that the Company record a valuation allowance when it is
more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. In 1998, the Company recorded an $826 million writedown related
to the impairment of oil and gas properties. The writedown and significant tax
net operating loss carryforwards (caused primarily by expensing intangible
drilling costs for tax purposes) resulted in a net deferred tax asset at
December 31, 1999 and 1998. The Company expects to generate future U.S. tax net
operating losses for the foreseeable future. Management has determined that it
is more likely than not that the net U.S. deferred tax assets will not be
realized and has recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net U.S. deferred
tax asset.

    At December 31, 1998, $5.7 million of the valuation allowance was related to
the Company's Canadian deferred tax assets. During 1999, this valuation
allowance was eliminated as part of a purchase price reallocation related to a
1999 acquisition.

    At December 31, 1999, the Company had a U.S. regular tax net operating loss
carryforward of approximately $613 million and a U.S. alternative minimum tax
net operating loss carryforward of approximately $267 million. The U.S. loss
carryforward amounts will expire during the years 2007 through 2019. The Company
also had a U.S. percentage depletion carryforward of approximately $5 million at
December 31, 1999, which is available to offset future U.S. federal income taxes
payable and has no expiration date.

    In accordance with certain provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, a
change of greater than 50% of the beneficial ownership of the Company within a
three-year period (an "Ownership Change") would place an annual limitation on
the Company's ability to utilize its existing tax carryforwards. Under
regulations issued by the


                                      -51-
<PAGE>   52

Internal Revenue Service, the Company has had two Ownership Changes. However,
these ownership changes have not resulted in a significant limitation of the tax
carryforwards.

6. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

    Certain directors, shareholders and employees of the Company have acquired
working interests in certain of the Company's oil and gas properties. The owners
of such working interests are required to pay their proportionate share of all
costs. As of December 31, 1999 and 1998, the Company had accounts receivable
from related parties, primarily related to such participation, of $4.6 million
and $5.6 million, respectively.

    As of December 31, 1998, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating
Officer of the Company had notes payable to CEMI in the principal amount of $9.9
million. In November 1999, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating
Officer tendered to CEMI 2,320,107 shares of Chesapeake common stock in full
satisfaction of the notes payable to CEMI with a combined outstanding balance of
$7.6 million. The common stock was valued at $3.29 per share, which was the
market value of the stock at the time of the transaction.

    During 1999, 1998, the Transition Period and fiscal 1997, the Company
incurred legal expenses of $398,000, $493,000, $388,000 and $207,000,
respectively, for legal services provided by a law firm of which a director is a
member.

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

    The Company maintains the Chesapeake Energy Corporation Savings and
Incentive Stock Bonus Plan, a 401(k) profit sharing plan. Eligible employees may
make voluntary contributions to the plan which are matched by the Company for up
to 10% of the employee's annual salary with the Company's common stock purchased
in the open-market. The amount of employee contribution is limited as specified
in the plan. The Company may, at its discretion, make additional contributions
to the plan. The Company contributed $1,163,000, $1,359,000, $418,000 and
$603,000 to the plan during 1999, 1998, the Transition Period and fiscal 1997,
respectively.

    Management believes that the loss of any of the above customers would not
have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or its financial
position.

    The Company believes all of its material operations are part of the oil and
gas industry, and therefore reports as a single industry segment. Beginning in
1998, the Company began foreign operations in Canada. The geographic

9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

    In November 1999, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Operating
Officer of Chesapeake tendered to CEMI 2,320,107 shares of Chesapeake common
stock in full satisfaction of two notes payable to CEMI with a combined
outstanding balance of $7.6 million. See Note 6.

    During 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved the expenditure of up
to $30 million to purchase outstanding Company common stock. As of August 25,
1998, the Company had purchased approximately 8.5 million shares of common stock
for an aggregate amount of $30 million pursuant to such authorization.

    On April 28, 1998, the Company acquired by merger the Mid-Continent
operations of DLB Oil & Gas, Inc. ("DLB") for $17.5 million in cash, 5 million
shares of the Company's common stock, and the assumption of $90 million in
outstanding debt and working capital obligations.

    On April 22, 1998, the Company issued $230 million (4.6 million shares) of
its 7% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, $50 per share liquidation
preference, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of $223 million.

    On March 10, 1998, the Company acquired Hugoton Energy Corporation
("Hugoton") pursuant to a merger by issuing approximately 25.8 million shares of
the Company's common stock in exchange for 100% of Hugoton's common stock.

    On December 16, 1997, the Company acquired AnSon Production Corporation.
Consideration for this merger was approximately $43 million consisting of the
issuance of approximately 3.8 million shares of Company common stock and cash
consideration in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement.

    On December 2, 1996, the Company completed a public offering of
approximately 9.0 million shares of common stock at a price of $33.63 per share,
resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $288.1 million.

    A 2-for-1 stock split of the common stock in December 1996 has been given
retroactive effect in these financial statements.

Stock Option Plans

    The Company's 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "ISO Plan") terminated
on December 16, 1994. Until then, the Company granted incentive stock options to
purchase common stock under the ISO Plan to employees. Subject to any adjustment
as provided by the ISO Plan, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued
and sold may not exceed 3,762,000 shares. The maximum period for exercise of an
option may not be more than 10 years (or five years for an optionee who owns
more than 10% of the common stock) from the date of grant, and the exercise
price may not be less than the fair market value of the shares underlying the
options on the date of grant

(or 110% of such value for an optionee who owns more than 10% of the common
stock). Options granted become exercisable at dates determined by the Stock
Option Committee of the Board of Directors.

    Under the Company's 1992 Nonstatutory Stock Option Plan (the "NSO Plan"),
non-qualified options to purchase common stock may be granted only to directors
and consultants of the Company. Subject to any adjustment as provided by the NSO
Plan, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued and sold may not exceed
3,132,000 shares. The maximum period for exercise of an option may not be more
than 10 years from the date of grant, and the exercise price may not be less
than the fair market value of the shares underlying the options on the date of
grant. Options granted become exercisable at dates determined by the Stock
Option Committee of the Board of Directors. The NSO Plan also contains a formula
award provision pursuant to which each director who is not an executive officer
receives every quarter a ten-year immediately exercisable option to purchase
6,250 shares of common stock at an option price equal to the fair market value
of the shares on the date of grant. The amount of the award was changed
increased from 20,000 shares (post-split) to 15,000 shares per year in 1998 and
to 25,000 shares per year in 1999. No options can be granted under the NSO Plan
after December 10, 2002.

    Under the Company's 1994 Stock Option Plan (the "1994 Plan"), and its 1996
Stock Option Plan (the "1996 Plan"), incentive and nonqualified stock options to
purchase Common Stock may be granted to employees and consultants of the Company
and its subsidiaries. Subject to any adjustment as provided by the respective
plans, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued and sold may not
exceed 4,886,910 shares under the 1994 Plan and 6,000,000 shares under the 1996
Plan. The maximum period for exercise of an option may not be more than 10 years
from the date of grant and the exercise price of nonqualified stock options may
not be less than par value and, under the 1996 Plan, 85% of the fair market
value of the shares underlying the options on the date of grant. Options granted
become exercisable at dates determined by the Stock Option Committee of the
Board of Directors. No options can be granted under the 1994 Plan after October
17, 2004 or under the 1996 Plan after October 14, 2006.

    Under the Company's 1999 Stock Option Plan (the "1999 Plan"), nonqualified
stock options to purchase Common Stock may be granted to employees and
consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries. Subject to any adjustment as
provided by the plan, the aggregate number of shares which may be issued and
sold may not exceed 3,000,000 shares. The maximum period for exercise of an
option may not be more than 10 years from the date of grant and the exercise
price may not be less than the fair market value of the shares underlying the
options on the date of grant; provided, however, nonqualified stock options not
exceeding 10% of the options issuable under the 1999 Plan may be granted at an
exercise price which is not less than 85% of the grant date fair market value.
Options granted become exercisable at dates determined by the Stock Option
Committee of the Board of Directors. No options can be granted under the 1999
Plan after March 4, 2009.

    The Company has elected to follow APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to
Employees and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock
options. Under APB No. 25, compensation expense is recognized for the difference
between the option price and market value on the measurement date. No
compensation expense has been recognized because the exercise price of the stock
options granted under the plans equaled the market price of the underlying stock
on the date of grant.

    Pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is
required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted
for its employee stock options under the fair value method of the statement. The
fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using a
Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions for 1999, 1998, the Transition Period and fiscal 1997, respectively:
interest rates (zero-coupon U.S. government issues with a remaining life equal
to the expected term of the options) of 5.88%, 5.20%, 6.45% and 6.74%; dividend
yields of 0.0%, 0.0%, 0.9% and 0.9%; volatility factors of the expected market
price of the Company's common stock of .82, .96, .67 and .60; and
weighted-average expected life of the options of five years.

    The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating
the fair value of traded options which have no vesting restrictions and are
fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of
highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility.
Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective
input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's
opinion the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure
of the fair value of its employee stock options.

    For purposes of the pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the
options is amortized to expense over the options' vesting period, which is four
years. Because the Company's stock options vest over four years and additional
awards are typically made each year, the above pro forma disclosures are not
likely to be representative of the effects on pro forma net income for future
years. A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information

    The exercise of certain stock options results in state and federal income
tax benefits to the Company related to the difference between the market price
of the common stock at the date of disposition and the option price. During
fiscal 1997, $4,808,000 was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in
capital and deferred income



                                      -55-

taxes with respect to such tax benefits. During 1999, 1998 and the Transition
Period, the Company did not recognize any such tax benefits.

10. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

    The Company has only limited involvement with derivative financial
instruments, as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 119
"Disclosure About Derivative Financial Instruments and Fair Value of Financial
Instruments", and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company's primary
objective is to hedge a portion of its exposure to price volatility from
producing crude oil and natural gas. These arrangements may expose the Company
to credit risk from its counterparties and to basis risk. The Company does not
expect that the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations given their
high credit ratings.

Hedging Activities

    Periodically the Company utilizes hedging strategies to hedge the price of a
portion of its future oil and gas production. These strategies include:

        (i)   swap arrangements that establish an index-related price above
              which the Company pays the counterparty and below which the
              Company is paid by the counterparty,

        (ii)  the purchase of index-related puts that provide for a "floor"
              price below which the counterparty pays the Company the amount by
              which the price of the commodity is below the contracted floor,

        (iii) the sale of index-related calls that provide for a "ceiling" price
              above which the Company pays the counterparty the amount by which
              the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling, and

        (iv)  basis protection swaps, which are arrangements that guarantee the
              price differential of oil or gas from a specified delivery point
              or points.

    Results from commodity hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas
sales to the extent related to the Company's oil and gas production. The Company
only enters into commodity hedging transactions related to the Company's oil and
gas production volumes or CEMI's physical purchase or sale commitments. Gains or
losses on crude oil and natural gas hedging transactions are recognized as price
adjustments in the months of related production.

    As of December 31, 1999, the Company had the following open natural gas swap
arrangements designed to hedge a portion of the Company's domestic gas
production for periods after December 1999:

    If the swap arrangements listed above had been settled on December 31, 1999,
the Company would have incurred a gain of $0.5 million.

    As of December 31, 1999, the Company had no open oil swap arrangements.

    The Company has also closed transactions designed to hedge a portion of the
Company's domestic oil and natural gas production. The net unrecognized losses
resulting from these transactions, $3.9 million as of December 31, 1999, will be
recognized as price adjustments in the months of related production. These
hedging gains and losses are set forth below ($ in thousands):

    In addition to commodity hedging transactions related to the Company's oil
and gas production, CEMI periodically enters into various hedging transactions
designed to hedge against physical purchase and sale commitments made by CEMI.
Gains or losses on these transactions are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas
marketing sales in the consolidated statements of operations and are not
considered by management to be material.

Interest Rate Risk

    The Company also utilizes hedging strategies to manage fixed-interest rate
exposure. Through the use of a swap arrangement, the Company believes it can
benefit from stable or falling interest rates and reduce its current interest
expense. During 1999, the Company's interest rate swap resulted in a $2.0
million reduction of interest expense. The terms of the swap agreement are as
follows:

Concentration of Credit Risk

    Other financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to
concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, short-term
investments in debt instruments and trade receivables. The Company's accounts
receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas products and
exploration and production companies which own interests in properties operated
by the Company. The industry concentration has the potential to impact the
Company's overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in
that the customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or
other conditions. The Company generally requires letters of credit for
receivables from customers which are judged to have sub-standard credit, unless
the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. The cash and cash equivalents are
deposited with major banks or institutions with high credit ratings.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

    The following disclosure of the estimated fair value of financial
instruments is made in accordance with the requirements of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of
Financial Instruments". The estimated fair value amounts have been determined by
the Company using available market information and valuation methodologies.
Considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. The use of different market assumptions or valuation
methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.

    The carrying values of items comprising current assets and current
liabilities approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of these
instruments. The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term (including
current maturities), fixed-rate debt using primarily quoted market prices. The
Company's carrying amount for such debt at December 31, 1999 and 1998 was $921.4
million and $919.1 million, respectively, compared to approximate fair values of
$838.7 million and $654.7 million, respectively. The carrying value of other
long-term


                                      -58-
<PAGE>   59

debt approximates its fair value as interest rates are primarily variable, based
on prevailing market rates. The Company estimates the fair value of its
convertible preferred stock, which was issued in April 1998, using quoted market
prices. The Company's carrying amount for such preferred stock at December 31,
1999 and 1998 was $229.8 million and $230.0 million, compared to an approximate
fair value of $119.0 million and $48.9 million, respectively.

    Unproved properties not subject to amortization at December 31, 1999 and
1998 consisted mainly of lease acquisition costs. The Company capitalized
approximately $3.5 million, $6.5 million, $5.1 million and $12.9 million of
interest during 1999, 1998, the Transition Period and fiscal 1997, respectively,
on significant investments in unproved properties that were not yet included in
the amortization base of the full-cost pool. The Company will continue to
evaluate its unevaluated properties; however, the timing of the ultimate
evaluation and disposition of the properties has not been determined.

Results of Operations from Oil and Gas Producing Activities (unaudited)

    The Company's results of operations from oil and gas producing activities
are presented below for 1999, 1998, the Transition Period and fiscal 1997. The
following table includes revenues and expenses associated directly with the
Company's oil and gas producing activities. It does not include any allocation
of the Company's interest costs and, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of
the contribution to consolidated net operating results of the Company's oil and
gas operations.

- ----------

(a) The imputed income tax provision is hypothetical (at the statutory rate) and
    determined without regard to the Company's deduction for general and
    administrative expenses, interest costs and other income tax credits and
    deductions, nor whether the hypothetical tax benefits will be realized.

    Capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income
taxes, cannot exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value (discounted
at 10%) of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to
be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related
income tax effects. At December 31, 1998 and 1997 and June 30, 1997, capitalized
costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the estimated present value of future
net revenues for the Company's proved reserves, net of related income tax
considerations, resulting in writedowns in the carrying value of oil and gas
properties of $826 million, $110 million and $236 million, respectively.

            Company's internal reservoir engineers evaluated 50%, 16%, and 34%
            of the Company's combined discounted future net revenues from the
            Company's estimated proved reserves, respectively.

        o   As of December 31, 1998, Williamson, Ryder Scott, H.J. Gruy and
            Associates, Inc. and the Company's internal reservoir engineers
            evaluated 63%, 12%, 1% and 24% of the Company's combined discounted
            future net revenues from the Company's estimated proved reserves,
            respectively.

        o   As of December 31, 1997, Williamson, Porter Engineering Associates,
            Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and internal reservoir
            engineers evaluated approximately 53%, 42%, 3% and 2% of the
            Company's combined discounted future net revenues from the Company's
            estimated proved reserves, respectively.

        o   As of June 30, 1997, the reserves evaluated by Williamson
            constituted approximately 41% of the Company's combined discounted
            future net revenues from the Company's estimated proved reserves,
            with the remaining reserves being evaluated internally. The reserves
            evaluated internally in fiscal 1997 were subsequently evaluated by
            Williamson with a variance of approximately 4% of total proved
            reserves.

    The information is presented in accordance with regulations prescribed by
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company emphasizes that reserve
estimates are inherently imprecise. The Company's reserve estimates were
generally based upon extrapolation of historical production trends, analogy to
similar properties and

volumetric calculations. Accordingly, these estimates are expected to change,
and such changes could be material and occur in the near term as future
information becomes available.

    Proved oil and gas reserves represent the estimated quantities of crude oil,
natural gas, and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from
known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved
developed oil and gas reserves are those expected to be recovered through
existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. As of December 31,
1997 and June 30, 1997, all of the Company's oil and gas reserves were located
in the United States.

    Presented below is a summary of changes in estimated reserves of the Company
for 1999, 1998, the Transition Period and fiscal 1997:

    During 1999, the Company acquired approximately 101 Bcfe of proved reserves
through purchases of oil and gas properties for consideration of $52 million.
The Company also sold 59 Bcfe of proved reserves for consideration of
approximately $46 million. During 1999, the Company recorded upward revisions of
80 Bcfe to the December 31, 1998 estimates of its U.S. reserves, and downward
revisions of 99 Bcfe to the December 31, 1998 estimates of its Canadian
reserves, for a net Company wide revision of 19 Bcfe, or approximately 1.7%. The
upward revisions to its U.S. reserves were caused by higher oil and gas prices
at December 31, 1999, and actual performance in excess of predicted performance.
Higher prices extend the economic lives of the underlying oil and gas properties
and thereby increase the estimated future reserves. The downward revisions to
its Canadian reserves were caused by a reduction of the Company's proved
undeveloped locations and an increase in projected transportation and operating
costs in Canada, which decreased the economic lives of the underlying
properties.

    During 1998, the Company acquired approximately 750 Bcfe of proved reserves
through mergers or through purchases of oil and gas properties. The total
consideration given for the acquisitions was 30.8 million shares of Company
common stock, $280 million of cash, the assumption of $205 million of debt, and
the incurrence of approximately $20 million of other acquisition related costs.
Also during 1998, the Company recorded downward revisions to the December 31,
1997 estimates of approximately 4,082 MBbl and 60,477 MMcf, or approximately 85
Bcfe. These reserve revisions were primarily attributable to lower oil and gas
prices at December 31, 1998. The weighted average prices used to value the
Company's reserves at December 31, 1998 were $10.48 per barrel of oil and $1.68
per Mcf of gas, as compared to the prices used at December 31, 1997 of $17.62
per barrel of oil and $2.29 per Mcf of gas.

    For the six months ended December 31, 1997, the Company recorded downward
revisions to the June 30, 1997 reserve estimates of approximately 3,428 MBbl and
24,189 MMcf, or approximately 45 Bcfe. The reserve revisions were primarily
attributable to lower than expected results from development drilling and
production which eliminated certain previously established proved reserves.

    On December 16, 1997, Chesapeake acquired AnSon Production Corporation, a
privately owned oil and gas producer based in Oklahoma City. Consideration for
this acquisition was approximately $43 million. The Company estimates that it
acquired approximately 26.4 Bcfe in connection with this acquisition.

    For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1997, the Company recorded downward
revisions to the previous year's reserve estimates of approximately 5,989 MBbl
and 137,938 MMcf, or approximately 174 Bcfe. The reserve revisions were
primarily attributable to the decrease in oil and gas prices between periods,
higher drilling and completion costs, and unfavorable developmental drilling and
production results during fiscal 1997. Specifically, the Company recorded
aggregate downward adjustments to proved reserves of 159 Bcfe for the Knox,
Giddings and Louisiana Trend areas.

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows (unaudited)

    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69 ("SFAS 69") prescribes
guidelines for computing a standardized measure of future net cash flows and
changes therein relating to estimated proved reserves. The Company has followed
these guidelines which are briefly discussed below.

    Future cash inflows and future production and development costs are
determined by applying year-end prices and costs to the estimated quantities of
oil and gas to be produced. Estimates are made of quantities of proved reserves
and the future periods during which they are expected to be produced based on
year-end economic conditions. Estimated future income taxes are computed using
current statutory income tax rates including consideration for the current tax
basis of the properties and related carryforwards, giving effect to permanent
differences and tax credits. The resulting future net cash flows are reduced to
present value amounts by applying a 10% annual discount factor.

    The assumptions used to compute the standardized measure are those
prescribed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and, as such, do not
necessarily reflect the Company's expectations of actual revenue to be derived
from those reserves nor their present worth. The limitations inherent in the
reserve quantity estimation process, as discussed previously, are equally
applicable to the standardized measure computations since these estimates are
the basis for the valuation process.

(a) Total revenue less total operating costs.

    Capitalized costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income
taxes, cannot exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of
estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred
in developing and producing the proved reserves, less any related income tax
effects. At December 31, 1998, June 30, 1998 and March 31, 1998, capitalized
costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the estimated present


                                      -67-
<PAGE>   68

value of future net revenues for the Company's proved reserves, net of related
income tax considerations, resulting in writedowns in the carrying value of oil
and gas properties of $360 million, $216 million and $250 million, respectively.

    During the fourth quarter of 1998, the Company incurred a $55 million
impairment charge to adjust certain non-oil and gas producing assets to their
estimated fair values. Of this amount, $30 million related to the Company's
investment in preferred stock of Gothic Energy Corporation, and the remainder
was related to certain of the Company's gas processing and transportation assets
located in Louisiana.

14. ACQUISITIONS

    During 1998, the Company acquired approximately 750 Bcfe of proved reserves
through mergers or through purchases of oil and gas properties. The total
consideration given for the acquisitions was $280 million of cash, 30.8 million
shares of Company common stock, the assumption of $205 million of debt, and the
incurrence of approximately $20 million of other acquisition related costs.

    In March 1998, the Company acquired Hugoton Energy Corporation ("Hugoton")
pursuant to a merger by issuing 25.8 million shares of the Company's common
stock in exchange for 100% of Hugoton's common stock. The acquisition of Hugoton
was accounted for using the purchase method as of March 1, 1998, and the results
of operations of Hugoton have been included since that date.

    The following unaudited pro forma information has been prepared assuming
Hugoton had been acquired as of the beginning of the periods presented. The pro
forma information is presented for informational purposes only and is not
necessarily indicative of what would have occurred if the acquisition had been
made as of those dates. In addition, the pro forma information is not intended
to be a projection of future results and does not reflect the efficiencies
expected to result from the integration of Hugoton.

    The Company acquired other businesses and oil and gas properties during 1999
and 1998. The results of operations of each of these businesses and properties,
taken individually, were not material in relation to the Company's consolidated
results of operations.

15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

    In January and February 2000, the Company engaged in five separate
transactions with two institutional investors in which the Company exchanged a
total of 8.8 million shares of common stock (both newly issued and treasury
shares) for 625,000 shares of its issued and outstanding preferred stock with a
liquidation value of $31.3 million plus dividends in arrears of $2.9 million.
All preferred shares acquired in these transactions were cancelled and retired
and will have the status of authorized but unissued shares of undesignated
preferred stock.

    In connection with a potential restructuring of Gothic Energy Corporation
("Gothic"), Chesapeake and Gothic agreed in March 2000 to substantially revise
their joint venture originally entered into in March 1998. In addition,
Chesapeake granted Gothic an option to redeem the preferred and common shares of
Gothic held by Chesapeake in exchange for rights to certain undeveloped
leasehold interests covered by the joint venture agreement. The terms of the
agreement are subject to certain conditions, including the approval by certain
of Gothic's creditors. Significant terms of the proposed agreement are as
follows:


                                      -68-
<PAGE>   69

    o   the joint venture is extended for three years to April 30, 2006,

    o   Chesapeake is granted a right of first refusal on any property
        disposition by Gothic,

    o   Chesapeake becomes operator of 28 wells currently operated by Gothic,

    o   Chesapeake will have the first right to drill, complete and operate
        wells in certain areas covered by the joint venture,

    o   Chesapeake granted Gothic the option to redeem its investment in $50
        million liquidation amount of Gothic Series B preferred stock, including
        dividends in arrears, and 2.4 million shares of Gothic common stock, for
        a permanent assignment to Chesapeake of certain undeveloped leasehold
        interests that were originally subject to a reassignment obligation to
        Gothic.
