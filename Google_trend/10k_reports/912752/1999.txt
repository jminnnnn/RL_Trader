ITEM 1. BUSINESS


     The Company is a  diversified  broadcasting  company  that owns or provides
programming  services  to more  television  stations  than any other  commercial
broadcasting group in the United States. The Company currently owns, or provides
programming  services  pursuant to Local  Marketing  Agreements  ("LMAs") to, 57
television  stations,  has pending  acquisitions of four  additional  television
stations, and has entered into an agreement to sell two television stations. The
Company believes it is also one of the top ten radio groups in the United States
when measured by the total number of radio stations owned or programmed pursuant
to LMAs. The Company owns, or programs pursuant to LMAs, 54 radio stations,  two
of which the Company  has  exercised  options to acquire,  and five of which the
Company holds for sale. 

     The 57  television  stations the Company owns or programs  pursuant to LMAs
are located in 36 geographically diverse markets, with 33 of the stations in the
top 51 television  designated  market areas ("DMAs") in the United  States.  The
Company's  television  station group is diverse in network  affiliation  with 20
stations  affiliated  with  Fox  Broadcasting  Company  ("Fox"),  16 with The WB
Television  Network  ("WB"),  eight with  United  Paramount  Television  Network
Partnership  ("UPN"),  six with  ABC,  three  with NBC and one with  CBS.  Three
stations operate as independents.

     The Company's  radio station  group is also  geographically  diverse with a
variety of  programming  formats  including  country,  urban,  news/talk/sports,
progressive  rock and adult  contemporary.  Of the 54 stations owned or provided
programming  services by the Company,  18 broadcast on the AM band and 36 on the
FM band.  The Company owns between  three and nine  stations in all of the radio
markets it serves.

     The Company has undergone rapid and  significant  growth over the course of
the last eight  years.  Since  1991,  the Company  has  increased  the number of
stations it owns or provides  services to from three  television  stations to 57
television  stations and 54 radio  stations.  From 1991 to 1998,  net  broadcast
revenues and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein) increased from $39.7 million to
$672.8 million, and from $15.5 million to $331.3 million, respectively.

     The  Company  is a  Maryland  corporation  formed  in 1986.  The  Company's
principal  offices are  located at 2000 West 41st  Street,  Baltimore,  Maryland
21211, and its telephone number is (410) 467-5005.

Operating Strategy

     The  Company's  television  operating  strategy  includes the following key
elements:

Attracting Viewership
- ---------------------

     The  Company  seeks to attract  viewership  and expand its  audience  share
through selective, high-quality programming.


     Popular  Programming.  The Company seeks to obtain,  at attractive  prices,
popular  syndicated  programming that is complementary to the station's  network
affiliation.  The Company also believes  that an important  factor in attracting
viewership to its stations is their network affiliations with Fox, WB, ABC, CBS,
NBC and UPN. These affiliations  enable the Company to attract viewers by virtue
of the quality first-run original programming provided by these networks and the
networks'  promotion  of such  programming.  The  Company  focuses on  obtaining
popular syndicated  programming for key programming periods (generally 6:00 p.m.
to 8:00 p.m.) for broadcast on its Fox, WB and UPN affiliates.  Examples of this
programming  include  "Friends,"  "Frasier,"  "3rd  Rock  From  the  Sun,"  "The
Simpsons," "Drew Carey" and "Seinfeld." In addition to network programming,  the
Company's network 


                                       3
<PAGE>


affiliates broadcast news magazine, talk show, and game show programming such as
"Hard Copy," "Entertainment Tonight," "Regis and Kathie Lee," "Roseanne," "Rosie
O'Donnel," "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy."

     Local News. The Company  believes that the production and  broadcasting  of
local news can be an important link to the community and an aid to the station's
efforts to expand its  viewership.  In  addition,  local  news  programming  can
provide access to advertising  sources targeted  specifically to local news. The
Company carefully assesses the anticipated benefits and costs of producing local
news prior to introduction at a Company station because a significant investment
in capital equipment is required and substantial operating expenses are incurred
in  introducing,  developing and producing local news  programming.  The Company
currently  provides  local news  programming  at 25 of its  television  stations
located in 21 separate markets.  The possible  introduction of local news at the
other  Company  stations is reviewed  periodically  and the Company has recently
expanded  its news  programming  in some of the  markets in which it  programs a
second station  pursuant to an LMA. The Company can produce news  programming in
these markets at relatively low cost per hour of programming and the programming
serves  the local  community  by  providing  additional  news  outlets  in these
markets.  The  Company's  policy is to  institute  local news  programming  at a
specific station only if the expected  benefits of local news programming at the
station  are  believed  to exceed  the  associated  costs  after an  appropriate
start-up period. 

     Popular  Sporting  Events.  The  Company  attempts  to capture a portion of
advertising  dollars  designated to sports  programming  in selected  DMAs.  The
Company's WB and UPN affiliated and  independent  stations  generally face fewer
restrictions  on   broadcasting   live  local  sporting  events  than  do  their
competitors  that are affiliates of the major networks and Fox since  affiliates
of the major  networks  and Fox are  subject  to  certain  prohibitions  against
preemptions  of network  programming.  The  Company has been able to acquire the
local television  broadcast  rights for certain  sporting events,  including NBA
basketball, Major League Baseball, NFL football, NHL hockey, ACC basketball, Big
Ten football and basketball,  and SEC football.  The Company seeks to expand its
sports broadcasting in DMAs as profitable  opportunities arise. In addition, the
Company's  stations  that are  affiliated  with Fox,  ABC, NBC and CBS broadcast
certain Major League Baseball games,  NFL football games and NHL hockey games as
well as other popular sporting events.

     Counter-Programming. The Company's programming strategy on its Fox, WB, UPN
and independent stations also includes  "counter-programming," which consists of
broadcasting programs that are alternatives to the types of programs being shown
concurrently  on  competing  stations.  This  strategy  is  designed  to attract
additional  audience  share in  demographic  groups  not  served  by  concurrent
programming on competing  stations.  The Company believes that implementation of
this strategy enables its stations to achieve competitive rankings in households
in  the  18-49  and  25-54  demographics  and  to  offer  greater  diversity  of
programming in each of its DMAs. 

Control of Operating and Programming Costs
- ------------------------------------------

     By employing a disciplined approach to managing programming acquisition and
other  costs,  the Company has been able to achieve  operating  margins that the
Company believes are among the highest in the television broadcast industry. The
Company has sought and will continue to seek to acquire quality  programming for
prices  at or  below  prices  paid in the  past.  As an  owner  or  provider  of
programming  services to 57 stations in 36 DMAs reaching  approximately 23.5% of
U.S.   television   households   (without  giving  effect  to  the  Guy  Gannett
Acquisition),  the Company believes that it is able to negotiate favorable terms
for the acquisition of programming.  Moreover, the Company emphasizes control of
each of its stations'  programming and operating costs through  program-specific
profit  analysis,  detailed  budgeting,  tight control over staffing  levels and
detailed long-term planning models.


                                       4
<PAGE>

Attract and Retain High Quality Management
- ------------------------------------------

     The  Company  believes  that much of its  success is due to its  ability to
attract and retain highly skilled and motivated managers,  both at the corporate
and local  station  levels.  A portion of the  compensation  provided to general
managers,  sales managers and other station managers is based on their achieving
certain operating  results.  The Company also provides its corporate and station
managers with deferred  compensation  plans offering  options to acquire Class A
Common Stock.

Community Involvement
- ---------------------

     Each of the Company's  stations actively  participates in various community
activities and offers many community services.  The Company's activities include
broadcasting  programming  of local  interest and  sponsorship  of community and
charitable  events.  The Company also encourages its station employees to become
active members of their communities and to promote  involvement in community and
charitable  affairs.  The Company believes that active community  involvement by
its stations  provides its stations with increased  exposure in their respective
DMAs and ultimately increases viewership and advertising support.

Establish LMAs
- --------------

     The Company  believes  that it can attain  significant  growth in operating
cash flow through the  utilization of LMAs. By expanding its presence in certain
of its markets in which it already  owns a station,  the Company can improve its
competitive  position  with respect to a  demographic  sector.  In addition,  by
providing programming services to an additional station in a market, the Company
is able to realize  significant  economies of scale in  marketing,  programming,
overhead and capital  expenditures.  The Company provides  programming  services
pursuant to an LMA to an additional  station in 21 of the 36 television  markets
in which the Company owns or programs another station.

Innovative Local Sales and Marketing
- ------------------------------------

     The  Company  believes  that it is able to attract new  advertisers  to its
stations and increase its share of existing  customers'  advertising  budgets by
creating a sense of partnership  with those  advertisers.  The Company  develops
such relationships by training its sales forces to offer new marketing ideas and
campaigns to  advertisers.  These  campaigns  often involve the  sponsorship  by
advertisers of local  promotional  events that capitalize on the station's local
identity and  programming  franchises.  In seven of the Company's  markets,  the
Company owns both television and radio stations.  In these markets,  the Company
can offer an  advertiser  an  efficient  means to reach its customer  base.  The
Company   seeks  to   increase   its  share  of  an   advertisers   business  by
cross-marketing  radio and television  time.  Through its strong local sales and
marketing  focus,  the  Company  seeks to  capture  an  increasing  share of its
revenues  from local  sources,  which are  generally  more stable than  national
advertising. 

Programming and Affiliations

     The Company  continually  reviews its existing  programming  inventory  and
seeks to purchase the most  profitable and  cost-effective  syndicated  programs
available  for each time period.  In  developing  its  selection  of  syndicated
programming, the Company balances the cost of available syndicated programs with
their  potential to increase  advertising  revenue and the risk of their reduced
popularity  during  the  term of the  program  contract.  The  Company  seeks to
purchase only those programs with  contractual  periods that permit  programming
flexibility   and  which   complement  a  station's   overall   programming  and
counter-programming  strategy.  Programs that can perform  successfully  in more
than  one  time  period  are  more  attractive  due to the  long  lead  time and
multi-year commitments inherent in program purchasing.

     Fifty-four  of the 57  television  stations  owned or provided  programming
services by the Company currently operate as affiliates of Fox (20 stations), WB
(16 stations),  ABC (six stations),  NBC (three stations), UPN (eight stations),
or CBS (one  station).  The  networks  produce  and  distribute  programming  in
exchange for each station's commitment to air the programming at specified times
and for  commercial  announcement  time  during the  programming.  In  addition,
networks other than Fox, WB and UPN pay each  affiliated  station a fee for each
network-sponsored program broadcast by the station.



                                       5
<PAGE>


     On August 21, 1996,  the Company  entered  into an agreement  with Fox (the
"Fox  Agreement")  which,  among other  things,  provides  that the  affiliation
agreements  between Fox and eight  stations  then owned or provided  programming
services by the Company would be amended to have new five-year terms  commencing
on the date of the Fox Agreement.  The eight affected  stations are:  WPGH-TV in
Pittsburgh,  WBFF-TV in Baltimore,  KABB-TV in San Antonio, WTTE-TV in Columbus,
WSMH-TV in Flint,  KDSM-TV in Des Moines,  WDKY-TV in  Lexington  and WYZZ-TV in
Peoria.  Fox has the option to extend the affiliation  agreements for additional
five-year terms and must extend all of the affiliation  agreements if it extends
any (except that Fox may selectively renew affiliation agreements if any station
has breached its affiliation  agreement).  The Fox Agreement also provides that,
during the term of the affiliation  agreements,  the Company will have the right
to  purchase,  for fair market  value,  any  station Fox  acquires in any of the
foregoing markets if Fox determines to terminate the affiliation  agreement with
the Company's  station in that market and operate the station being  acquired by
Fox as a Fox affiliate.

     The Fox-affiliated stations acquired, to be acquired or being programmed by
the Company as a result of the Sullivan  Acquisition  and Max Media  Acquisition
continue  to  carry  Fox  programming   notwithstanding   the  fact  that  their
affiliation  agreements have expired. The Company is in negotiations with Fox to
secure long-term affiliation agreements. While Fox completes its revision of its
standard-form  Station  Affiliation  Agreement,  Fox has  prepared to enter into
90-day rolling affiliation agreements with these stations.

     On July 4, 1997,  the Company  entered into an  agreement  with WB (the "WB
Agreement"),  pursuant to which the Company  affiliated  certain of its stations
with the WB for a ten year term  expiring  January 15, 2008.  Under the terms of
the WB Agreement (as modified by the subsequent letter agreement entered into by
the Company and WB on May 18, 1998), WB agreed to pay the Company $64 million in
aggregate amount in monthly installments during the first eight years commencing
on January 16, 1998 in consideration  for entering into  affiliation  agreements
with WB.

      statistical  information concerning audience ratings. Due to the nature of
      listener  surveys,  other  radio  ratings  services  may report  different
      rankings;  however,  the Company does not believe  that any radio  ratings
      service  other than Arbitron is accorded  significant  weight in the radio
      broadcast  industry.  "Station Rank in Primary  Demographic Target" is the
      ranking of the  station  among all radio  stations  in its market that are
      ranked  in its  target  demographic  group  and is based on the  station's

Radio Operating Strategy

     The Company's  radio  strategy is to operate a cluster of radio stations in
selected  geographic markets throughout the country.  In each geographic market,
the Company employs  broadly  diversified  programming  formats to appeal to key
demographic  groups  within the market.  The  Company  seeks to  strengthen  the
identity  of  each of its  stations  through  its  programming  and  promotional
efforts,  and emphasizes that identity to a far greater degree than the identity
of any local radio personality.

     The Company believes that its strategy of appealing to diverse  demographic
groups in selected  geographic  markets allows it to reach a larger share of the
overall  advertising  market  while  realizing  economies  of scale and avoiding
dependence  on one  demographic  or  geographic  market.  The  Company  realizes
economies  of scale  by  combining  sales  and  marketing  forces,  back  office
operations and general  management in each geographic  market. At the same time,
the  geographic  diversity of its portfolio of radio  stations  helps lessen the
potential impact of economic  downturns in specific markets and the diversity of
target  audiences  served  helps  lessen  the  impact of  changes  in  listening
preferences.  In addition,  the geographic and demographic  diversity allows the
Company to avoid dependence on any one or any small group of advertisers.

     The  Company's  group of radio  stations  includes the top billing  station
group in four markets and one of the top three billing station groups in each of
its markets other than Milwaukee.  The group has duopolies in all the markets it
operates in and owns television stations in seven of the ten radio markets.

     Depending on the programming  format of a particular  station,  there are a
predetermined  number  of  advertisements   broadcast  each  hour.  The  Company
determines the optimum number of  advertisements  available for sale during each
hour without jeopardizing listening levels (and the resulting ratings). Although
there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements  available
for sale during a particular  time of day,  the total  number of  advertisements
available for sale on a particular station normally does not vary significantly.
Any change in net radio broadcasting revenue, with the exception


                                       8
<PAGE>

of those  instances where stations are acquired or sold, is generally the result
of  pricing  adjustments  made to  ensure  that  the  station  effectively  uses
advertising  time  available for sale, an increase in the number of  commercials
sold or a combination of these two factors.

     Large,  well-trained  local sales forces are  maintained  by the Company in
each of its radio markets.  The Company's principal goal is to utilize its sales
efforts to develop long-standing  customer relationships through frequent direct
contacts,  which the Company believes provides it with a competitive  advantage.
Additionally,  our  super-duopolies and cross-ownership of TV and radio stations
permit the Company to offer creative advertising packages to local, regional and
national advertisers. Each radio station owned or programmed by the Company also
engages a national  independent  sales  representative to assist it in obtaining
national advertising revenues.  These representatives obtain advertising through
national  advertising  agencies and receive a commission  from the radio station
based on its gross revenue from the advertising obtained.


BROADCASTING ACQUISITION STRATEGY

     On February 8, 1996,  the  Telecommunications  Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act")
was signed into law. The 1996 Act represented the most sweeping  overhaul of the
country's  telecommunications  laws  since the  Communications  Act of 1934,  as
amended (the "Communications Act"). The 1996 Act relaxed the broadcast ownership
rules and simplified the process for renewal of broadcast station licenses.


     The enactment of the 1996 Act offered the Company a unique  opportunity  to
build a large and diversified  broadcasting company.  Additionally,  the Company
believes that, as one of the  consolidators  of the industry it has been able to
gain additional  influence with program suppliers,  television  networks,  other
vendors, and alternative delivery media. 

     In implementing its acquisition strategy, the Company seeks to identify and
pursue favorable  station or group  acquisition  opportunities  primarily in the
15th to 75th  largest  DMAs and  Metro  Service  Areas  ("MSAs").  In  assessing
potential  acquisitions,  the Company examines  opportunities to improve revenue
share, audience share and/or cost control.  Additional factors considered by the
Company in a potential  acquisition  include  geographic  location,  demographic
characteristics  and  competitive  dynamics  of the  market.  The  Company  also
considers the opportunity for  cross-ownership  of television and radio stations
and the opportunity it may provide for cross-promotion and cross-selling.


     Beginning  in  the  third  quarter  of  1998,  the  Company   adjusted  its
acquisition  strategy to reduce its pace of  acquisitions  and begin to identify
and negotiate the sale of certain  stations that may not be consistent  with the
Company's strategic plan. The Company adjusted its acquisition  strategy for the
following  reasons.  First,  the  Company  intends to focus on and  improve  the
performance of its core station operations.  By selling non-strategic  stations,
management can better  concentrate  its resources on the core stations.  Second,
the Company believes that it is appropriate at this time to reduce the financial
leverage  employed in its  business.  The Company will  continue to evaluate the
extent of the  reduction in its  financial  leverage,  but any related  goals or
targets could be changed at any time.

     Since the 1996 Act became  effective,  the Company has  acquired,  obtained
options  to  acquire or has  acquired  the right to  program  or  provide  sales
services to, 46 television and 61 radio stations for an aggregate  consideration
of  approximately  $3.4 billion.  The terms of the acquisitions and dispositions
entered into or completed in 1998 are described below.

1998 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

     Heritage  Acquisition.  In July 1997,  the Company  entered into a purchase
agreement  to acquire  certain  assets of the radio and  television  stations of
Heritage  for  approximately  $630  million (the  "Heritage  Acquisition").  The
Company  completed all of the  acquisitions  under this  agreement by July 1998,
acquiring  three  radio  stations  in the  New  Orleans,  Louisiana  market  and
simultaneously   disposing  of  two  of  those   stations  (see  the  Centennial
Disposition  below).  Pursuant to the  Heritage  Acquisition,  and after  giving
effect to the STC Disposition,  Entercom Disposition and Centennial  Disposition
the  Company  has  acquired  or  is  providing  programming  services  to  three
television  stations  in two  separate  markets  and 11 radio  stations  in four
separate markets.

     1998   STC   Disposition.  In  February  1998,  the  Company  entered  into
agreements  to  sell to STC Broadcasting of Vermont, Inc. ("STC") two television
stations  and  the  Non-License  Assets and rights to program a third television
station,  all of which were acquired in the Heritage Acquisition. In April 1998,
the Company closed on the sale of the non-license assets of the three television
stations  in the  Burlington,  Vermont  and  Plattsburgh,  New York  market  for
aggregate consideration of approximately $70.0 million. During the third quarter
of 1998, the Company sold the license assets of these stations for a sales price
of $2.0 million.

     Montecito  Acquisition.  In  February  1998,  the Company  entered  into an
agreement  to  acquire  all of  the  capital  stock  of  Montecito  Broadcasting
Corporation   ("Montecito")   for  approximately  $33  million  (the  "Montecito
Acquisition"). Montecito owns all of the issued and outstanding stock of Channel
33, Inc. which owns and operates KFBT-TV in Las Vegas,  Nevada.  Currently,  the
Company is a guarantor of Montecito indebtedness of approximately $33.0 million.
The  Company  cannot  acquire  Montecito  unless and until FCC rules  permit the
Company to own the broadcast  license for more than one station in the Las Vegas
market,  or unless the Company no longer owns the broadcast  license for KVWB-TV
in Las Vegas. At any time the Company, at its option, may transfer the rights to
acquire  the stock of  Montecito.  In April 1998 the Company  began  programming
KMWB-TV pursuant to an LMA.

     WSYX  Acquisition  and Sale of WTTE  License  Assets.  In April  1998,  the
Company  exercised  its option to acquire the  non-license  assets of WSYX-TV in
Columbus,  Ohio from River City  Broadcasting,  LP ("River  City") for an option
exercise price and other costs of approximately  $228.6 million. In August 1998,
the  Company  exercised  its option to acquire  the WSYX  License  Assets for an
option exercise price of $2.0 million.  The Company acquired the options in 1996
in   connection   with  its   acquisitions   of  other  assets  of  River  City.
Simultaneously  with the WSYX  Acquisition,  the Company  sold the WTTE  License
Assets to  Glencairn  for a sales price of $2.3  million and entered into an LMA
with Glencairn to program WTTE. In connection  with the sale of the WTTE License
Assets, the Company recognized a $2.3 million gain.

     SFX Disposition. In May 1998, the Company completed the sale of three radio
stations to SFX Broadcasting,  Inc. for aggregate consideration of approximately
$35.0 million (the "SFX  Disposition").  The radio  stations sold are located in
the Nashville, Tennessee market. In connection with the disposition, the Company
recognized a $5.2 million gain on the sale.

     Lakeland  Acquisition.  In May 1998, the Company acquired 100% of the stock
of   Lakeland   Group   Television,  Inc.  ("Lakeland")  for  cash  payments  of
approximately  $53.0  million  (the  "Lakeland Acquisition"). In connection with
the  Lakeland  Acquisition,  the  Company now owns television station KMUB-TV in
Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota.

     Entercom Disposition. In June 1998, the Company completed the sale of seven
radio  stations  acquired in the Heritage  acquisition.  The seven  stations are
located in the Portland,  Oregon and  Rochester,  New York markets and were sold
for aggregate consideration of approximately $126.9 million.

     Sullivan Acquisition.  In July 1998, the Company acquired 100% of the stock
of Sullivan Broadcast Holdings,  Inc. and Sullivan Broadcasting Company II, Inc.
for cash payments of approximately $951.1 million (the "Sullivan  Acquisition").
The Company  financed the acquisition by utilizing  indebtedness  under the 1998
Bank Credit  Agreement.  In  connection  with the  acquisition,  the Company has
acquired the right to program 12 additional  television  stations in 10 separate
markets.  In a subsequent  closing,  which is expected to occur during 1999, the
Company will acquire the stock of a company that owns the


                                       10
<PAGE>


license assets of six of the stations. In addition, the Company has entered into
new LMA  agreements  with respect to six of the  stations  and will  continue to
program two of the television stations pursuant to existing LMA agreements.

     Max Media  Acquisition.  In July 1998,  the Company  directly or indirectly
acquired  all of the equity  interests of Max Media  Properties  LLC, for $252.2
million (the "Max Media  Acquisition").  The Company financed the acquisition by
utilizing  existing  cash balances and  indebtedness  under the 1998 Bank Credit
Agreement. In connection with the acquisition,  the Company now owns or provides
programming  services to nine  additional  television  stations in six  separate
markets and seven radio stations in two separate markets.

     Centennial Disposition. In July 1998, the Company completed the sale of the
assets of radio stations WRNO-FM, KMEZ-FM and WBYU-AM in New Orleans,  Louisiana
to Centennial  Broadcasting  for $16.1 million in cash and  recognized a loss on
the sale of $2.9 million.  The Company  acquired  KMEZ-FM in connection with the
River City  Acquisition  in May of 1996 and acquired  WRNO-FM and WBYU-AM in New
Orleans from Heritage Media Group,  Inc.  ("Heritage") in July 1998. The Company
was required to divest WRNO-FM,  KMEZ-FM and WBYU-AM to meet certain  regulatory
ownership guidelines.

     Greenville  Acquisition.  In July 1998,  the Company  acquired  three radio
stations in the  Greenville/Spartansburg  market from  Keymarket  Radio of South
Carolina,  Inc. for a purchase price consideration  involving the forgiveness of
approximately  $8.0 million of indebtedness to Sinclair.  Concurrently  with the
acquisition,  the Company  acquired an additional two radio stations in the same
market from Spartan  Broadcasting  for a purchase  price of  approximately  $5.2
million.

     Radio  Unica  Disposition.  In July 1998, the Company completed the sale of
KBLA-AM  in  Los  Angeles,  California  to  Radio Unica, Corp. for approximately
$21.0  million  in  cash.  In  connection  with  the  disposition,  the  Company
recognized an $8.4 million gain.

PENDING ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

     Buffalo Acquisition.  In August 1998, the Company entered into an agreement
with Western New York Public Broadcasting  Association to acquire the television
station  WNEQ in  Buffalo,  NY for a purchase  price of $33 million in cash (the
"Buffalo Acquisition").  The Company expects to close the sale upon FCC approval
and the  termination  of the  applicable  waiting  period  under the HSR Act. In
addition,  the sale is contingent upon FCC approval of the change of the station
from a non-commercial channel to a commercial channel.

     St. Louis Radio  Acquisition.  In August 1998, the Company  entered into an
agreement to acquire radio station KXOK-FM in St. Louis, Missouri for a purchase
price of $14.1 million in cash. The purchase price is subject to be increased or
decreased,  depending  upon whether or not closing occurs within 210 days of the
agreement. The Company expects to close the purchase upon FCC approval.

     Guy Gannett  Acquisition.  In September 1998, the Company agreed to acquire
from  Guy  Gannett  Communications  its  television  broadcasting  assets  for a
purchase  price of $317  million in cash (the "Guy Gannett  Acquisition").  As a
result of this transaction,  the Company will acquire seven television  stations
in six  markets.  The FCC must  approve  the Guy Gannet  Acquisition,  which the
Company  expects to complete in the second quarter of 1999. The Company  expects
to finance the acquisition  with a combination of bank borrowings and the use of
cash  proceeds  resulting  from the  Company's  planned  disposition  of certain
broadcast assets.

     Ackerley Disposition. In September 1998, the Company agreed to sell WOKR-TV
in  Rochester,  New York to the Ackerley  Group,  Inc. for a sales price of $125
million (the "Ackerley  Disposition").  The Company  previously  entered into an
agreement  to acquire  WOKR-TV as part of the Guy Gannett  Acquisition.  The FCC
must approve the  disposition,  which the Company expects to close in the second
quarter of 1999.

     CCA Disposition. In February 1999, the Company entered into an agreement to
sell to Communications  Corporation of America ("CCA") the non-license assets of
KETK-TV  and KLSB-TV in  Tyler-Longview,  Texas for a sales price of $36 million
(the "CCA Disposition").  In addition,  CCA has an option to acquire the license
assets of  KETK-TV  for an option  purchase  price of $2  million.  The  Company
expects to close the transaction in the second quarter of 1999.


                                       11
<PAGE>


     1999 STC Disposition.  In March 1999, the Company entered into an agreement
to sell to STC the  television  stations  WICS-TV in the  Springfield,  Illinois
market,  WICD-TV in the  Champaign,  Illinois  market  and  KGAN-TV in the Cedar
Rapids,  Iowa  market.  The  stations are being sold to STC for a sales price of
$81.0 million and are being  acquired by the Company in connection  with the Guy
Gannett Acquisition.

     On going  Discussions.  In furtherance  of its  acquisition  strategy,  the
Company routinely reviews,  and conducts  investigations of potential television
and radio station acquisitions.  In addition,  the Company has announced that it
intends to enter into  agreements  to sell  non-strategic  television  and radio
stations.  When the Company believes a favorable opportunity exists, the Company
seeks to enter into  discussions with the owners of stations or potential buyers
regarding the possibility of an acquisition, disposition or station swap. At any
given time,  the Company may be in  discussions  with one or more  parties.  The
Company is  currently  in  negotiations  with  various  parties  relating to the
disposition  of television and radio  properties  which would be disposed of for
aggregate  consideration of approximately $60 million. There can be no assurance
that any of these or other negotiations will lead to definitive  agreement or if
agreements are reached that any transactions would be consummated.


LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENTS

     The Company  believes  that it is able to increase its revenues and improve
its margins by providing  programming  services to stations in selected DMAs and
MSAs where the Company  already  owns a station.  In certain  instances,  single
station  operators and stations operated by smaller ownership groups do not have
the management expertise or the operating  efficiencies available to the Company
as a multi-station  broadcaster.  The Company seeks to identify such stations in
selected markets and to provide such stations with programming services pursuant
to  LMAs.  In  addition  to  providing  the  Company  with  additional   revenue
opportunities,  the Company believes that these LMA  arrangements  have assisted
certain  stations  whose  operations  may have  been  marginally  profitable  to
continue to air popular  programming  and contribute to diversity of programming
in their respective DMAs and MSAs.

     In cases where the Company enters into LMA  arrangements in connection with
a station whose acquisition by the Company is pending FCC approval,  the Company
(i) obtains an option to acquire the station assets essential for broadcasting a
television or radio signal in compliance with regulatory  guidelines,  generally
consisting  of the  FCC  license,  transmitter,  transmission  lines,  technical
equipment,  call letters and  trademarks,  and certain  furniture,  fixtures and
equipment  (the "License  Assets") and (ii)  acquires the remaining  assets (the
"Non-License  Assets")  at  the  time  it  enters  into  the  option.  Following
acquisition of the Non-License  Assets,  the License Assets continue to be owned
by the  owner-operator  and holder of the FCC license,  which enters into an LMA
with the  Company.  After FCC  approval  for  transfer of the License  Assets is
obtained,  the Company  exercises  its option to acquire the License  Assets and
become the owner-operator of the station, and the LMA arrangement is terminated.


USE OF DIGITAL TELEVISION TECHNOLOGY

     The  Company   believes  that  television   broadcasting  may  be  enhanced
significantly   by  the  development  and  increased   availability  of  digital
broadcasting service technology. This technology has the potential to permit the
Company to provide viewers multiple channels of digital  television over each of
its  existing  standard  channels,  to  provide  certain  programming  in a high
definition  television  format  ("HDTV") and to deliver  various  forms of data,
including data on the Internet, to home and business computers. These additional
capabilities may provide the Company with additional sources of revenue although
the Company may be required to incur significant  additional costs in connection
therewith.   The  Company  is  currently   considering  plans  to  provide  HDTV
programming,  to provide multiple channels of television including the provision
of additional  broadcast  programming  and  transmitted  data on a  subscription
basis, and to continue its current TV program channels on its allocated  digital
television  ("DTV")  channels.  The Company  does not believe the adoption of an
HDTV format will provide any significant  economic benefits to the Company.  The
FCC granted  authority for the Company to conduct  experimental DTV multicasting
operations in Baltimore, Maryland. In June 1998, the Company successfully linked
the  bandwidths  of the two Baltimore  television  stations it owns or programs,
demonstrating  the  ability  to  provide  multiple  channel  options.  The  test
demonstrated  that  either  manufacturers  must  make  improvements  in  digital
receivers or the DTV frequency  standards must be improved to achieve  broadcast
parity with the analog signal. 


                                       12
<PAGE>

     The 1996 Act allows the FCC to charge a spectrum  fee to  broadcasters  who
use the digital spectrum to offer  subscription-based  services, and the FCC has
ruled that  broadcasters  shall be required to pay a fee of 5% of gross revenues
on all subscription services. The Company cannot predict what future actions the
FCC or Congress might take with respect to DTV, nor can it predict the effect of
the  FCC's  present  DTV  implementation  plan or  such  future  actions  on the
Company's business. DTV technology currently is available in some of the top ten
viewing  markets.  A successful  transition  from the current  analog  broadcast
format to a digital  format may take many years.  There can be no assurance that
the  Company's  efforts  to  take  advantage  of  the  new  technology  will  be
commercially successful.

FEDERAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING

     The  ownership,  operation  and sale of television  and radio  stations are
subject to the  jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under  authority  granted by
the Communications  Act. Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for
broadcasting;  determines  the particular  frequencies,  locations and operating
power of  stations;  issues,  renews,  revokes and  modifies  station  licenses;
regulates  equipment  used by stations;  adopts and implements  regulations  and
policies  that  directly  or  indirectly  affect the  ownership,  operation  and
employment  practices of  stations;  and has the power to impose  penalties  for
violations of its rules or the Communications Act.

     The   following  is  a  brief   summary  of  certain   provisions   of  the
Communications  Act,  the 1996 Act and specific FCC  regulations  and  policies.
Reference should be made to the Communications  Act, the 1996 Act, FCC rules and
the public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the
nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.

     License Grant and Renewal.  Television and radio stations  operate pursuant
to broadcasting  licenses that are granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight
years and are subject to renewal upon  application  to the FCC.  During  certain
periods  when  renewal  applications  are  pending,  petitions  to deny  license
renewals can be filed by interested  parties,  including  members of the public.
The FCC will generally  grant a renewal  application  if it finds:  (i) that the
station has served the public  interest,  convenience  and necessity;  (ii) that
there have been no serious  violations by the licensee of the Communications Act
or the rules and regulations of the FCC; and (iii) that there have been no other
violations  by  the  licensee  of  the  Communications  Act  or  the  rules  and
regulations of the FCC that, when taken together,  would constitute a pattern of
abuse. 

     All of the  stations  that  the  Company  currently  owns and  operates  or
provides  programming  services to  pursuant  to LMAs,  or intends to acquire or
provide  programming  services  pursuant  to LMAs  in  connection  with  pending
acquisitions, are presently operating under regular licenses, which expire as to
each station on the dates set forth under  "Television  Broadcasting" and "Radio
Broadcasting,"  above.  Although  renewal  of  license  is  granted  in the vast
majority  of cases  even  when  petitions  to deny are  filed,  there  can be no
assurance that the licenses of such stations will be renewed.

Ownership Matters
- -----------------

GENERAL

     The  Communications  Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or
the transfer of control of a broadcast  licensee  without the prior  approval of
the FCC. In determining  whether to permit the assignment or transfer of control
of, or the grant or renewal of, a broadcast license,  the FCC considers a number
of factors pertaining to the licensee,  including  compliance with various rules
limiting common ownership of media  properties,  the "character" of the licensee
and those persons holding "attributable"  interests therein, and compliance with
the Communications Act's limitations on alien ownership.

     To obtain the FCC's prior consent to assign a broadcast license or transfer
control of a broadcast licensee, appropriate applications must be filed with the
FCC. If the application involves a "substantial change" in ownership or control,
the application must be placed on public notice for a period of approximately 30
days during which  petitions to deny the  application may be filed by interested
parties,  including members of the public. If the application does not involve a
"substantial  change" in ownership or control,  it is a "pro forma" application.
The "pro forma" application is not subject to petitions to deny


                                       13
<PAGE>

or a mandatory  waiting period,  but is nevertheless  subject to having informal
objections  filed  against  it. If the FCC  grants  an  assignment  or  transfer
application, interested parties have approximately 30 days from public notice of
the grant to seek  reconsideration  or review of the grant.  Generally,  parties
that do not file initial  petitions to deny or informal  objections  against the
application face difficulty in seeking  reconsideration  or review of the grant.
The FCC normally has approximately an additional 10 days to set aside such grant
on its own motion.  When passing on an assignment or transfer  application,  the
FCC is prohibited from  considering  whether the public interest might be served
by an  assignment or transfer to any party other than the assignee or transferee
specified in the application.

     The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to "attributable"  interests
held by an individual,  corporation,  partnership or other  association.  In the
case of corporations  holding, or through  subsidiaries  controlling,  broadcast
licenses,  the  interests  of  officers,  directors  and those who,  directly or
indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation's stock (or 10%
or more of such stock in the case of insurance  companies,  investment companies
and  bank  trust   departments   that  are  passive   investors)  are  generally
attributable, except that, in general, no minority voting stock interest will be
attributable  if there is a single  holder of more  than 50% of the  outstanding
voting power of the  corporation.  The FCC has a pending  rulemaking  proceeding
that,  among other  things,  seeks  comment on whether the FCC should modify its
attribution rules by (i) raising the attribution stock benchmark from 5% to 10%;
(ii) raising the attribution  stock benchmark for passive  investors from 10% to
20%; (iii)  restricting  the  availability  of the single  majority  shareholder
exemption; and (iv) attributing certain interests such as non-voting stock, debt
and certain holdings by limited liability corporations in certain circumstances.
More  recently,  the FCC has solicited  comment on proposed rules that would (i)
treat an otherwise  nonattributable  equity or debt interest in a licensee as an
attributable  interest  where the interest  holder is a program  supplier or the
owner of a  broadcast  station in the same  market and the  equity  and/or  debt
holding is  greater  than a  specified  benchmark;  (ii)  treat a licensee  of a
television  station  which,  under an LMA,  brokers more than 15% of the time on
another  television  station serving the same market,  as having an attributable
interest in the brokered station; and (iii) in certain circumstances,  treat the
licensee of a broadcast  station that sells  advertising time on another station
in the same market pursuant to a JSA as having an  attributable  interest in the
station whose  advertising is being sold. The Company cannot predict the outcome
of this proceeding or how it will affect the business.  However, if the proposal
were adopted  without  excluding  existing LMAs and JSAs,  the  proposals  could
require the Company to dispose or otherwise alter its LMA and JSA relationships.

     Under its  "cross-interest"  policy, the FCC considers certain "meaningful"
relationships  among  competing  media  outlets in the same market,  even if the
ownership  rules do not  specifically  prohibit  the  relationship.  Under  this
policy,  the FCC may consider  significant  equity  interests  combined  with an
attributable interest in a media outlet in the same market, joint ventures,  and
common key  employees  among  competitors.  The  cross-interest  policy does not
necessarily prohibit all of these interests,  but requires that the FCC consider
whether,  in  a  particular  market,  the  "meaningful"   relationships  between
competitors  could have a significant  adverse effect upon economic  competition
and program  diversity.  Heretofore,  the FCC has not applied its cross-interest
policy to LMAs and JSAs between broadcast  stations.  In its ongoing  rulemaking
proceeding  concerning  the  attribution  rules,  the FCC has sought comment on,
among other things, (i) whether the cross-interest policy should be applied only
in smaller markets, and (ii) whether non-equity financial  relationships such as
debt, when combined with multiple business  interrelationships  such as LMAs and
JSAs,  raise concerns under the  cross-interest  policy.  Moreover,  in its most
recent proposals in its ongoing attribution rulemaking  proceeding,  the FCC has
proposed  treating  television  LMAs,  television  and radio JSAs, and presently
nonattributable  debt or equity  interests as attributable  interests in certain
circumstances  without regard to the  cross-interest  policy. The Company cannot
predict the outcome of this rulemaking.

     The  Communications Act prohibits the issuance of broadcast licenses to, or
the holding of a broadcast license by, any corporation of which more than 20% of
the  capital  stock is owned of record or voted by  non-U.S.  citizens  or their
representatives  or by a foreign government or a representative  thereof,  or by
any corporation  organized  under the laws of a foreign  country  (collectively,
"Aliens"). The Communications Act also authorizes the FCC, if the FCC determines
that it would be in the public interest, to prohibit the issuance of a broadcast
license to, or the holding of a broadcast  license by, any corporation  directly
or indirectly


                                       14
<PAGE>

controlled by any other  corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock
is owned of record or voted by Aliens. The Company has been advised that the FCC
staff has  interpreted  this  provision  to require a finding that such grant or
holding  would be in the  public  interest  before a  broadcast  license  may be
granted to or held by any such  corporation and that the FCC staff has made such
a finding only in limited  circumstances.  The FCC has issued interpretations of
existing  law under which  these  restrictions  in modified  form apply to other
forms of business organizations,  including  partnerships.  As a result of these
provisions, the licenses granted to Subsidiaries of the Company by the FCC could
be revoked if, among other restrictions imposed by the FCC, more than 25% of the
Company's  stock were  directly  or  indirectly  owned or voted by  Aliens.  The
Company and the Subsidiaries are domestic  corporations,  and the members of the
Smith  family (who  together  hold over 90% of the common  voting  rights of the
Company) are all United States  citizens.  The Amended and Restated  Articles of
Incorporation of the Company (the "Amended  Certificate") contain limitations on
Alien ownership and control that are substantially similar to those contained in
the Communications Act. Pursuant to the Amended Certificate, the Company has the
right to repurchase  Alien-owned shares at their fair market value to the extent
necessary,  in the judgment of the Board of Directors,  to comply with the Alien
ownership restrictions.

TELEVISION

     National  Ownership Rule.  Pursuant to the 1996 Act no individual or entity
may have an attributable  interest in television stations reaching more than 35%
of the national  television  viewing audience.  Historically,  VHF stations have
shared a larger portion of the market than UHF stations. Therefore, only half of
the  households  in the  market  area  of any  UHF  station  are  included  when
calculating  whether an entity or individual owns television  stations  reaching
more than 35% of the national television viewing audience.  All but seven of the
stations  owned and  operated by the Company,  or to which the Company  provides
programming  services,  are UHF. Upon completion of all pending acquisitions and
dispositions,  the  Company  will  reach  approximately  14% of U.S.  television
households using the FCC's method of calculation. 

     Duopoly Rule. On a local level,  the  television  "duopoly"  rule generally
prohibits a single individual or entity from having an attributable  interest in
two or more television  stations with overlapping  Grade B service areas.  While
the 1996 Act did not  eliminate  the TV duopoly  rule,  it did direct the FCC to
initiate a rulemaking  proceeding  to determine  whether to retain,  modify,  or
eliminate the rule. The FCC has pending a rulemaking  proceeding in which it has
proposed,  among other options,  to modify the television duopoly rule to permit
the common  ownership of television  stations in different  DMAs, so long as the
Grade A signal  contours of the stations do not overlap.  Pending  resolution of
its  rulemaking  proceeding,  the FCC has adopted an interim  waiver policy that
permits the common  ownership of television  stations in different  DMAs with no
overlapping  Grade A signal  contours,  conditioned  on the final outcome of the
rulemaking  proceeding.  The FCC has  also  sought  comment  on  whether  common
ownership of two  television  stations in a market should be permitted (i) where
one or  more of the  commonly  owned  stations  is UHF,  (ii)  where  one of the
stations is in bankruptcy  or has been off the air for a  substantial  period of
time and (iii) where the commonly  owned  stations  have very small  audience or
advertising  shares,  are  located in a very large  market,  and/or a  specified
number of  independently  owned media voices would remain after the acquisition.
The Company  cannot  predict the outcome of the proceeding in which such changes
are being considered.

     Local  Marketing  Agreements.  A number of television  stations,  including
certain of the  Company's  stations,  have entered into what have  commonly been
referred to as local marketing  agreements or LMAs.  While these  agreements may
take varying  forms,  pursuant to a typical LMA,  separately  owned and licensed
television  stations  agree to enter into  cooperative  arrangements  of varying
sorts,  subject to compliance  with the  requirements of antitrust laws and with
the FCC's rules and  policies.  Under these  types of  arrangements,  separately
owned stations could agree to function  cooperatively  in terms of  programming,
advertising  sales,  etc.,  subject to the requirement that the licensee of each
station maintain  independent control over the programming and operations of its
own station.  One typical  type of LMA is a  programming  agreement  between two
separately owned television  stations serving a common service area, whereby the
licensee of one station  programs  substantial  portions of the broadcast day on
the other licensee's  station,  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls
being exercised by the latter licensee,  and sells  advertising time during such
program  segments.  Such  arrangements  are an extension of the concept of "time
brokerage" agreements,


                                       15
<PAGE>

under  which a licensee of a station  sells  blocks of time on its station to an
entity or  entities  which  program  the blocks of time and which sell their own
commercial  advertising  announcements during the time periods in question.  The
staff of the FCC's Mass Media  Bureau has held that LMAs are not contrary to the
Communications  Act,  provided  that the licensee of the station  which is being
substantially programmed by another entity maintains complete responsibility for
and control over programming and operations of its broadcast station and assures
compliance with applicable FCC rules and policies.

     At present, FCC rules permit television station LMAs, and the licensee of a
television   station  brokering  time  on  another  television  station  is  not
considered to have an attributable interest in the brokered station. However, in
connection  with its ongoing  rulemaking  proceeding  regarding  the  television
duopoly rule, the FCC has proposed to adopt rules providing that the licensee of
a  television  station  which  brokers  more  than  15% of the  time on  another
television  station  serving  the  same  market  would  be  deemed  to  have  an
attributable  interest in the brokered  station for purposes of the national and
local  multiple  ownership  rules.  If  a  brokered  station  is  deemed  to  be
attributable, the presence of a station brokered by the owner of another station
in the market would violate the FCC's duopoly rule.


     The TV duopoly  rule  currently  prevents the Company  from  acquiring  the
licenses of  television  stations  with which it has LMAs in those markets where
the Company owns a  television  station.  As a result,  if the FCC were to adopt
rules that would make such interests  attributable without modifying its current
prohibitions  against the  ownership  of more than one  television  station in a
market,  the Company  could be prohibited  from entering into such  arrangements
with other stations in markets in which it owns television stations and could be
required to terminate existing LMA arrangements.  The FCC has proposed that LMAs
in force  prior to  November 5, 1996 would be  permitted  to continue  until the
original  term of the  agreement  expires.  Of the  Company's 22 LMAs in markets
where the  Company  owns or is  expected  to acquire  another  station,  15 were
entered  into  after  adoption  of the 1996 Act (and two  additional  LMAs  were
assumed by the Company after adoption of the Act) and 12 were entered into after
November 5, 1996 (and the license  rights under one  additional LMA were assumed
by a third  party  after  November  5,  1996).  However,  the FCC  currently  is
reviewing its LMA policy,  and while Congress,  pursuant to the 1996 Act, stated
that existing LMAs should generally be grandfathered, the Company cannot predict
whether any of its LMAs will be grandfathered.  The Company could be required to
terminate  even those LMAs that were in effect prior to the date of enactment of
the 1996 Act or prior to November 5, 1996.  In such an event,  the Company could
be required to pay termination penalties under certain of such LMAs. Further, if
the FCC were to find, in connection  with any of the  Company's  LMAs,  that the
owners/licensees  of the  stations  with which the  Company  has LMAs  failed to
maintain  control over their  operations  as required by FCC rules and policies,
the  licensee  of the LMA station  and/or the Company  could be fined or set for
hearing,  the outcome of which could be a monetary  forfeiture or, under certain
circumstances,  loss of the  applicable  FCC  license.  The Company is unable to
predict  the  ultimate  outcome of  possible  changes to these FCC rules and the
impact such FCC rules may have on its broadcasting operations.


RADIO

     National  Ownership  Rule. Pursuant to the 1996 Act, there are no limits on
the number of radio stations a single individual or entity may own nationwide.


     Local Ownership  Rules.  Pursuant to the 1996 Act, the limits on the number
of radio  stations  one entity may own locally  are as follows:  (i) in a market
with 45 or  more  commercial  radio  stations,  an  entity  may own up to  eight
commercial  radio stations,  not more than five of which are in the same service
(AM or FM); (ii) in a market with between 30 and 44 (inclusive) commercial radio
stations, an entity may own up to seven commercial radio stations, not more than
four of which are in the same service;  (iii) in a market with between 15 and 29
(inclusive)  commercial  radio stations,  an entity may own up to six commercial
radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service; and (iv) in
a market with 14 or fewer  commercial  radio  stations,  an entity may own up to
five  commercial  radio  stations,  not more than three of which are in the same
service, except that an entity may not own more than 50% of the stations in such
market.  These numerical limits apply regardless of the aggregate audience share
of the stations  sought to be commonly  owned.  FCC ownership  rules continue to
permit an entity to own one FM and one AM station in a local  market  regardless
of market size.  Irrespective of FCC rules governing radio  ownership,  however,
the DOJ and the Federal 


                                       16
<PAGE>

Trade  Commission  have the authority to determine,  and in certain recent radio
transactions have determined,  that a particular  transaction presents antitrust
concerns.  Moreover, in certain recent cases the FCC has publicly announced that
it will independently  examine issues of market concentration  notwithstanding a
transaction's  compliance with the numerical  station  limits.  The FCC has also
indicated that it may propose further revisions to its radio multiple  ownership
rules.

     Local Marketing  Agreements.  As in television,  a number of radio stations
have entered into LMAs. The FCC's multiple ownership rules  specifically  permit
radio station LMAs to be entered into and  implemented,  so long as the licensee
of the  station  which is being  programmed  under  the LMA  maintains  complete
responsibility  for and control over programming and operations of its broadcast
station and assures  compliance with applicable FCC rules and policies.  For the
purposes of the multiple  ownership  rules,  in general,  a radio  station being
programmed  pursuant to an LMA by an entity is not  considered  an  attributable
ownership  interest of that  entity  unless  that  entity  already  owns a radio
station in the same market.  However,  a licensee that owns a radio station in a
market,  and brokers  more than 15% of the time on another  station  serving the
same market (i.e. a station whose principal  community  contour overlaps that of
the owned market),  is considered to have an attributable  ownership interest in
the brokered  station for purposes of the FCC's multiple  ownership  rules. As a
result, in a market in which the Company owns a radio station, the Company would
not be permitted to enter into an LMA with another  local radio station which it
could not own under the local ownership rules, unless the Company's  programming
constituted  15% or less of the  other  local  station's  programming  time on a
weekly  basis.  The  FCC's  rules  also  prohibit  a  broadcast   licensee  from
simulcasting  more than 25% of its  programming  on another  station in the same
broadcast  service  (i.e.,  AM-AM or  FM-FM)  through  a time  brokerage  or LMA
arrangement  where the brokered and brokering  stations serve  substantially the
same area.

     Joint Sales  Agreements.  A number of radio (and television)  stations have
entered into cooperative  arrangements commonly known as joint sales agreements,
or JSAs. While these agreements may take varying forms, under the typical JSA, a
station licensee obtains,  for a fee, the right to sell substantially all of the
commercial  advertising on a  separately-owned  and licensed station in the same
market.  The typical JSA also customarily  involves the provision by the selling
licensee of certain sales, accounting, and "back office" services to the station
whose advertising is being sold. The typical JSA is distinct from an LMA in that
a JSA (unlike an LMA) normally does not involve programming.

     The FCC has  determined  that issues of joint  advertising  sales should be
left to enforcement by antitrust  authorities,  and therefore does not generally
regulate joint sales practices between stations. Currently, stations for which a
licensee  sells time  under a JSA are not  deemed by the FCC to be  attributable
interests of that licensee.  However,  in connection with its ongoing rulemaking
proceeding concerning the attribution rules, the FCC is considering whether JSAs
should be  considered  attributable  interests  or within the scope of the FCC's
cross-interest policy,  particularly when JSAs contain provisions for the supply
of programming services and/or other elements typically associated with LMAs. If
JSAs become attributable  interests as a result of changes in the FCC rules, the
Company may be required to terminate  any JSA it might have with a radio station
which the Company could not own under the FCC's multiple ownership rules.


OTHER OWNERSHIP MATTERS

     There  remain  in  place  after  the  1996  Act  a  number  of   additional
cross-ownership rules and prohibitions pertaining to licensees of television and
radio stations. FCC rules, the Communications Act, or both generally prohibit an
individual or entity from having an  attributable  interest in both a television
station and a radio station,  a daily newspaper,  or a cable  television  system
that is located in or serves the same market area.

     Antitrust  Regulation.  The DOJ  and  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  have
increased their scrutiny of the television and radio industry since the adoption
of the 1996 Act, and have indicated their intention to review matters related to
the  concentration  of ownership  within markets  (including LMAs and JSAs) even
when  the  ownership  or LMA or JSA in  question  is  permitted  under  the laws
administered by the FCC or by FCC rules and regulations.  For instance,  the DOJ
has for some time taken the position that


                                       17
<PAGE>

an LMA entered into in anticipation of a station's acquisition with the proposed
buyer of the station constitutes a change in beneficial ownership of the station
which, if subject to filing under the HSR Act,  cannot be implemented  until the
waiting period required by that statute has ended or been terminated.

     Radio/Television   Cross-Ownership   Rule.   The   FCC's   radio/television
cross-ownership  rule (the "one to a market" rule) generally  prohibits a single
individual  or entity  from  having an  attributable  interest  in a  television
station and a radio station serving the same market.  However, in each of the 25
largest local markets in the United States,  provided that there remain at least
30 separately owned television and radio stations in the particular market after
the acquisition in question,  the FCC has  traditionally  employed a policy that
presumptively  allows  waivers of the one to a market  rule to permit the common
ownership  of one AM,  one FM and one TV  station  in the  market.  The 1996 Act
directs the FCC to extend  this policy to each of the top 50 markets.  Moreover,
the FCC has pending a rulemaking proceeding in which it has solicited comment on
the implementation of this policy and whether the one to a market rule should be
eliminated  altogether.  The Company has pending several requests for waivers of
the one to a market rule in connection  with (1) its  applications  to acquire a
television  station in the  Sullivan  Acquisition  in a market where the Company
owns radio  stations  and (2) its  application  to acquire a radio  station from
WPNT, Inc. in a market where the Company owns a television station.

     However,  the FCC does not apply  its  presumptive  waiver  policy in cases
involving the common ownership of one television station,  and two or more radio
stations in the same service (AM or FM), in the same market. Pending its ongoing
rulemaking  proceeding to reexamine the one to a market rule, the FCC has stated
that it will consider  waivers of the rule in such  instances on a  case-by-case
basis,  considering  (i) the public  service  benefits  that will arise from the
joint operation of the facilities  such as economies of scale,  cost savings and
programming and service benefits;  (ii) the types of facilities involved;  (iii)
the number of media outlets owned by the applicant in the relevant market;  (iv)
the financial  difficulties of the stations involved;  and (v) the nature of the
relevant  market in light of the level of competition  and diversity after joint
operation is implemented. Waiver requests involving the common ownership of more
than two same service radio  stations in the same market  generally are granted,
but are temporary and  conditioned on the outcome of the rulemaking  proceeding.
The Company obtained such temporary,  conditional waivers of the one to a market
rule in connection  with its  acquisition  of the Heritage radio stations in the
Kansas City and St. Louis markets, in connection with its acquisition of the Max
Media  radio  stations  in the  Norfolk  market,  and  in  connection  with  its
acquisition   of   Keymarket   and   Spartan   Broadcasting   stations   in  the
Greenville/Spartanburg market.

     In its ongoing rulemaking proceeding to reexamine the one to a market rule,
the FCC has proposed the  following  options for modifying the rule in the event
it is not  eliminated:  (i)  extending  the  presumptive  waiver  policy  to any
television  market in which a specified  number of  independently  owned  voices
would  remain after  common  ownership  of a television  station and one or more
radio stations is effectuated;  (ii) extending the presumptive  waiver policy to
entities  that seek to own more than one FM and/or one AM radio  station;  (iii)
reducing the minimum number of independently owned voices that must remain after
a transaction is effectuated;  and (iv) modifying the  five-factor  case-by-case
test for waivers.

     Local Television/Cable  Cross-Ownership Rule. While the 1996 Act eliminates
a previous  statutory  prohibition  against the common ownership of a television
broadcast station and a cable system that serve the same local market,  the 1996
Act leaves the current  FCC rule in place.  The  legislative  history of the Act
indicates  that the repeal of the  statutory ban should not prejudge the outcome
of any FCC review of the rule. 

     Broadcast Network/Cable  Cross-Ownership Rule. The 1996 Act directs the FCC
to  eliminate  its rules which  formerly  prohibited  the common  ownership of a
broadcast  network and a cable  system,  subject to the  provision  that the FCC
revise its rules as  necessary  to ensure  carriage,  channel  positioning,  and
non-discriminatory  treatment  of  non-affiliated  broadcast  stations  by cable
systems  affiliated with a broadcast  network.  In March 1996, the FCC issued an
order implementing this legislative change.

     Broadcast/Daily  Newspaper  Cross-Ownership  Rule. The FCC's rules prohibit
the common  ownership  of a radio or  television  broadcast  station and a daily
newspaper  in the same  market.  The 1996 Act does not  eliminate or modify this
prohibition. In October 1996, however, the FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding
to  determine  whether it should  liberalize  its waiver  policy with respect to
cross-ownership  of a daily newspaper and one or more radio stations in the same
market.


                                       18
<PAGE>

     Dual  Network  Rule.  The 1996 Act directs the FCC to repeal its rule which
formerly  prohibited an entity from operating more than one television  network.
In March 1996, the FCC issued an order  implementing  this  legislative  change.
Under the modified  rule, a network entity is permitted to operate more than one
television  network,  provided,  however,  that ABC,  CBS,  NBC,  and/or Fox are
prohibited  from  merging  with each other or with  another  network  television
entity such as WB or UPN.

     Expansion  of the  Company's  broadcast  operations  on  both a  local  and
national level will continue to be subject to the FCC's  ownership rules and any
changes the FCC or Congress may adopt. Concomitantly,  any further relaxation of
the FCC's  ownership  rules may increase the level of competition in one or more
of the markets in which the Company's stations are located, more specifically to
the extent that any of the Company's  competitors may have greater resources and
thereby be in a superior position to take advantage of such changes.


Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent
- ---------------------------------

     Pursuant to the Cable Act of 1992, television  broadcasters are required to
make   triennial   elections  to  exercise   either  certain   "must-carry"   or
"retransmission  consent"  rights in  connection  with their  carriage  by cable
systems in each broadcaster's local market. By electing the must-carry rights, a
broadcaster  demands carriage on a specified channel on cable systems within its
Area of  Dominant  Influence,  in general as  defined  by the  Arbitron  1991-92
Television  Market Guide.  These must-carry  rights are not absolute,  and their
exercise is dependent on variables such as (i) the number of activated  channels
on a cable system;  (ii) the location and size of a cable system;  and (iii) the
amount of programming on a broadcast  station that duplicates the programming of
another broadcast station carried by the cable system. Therefore,  under certain
circumstances,   a  cable   system  may  decline  to  carry  a  given   station.
Alternatively,  if a  broadcaster  chooses to  exercise  retransmission  consent
rights,  it can prohibit  cable  systems  from  carrying its signal or grant the
appropriate  cable system the authority to retransmit the broadcast signal for a
fee or other  consideration.  In October 1996, the Company elected must-carry or
retransmission  consent with respect to each of its non-Fox affiliated  stations
based on its  evaluation  of the  respective  markets  and the  position  of the
Company's  owned or  programmed  station(s)  within the  market.  The  Company's
stations continue to be carried on all pertinent cable systems,  and the Company
does not  believe  that its  elections  have  resulted  in the  shifting  of its
stations to less  desirable  cable channel  locations.  The  Company's  stations
affiliated  with Fox  granted  Fox their  proxies  to  negotiate  retransmission
consent with the cable  systems.  The  agreements  negotiated by Fox extend only
through May of 1999. Therefore, subject to Fox's approval, the Company will need
to negotiate retransmission consent agreements for these Fox-affiliated stations
to attain  carriage  on those  relevant  cable  systems  for the balance of this
triennial period (i.e.,  through  December 31, 1999).  For subsequent  elections
beginning with the election to be made by October 1, 1999, the must-carry market
will be the  station's  DMA, in general as defined by the Nielsen DMA Market and
Demographic Rank Report of the prior year.

     The FCC has initiated a rulemaking  proceeding to consider whether to apply
must-carry rules to require cable companies to carry both the analog and digital
signals of local broadcasters  during the DTV transition period between 2002 and
2006 when television stations will be broadcasting both signals. If the FCC does
not require DTV must-carry,  cable customers in the Company's  broadcast markets
may not receive the station's digital signal, which could have an adverse affect
on the Company.

Syndicated Exclusivity/Territorial Exclusivity
- ----------------------------------------------

     The FCC has imposed  syndicated  exclusivity  rules and  expanded  existing
network  nonduplication  rules.  The  syndicated  exclusivity  rules allow local
broadcast   television  stations  to  demand  that  cable  operators  black  out
syndicated  non-network  programming carried on "distant signals" (i.e., signals
of broadcast stations,  including so-called  "superstations,"  which serve areas
substantially  removed from the cable  system's  local  community).  The network
non-duplication  rules allow local broadcast  network  television  affiliates to
require that cable operators black out duplicating  network  programming carried
on distant signals. However, in a number of markets in which the Company owns or
programs stations  affiliated with a network,  a station that is affiliated with
the same network in a nearby market is carried on cable systems in the Company's
market.  This is not in violation  of the FCC's  network  nonduplication  rules.
However,  the  carriage of two network  stations on the same cable  system could
result in a decline  of  viewership  adversely  affecting  the  revenues  of the
Company owned or programmed station.

Restrictions on Broadcast Advertising
- -------------------------------------

     Advertising of cigarettes  and certain other tobacco  products on broadcast
stations has been banned for many years. Various states restrict the advertising
of  alcoholic  beverages.   Congressional   committees  have  recently  examined
legislation  proposals which may eliminate or severely  restrict the advertising
of beer and wine. Although no prediction can be made as to whether any or all of
the present  proposals will be enacted into law, the elimination of all beer and
wine advertising would have an adverse effect upon the revenues of the Company's
stations,  as well as the revenues of other  stations  which carry beer and wine
advertising.

     The FCC has imposed  commercial time  limitations in children's  television
programming pursuant to legislation. In television programs designed for viewing
by  children  of 12 years of age and under,  commercial  matter is limited to 12
minutes per hour on weekdays and 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends.  In granting
renewal of the  license  for  WBFF-TV,  the FCC imposed a fine of $10,000 on the
Company  alleging that the station had exceeded these  limitations.  The Company
has  appealed  this fine and the appeal is pending.  In granting  renewal of the
license for WTTV-TV and WTTK-TV,  stations that the Company programs pursuant to
an LMA,  the FCC  imposed a fine of $15,000 on WTTV-TV  and  WTTK-TV's  licensee
alleging that the stations had exceed these limitations.

     The  Communications  Act and  FCC  rules  also  place  restrictions  on the
broadcasting  of  advertisements  by legally  qualified  candidates for elective
office.  Among other things, (i) stations must provide  "reasonable  access" for
the purchase of time by legally  qualified  candidates for federal office;  (ii)
stations  must provide  "equal  opportunities"  for the  purchase of  equivalent
amounts  of  comparable  broadcast  time by  opposing  candidates  for the  same
elective  office;  and (iii)  during the 45 days  preceding a primary or primary
run-off election and during the 60 days preceding a general or special election,
legally qualified candidates for elective office may be charged no more than the
station's  "lowest unit charge" for the same class of  advertisement,  length of
advertisement,  and daypart.  Recently,  both the President of the United States
and the Chairman of the FCC have called for rules that would  require  broadcast
stations to provide  free airtime to political  candidates.  The Company  cannot
predict the effect of such a requirement on its advertising revenues.

Programming and Operation
- -------------------------

     General. The Communications Act requires  broadcasters to serve the "public
interest."  The FCC has  relaxed  or  eliminated  many  of the  more  formalized
procedures  it had  developed  in the past to promote the  broadcast  of certain
types of  programming  responsive  to the  needs  of a  station's  community  of
license. FCC licensees continue to be required,  however, to present programming
that is responsive to their communities' issues, and to maintain certain records
demonstrating  such   responsiveness.   Complaints  from  viewers  concerning  a
station's  programming  may be considered  by the FCC when it evaluates  renewal
applications  of a licensee,  although such  complaints may be filed at any time
and generally  may be considered by the FCC at any time.  Stations also must pay
regulatory and application  fees, and follow various rules promulgated under the
Communications  Act that regulate,  among other things,  political  advertising,
sponsorship  identifications,  the  advertisement  of  contests  and  lotteries,
obscene and indecent broadcasts,  and technical operations,  including limits on
radio frequency radiation. Certain of the FCC's rules that required licensees to
develop and  implement  affirmative  action  programs  designed to promote equal
employment  opportunities  and the annual  submission of reports to the FCC with
respect  to those  matters  were  found  unconstitutional  by the U.S.  Court of
Appeals. The FCC has initiated a rulemaking to revise these rules.

     Children's  Television  Programming.  Pursuant  to  rules  adopted  in 1996
television  stations are required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week
of  "core"  children's  educational  programming,   which  the  FCC  defines  as
programming  that (i) has serving the  educational  and  informational  needs of
children 16 years of age and under as a significant  purpose;  (ii) is regularly
scheduled,  weekly  and at least 30  minutes  in  duration;  and  (iii) is aired
between the hours of 7:00 a.m.  and 10:00 p.m.  Furthermore,  "core"  children's
educational programs, in order to qualify as such, are required to be identified
as  educational  and  informational  programs  over the air at the time they are
broadcast,  and are  required to be  identified  in the  children's  programming
reports   required  to  be  placed  in  stations'   public   inspection   files.
Additionally,   television   stations  are  required  to  identify  and  provide
information  concerning "core"  children's  programming to publishers of program
guides and listings.

     Television Violence.  The 1996 Act contains a number of provisions relating
to television violence. First, pursuant to the 1996 Act, the television industry
has  developed a ratings  system which the FCC has approved.  Furthermore,  also
pursuant to the 1996 Act, the FCC has adopted rules requiring certain television
sets to include the so-called  "V-chip," a computer chip that allows blocking of
rated  programming.  Under these rules, half of television  receiver models with
picture  screens 13 inches or greater will be required to have the  "V-chip," by
July 1, 1999,  and all such  models  will be  required  to have the  "V-chip" by
January 1, 2000. In addition,  the 1996 Act requires that all television license
renewal  applications  filed  after May 1, 1995  contain  summaries  of  written
comments  and  suggestions  received  by the station  from the public  regarding
violent programming. 

     Closed  Captioning.  The FCC has adopted rules that require  generally that
(i) 100% of all new programming first published or exhibited on or after January
1, 1998 must be  closed  captioned  within  eight  years,  and (ii) 75% of "old"
programming  which first aired prior to January 1, 1998 must be closed captioned
within 10 years, subject to certain exemptions.

Digital Television
- ------------------

     The FCC has taken a number of steps to implement DTV  broadcasting  service
in the United States. In December 1996, the FCC adopted a DTV broadcast standard
and, in April 1997, adopted decisions in several pending rulemaking  proceedings
that establish  service rules and a plan for implementing DTV. The FCC adopted a
DTV Table of Allotments that provides all authorized  television stations with a
second channel on which to broadcast a DTV signal. The FCC made slight revisions
to the DTV rules and table of  allotments  in acting upon a number of appeals in
the DTV proceeding. The FCC has attempted to provide DTV coverage areas that are
comparable  to  stations'  existing  service  areas.  The  FCC  has  ruled  that
television broadcast licensees may use their digital channels for a wide variety
of services such as  high-definition  television,  multiple standard  definition
television programming, audio, data, and other types of communications,  subject
to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel
equal in quality to the current  technical  standard and further  subject to the
requirement  that  broadcasters  pay a fee of 5% of  gross  revenues  on all DTV
subscription services.

     DTV  channels  will  generally  be  located in the range of  channels  from
channel 2 through  channel 51. The FCC is requiring that affiliates of ABC, CBS,
Fox and NBC in the top 10 television  markets begin digital  broadcasting by May
1,  1999,  that  affiliates  of these  networks  in  markets 11 through 30 begin
digital  broadcasting by November 1999 and that all other stations begin digital
broadcasting by May 1, 2002. The majority of the Company's stations are required
to commence digital operations by May 1, 2002.  Applications for such facilities
are  required  to be filed by November  1, 1999.  The Company has already  filed
these  applications  for five of its  stations  and plans to begin  broadcasting
digital signals at four of its stations in Baltimore,  Sacramento, St. Louis and
Pittsburgh  by the end of 1999.  The FCC's  plan  calls  for the DTV  transition
period to end in the year 2006,  at which time the FCC expects  that  television
broadcasters  will cease  non-digital  broadcasting  and return one of their two
channels to the  government,  allowing  that  spectrum to be recovered for other
uses.  Under the Balanced Budget Act,  however,  the FCC is authorized to extend
the  December  31, 2006  deadline  for  reclamation  of a  television  station's
non-digital  channel if, in any given case: (i) one or more television  stations
affiliated with ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox in a market is not broadcasting  digitally,
and the FCC  determines  that such stations have  "exercised  due  diligence" in
attempting  to  convert to  digital  broadcasting;  or (ii) less than 85% of the
television  households in the station's market subscribe to a multichannel video
service (cable, wireless cable or direct-to-home  broadcast satellite television
("DBS"))  that  carries  at least  one  digital  channel  from each of the local
stations in that market; or (iii) less than 85% of the television  households in
the  market  can  receive  digital  signals  off the air using  either a set-top
converter  box for an analog  television  set or a new DTV  television  set. The
Balanced Budget Act also directs the FCC to auction the non-digital  channels by
September  30, 2002 even though they are not to be reclaimed  by the  government
until  at least  December  31,  2006.  The  Balanced  Budget  Act  also  permits
broadcasters  to bid on the  non-digital  channels  in cities  with  populations
greater  than  400,000,  provided the  channels  are used for DTV.  Thus,  it is
possible a broadcaster could own two channels in a market. The FCC has initiated
separate  proceedings to consider the surrender of existing  television channels
and how these frequencies will be used after they are eventually  recovered from
broadcasters.  Additionally,  the FCC has  initiated  a separate  proceeding  to
consider  to what  extent the cable  must-carry  requirements  will apply to DTV
signals.

     Implementation of digital  television will improve the technical quality of
television signals received by viewers.  Under certain  circumstances,  however,
conversion to digital operation may reduce a station's  geographic coverage area
or result in some  increased  interference.  The FCC's DTV allotment plan allows
present UHF stations  that move to DTV channels  considerably  less signal power
than present VHF stations that move to UHF DTV  channels.  While the 1998 orders
of the FCC  present  current UHF  stations  with some  options to overcome  this
disparity,  it is unknown  whether the Company will  benefit from such  options.
Additionally,  the DTV  transmission  standard  adopted by the FCC may not allow
certain  stations  to provide a DTV signal of  adequate  strength to be reliably
received by certain viewers using inside television set antennas. Implementation
of  digital  television  will  also  impose  substantial   additional  costs  on
television  stations  because of the need to replace  equipment and because some
stations  will  need to  operate  at  higher  utility  costs and there can be no
assurance  that  the  Company's  television  stations  will be able to  increase
revenue to offset such  costs.  The Company is  currently  considering  plans to
provide HDTV, to provide multiple channels of television including the provision
of additional  broadcast  programming  and  transmitted  data on a  subscription
basis,  and to continue  its current TV program  channels on its  allocated  DTV
channels.  The 1996 Act allows the FCC to charge a spectrum fee to  broadcasters
who use the digital spectrum to offer subscription-based services. The FCC ruled
that  broadcasters  are subject to the  requirement  to pay a fee of 5% of gross
revenues on all subscription  services. The FCC is also considering imposing new
public  interest  requirements  on  television  licensees  in exchange for their
receipt  of  DTV   channels.   In  addition,   Congress  has  held  hearings  on
broadcasters'  plans  for  the  use of  their  digital  spectrum.A  governmental
commission  was  appointed  to  consider  whether   additional   public  service
obligations should be imposed on television broadcasters.  The commission issued
its  report  in  December  1998  making  several  non-binding   recommendations,
including that  broadcasters  voluntarily  provide five minutes of free air time
per evening to political  candidates  for thirty days prior to an election.  The
Company cannot predict the impact of such recommendations or what future actions
the FCC might  take with  respect to DTV,  nor can it predict  the effect of the
FCC's present DTV  implementation  plan or such future  actions on the Company's
business. 

Proposed Changes
- ----------------

     The  Congress and the FCC have under  consideration,  and in the future may
consider and adopt, new laws,  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety
of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly,  the operation,  ownership
and  profitability of the Company's  broadcast  stations,  result in the loss of
audience share and advertising  revenues for the Company's  broadcast  stations,
and affect the ability of the Company to acquire  additional  broadcast stations
or finance such  acquisitions.  In addition to the changes and proposed  changes
noted above, such matters may include, for example, the license renewal process,
spectrum use fees, political  advertising rates,  potential  restrictions on the
advertising of certain products (beer, wine and hard liquor,  for example),  and
the rules and  policies to be applied in  enforcing  the FCC's equal  employment
opportunity regulations. Other matters that could affect the Company's broadcast
properties  include   technological   innovations  and  developments   generally
affecting competition in the mass communications  industry, such as direct radio
and television  broadcast  satellite  service,  the continued  establishment  of
wireless cable systems and low power television stations, digital television and
radio   technologies,   the  Internet  and  the  advent  of  telephone   company
participation in the provision of video programming service. 

Other Considerations
- --------------------

     The foregoing  summary does not purport to be a complete  discussion of all
provisions  of the  Communications  Act or  other  congressional  acts or of the
regulations and policies of the FCC. For further  information,  reference should
be made to the Communications Act, other congressional acts, and regulations and
public  notices  promulgated  from time to time by the FCC. There are additional
regulations  and  policies  of the FCC and other  federal  agencies  that govern
political broadcasts, public affairs programming,  equal employment opportunity,
and other matters affecting the Company's business and operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

     Prior to the Company's ownership or operation of its facilities, substances
or  waste  that  are  or  might  be  considered   hazardous   under   applicable
environmental  laws may have been  generated,  used,  stored or  disposed  of at
certain of those facilities.  In addition,  environmental conditions relating to
the soil and groundwater at or under the Company's facilities may be affected by
the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored or disposed
of hazardous  substances.  As a result,  it is possible  that the Company  could
become subject to  environmental  liabilities  in the future in connection  with
these facilities under applicable  environmental laws and regulations.  Although
the  Company   believes  that  it  is  in  substantial   compliance   with  such
environmental  requirements,  and has not in the  past  been  required  to incur
significant  costs in connection  therewith,  there can be no assurance that the
Company's  costs to  comply  with such  requirements  will not  increase  in the
future.  The Company  presently  believes that none of its  properties  have any
condition  that is likely to have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's
financial condition or results of operations.


COMPETITION

     The Company's  television and radio stations compete for audience share and
advertising revenue with other television and radio stations in their respective
DMAs or MSAs,  as well as with  other  advertising  media,  such as  newspapers,
magazines,  outdoor advertising,  transit advertising,  yellow page directories,
direct mail and local cable and wireless cable  systems.  Some  competitors  are
part of larger organizations with substantially greater financial, technical and
other resources than the Company.

     Television Competition. Competition in the television broadcasting industry
occurs  primarily in  individual  DMAs.  Generally,  a  television  broadcasting
station in one DMA does not compete with  stations in other DMAs.  The Company's
television stations are located in highly competitive DMAs. In addition, certain
of the Company's DMAs are overlapped by both  over-the-air and cable carriage of
stations in adjacent  DMAs,  which tends to spread  viewership  and  advertising
expenditures over a larger number of television stations.

     Broadcast  television  stations compete for advertising  revenues primarily
with other broadcast television stations,  radio stations,  cable channels,  and
cable system operators serving the same market.  Traditional network programming
generally  achieves  higher  household  audience  levels  than  Fox,  WB and UPN
programming and syndicated  programming aired by independent stations.  This can
be attributed to a combination of factors,  including the traditional  networks'
efforts to reach a broader audience,  generally better signal carriage available
when  broadcasting  over VHF channels 2 through 13 versus  broadcasting over UHF
channels  14 through 69 and the higher  number of hours of  traditional  network
programming being broadcast weekly. However, greater amounts of advertising time
are  available  for sale  during Fox,  UPN and WB  programming  and  non-network
syndicated programming,  and as a result the Company believes that the Company's
programming typically achieves a share of television market advertising revenues
greater than its share of the market's audience.

     Television  stations  compete for audience share  primarily on the basis of
program  popularity,  which has a direct effect on  advertising  rates.  A large
amount of the  Company's  prime time  programming  is  supplied  by Fox and to a
lesser  extent WB,  UPN,  ABC,  NBC and CBS.  In those  periods,  the  Company's
affiliated  stations are totally dependent upon the performance of the networks'
programs in attracting  viewers.  Non-network time periods are programmed by the
station primarily with syndicated  programs purchased for cash, cash and barter,
or barter-only,  and also through  self-produced  news, public affairs and other
entertainment programming.

     Television  advertising rates are based upon factors which include the size
of the DMA in which the  station  operates,  a  program's  popularity  among the
viewers  that an  advertiser  wishes  to  attract,  the  number  of  advertisers
competing for the available  time, the  demographic  makeup of the DMA served by
the  station,  the  availability  of  alternative  advertising  media in the DMA
including radio and cable, the  aggressiveness  and knowledge of sales forces in
the DMA and  development of projects,  features and programs that tie advertiser
messages to  programming.  The Company  believes that its sales and  programming
strategies allow it to compete effectively for advertising within its DMAs.


                                       23
<PAGE>

     Other  factors  that are  material to a  television  station's  competitive
position include signal coverage, local program acceptance, network affiliation,
audience  characteristics and assigned broadcast  frequency.  Historically,  the
Company's UHF broadcast  stations  have suffered a competitive  disadvantage  in
comparison   to  stations  with  VHF   broadcast   frequencies.   This  historic
disadvantage has gradually declined through (i) carriage on cable systems,  (ii)
improvement   in  television   receivers,   (iii)   improvement   in  television
transmitters, (iv) wider use of all channel antennae, (v) increased availability
of  programming,  and (vi) the  development  of new networks such as Fox, WB and
UPN.

     The broadcasting  industry is continuously faced with technical changes and
innovations, the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media,
changes in labor conditions, and governmental restrictions or actions of federal
regulatory  bodies,  including  the FCC,  any of  which  could  possibly  have a
material  effect on a television  station's  operations  and profits.  There are
sources of video service other than conventional  television stations,  the most
common being cable  television,  which can increase  competition for a broadcast
television station by bringing into its market distant  broadcasting signals not
otherwise available to the station's audience,  serving as a distribution system
for national satellite-delivered programming and other non-broadcast programming
originated on a cable system and selling  advertising time to local advertisers.
Other  principal  sources of  competition  include  home video  exhibition,  DBS
entertainment  services  and  multichannel   multipoint   distribution  services
("MMDS").  DBS and cable operators in particular are competing more aggressively
than in the past for  advertising  revenues in our TV  stations'  markets.  This
competition could adversely affect our stations' revenues and performance in the
future.   Moreover,   technology   advances  and  regulatory  changes  affecting
programming  delivery through fiber optic telephone lines and video  compression
could lower entry barriers for new video channels and encourage the  development
of increasingly specialized "niche" programming.  The 1996 Act permits telephone
companies to provide video distribution  services via radio communication,  on a
common  carrier  basis,  as "cable  systems"  or as "open video  systems,"  each
pursuant to different  regulatory schemes. The Company is unable to predict what
other video  technologies  might be considered in the future, or the effect that
technological  and  regulatory  changes  will have on the  broadcast  television
industry and on the future  profitability  and value of a  particular  broadcast
television station.

     The  Company   believes  that  television   broadcasting  may  be  enhanced
significantly  by the development and increased  availability of DTV technology.
This  technology  has the  potential  to permit the  Company to provide  viewers
multiple  channels  of digital  television  over each of its  existing  standard
channels,  to provide certain programming in a high definition television format
and to deliver  various forms of data,  including data on the Internet,  to home
and business  computers.  These additional  capabilities may provide the Company
with additional sources of revenue.  The Company is currently  considering plans
to provide  HDTV,  to provide  multiple  channels of  television  including  the
provision  of  additional  broadcast  programming  and  transmitted  data  on  a
subscription  basis,  and to  continue  its  current TV program  channels on its
allocated  DTV  channels.  The Company has  obtained  FCC  authority  to conduct
experimental DTV multicasting  operations in Baltimore,  Maryland.  The 1996 Act
allows  the FCC to charge a spectrum  fee to  broadcasters  who use the  digital
spectrum  to  offer   subscription-based   services.  The  FCC  has  ruled  that
broadcasters  are  required  to  pay  a  fee  of 5% of  gross  revenues  in  all
subscription services. In addition,  Congress has held hearings on broadcasters'
plans for the use of their digital  spectrum.  The Company  cannot  predict what
future  actions the FCC or Congress  might take with  respect to DTV, nor can it
predict the effect of the FCC's present DTV  implementation  plan or such future
actions on the Company's  business.  While DTV technology is currently available
in some of the top ten viewing markets, a successful transition from the current
analog broadcast format to a digital format may take many years. There can be no
assurance  that the Company's  efforts to take  advantage of the new  technology
will be commercially successful.

     The Company also competes for programming,  which involves negotiating with
national  program  distributors  or  syndicators  that sell  first-run and rerun
packages of programming.  The Company's stations compete for exclusive access to
those programs against in-market  broadcast  station  competitors for syndicated
products.  Cable  systems  generally  do not  compete  with local  stations  for
programming,  although  various  national  cable networks from time to time have
acquired programs that would have


                                       24
<PAGE>

otherwise  been  offered  to  local  television  stations.  Public  broadcasting
stations generally compete with commercial  broadcasters for viewers but not for
advertising dollars.

     Historically,  the cost of programming has increased because of an increase
in the number of new independent stations and a shortage of quality programming.
However,  the  Company  believes  that over the past five years  program  prices
generally have stabilized.

     The  Company  believes  it  competes  favorably  against  other  television
stations  because of its  management  skill and  experience,  the ability of the
Company  historically to generate revenue share greater than its audience share,
its network  affiliations  and its local program  acceptance.  In addition,  the
Company  believes  that it benefits  from the  operation  of multiple  broadcast
properties,   affording  it  certain  nonquantifiable  economies  of  scale  and
competitive advantages in the purchase of programming.

     Radio Competition. Radio broadcasting is a highly competitive business, and
each of the radio stations  operated by the Company  competes for audience share
and  advertising  revenue  directly with other radio  stations in its geographic
market,  as well as with other media,  including  television,  cable television,
newspapers,  magazines,  direct mail and  billboard  advertising.  The  audience
ratings and advertising  revenue of each of such stations are subject to change,
and any adverse  change in a  particular  market  could have a material  adverse
effect on the revenue of such radio stations  located in that market.  There can
be no assurance  that any one of the  Company's  radio  stations will be able to
maintain or increase its current audience ratings and radio advertising  revenue
market share.

     The Company attempts to improve each radio station's  competitive  position
with promotional campaigns designed to enhance and reinforce its identities with
the  listening  public.  Extensive  market  research  is  conducted  in order to
identify specific  demographic  groups and design a programming format for those
groups.  The Company seeks to build a strong  listener base composed of specific
demographic  groups in each market, and thereby attract  advertisers  seeking to
reach  these  listeners.  Aside  from  building  its  stations'  identities  and
targeting its programming at specific  demographic  groups,  management believes
that the Company also obtains a competitive  advantage by operating duopolies or
multiple stations in the nation's larger mid-size markets.

     The radio  broadcasting  industry is also subject to  competition  from new
media technologies that are being developed or introduced,  such as the delivery
of  audio  programming  by  cable  television   systems  and  by  digital  audio
broadcasting  ("DAB"). DAB may provide a medium for the delivery by satellite or
terrestrial  means of  multiple  new  audio  programming  formats  to local  and
national  audiences.  Also, new technology has introduced the broadcast of radio
programming  over the Internet.  This new  capability  may provide an additional
source of competition in some of the Company's markets.  Historically, the radio
broadcasting  industry  has  grown  in  terms  of  total  revenues  despite  the
introduction  of  new  technologies  for  the  delivery  of  entertainment   and
information, such as television broadcasting,  cable television, audio tapes and
compact  disks.  In  addition,  the FCC has  initiated a  rulemaking  proceeding
proposing  to create a new lower  power FM radio  service,  which may create new
competition  in some of our radio markets.  There can be no assurance,  however,
that the development or  introduction in the future of any new media  technology
will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcast industry.

EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 1998,  the Company had  approximately  4,200  employees.
With the  exception of certain of the  employees of KOVR-TV,  KDNL-TV,  WSYX-TV,
WCHS-TV,  and certain  employees at radio  stations in New Orleans and two radio
stations in St.  Louis,  none of the  employees is  represented  by labor unions
under any collective  bargaining  agreement.  No significant labor problems have
been  experienced  by the Company,  and the Company  considers its overall labor
relations to be good.

     As of March 23, 1999, there were  approximately  103 stockholders of record
of the common  stock of the  Company.  This number  does not include  beneficial
owners holding shares through nominee names.  Based on information  available to

Common Stock.

not expect to pay dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable  future.  The
1998  Bank  Credit  Agreement  and  certain  subordinated  debt  of the  Company
generally  prohibit the Company from paying dividends on its common stock. Under
the indentures  governing the Company's 10% Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2005,
9% Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2007 and 8 3/4% Senior  Subordinated Notes due
2007,  the Company is not  permitted to pay dividends on its common stock unless
certain  specified  conditions  are  satisfied,  including  that (i) no event of
default then exists under the  indenture or certain other  specified  agreements
relating  to  indebtedness  of the Company and (ii) the  Company,  after  taking
account  of  the  dividend,   is  in  compliance  with  certain  net  cash  flow
requirements  contained in the  indenture.  In addition,  under  certain  senior
unsecured  debt of the  Company,  the payment of  dividends  is not  permissible
during a default thereunder.

(c)   Depreciation  and amortization  includes  amortization of program contract
      costs and net realizable value adjustments,  depreciation and amortization
      of  property  and  equipment,  and  amortization  of  acquired  intangible

      stock-based  compensation  depreciation and  amortization  (including film

      payments for program rights. Cash program payments represent cash payments
      made for current  programs  payable and do not  necessarily  correspond to
      program usage.  The Company has presented  broadcast cash flow data, which
      the Company believes is comparable to the data provided by other companies
      in the  industry,  because  such data are  commonly  used as a measure  of
      performance for broadcast  companies;  however,  there can be no assurance

      represent  cash  provided by  operating  activities  as  reflected  in the
      Company's  consolidated  statements  of cash  flows,  is not a measure  of
      financial  performance under generally accepted accounting  principles and
      should not be considered  in isolation or as a substitute  for measures of
      performance  prepared in accordance  with  generally  accepted  accounting
      principles.  Management  believes the  presentation of broadcast cash flow
      (BCF) is relevant and useful  because 1) BCF is a measurement  utilized by
      lenders to measure the Company's  ability to service its debt, 2) BCF is a
      measurement  utilized by industry  analysts to determine a private  market
      value of the  Company's  television  and  radio  stations  and 3) BCF is a
      measurement  industry  analysts  utilize when  determining  the  operating

      expenses  and is a commonly  used  measure of  performance  for  broadcast
      companies.  The Company has  presented  Adjusted  EBITDA  data,  which the
      Company  believes is comparable to the data provided by other companies in
      the  industry,  because  such  data  are  commonly  used as a  measure  of

(h)   "After tax cash flow" is defined as net income (loss)  available to common
      shareholders,  plus extraordinary  items (before the effect of related tax
      benefits)   plus    depreciation   and   amortization    (excluding   film
      amortization),  stock-based  compensation,  unrealized  loss on derivative
      instrument, the deferred tax provision (or minus the deferred tax benefit)
      and minus the gain on sale of assets.  The Company has presented after tax
      cash flow data,  which the  Company  believes  is  comparable  to the data
      provided  by  other  companies  in the  industry,  because  such  data are
      commonly  used  as a  measure  of  performance  for  broadcast  companies;
      however, there can be no assurances that it is comparable.  After tax cash
      flow is presented here not as a measure of operating  results and does not
      purport to represent cash provided by operating activities. After tax cash
      flow should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures
      of performance  prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting
      principles.  Management  believes the  presentation of after tax cash flow
      (ATCF) is relevant and useful  because ATCF is a  measurement  utilized by

ITEM  7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
         OF OPERATIONS


INTRODUCTION

     As of December 31, 1998,  the Company  owned,  operated,  or  programmed 56
television  stations in 36 geographically  diverse markets and 51 radio stations
in 10  geographically  diverse  markets  in the  United  States.  As of the date
hereof, the Company owns, or provides  programming services pursuant to LMAs to,
57 television stations, has pending acquisitions of four television stations and
has entered into an agreement to sell two television stations. The Company owns,
or programs pursuant to LMAs to, 56 radio stations, two of which the Company has
options to acquire and five of which the Company holds for sale.

     The  operating  revenues of the Company are derived from local and national
advertisers  and,  to a much  lesser  extent,  from  political  advertisers  and
television network  compensation.  The Company's revenues from local advertisers
have  continued to trend  upward and revenues  from  national  advertisers  have
continued to trend  downward when  measured as a percentage  of total  broadcast
revenue. The Company believes this trend is primarily resulting from an increase
in the number of media outlets providing  national  advertisers a means by which
to advertise  their goods and services.  The Company's  efforts to mitigate this
trend  include  continuing  its  efforts  to  increase  local  revenues  and the
development  of  innovative   marketing   strategies  to  sell  traditional  and
non-traditional services to national advertisers.

     The Company's primary operating  expenses involved in owning,  operating or
programming  the television  and radio  stations are  syndicated  program rights
fees, commissions on revenues, employee salaries, and news-gathering and station
promotional  costs.  Amortization  and depreciation of costs associated with the
acquisition  of the  stations  and  interest  carrying  charges are  significant
factors in determining the Company's overall profitability.

     Set forth below are the principal types of broadcast  revenues  received by
the Company's stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution
of each type to the Company's total gross broadcast revenues:

retail/department  stores  (6.6%) and  professional  services  (5.9%).  No other
advertising  category  accounted for more than 5% of the Company's net broadcast
revenues in 1998.  No  individual  advertiser  accounted for more than 2% of the
Company's consolidated net broadcast revenues in 1998.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- ---------------------


YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1997.

     Net broadcast  revenue  increased  $201.6 million to $672.8 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 from $471.2 million for the year ended December 31,
1997,  or 42.8%.  The  increase  in net  broadcast  revenue  for the year  ended
December  31,  1998 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1997  comprised
$194.3 million  related to businesses  acquired or disposed of by the Company in
1998 (the "1998 Transactions") and $7.3 million resulted from an increase in net
broadcast  revenues on a same station  basis,  representing a 1.5% increase over
prior year's net broadcast revenue for these stations.  On a same station basis,
revenues were  negatively  impacted by a decrease in revenues in the  Baltimore,
Milwaukee,  Norfolk and Raleigh markets.  The Company's  television  stations in
these  markets  experienced  a decrease in ratings  which  resulted in a loss in
revenues  and market  revenue  share.  In the  Raleigh  and  Norfolk  television
markets,  the Company's  affiliation  agreements  with Fox expired on August 31,
1998 which further  contributed  to a decrease in ratings and  revenues.  In the
Baltimore market, the addition of a new UPN affiliate competitor  contributed to
a loss  in  ratings  and  market  revenue  share.  An  additional  factor  which
negatively impacted station revenues for the year was the loss of General Motors
advertising  revenues  caused by a strike of its employees.  These  decreases in
revenue on a same station basis were offset by revenue  growth at certain of the
Company's  other  television  and radio  stations  combined  with an increase in
network compensation revenue and political advertising revenue.

     Total  operating  costs  increased  $88.8 million to $287.1 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 from $198.3 million for the year ended December 31,
1997, or 44.8%.  The increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31,
1998 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997  comprised  $81.3  million
related  to the 1998  Transactions,  $4.4  million  related  to an  increase  in
corporate  overhead  expenses,  and  $3.1  million  related  to an  increase  in
operating costs on a same station basis, representing a 1.8% increase over prior
year's  operating costs for those stations.  The increase in corporate  overhead
expenses  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998  primarily  resulted  from an
increase  in legal fees and an  increase  in salary  costs  incurred to manage a
larger base of operations.

     Depreciation and amortization increased $47.7 million to $199.9 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998 from $152.2 million for the year ended December
31, 1997. The increase in depreciation and  amortization  related to fixed asset
and intangible asset additions  associated with businesses  acquired during 1997
and 1998.

     Broadcast  operating  income  increased $66.1 million to $192.4 million for
the year  ended  December  31,  1998,  from  $126.3  million  for the year ended
December 31, 1997, or 52.3%. The net increase in broadcast  operating income for
the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997
was primarily attributable to the 1998 Transactions.

     Interest  expense  increased  $40.6 million to $139.0  million for the year
ended December 31, 1998 from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997,
or 41.3%.  The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1998
primarily  related to  indebtedness  incurred  by the  Company  to  finance  the
Acquisitions.  Subsidiary  trust minority  interest expense of $23.3 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998 is related to the private placement of the $200
million  aggregate  liquidation value 11 5/8% High Yield Trust Offered Preferred
Securities  (the "HYTOPS")  completed March 12, 1997. The increase in subsidiary
trust minority interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 1997 related to the HYTOPS being  outstanding for
a partial period during 1997.

     Interest  and other  income  increased  to $6.7  million for the year ended
December 31, 1998 from $2.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  This
increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances during these periods.
However,  cash  balances  were lower at December  31, 1998 than at December  31,
1997.

     Net loss for the year ended December 31, 1998 was $16.9 million or $.29 per
share compared to net loss of $10.6 million or $.19 per share for the year ended
December 31, 1997.  Net loss  increased for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as
compared to the year ended  December  31,  1997 due to an increase in  operating
expenses,  depreciation and  amortization,  interest  expense,  subsidiary trust
minority interest


                                       36

expense,  the  recognition of an unrealized loss of $9.1 million on a derivative
instrument and the recognition of an extraordinary loss offset by an increase in
total  revenues,  a gain on the sale of  broadcast  assets  and an  increase  in
interest and other income. The Company's extraordinary loss of $11.1 million net
of a related tax benefit of $7.4  million  resulted  from the  write-off of debt
acquisition costs associated with indebtedness  replaced by the 1998 Bank Credit
Agreement.  As noted above,  the Company's net loss for the year ended  December
31, 1998  included  recognition  of a loss of $9.1 million on a treasury  option
derivative  instrument.   Upon  execution  of  the  treasury  option  derivative
instrument,  the Company  received a cash payment of $9.5 million.  The treasury
option  derivative  instrument  will  require  the  Company to make five  annual
payments equal to the difference  between 6.14% minus the interest rate yield on
five-year  treasury  securities  on  September  30, 2000 times the $300  million
notional amount of the instrument. If the yield on five-year treasuries is equal
to or greater than 6.14% on September 30, 2000, the Company will not be required
to make any  payment  under the terms of this  instrument.  If the rate is below
6.14% on that date, the Company will be required to make payments,  as described
above,  and the size of the payment  will  increase as the rate goes down.  Each
year,  the Company  recognizes  an expense  equal to the change in the projected
liability under this arrangement based on interest rates at the end of the year.
The loss  recognized in the year ended  December 31, 1998 reflects an adjustment
of the Company's  liability under this instrument to the present value of future
payments based on the two-year  forward  five-year  treasury rate as of December
31, 1998.  If the yield on five-year  treasuries  at September  30, 2000 were to
equal the two year forward five year  treasury rate on December 31, 1998 (4.6%),
Sinclair would be required to make five annual  payments of  approximately  $4.6
million each. If the yield on five-year  treasuries  declines further in periods
before  September  30,  2000,  Sinclair  will be required to  recognize  further
losses.  In any event,  Sinclair will not be required to make any payments until
September 30, 2000.

     Broadcast Cash Flow increased $106.7 million to $350.1 million for the year
ended  December  31, 1998 from $243.4  million for the year ended  December  31,
1997,  or  43.8%.  The  increase  in  Broadcast  Cash Flow  related  to the 1998
Transactions and Broadcast Cash Flow on a same station basis remained relatively
unchanged for the periods. The Company's Broadcast Cash Flow Margin increased to
52.0%  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998 from  51.7%  for the year  ended
December 31, 1997. The increase in Broadcast Cash Flow Margin for the year ended
December  31,  1998 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1997  primarily
resulted from a lag in program  contract  payments for certain of the television
broadcasting  assets acquired during 1998 of  approximately  $4.3 million and an
increase  in  radio  broadcast  cash  flow  margins.  On a same  station  basis,
Broadcast Cash Flow Margin  decreased from 51.8% for the year ended December 31,
1997 to 50.9% for the year ended  December 31, 1998.  This decrease in Broadcast
Cash Flow Margin primarily  resulted from an increase in film payments  combined
with a disproportionate increase in net broadcast revenue.

     Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses.
Adjusted  EBITDA  increased  $102.3 million to $331.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1998 from $229.0  million for the year ended  December 31, 1997, or
44.7%.  The increase in Adjusted  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1998 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 resulted from the 1998 Transactions
offset by a $4.4 million increase in corporate overhead  expenses,  as described
above.  The Company's  Adjusted  EBITDA  margin  increased to 49.2% for the year
ended  December 31, 1998 from 48.6% for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  This
increase in Adjusted  EBITDA margin  resulted  primarily from the  circumstances
affecting  broadcast  cash flow  margins as noted above offset by an increase in
corporate expenses.

     After Tax Cash Flow increased  $44.9 million to $149.8 million for the year
ended  December  31, 1998 from $104.9  million for the year ended  December  31,
1997, or 42.8%.  The increase in After Tax Cash Flow for the year ended December
31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 primarily resulted from
a net increase in broadcast  operating income relating to the 1998  Transactions
offset by an increase in interest expense and subsidiary trust minority interest
expense relating to the HYTOPS.


YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1997 AND 1996.

     Net broadcast  revenue  increased  $124.7 million to $471.2 million for the
year ended December 31, 1997 from $346.5 million for the year ended December 31,
1996 or 36.0%. The increase in net broadcast


                                       37
<PAGE>

revenue  for the year ended  December  31,  1997 as  compared  to the year ended
December 31, 1996  comprised  $114.5  million  related to  television  and radio
station acquisitions and LMA transactions  consummated during 1996 and 1997 (the
"1996 and 1997 Acquisitions") and $10.2 million resulted from an increase in net
broadcast  revenues  on a same  station  basis.  Also on a same  station  basis,
revenues from local and national  advertisers grew 7.7% and 4.9%,  respectively,
for a combined growth rate of 6.1%.

     Total  operating  costs  increased  $55.7 million to $198.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 1997 from $142.6 million for the year ended December 31,
1996 or 39.1%.  The increase in operating  costs for the year ended December 31,
1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996  comprised  $49.0  million
related  to the  1996 and  1997  Acquisitions,  $5.4  million  resulted  from an
increase in  corporate  overhead  expenses,  and $1.3 million  resulted  from an
increase in  operating  costs on a same  station  basis.  Also on a same station
basis, operating costs increased 1.8%.

     Depreciation and amortization increased $31.1 million to $152.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 1997 from $121.1 million for the year ended December
31, 1996. The increase in depreciation and  amortization  related to fixed asset
and intangible asset additions  associated with businesses  acquired during 1996
and 1997.

     Broadcast  operating  income increased to $126.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997,  from $88.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996, or
42.1%.  The increase in broadcast  operating  income for the year ended December
31,  1997 as  compared  to the  year  ended  December  31,  1996  was  primarily
attributable to the 1996 and 1997 Acquisitions.

     Interest expense increased to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31,
1997 from $84.3  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996,  or 16.7%.  The
increase in  interest  expense for the year ended  December  31, 1997  primarily
related to  indebtedness  incurred  by the  Company to finance the 1996 and 1997
Acquisitions.  Subsidiary  trust minority  interest expense of $18.6 million for
the year ended  December  31, 1997 is related to the HYTOPS  offering  completed
March 12, 1997.  Subsidiary trust minority interest expense was partially offset
by reductions in interest  expense because a portion of the proceeds of the sale
of the  HYTOPS was used to reduce  indebtedness  under the  Company's  1997 Bank
Credit Agreement.

     Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $2.2  million for the year ended
December 31, 1997 from $3.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This
decrease was primarily due to lower average cash balances during these periods.

     Net loss for the year ended December 31, 1997 was $10.6 million or $.19 per
share  compared  to net  income of $1.1  million  or $.02 per share for the year
ended December 31, 1996. Net loss increased for the year ended December 31, 1997
as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996 due to an increase in operating
expenses,  depreciation and  amortization,  interest  expense,  subsidiary trust
minority   interest   expense  not  incurred  in  1996  and  recognition  of  an
extraordinary  loss  offset  by an  increase  in total  broadcast  revenue.  The
Company's  extraordinary  loss of $6.1  million  net of a related tax benefit of
$4.0 million  resulted from the write-off of debt  acquisition  costs  resulting
from the redemption of substantially all of the 1993 Notes.

     Broadcast Cash Flow increased  $54.2 million to $243.4 million for the year
ended  December  31, 1997 from $189.2  million for the year ended  December  31,
1996,  or 28.6%.  The increase in Broadcast  Cash Flow  comprised  $45.0 million
relating  to the 1996 and 1997  Acquisitions  and  $9.2  million  resulted  from
Broadcast  Cash Flow growth on a same station  basis,  which had Broadcast  Cash
Flow growth of 8.2%. The Company's Broadcast Cash Flow Margin decreased to 51.7%
for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from 54.6% for the year ended December 31,
1996. The decrease in Broadcast Cash Flow Margin for the year ended December 31,
1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily resulted from the
lower margins related to the 1996 Acquisitions. In addition, 1996 Broadcast Cash
Flow Margin  benefited from a  non-recurring  $4.7 million timing lag of program
contract  payments  relating to the River City  Acquisition  and  certain  other
acquisitions.  On a same station basis, Broadcast Cash Flow Margin improved from
57.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to 58.9% for the year ended December
31, 1997.

     Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA increased to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997
from $180.3  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1996,  or 27.0%.  These
increases in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31,


                                       38
<PAGE>

1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996 resulted from the 1996 and
1997 Acquisitions and to a lesser extent, increases in net broadcast revenues on
a same station basis.  The Company's  Adjusted EBITDA margin  decreased to 48.6%
for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from 52.0% for the year ended December 31,
1996.  This  decrease in Adjusted  EBITDA  margin  resulted  primarily  from the
circumstances affecting broadcast cash flow margins as noted above combined with
an increase in corporate  expenses.  Corporate  overhead  expenses  increased to
$14.4  million for the year ended  December  31, 1997 from $8.9  million for the
year ended December 31, 1996, or 61.8%.  These  increases in corporate  expenses
primarily   result  from  costs  associated  with  managing  a  larger  base  of
operations.  During 1996, the Company  increased the size of its corporate staff
as a result  of the  addition  of a radio  business  segment  and a  significant
increase in the number of television stations owned, operated or programmed. The
costs associated with this increase in staff were only incurred during a partial
period of the year ended December 31, 1996.

     After Tax Cash Flow increased to $104.9 million for the year ended December
31, 1997 from $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, or 35.4%.  The
increase in After Tax Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared
to the year ended  December 31, 1996  primarily  resulted from the 1996 and 1997
Acquisitions,  an increase in revenues on a same station basis, a Federal income
tax receivable of $10.6 million  resulting from 1997 NOL carry-backs,  offset by
interest  expense  on  the  debt  incurred  to  consummate  the  1996  and  1997
Acquisitions  and subsidiary  trust  minority  interest  expense  related to the
private placement of the HYTOPS issued during March 1997.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     The Company's  primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations
and availability under the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement.  As of December 31, 1998,
the  Company  had $3.3  million  in cash  balances  and net  working  capital of
approximately $55.8 million.  The Company's net decrease in cash to $3.3 million
at December 31, 1998 from $139.3 million at December 31, 1997 primarily resulted
from the 1998  Transactions.  As of December 31,  1998,  the  remaining  balance
available under the Revolving  Credit Facility was $197.0 million.  Based on pro
forma  trailing cash flow levels for the twelve months ended  December 31, 1998,
the Company had  approximately  $75.2  million  available  of current  borrowing
capacity under the Revolving  Credit  Facility.  The 1998 Bank Credit  Agreement
also  provides for an  incremental  term loan  commitment in the amount of up to
$400  million  which can be  utilized  upon  approval  by the Agent bank and the
raising of sufficient commitments from banks to fund the additional loans.

     The Company has current  acquisition  commitments of  approximately  $122.0
million net of proceeds  totaling  $242.0 million  anticipated  from the sale of
television  stations  related  to  the  Ackerley   Disposition,   the  1999  STC
Disposition and the CCA Disposition (collectively,  the "Pending Transactions").
In order to complete the Pending  Transactions during the second quarter of 1999
and also remain in compliance  with certain of its debt  covenants,  the Company
estimates  that  it  would  be  required  to  generate   proceeds  from  station
dispositions of approximately  $30 million or alternatively  raise proceeds from
common or preferred stock securities issuances of approximately $15 million. The
Company  announced in the fourth  quarter of 1998 that it intended to enter into
agreements to sell  selected  television  and radio  stations not central to its
business strategy. As of March 22, 1999, the Company has entered into agreements
to sell stations for aggregate  consideration of approximately  $140 million and
was  actively  planning to sell an  additional  $35 million in  properties.  The
Company intends to evaluate whether further  divestitures are appropriate  after
completing  these sales.  The Company's  other primary  sources of liquidity are
cash  provided  by  operations  and  availability  under  the 1998  Bank  Credit
Agreement. 

     The Company anticipates that funds from operations, existing cash balances,
the  availability  of the Revolving  Credit  Facility under the 1998 Bank Credit
Agreement and the proceeds from the sale of certain  stations will be sufficient
to meet its working  capital,  capital  expenditure  commitments,  debt  service
requirements and current acquisition commitments.

     Net cash flows from  operating  activities  increased to $150.5 million for
the year ended  December 31, 1998 from $96.6 million for the year ended December
31,  1997.  The Company  made income tax  payments of $3.6  million for the year
ended December 31, 1998 as compared to $6.5 million for the year ended


                                       39

December  31,  1997.   The  Company  made  interest   payments  on   outstanding
indebtedness  and payments for subsidiary  minority  interest  expense  totaling
$140.9  million  during the year ended  December  31, 1998 as compared to $116.2
million for the year ended December 31, 1997.  Additional  interest payments for
the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997
primarily  related to  additional  interest  costs on  indebtedness  incurred to
finance  businesses  acquired during 1998.  Program rights payments increased to
$64.3  million for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from $51.1  million for the
year ended December 31, 1997. This increase in program rights payments comprised
$8.8 million  related to the 1998  Transactions  and $4.4 million  related to an
increase in programming costs on a same station basis, which increased 8.7%.

     Net cash flows used in investing  activities  increased to $1.8 billion for
the year ended December 31, 1998 from $219.0 million for the year ended December
31, 1997.  For the year ended  December 31, 1998, the Company made cash payments
of approximately $2.1 billion related to the acquisition of television and radio
broadcast assets primarily by utilizing  available  indebtedness  under the 1998
Bank Credit  Agreement.  These payments  included  $232.9 million related to the
WSYX  Acquisition,  $53.0 million  related to the Lakeland  Acquisition,  $571.3
million  related to the  Heritage  Acquisition,  $951.0  million  related to the
Sullivan  Acquisition,  $239.4 million related to the Max Media  Acquisition and
$10.4 million  related to other  acquisitions.  For the year ended  December 31,
1998, the Company received approximately $273.3 million of cash proceeds related
to the sale of certain television and radio broadcast assets which was primarily
utilized to repay indebtedness under the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement.  These cash
proceeds  included  $126.9 million  related to the Entercom  Disposition,  $72.0
million  related  to the  STC  Disposition,  $35.0  million  related  to the SFX
Disposition, $21.0 million related to the Radio Unica Disposition, $16.1 million
related to the Centennial  Disposition  and $2.3 million  related to the sale of
other broadcast  assets.  For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company made
cash payments  related to the Buffalo  Acquisition of $3.3 million and made cash
payments of $6.9 million for  deposits  and other costs  related to other future
acquisitions.  During  1998,  the Company  made equity  investments  in Acrodyne
Communications,  Inc. and USA Digital Radio, Inc. of approximately  $7.1 million
and $1.5  million,  respectively.  The Company  made  payments  for property and
equipment of $19.4  million for the year ended  December  31, 1998.  The Company
expects that  expenditures for property and equipment will increase for the year
ended  December 31, 1999 as a result of a larger number of stations owned by the
Company.  In addition,  the Company  anticipates  that future  requirements  for
capital  expenditures  will include  capital  expenditures  incurred  during the
ordinary course of business and additional  strategic  station  acquisitions and
equity  investments  if suitable  investments  can be  identified  on acceptable
terms.

     Net cash flows provided by financing  activities  increased to $1.5 billion
for the year ended  December  31,  1998 from  $259.4  million for the year ended
December 31,  1997.  In April 1998,  the Company and certain  Series B Preferred
stockholders  of the Company  completed  a public  offering  of  12,000,000  and
4,060,374 shares, respectively of Class A Common Stock. The shares were sold for
an offering price of $29.125 per share and generated  proceeds to the Company of
$335.1  million,  net of  underwriters'  discount  and other  offering  costs of
approximately $14.4 million. The Company utilized proceeds to repay indebtedness
under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement.  In May 1998, the Company entered into the
1998 Bank Credit Agreement in order to expand its borrowing  capacity for future
acquisitions  and obtain more  favorable  terms with its banks. A portion of the
proceeds of the initial  borrowing under the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement was used
to repay all outstanding indebtedness related to the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement.
In addition,  during September 1998, the Company repurchased 1,505,000 shares of
its Class A Common Stock for an aggregate  purchase price of $26.7  million,  an
average share price of $17.72. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the Company
also made option  premium  payments of $14.0  million  related to equity put and
call options entered into during 1998.


INCOME TAXES

     The income tax  provision  increased  to $45.7  million  for the year ended
December 31, 1998 from a provision of $16.0 million for the year ended  December
31, 1997.  The  Company's  effective  tax rate  decreased to 114.6% for the year
ended  December 31, 1998 from 139.1% for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  The
decrease in the  Company's  effective  tax rate for the year ended  December 31,
1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997  primarily  resulted from a
decrease in the deferred tax


                                       40
<PAGE>

liability  associated  with dividends  paid on the Company's  Series C Preferred
Stock  (see  Note  8,  sub-note  (a) to  the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial
Statements).  Management believes that pre-tax income and "earnings and profits"
will increase in future years which will further result in a lower effective tax
rate and utilization of certain tax deductions  related to dividends paid on the
Company's Series C Preferred Stock.

     As of December  31, 1998,  the Company has a net deferred tax  liability of
$165.5  million as compared to a net deferred tax  liability of $21.5 million as
of December 31, 1997.  During 1998,  the Company  acquired the stock of Sullivan
Broadcast Holdings, Inc. (Sullivan),  Lakeland Group Television, Inc. (Lakeland)
and the direct and indirect  interests of Max Media  Properties LLC (Max Media).
The Company recorded net deferred tax liabilities resulting from these purchases
of approximately  $114.0 million.  These net deferred tax liabilities  primarily
relate to the permanent differences between financial reporting carrying amounts
and tax basis amounts measured upon the purchase date.

     The income tax  provision  increased  to $16.0  million  for the year ended
December 31, 1997 from a provision  of $6.9 million for the year ended  December
31, 1996.  The  Company's  effective  tax rate  increased to 139.1% for the year
ended  December 31, 1997 from 86.0% for the year ended  December  31, 1996.  The
increase in the  Company's  effective  tax rate for the year ended  December 31,
1997 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1996  primarily  resulted  from
non-deductible  goodwill amortization resulting from certain 1995 and 1996 stock
acquisitions,  a tax liability  related to the  dividends  paid on the Company's
Series C Preferred Stock (see Note 8, sub-note (a) to the Company's Consolidated
Financial  Statements),  and state  franchise  taxes  which  are not based  upon
pre-tax  income.  During the year ended December 31, 1997,  the Company  carried
back certain Federal NOL's to be applied against prior years Federal taxes paid.
These Federal NOL  carry-backs  resulted in a Federal  income tax refund of $9.3
million during 1998.


SEASONALITY

     The Company's results usually are subject to seasonal  fluctuations,  which
result in fourth quarter  broadcast  operating income being greater usually than
first,  second and third quarter broadcast operating income. This seasonality is
primarily  attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation
of holiday season spending and an increase in viewership  during this period. In
addition, revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in even numbered
years.


YEAR 2000

     The Company has  commenced a process to assure Year 2000  compliance of all
hardware,  software,  broadcast  equipment and ancillary equipment that are date
dependent.  The process  involves  four  phases:  Phase I -  Inventory  and Data
Collection.  This phase  involves an  identification  of all items that are date
dependent.  Sinclair  commenced  this phase in the third  quarter  of 1998,  and
Management estimates it has completed  approximately 50% of this phase as of the
date hereof. The Company expects to complete this phase by the end of the second
quarter of 1999.

     Phase II - Compliance Requests. This phase involves requests to information
technology systems vendors for verification that the systems identified in Phase
I are Year 2000  compliant.  Sinclair  will  identify and begin to replace items
that cannot be updated or certified as  compliant.  Sinclair has  completed  the
compliance  request  phase  of its  plan as of the  date  hereof.  In  addition,
Sinclair has verified that its accounting,  traffic, payroll, and local and wide
area network hardware and software systems are compliant. In addition,  Sinclair
is currently in the process of ascertaining  that all of its personal  computers
and PC applications are compliant. Sinclair is currently reviewing its news-room
systems,  building  control systems,  security  systems and other  miscellaneous
systems.  The Company  expects to  complete  this phase by the end of the second
quarter of 1999.

     Phase III - Test,  Fix and Verify.  This phase  involves  testing all items
that are date  dependent  and  upgrading  all  non-compliant  devices.  Sinclair
expects to complete  this phase during the first,  second and third  quarters of
1999.


                                       41
<PAGE>

     Phase IV - Final Testing,  New Item Compliance.  This phase involves review
of all inventories for compliance and retesting as necessary. During this phase,
all new equipment will be tested for  compliance.  Sinclair  expects to complete
this phase by the end of the third quarter of 1999.

     The Company has developed a contingency/emergency plan to address Year 2000
worst case  scenarios.  The  contingency  plan includes,  but is not limited to,
addressing  (i)  regional  power  facilities,  (ii)  interruption  of  satellite
delivered  programming,  (iii) replacement or repair of equipment not discovered
or fixed  during  the year  2000  compliance  process  and (iv)  local  security
measures that may become  necessary  relating to the Company's  properties.  The
contingency plan involves obtaining  alternative  sources if existing sources of
these goods and services are not  available.  Although the  contingency  plan is
designed to reduce the impact of  disruptions  from these  sources,  there is no
assurance that the plan will avoid material disruptions in the event one or more
of these events occurs.

     To date,  Sinclair believes that its major systems are Year 2000 compliant.
This  substantial  compliance has been achieved  without the need to acquire new
hardware,  software or systems  other than in the  ordinary  course of replacing
such systems. Sinclair is not aware of any non-compliance that would be material
to repair or replace or that would have a material effect on Sinclair's business
if compliance were not achieved.  Sinclair does not believe that  non-compliance
in any systems that have not yet been reviewed would result in material costs or
disruption.  Neither is Sinclair aware of any non-compliance by its customers or
suppliers   that  would  have  a  material   impact  on   Sinclair's   business.
Nevertheless,  there can be no assurance that unanticipated  non-compliance will
not occur,  and such  non-compliance  could require  material costs to repair or
could cause material disruptions if not repaired.


ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     The Company is exposed to market risk from  changes in interest  rates.  To
manage its  exposure  to changes in  interest  rates,  the  Company  enters into
interest rate  derivative  hedging  agreements.  The Company has entered into an
additional  derivative  instrument to monetize the benefit of a call option on a
portion of its outstanding indebtedness at interest rates prevailing at the time
the  Company  entered  into the  instrument.  This  derivative  instrument  (the
"Treasury Option Derivative Instrument") exposes the Company to market risk from
a further decrease in interest rates, but the Company believes that this risk is
offset by the benefit to the Company  from  reduced  interest  rate expense on a
portion  of its  floating  rate  debt  and  the  ability  to  call  some  of its
indebtedness and replace it with debt at the lower prevailing interest rates.

     Finally, the Company has entered put and call option derivative instruments
relating to the  Company's  Class A Common  Stock in order to hedge  against the
possible dilutive effects of employees  exercising stock options pursuant to the
Company's stock option plans.

     The Company  does not enter into  derivative  instruments  for  speculative
trading purposes. With the exception of the Company's Treasury Option Derivative
Instrument  (described  below), the Company does not reflect the changes in fair
market value related to derivative  instruments  in the  accompanying  financial
statements.


INTEREST RATE RISKS

     The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates, which
arises from its floating  rate debt.  As of December  31, 1998,  the Company was
obligated on $1.6 billion of indebtedness carrying a floating interest rate. The
Company enters into interest rate derivative  agreements to reduce the impact of
changing  interest  rates  on its  floating  rate  debt.  The 1998  Bank  Credit
Agreement, as amended and restated,  requires the Company to enter into Interest
Rate Protection Agreements at rates not to exceed 10% per annum as to a notional
principal  amount  at  least  equal to 60% of the Term  Loan,  Revolving  Credit
Facility and Senior  Subordinated Notes scheduled to be outstanding from time to
time.

     As of  December  31,  1998,  the Company  had  several  interest  rate swap
agreements  which expire from July 7, 1999 to July 15, 2007. The swap agreements
effectively set fixed rates on the Company's  floating rate debt in the range of
5.5% to 8.1%.  Floating  interest  rates are based upon the three  month  London
Interbank  Offered Rate (LIBOR)  rate,  and the  measurement  and  settlement is
performed quarterly.


                                       42
<PAGE>

Settlements of these  agreements are recorded as adjustments to interest expense
in the relevant  periods.  The notional amounts related to these agreements were
$1.1  billion at December 31,  1998,  and  decrease to $200 million  through the
expiration   dates.  In  addition,   the  Company  entered  into  floating  rate
derivatives with notional amounts totaling $200 million.  Based on the Company's
currently  hedged  position,  $1.7 billion or 73% of the  Company's  outstanding
indebtedness is hedged.

     Based on the Company's debt levels and the amount of floating rate debt not
hedged as of December  31, 1998, a 1% increase in the LIBOR rate would result in
an increase in annualized interest expense of approximately $10.5 million.


TREASURY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

     In August  1998,  the Company  entered  into a treasury  option  derivative
contract (the "Option Derivative").  The Option Derivative contract provides for
1) an option  exercise date of September 30, 2000, 2) a notional  amount of $300
million and 3) a five-year  treasury  strike rate of 6.14%. If the interest rate
yield on five  year  treasury  securities  is less than the  strike  rate on the
option  exercise  date,  the Company would be obligated to pay five  consecutive
annual  payments  in an  amount  equal to the  strike  rate  less the five  year
treasury rate  multiplied by the notional  amount  beginning  September 30, 2001
through  September  30, 2006.  If the interest  rate yield on five year treasury
securities  is greater  than the strike rate on the option  exercise  date,  the
Company would not be obligated to make any payments.

     Upon the execution of the Option Derivative contract,  the Company received
a cash payment representing an option premium of $9.5 million which was recorded
in "Other long-term liabilities" in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company
is required to  periodically  adjust its  liability to the present  value of the
future  payments  of the  settlement  amounts  based on the  forward  five  year
treasury  rate  at the  end of an  accounting  period.  The  fair  market  value
adjustment for 1998 resulted in an income statement charge  (unrealized loss) of
$9.1 million for the year ended  December  31,  1998.  If the yield on five year
treasuries  at  September  30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year
treasury  rate on December 31, 1998 (4.6%),  Sinclair  would be required to make
five  annual  payments  of  approximately  $4.6  million  each.  If the yield on
five-year  treasuries  at September  30, 2000  decreased by 1% from the two-year
forward  five-year rate of December 31, 1998 (i.e., to 3.6%) then Sinclair would
be required to make five annual payments of approximately $7.6 million each.

     The Company has the ability to call the 1995 Notes on  September  15, 2000.
The  value  of  this  call is  determined  by new  issuance  yields  for  senior
subordinated  debt at that time.  The value of this call rises when  yields fall
and falls when  yields  rise.  New  issuance  yields are based on a spread  over
treasury yields. If the yield on five-year  treasuries remains below 6.14% until
September  30, 2000,  the Company  expects to be able to call the 1995 Notes and
refinance  at the lower  prevailing  rates,  thus  offsetting  the effect of the
payments  required  under  the  Treasury  Option  Derivative.  There  can  be no
assurance,  however,  that the Company would be able to refinance the 1995 Notes
at such time at favorable interest rates.

     Senior Subordinated Notes The Company is also exposed to risk from a change
in interest rates to the extent it is required to refinance  existing fixed rate
indebtedness  at rates  higher than those  prevailing  at the time the  existing
indebtedness  was  incurred.  As of December  31,  1998,  the Company has Senior
Subordinated Notes totaling $1.9 million, $300 million and $450 million expiring
in the years 2003,  2005 and 2007,  respectively.  Based upon the quoted  market
price,  the fair value of the Notes was $781.4  million as of December 31, 1998.
Generally,  the fair market value of the Notes will  decrease as interest  rates
rise and  increase as  interest  rates fall.  The  Company  estimates  that a 1%
increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value
of the Notes by approximately $43.6 million as of December 31, 1998.

EQUITY PUT OPTION DERIVATIVES

     The  Company is exposed to market  risk  relating  to its equity put option
derivative instruments (the "Equity Puts"). The contract terms relating to these
instruments  provide for  settlement  on the  expiration  date.  The Equity Puts
require the Company to make a settlement  payment to the counterparties to these
contracts  (payable  in either  cash or shares of the  Company's  Class A Common
stock) in an amount that


                                       43
<PAGE>

is approximately  equal to the put strike price minus the price of the Company's
Class A Common Stock as of the termination date. If the put strike price is less
than the price of the Company's Class A Common Stock as of the termination date,
the Company  would not be obligated to make a settlement  payment.  In addition,
certain  of these  contracts  include  terms  allowing  the put option to become
immediately  exercisable  upon the  Company's  Class A Common  Stock  trading at
certain levels.  The following table summarizes the Company's  position relating
to the  Equity  Puts and  illustrates  the  market  risk  associated  with these
instruments.

                   REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS




To the Stockholders of
Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.:

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Sinclair
Broadcast Group,  Inc. (a Maryland  corporation) and Subsidiaries as of December
31,  1997 and 1998,  and the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,
stockholders'  equity and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the period
ended December 31, 1998. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits  provide a reasonable  basis for our opinion.  In our
opinion,  the  financial  statements  referred to above present  fairly,  in all
material respects,  the financial position of Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc. and
Subsidiaries  as of  December  31,  1997  and  1998,  and the  results  of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1998, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

                SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998


1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:



BASIS OF PRESENTATION
- ---------------------

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of
Sinclair  Broadcast Group,  Inc.,  Sinclair  Communications,  Inc. and all other
consolidated subsidiaries,  which are collectively referred to hereafter as "the
Company,  Companies or SBG." The Company owns and operates  television and radio
stations   throughout   the  United  States.   Additionally,   included  in  the
accompanying  consolidated financial statements are the results of operations of
certain  television  stations pursuant to local marketing  agreements (LMAs) and
radio stations pursuant to joint sales agreements (JSAs).


PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
- ---------------------------

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
all  its  wholly-owned  and  majority-owned   subsidiaries.   Minority  interest
represents a minority  owner's  proportionate  share of the equity in two of the
Company's  subsidiaries.  In  addition,  the Company  uses the equity  method of
accounting for 20% to 50% ownership  investments.  All significant  intercompany
transactions and account balances have been eliminated.


CASH AND USE OF ESTIMATES
- -------------------------

The preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the
financial   statements  and  in  the   disclosures  of  contingent   assets  and
liabilities. While actual results could differ from those estimates,  management
believes  that actual  results  will not be  materially  different  from amounts
provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


PROGRAMMING
- -----------

The Companies have  agreements  with  distributors  for the rights to television
programming  over contract  periods which generally run from one to seven years.
Contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally shorter
than the contract period.  Each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability
at an amount equal to its gross  contractual  commitment when the license period
begins and the  program  is  available  for its first  showing.  The  portion of
program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current
liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheetsfinancial statements.

The rights to program  materials are reflected in the accompanying  consolidated
balance  sheets at the lower of  unamortized  cost or estimated  net  realizable
value.  Estimated net realizable values are based upon management's  expectation
of future  advertising  revenues net of sales commissions to be generated by the
program material.  Amortization of program contract costs is generally  computed
under either a four year accelerated method or based on usage,  whichever yields
the greater amortization for each program.  Program contract costs, estimated by
management to be amortized in the  succeeding  year,  are  classified as current
assets.  Payments  of  program  contract  liabilities  are  typically  paid on a
scheduled  basis  and  are not  affected  by  adjustments  for  amortization  or
estimated net realizable value.


BARTER ARRANGEMENTS
- -------------------

Certain  program  contracts  provide for the exchange of advertising air time in
lieu of cash payments for the rights to such  programming.  These  contracts are
recorded  as  the  programs  are  aired  at  the  estimated  fair  value  of the
advertising  air  time  given  in  exchange  for  the  program  rights.  Network
programming is excluded from these calculations.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998 - (CONTINUED )

The Company broadcasts certain customers' advertising in exchange for equipment,
merchandise and services. The estimated fair value of the equipment, merchandise
or services  received is recorded as deferred barter costs and the corresponding
obligation to broadcast advertising is recorded as deferred barter revenues. The
deferred barter costs are expensed or capitalized as they are used,  consumed or
received.  Deferred barter revenues are recognized as the related advertising is
aired.


OTHER ASSETS

Other  assets  as  of  December  31,  1997 and 1998 consist of the following (in

</TABLE>

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE BROADCASTING ASSETS
- ---------------------------------------

Acquired  intangible  broadcasting assets are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods of 1 to 40 years.  These amounts result from the  acquisition
of certain  television and radio station  license and  non-license  assets.  The
Company  monitors the individual  financial  performance of each of the stations
and continually  evaluates the  realizability  of intangible and tangible assets
and the existence of any impairment to its recoverability based on the projected
undiscounted  cash flows of the  respective  stations.  As of December 31, 1998,
Management  believes  that the carrying  amounts of the  Company's  tangible and
intangible assets have not been impaired.

Intangible assets as of December 31, 1997 and 1998, consist of the following (in
thousands):

LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENTS
- --------------------------

The Company  generally  enters into LMAs,  JSAs and  similar  arrangements  with
stations  located in markets in which the Company  already  owns and  operates a
station,  and in connection with acquisitions,  pending  regulatory  approval of
transfer of License  Assets.  Under the terms of these  agreements,  the Company
makes  specified  periodic  payments to the  owner-operator  in exchange for the
grant to the Company of the right to program and sell advertising on a specified
portion of the  station's  inventory of  broadcast  time.  Nevertheless,  as the
holder  of  the   Federal   Communications   Commission   (FCC)   license,   the
owner-operator  retains  control and  responsibility  for the  operation  of the
station, including responsibility over all programming broadcast on the station.

Included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years
ended  December 31,  1996,  1997 and 1998,  are net revenues of $153.0  million,
$135.0 million and $207.8 million, respectively, that relate to LMAs and JSAs.


BROADCAST ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
- ------------------------------

Broadcast  assets held for sale  primarily  comprise four radio  stations in the
Norfolk,  Virginia market  acquired in connection with the Heritage  Acquisition
and Max Media  Acquisition  (see Note 11).  The Company is required to divest of
certain of these radio stations due to FCC ownership guidelines.  The Company is
currently  engaged in discussions with potential buyers with respect to three of
these stations and expects to complete the sale of these  stations  during 1999.

3. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS:


The Company  enters into  derivative  instruments  primarily  for the purpose of
reducing  the impact of changing  interest  rates and to monitize  the  benefits
associated with a historically low interest rate environment.  In addition,  the
Company has entered into put and call option derivative  instruments relating to
the  Company's  Class A Common  Stock in order to hedge  the  possible  dilutive
effect of employees  exercising  stock options  pursuant to the Company's  stock
option  plans.  The  Company  does not enter  into  derivative  instruments  for
speculative  trading  purposes.  With the  exception of the  Company's  Treasury
Option Derivative Instrument (described below), the Company does not reflect the
changes  in  fair  market  value  related  to  derivative   instruments  in  the
accompanying financial statements.

During 1998, FASB issued SFAS 133 "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and for
Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"). SFAS 133 establishes  accounting and reporting
standards for derivative  investments  and for hedging  activities.  It requires
that an entity  recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the
statement of financial  position and measure those instruments at fair value. If
certain  conditions  are met, a derivative may be  specifically  designated as a
hedge.  The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative  depends on
the intended use of the  derivative and the resulting  designation.  SFAS 133 is
effective for the Company  beginning  January 1, 2000. The Company is evaluating
its eventual impact on its financial statements.


INTEREST RATE HEDGING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
- --------------------------------------------

The Company enters into interest rate derivativeinterest rate hedging agreements
to reduce the impact of changing  interest  rates on its floating rate debt. The
1998 Bank Credit Agreement, as amended and

                SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998 - (CONTINUED )

restated, requires the Company to enter into Interest Rate Protection Agreements
at rates not to exceed 10% per annum as to a notional  principal amount at least
equal to 60% of the Term Loan, Revolving Credit Facility and Senior Subordinated
Notes scheduled to be outstanding from time to time.

As of December 31, 1998, the Company had several  interest rate swap  agreements
which expire from July 7, 1999 to July 15, 2007.  The swap  agreements set rates
in the range of 5.5% to 8.1%.  Floating  interest rates are based upon the three
month London  Interbank  Offered  Rate (LIBOR)  rate,  and the  measurement  and
settlement is performed quarterly.  Settlements of these agreements are recorded
as adjustments to interest expense in the relevant periods. The notional amounts
related to these  agreements  was were $1.1 billion at December  31,  1998,  and
decrease to $200 million through the expiration dates. In addition,  the Company
has entered into floating rate  derivatives  with notional amounts totaling $200
million.  Based on the Company's currently hedged position,  $1.7 billion or 73%
of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is hedged.

The Company has no intentions of terminating  these  instruments  prior to their
expiration  dates  unless  it were to  prepay a portion  of its bank  debt.  The
counter parties to these agreements are  international  financial  institutions.
The Company  estimates the fair value of these  instruments at December 31, 1997
and 1998 to be $0.7 million and $3.0  million,  respectively.  The fair value of
the  interest  rate  hedging  derivative  instruments  is estimated by obtaining
quotations  from the financial  institutions  which are a party to the Company's
derivative  contracts  (the  "Banks").  The fair value is an estimate of the net
amount that the Company  would pay at December  31, 1998 if the  contracts  were
transferred to other parties or canceled by the Banks.


TREASURY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT
- -------------------------------------

In August 1998, the Company entered into a treasury option  derivative  contract
(the "Option  Derivative").  The Option  Derivative  contract provides for 1) an
option exercise date of September 30, 2000, 2) a notional amount of $300 million
and 3) a five-year  treasury strike rate of 6.14%. If the interest rate yield on
five  year  treasury  securities  is less  than the  strike  rate on the  option
exercise  date,  the Company would be obligated to pay five  consecutive  annual
payments in an amount equal to the strike rate less the five year  treasury rate
multiplied by the notional amount beginning September 30, 2001 through September
30, 2006. If the interest rate yield on five year treasury securities is greater
than the strike  rate on the option  exercise  date,  the  Company  would not be
obligated to make any payments.

Upon the execution of the Option  Derivative  contract,  the Company  received a
cash payment  representing  an option premium of $9.5 million which was recorded
in "Other long-term liabilities" in the accompanying balance sheets. The Company
is required to  periodically  adjust its  liability to the present  value of the
future  payments  of the  settlement  amounts  based on the  forward  five  year
treasury  rate  at the  end of an  accounting  period.  The  fair  market  value
adjustment for 1998 resulted in an income statement charge  (unrealized loss) of
$9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1998.


EQUITY PUT AND CALL OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS
- -------------------------------------------------

1996 OPTIONS

During  December  1996, the Company  entered into put and call option  contracts
related to the Company's common stock.  These option contracts were entered into
for the purpose of hedging the dilution of the  Company's  common stock upon the
exercise of stock options  granted and can either be physically  settled in cash
or net physically settled in shares, at the election of the Company. The Company
entered  into  500,000 call options for common stock and 641,200 put options for
common  stock,  with a strike  price of $18.875  and  $13.94  per common  share,

related to its common  stock for the  purpose of  hedging  the  dilution  of the
common stock upon the exercise of stock  options  granted.  The Company  entered
into 1,100,000 European style (that is, exercisable on the expiration date only)
put  options  for  common  stock with a strike  price of $12.89 per share  which
provide for settlement in cash or in shares, at the election of the Company. The
Company entered into 1,100,000  American style (that is, exercisable any time on
or before the expiration date) call options for common stock with a strike price
of $12.89 per share which provide for  settlement  in cash or in shares,  at the
election of the Company.


1998 OPTIONS

In July 1998, the Company entered into put and call option contracts  related to
the Company's common stock (the "July Options").  In September 1998, the Company
entered into additional put and call option  contracts  related to the Company's
common  stock  (the  "September  Options").  These  option  contracts  allow for
settlement in cash or net physically in shares,  at the election of the Company.
The Company  entered into these option  contracts for the purpose of hedging the
dilution  of the  Company's  common  stock upon the  exercise  of stock  options
granted.  The July Options included  2,700,000 call options for common stock and
2,700,000 put options for common stock, with a strike price of $33.27 and $28.93
per common share,  respectively.  The September  Options  included  467,000 call
options for common stock and 700,000 put options for common stock, with a strike
price of $28.00 and $16.0625 per common share, respectively.  For the year ended
December 31, 1998,  option  premium  payments of $12.2  million and $0.7 million
were made relating to the July and September Options,  respectively. The Company
recorded these premium payments as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. To
the extent  that the  Company  entered  into put  options  related to its common
stock, the additional paid-in capital amounts were reclassified  accordingly and
reflected as Equity Put Options in the accompanying balance sheet as of December
31, 1998.

The Tranche A Term Loan was a term loan in a principal amount not to exceed $550
million  and  was  scheduled  to be  paid in  quarterly  installments  beginning

Credit  Commitment was either LIBOR plus 1.25% to 2.5% or the  alternative  base
rate plus zero to 1.25%.  The  applicable  interest  rate for the Tranche A Term
Loan and the  Revolving  Credit  Commitment  was adjusted  based on the ratio of
total  debt  to  four  quarters  trailing   earnings  before  interest,   taxes,
depreciation and  amortization.  The applicable  interest rate for Tranche B was
either  LIBOR  plus  2.75% or the base rate plus  1.75%.  The  weighted  average

1998 BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT
- --------------------------

In order to expand its borrowing capacity to fund future acquisitions and obtain
more  favorable  terms with its syndicate of banks,  the Company  obtained a new
$1.75 billion senior secured credit facility (the "1998 Bank Credit Agreement").
The 1998 Bank Credit  Agreement  was  executed in May of 1998 and includes (i) a
$750.0   million  Term  Loan  Facility   repayable  in   consecutive   quarterly
installments  commencing on March 31, 1999 and ending on September 15, 2005; and
(ii) a $1.0 billion reducing  Revolving Credit Facility.  Availability under the
Revolving  Credit  Facility  reduces  quarterly,  commencing  March 31, 2001 and
terminating on September 15, 2005. Not more than $350.0 million of the Revolving
Credit  Facility will be available for issuances of letters of credit.  The 1998

loan facility of $400.0 million. The Company is required to prepay the term loan
facility  and  reduce the  revolving  credit  facility  with (i) 100% of the net
proceeds of any casualty loss or condemnation;  (ii) 100% of the net proceeds of
any sale or other  disposition  by the Company of any assets in excess of $100.0
million in the  aggregate for any fiscal year, to the extent not used to acquire
new  assets;  and (iii) 50% of excess cash flow (as  defined)  if the  Company's
ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined) exceeds a certain threshold.  The 1998 Bank
Credit Agreement contains  representations  and warranties,  and affirmative and
negative  covenants,   including  among  other   restrictions,   limitations  on
additional indebtedness,  customary for credit facilities of this type. The 1998
Bank  Credit  Agreement  is  secured  only  by a  pledge  of the  stock  of each
subsidiary of the Company other than KDSM,  Inc.,  KDSM Licensee,  Inc.,  Cresap
Enterprises,  Inc.  and  Sinclair  Capital.  The Company is required to maintain
certain debt covenants in connection with the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement.  As of

- ----------
(a) In March 1997, the Company issued the HYTOPS securities.  In connection with
    this  transaction,  Sinclair  Broadcast  Group,  Inc. (the "Parent")  issued
    $206.2 million of Series C Preferred Stock (the "Parent Preferred Stock") to
    KDSM, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. Parent Preferred Stock dividends paid
    to KDSM, Inc. are considered taxable income for Federal tax purposes and not
    considered  income for book purposes.  Also for Federal tax purposes,  KDSM,
    Inc.  is  allowed a tax  deduction  for  dividends  received  on the  Parent
    Preferred  Stock in an amount  equal to  Parent  Preferred  Stock  dividends
    received  in each  taxable  year  limited  to the extent  that the  Parent's
    consolidated  group has "earnings and profits." To the extent that dividends
    received by KDSM,  Inc.  are in excess of the  Parent's  consolidated  group
    earnings  and  profits,  the Parent  will reduce its tax basis in the Parent
    Preferred  Stock  which  gives  rise  to a  deferred  tax  liability  (to be
    recognized upon redemption) and KDSM, Inc.'s dividend income is treated as a
    permanent  difference  between  taxable  income and book income.  During the
    years  ended  December  31,  1997 and  1998,  the  Parent  did not  generate
    "earnings and profits" in an amount  greater than or equal to dividends paid
    on the Parent Preferred Stock.  This resulted in a reduction in basis of the
    Parent's  Series C  Preferred  Stock and  generated a related  deferred  tax
    liability.


Temporary  differences  between the financial reporting carrying amounts and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities give rise to deferred taxes. The Company had
a net deferred tax liability of $21.5 million and $165.5  million as of December
31, 1997 and 1998,  respectively.  The  realization  of  deferred  tax assets is
contingent  upon the Company's  ability to generate  sufficient  future  taxable
income to realize the future tax benefits  associated  with the net deferred tax
asset.  Management believes that deferred assets will be realized through future
operating results.


The Company has total available Federal NOL's of approximately  $58.5 million as
of December 31, 1998, which expire during various years from 2001 to 2012. These
NOL's are recorded in the deferred tax accounts in the accompanying Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of December 31, 1998. Of these NOL's, $49.1 million are limited
to use within a specific entity and subject to annual limitations under Internal
Revenue Code Section 382 and similar state provisions.


Total  deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities as of December 31, 1997
and 1998, including the effects of businesses  acquired,  and the sources of the
difference  between  financial  accounting and tax bases of the Company's assets
and  liabilities  which give rise to the  deferred  tax assets and  deferred tax
liabilities and the tax effects of each are as follows (in thousands):

During 1998, the Company acquired the stock of Sullivan Broadcast Holdings, Inc.
(Sullivan),  Lakeland  Group  Television,  Inc.  (Lakeland)  and the  direct and
indirect interests of Max Media Properties LLC (Max Media). The Company recorded
net deferred tax  liabilities  resulting from these  purchases of  approximately
$114.0  million  under  the  purchase  accounting  guidelines  of  APB 16 and in
accordance with SFAS 109. These net deferred tax liabilities primarily relate to
the permanent  differences  between financial reporting carrying amounts and tax
basis amounts measured upon the purchase date.


9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN:


The Sinclair  Broadcast  Group,  Inc.  401(k) Profit Sharing Plan and Trust (the
"SBG Plan") covers eligible employees of the Company.  Contributions made to the
SBG Plan include an employee elected salary reduction  amount,  company matching
contributions  and a discretionary  amount  determined each year by the Board of
Directors.  The Company's  401(k) expense for the years ended December 31, 1996,
1997 and 1998,  was $0.7 million,  $1.0 million and $1.6 million,  respectively.
There were no discretionary  contributions during these periods. During December
1997, the Company  registered  800,000 shares of its Class "A" Common Stock with
the  Securities and Exchange  Commission  (the  "Commission")  to be issued as a
matching contribution for the 1997 plan year and subsequent plan years.


10. CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS:



LITIGATION

1996 ACQUISITIONS
- -----------------


RIVER CITY ACQUISITION

In May 1996, the Company acquired certain non-license assets of River City for a
purchase price of $967.1 million, providing as consideration 1,150,000 shares of
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with a fair market value of $125.1 million,
1,382,435  stock  options  with a fair  market  value of $23.9  million and cash
payments totaling $818.1 million.  The Company utilized  indebtedness  under its
Bank Credit Agreement to finance the transaction.  The acquisition was accounted
for under the  purchase  method of  accounting  whereby the  purchase  price was
allocated to property and programming assets,  acquired intangible  broadcasting
assets and other intangible assets for $82.8 million,  $375.6 million and $508.7
million,  respectively,  based upon an independent appraisal.  Intangible assets
are being amortized over 1 to 40 years.

In May 1996, the Company also entered into option agreements to purchase certain
license assets for an aggregate  option  exercise  price of $20 million.  During
1996 and 1997, the Company exercised its options to acquire the FCC licenses for
option  exercise  prices  totaling $18.2 million and now owns all of the license
assets of the  television  and radio  stations with respect to which it acquired
non-license   assets  from  River  City,  other  than  WTTV-TV  and  WTTK-TV  in
Indianapolis, Indiana. In addition, the Company entered into an option agreement
to purchase the license and  non-license  assets of WSYX-TV in  Columbus,  Ohio.
During 1998, the Company exercised its option to acquire the non-license  assets
of WSYX (see discussion below).

In  connection  with the River City  acquisition,  the Company  consummated  the
following transactions concurrent with or subsequent to the closing:

1. Series A Preferred Stock -- As partial  consideration  for the acquisition of
   the non-license  assets of River City, the Company issued 1,150,000 shares of
   Series A Preferred Stock. In June 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company
   adopted,  upon  approval of the  stockholders  by proxy,  an amendment to the
   Company's amended and restated charter at which time Series A Preferred Stock
   was exchanged for and converted  into Series B Preferred  Stock.  The Company
   recorded the  issuance of Series A Preferred  Stock in an amount equal to its
   fair market value on the date the River City acquisition was announced.

2. Series  B  Preferred  Stock  --  Shares  of  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  are
   convertible at any time into shares of Class A Common Stock,  with each share
   of Series B Preferred Stock  convertible  into  approximately  7.27 shares of
   Series A Common  Stock.  The Company may redeem  shares of Series B Preferred
   Stock only after the  occurrence of certain  events.  If the Company seeks to
   redeem  shares of Series B  Preferred  Stock  and the  stockholder  elects to
   retain the shares, the shares will automatically be

  converted  into common stock on the proposed  redemption  date.  All shares of
  Series B  Preferred  stock  remaining  outstanding  as of May 31,  2001,  will
  automatically  convert into Class A Common Stock.  Series B Preferred Stock is
  entitled  to 7.27 votes on all  matters  with  respect to which Class A Common
  Stock has a vote.


3. The Baker  Agreement -- In connection with the acquisition of River City, the
   Company entered into a five year agreement (the "Baker Agreement") with Barry
   Baker (the Chief Executive Officer of River City) pursuant to which Mr. Baker
   served  as a  consultant  to the  Company  until  terminating  such  services
   effective  March 8, 1999  (the  "Termination  Date").  Under the terms of the
   Baker  Agreement,  until such time as Mr. Baker was able to become an officer
   of the Company,  he was to serve as a  consultant  to the Company and receive
   compensation  that he would be  entitled  to as an  officer  under  the Baker
   Agreement.  Additionally, if the Company terminated the Baker Agreement other
   than for cause (as defined) or Mr. Baker  terminated the Baker  Agreement for
   good cause (constituting certain occurrences specified in the agreement), Mr.
   Baker   would  be  entitled  to  certain   termination   payments   primarily
   representing  consulting  fees which would have been paid under the remaining
   term of the Baker Agreement.

  As of February 8, 1999, the conditions to Mr. Baker becoming an officer of the
  Company  had not been  satisfied,  and on that date Mr.  Baker and the Company
  entered into a termination  agreement  with effect on March 8, 1999. Mr. Baker
  has certain rights as a consequence of the termination of the Baker Agreement.
  These rights included  entitlement to the termination payments described above
  and the  right to  purchase  at fair  market  value the  television  and radio
  stations owned by the Company  serving the St. Louis,  Missouri  market or the
  Greenville/Spartanburg/Ashville,   South  Carolina   market  (the   "Broadcast
  Option").  Mr.  Baker has 180 days from the  Termination  Date to exercise the
  Broadcast  Option.  Additional  rights under the Baker  Agreement also include
  allowing  Mr.  Baker  to  convert  his  Class A Common  Stock  into a class of
  preferred  stock.  Mr. Baker's Class A Common Stock would be convertible  into
  preferred stock at a liquidation value conversion rate of $13.75 per share and
  would begin accruing a dividend  beginning 180 days from the Termination Date.
  Mr. Baker has 160 days from the  Termination  Date to elect  conversion of his
  Class A Common Stock.


Also, in conjunction with the River City  acquisition,  the Company entered into
an  agreement  to purchase the  non-license  assets of KRRT,  Inc., a television
station in San  Antonio,  Texas,  for a  purchase  price of $29.5  million.  The
acquisition  was accounted for under the purchase  method of accounting  whereby
the purchase price was allocated to property and  programming  assets,  acquired

                DECEMBER 31, 1996, 1997 AND 1998 - (CONTINUED )

1998 STC  DISPOSITION.  In February 1998, the Company entered into agreements to
sell to STC Broadcasting of Vermont,  Inc.  ("STC") two television  stations and
the Non-License Assets and rights to program a third television station,  all of
which were  acquired in the  Heritage  Acquisition.  In April 1998,  the Company
closed on the sale of the non-license assets of the three television stations in

PRO FORMA INFORMATION RELATED TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
- ---------------------------------------------------------

As permitted  under SFAS 123,  "Accounting for  Stock-Based  Compensation,"  the
Company measures  compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation
plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees,"  and provides pro
forma  disclosures  of  net  income  and  earnings  per  share  as if  the  fair
value-based  method  prescribed  by  SFAS  123 had  been  applied  in  measuring
compensation expense.

Had  compensation  cost  for the  Company's  1995,  1996,  and 1997  grants  for
stock-based  compensation  plans been  determined  consistent with SFAS 123, the
Company's net income, net income applicable to common share before extraordinary
items, and net income per common share for these years would approximate the pro
forma amounts below (in thousands except per share data):

a condition of Employee's  being  employed by SCI,  Employee's  having access to

character  and a  violation  of any of the  terms  of such  Section  will  cause
irreparable  injury to the SCI Entities,  the amount of which will be impossible
to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated.  Therefore,
the SCI Entities will be entitled to an injunction,  restraining  order or other
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (subject to such terms
and conditions that the court determines appropriate), restraining any violation
or threatened  violation of any of such terms by Employee and such other persons
as the court orders.  The parties  acknowledge  and agree that judicial  action,
rather than  arbitration,  is appropriate with respect to the enforcement of the
provisions  of Section 5. The forum for any  litigation  hereunder  shall be the
Circuit Court of Baltimore  County or the United States District Court (Northern
Division) sitting in Baltimore, Maryland.

          6.2.  CUMULATIVE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.  Rights and remedies provided by
Sections  5 and 6 are  cumulative  and an in  addition  to any other  rights and
remedies any of the SCI Entities may have at law or equity.

         7.  ABSENCE OF  RESTRICTIONS.  Employee  warrants and  represents  that
Employee is not a party to or bound by any agreement, contact, or understanding,
whether of employment or otherwise,  with any third person or entity which would
in any  way  restrict  or  prohibit  Employee  from  undertaking  or  performing
employment  with  SCI in  accordance  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of this
Agreement.

          8. MISCELLANEOUS.

                              EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

     THIS EMPLOYMENT  AGREEMENT (this  "Agreement") is effective as of this 21st
day of  February,  1997,  between  Sinclair  Communications,  Inc.,  a  Maryland
corporation ("SCI"), and Barry Drake ("Employee").

                                    RECITALS

          A.   SCI  through  its  wholly-owned  subsidiaries,  owns or  operates
television and radio broadcast stations.


          B.   SCI desires to employ Employee as Chief  Operating  Officer/Radio
of SCI, and Employee desires to accept such employment.

          C.   SCI and Employee  desire to set forth the terms of  employment of
Employee with SCI as Chief Operating Officer/Radio.

     NOW, THEREFORE,  IN CONSIDERATION OF the mutual covenants herein contained,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

     1.   DUTIES.

          1.1.  DUTIES UPON EMPLOYMENT.  Upon the terms and subject to the other
provisions  of this  Agreement,  commencing  on the date hereof (the  "Effective
Date"),  Employee  will be  employed  by SCI in  Baltimore,  Maryland  as  Chief
Operating Officer/Radio of SCI. As the Chief Operating  Officer/Radio,  Employee
will

                (a)  report  to the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and  such  other
officer(s) of SCI as the Chief Executive Officer of SCI designates; and

                (b) have such  responsibilities  and perform  such duties as may
from time to time be  established by the Chief  Executive  Officer or such other
senior officers.

          1.2   FULL-TIME  EMPLOYMENT. While an employee of SCI, Employee agrees
to devote Employee's full working time,  attention, and best efforts exclusively
to the business of SCI.

     2.   TERM

          2.1.  TERM. The term of Employee's employment  as the Chief  Operating
Officer/Radio of SCI under this Agreement  (the "Employment Term") will begin on
the


<PAGE>


Effective  Date and continue until  employment is terminated in accordance  with
Section 5. As used in this  Agreement,  an  "employment  year" is a twelve  (12)
month period  beginning on January 1 and ending on the next  following  December
31;  provided,  however,  that the first  "employment  year"  shall begin on the
Effective Date and shall end on December 31, 1997.

          2.2.  AT  WILL  EMPLOYMENT.  Notwithstanding  anything  else  in  this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the provisions of Section 2.1. of this
Agreement  and  Schedule  A  attached  hereto  regarding  the  employment  term,
compensation of Employee, or benefits of Employees respectively,  the employment
of  Employee  is not for a specified  period of time,  and SCI or  Employee  may
terminate the employment of Employee with or without Cause (as defined below) at
any time for any reason.  There is not,  nor will there be,  unless in a writing
signed by all of the parties to this Agreement, any express or implied agreement
as to the continued employment of Employee.

     3.   COMPENSATION  AND BENEFITS.  Employee is entitled to the  compensation
and benefits described on Schedule A attached hereto on the terms and conditions
stated therein. Contingent upon Employee's execution of this Agreement, Employee
will also be granted  options to acquire  share of stock of  Sinclair  Broadcast
Group,  Inc.  ("Parent"),  subject to the terms and conditions  contained in the
Long Term  Incentive  Plan of Parent  and the Stock  Option  Agreement  attached
hereto as Schedule B.

     4.   EMPLOYMENT TERMINATION

          4.1.  TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT.

                (a) The Employment  Term will end, and the parties will not have
any  rights or  obligations  under  this  Agreement  (except  for the rights and
obligations under those Sections of this Agreement which are continuing and will
survive the end of the  Employment  Term,  as  specified in Section 8.10 of this
Agreement)  on the earliest to occur of the following  events (the  "Termination
Date"):

                    (1)   the death of Employee;

                    (2)   the Disability (as defined in Section 4.1(b) below) of
Employee;  

                    (3)   the termination of Employee's employment by Employee;

<PAGE>

                    (4)   the  termination  of Employee's  employment by SCI for
Cause (as defined in Section 4.1(c) below); or

                    (5)   the  termination  of  Employee's   employment  by  SCI
without Cause.

               (b)  For the  purposes  of  this  Agreement,  "Disability"  means
Employee's  inability,  whether mental or physical, to perform the normal duties
of  Employee's  position  for ninety (90) days  (which need not be  consecutive)
during any twelve (12) consecutive month period,  and the effective date of such
Disability  shall be the day next following  such ninetieth  (90th ) day. If SCI
and  Employee  are  unable to agree as to  whether  Employee  is  disabled,  the
question will be decided by a physician to be paid by SCI and designated by SCI,
subject to the  approval of Employee  (which  approval  may not be  unreasonably
withheld) whose  determination  will be final and binding on the parties.  

               (c)  For the purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" means any of the
following:  (i) the wrongful  appropriation for Employee's own use or benefit of
property or money  entrusted to Employee by SCI, (ii) the  commission of any act
involving moral turpitude, (iii) Employee's continued disregard of directions of
the Chief  Executive  Officer or other senior  management  of SCI after  written
notice of such  disregard,  (iv)  Employee's  continued  violation of SCI policy
after written notice of such violations  (such policy may include policies as to
drug or alcohol abuse), or (v) any action by Employee which is reasonably likely
to  jeopardize  a Federal  Communications  Commission  license of any  broadcast
station owned directly by SCI.

         4.2   TERMINATION PAYMENTS.

               (a)  If Employee's  employment  with SCI  terminates  pursuant to
Sections  4.1(a)(1),  4.1(a)(2),  4.1(a)(3),  or 4.1(a)(5),  Employee (or in the
event of the death of Employee,  the person or persons designated by Employee in
a written  instrument  delivered to SCI prior to Employee's death or, if no such
written  designation  has been made,  Employee's  estate)  will be  entitled  to
receive, and SCI will pay to the same, all of the following:

                    (1)   the salary payable to Employee through the Termination
Date;

                    (2)   a payment in respect of unutilized  vacation time that
has  accrued  through  the  Termination  Date  (determined  in  accordance  with
corporate  policies  established by SCI and consistent  with Schedule A hereof);
and

                                       3

upon the terms and conditions set forth therein.

               (b) If  Employee's  employment  with SCI  terminates  pursuant to
Section  4.1(a)(5),  prior to August 31,  1998,  Employee  will be  entitled  to
receive,  and SCI will pay to the same,  in addition to any amount owed pursuant
to Section  4.2(a),  Employees'  base salary (but no bonuses or other  benefits,
other than those which may be required by law) through and including  such date,
such payment (i) to be made in accordance with SCI's regular payroll  procedures
and (ii) to be reduced by 50% of any  compensation  earned by Employee  from any
other source during the period such payments are to be made.

               (c)  If Employee's  employment  with SCI  terminates  pursuant to
Section  4.1(a)(4),  Employee  will be entitled to receive,  and SCI will pay to
Employee, only the salary payable to Employee through the Termination Date.

               (d)  The termination payments described in this Section 4 will be
in lieu of any termination or severance  payments  required by SCI policy or, to
the  fullest   extent   permissible   thereunder,   applicable   law  (including
unemployment  compensation) and will constitute  Employee's exclusive rights and
remedies with respect to termination of Employee's employment.

                      (3)     take all reasonable steps necessary, or reasonably
requested  by  any  of  the  SCI  Entities,  to  ensure  that  all  Confidential
Information  is kept  confidential  for the use and benefit of the SCI Entities;
and

                      (4)     upon  termination of Employee's  employment or any
other time any for the SCI Entities in writing so request,  promptly  deliver to

if Employee's  employment  is  terminated  for any reason other than pursuant to

Term, broadcast radio stations owned or operated by any of the SCI Entities);

                    (2) hire,  attempt to hire, or to assist any other person or

               (d) In the event that (i) SCI places all or substantially  all of
its  broadcast  stations  up for sale within one (1) year after  termination  of
Employee's employment hereunder,  or (ii) Employee's employment is terminated in
connection  with  the  disposition  of all or  substantially  all of such  radio
stations (whether by sale of assets,  equity, or otherwise),  Employee agrees to
be bound by, and to execute such  additional  instruments as may be necessary or
desirable  to  evidence  Employee's  agreement  to be bound  by,  the  terms and
conditions of any  non-competition  provisions relating to the purchase and sale
agreement  for such  radio  stations,  without  any  consideration  beyond  that
expressed in this  Agreement,  provided that the purchase and sale  agreement is
negotiated  in  good  faith  with  customary  terms  and  provisions,   and  the
transaction  contemplated  thereby is consummated  and closed not later than one
(1) year after the date on which such SCI Entity  first put the  stations up for
sale.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall Employee be bound by, or
obligated  to enter into,  any  non-competition  provisions  referred to in this
Section  5.2(d) which extend beyond one (1) year from the date of termination of
Employee's  employment  hereunder  or  whose  scope  extends  the  scope  of the
non-competition  provisions  set forth in Section 5.1(a) (as limited by Sections
5.1(b) and (c) above).

               (e)  The one (1) year  time  period  referred  to above  shall be

one (1) year.

          5.3.  ACKNOWLEDGMENT.  Employee  acknowledges  and  agrees  that  this
Agreement (including without limitation, the provisions of Section 5 and 6) is a
condition  of  Employee  being  employed  by  SCI,  Employee  having  access  to
Confidential  Information,  being  eligible to receive the items  referred to in
Schedule A (including, without limitation, Employee's eligibility to participate
in the Long Term  Incentive  Plan,  Employee's  advancement at SCI, and Employee
being eligible to receive other special benefits at SCI; and further,  that this
Agreement  is entered  into,  and is  reasonably  necessary,  to protect the SCI
Entities' investment in Employee's training and development,  and to protect the
good will and other business interests of the SCI Entities.

    6.    REMEDIES.

          6.1.  INJUNCTIVE  RELIEF.  The covenants and obligations  contained in
Section 5 relate to matters which are of a special,  unique,  and  extraordinary
character  and a  violation  of any of the  terms  of such  Section  will  cause
irreparable  injury to the SCI Entities,  the amount of which will be impossible
to estimate or determine and which cannot be adequately compensated.  Therefore,
SCI  Entities  will be  entitled  to an  injunction  restraining  order or other
equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction (subject to such terms
and conditions that the court determines appropriate), restraining any violation
or threatened  violation of any of such terms by Employee and such other persons
as the court orders.  The parties  acknowledge  and agree that judicial  action,
rather than  arbitration,  is appropriate with respect to the enforcement of the
provisions  of Section 5. The forum for any  litigation  hereunder  shall be the
Circuit Court of Baltimore  County or the United States District Court (Northern
Division) sitting in Baltimore, Maryland.

          6.2.  CUMULATIVE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES.  Rights and remedies provided by
Section 5 are  cumulative  and are in addition to any other  rights and remedies
any of the SCI Entities may have at law or equity.

     7.   ABSENCE  OF  RESTRICTIONS.   Employee  warrants  and  represents  that
Employee  is  not  a  party  to  or  bound  by  any  agreement,   contract,   or
understanding,  whether of  employment  or  otherwise,  with any third person or
entity which would in any way restrict or prohibit  Employee from undertaking or
performing  employment  with SCI in accordance  with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

     8.   MISCELLANEOUS.

           8.1. ATTORNEYS'  FEES.  In  any  action,  litigation,  or  proceeding
(collectively,  "Action")  between the parties  arising out of or in relation to
this Agreement,  the prevailing party in the Action will be awarded, in addition
to any damages, injunctions, 


                                       7
<PAGE>

or other  relief,  and without  regard to whether such Action is  prosecuted  to
final appeal, such party's costs and expenses,  including reasonable  attorneys'
fees.

           8.2. HEADINGS.  The  descriptive  headings  of the  Sections  of this
Agreement are inserted for  convenience  only,  and do not  constitute a part of
this Agreement.

                             TERMINATION AGREEMENT

     Termination  Agreement  dated  as of February 8, 1999 ("Agreement") between
Sinclair  Broadcast  Group,  Inc., a Maryland corporation ("Sinclair") and Barry
Baker ("Baker").

     Whereas, Sinclair and Baker have entered into an Employment Agreement dated
as of April 10,  1996 (the  "Original  Employment  Agreement"),  as amended by a
First  Amendment  to  Employment  Agreement  dated as of May , 1998 (the  "First
Amendment"  and the  Original  Employment  Agreement,  as  amended  by the First
Amendment, being referred hereto as the "Amended Employment Agreement");

     Whereas,  Sinclair and Baker have entered into a Consulting Agreement dated
as of April 10, 1996 (the "Consulting Agreement");

     Whereas,   pursuant  to  Section  10.3.1  (g)  of  the  Amended  Employment
Agreement,  Baker has the right to  terminate  the  Agreement  Term (as  defined
therein) in the event that the  Effective  Date (as defined  therein)  shall not
have occurred by December 31, 1998, unless such failure is solely due to actions
or failure to take actions on the part of Baker (other than the failure of Baker
to  eliminate  his  attributable  interest  in RCB and  RCLP  (each  as  defined
therein);

     Whereas, the Effective Date has not occurred by December 31, 1998, and such
failure  has not been as a result of actions or the  failure to take  actions on
the part of Baker;

     Whereas,  Baker  desires to  terminate  the  Amended  Employment  Agreement
pursuant to Section 10.3.1(g) of the Amended Employment Agreement;

     Whereas,  pursuant to Section 1.2 of the Consulting Agreement,  the term of
Baker's  engagement as a consultant to Sinclair  terminates upon the termination
of the Agreement Term (as defined therein);

     Whereas,  Sinclair and Baker desire to confirm and clarify their agreements
regarding  termination  of  Baker's  employment  and  Baker's  engagement  as  a
consultant,  as well as to provide  for  certain  additional  matters  set forth
herein;

     Now, therefore, in consideration of the foregoing, Sinclair and Baker agree
as follows:

     1.   The Agreement Term, and Baker's engagement as a consultant pursuant to
          the  Consulting  Agreement,  (collectively  referred  to  as  "Baker's
          employment  with  Sinclair")  shall end on a date between  March 8 and
          April 8, 1999.  At any time  either  Sinclair  or Baker may specify in
          writing to the other a date between March 8 and April 8, 1999 at which
          the Agreement Term and Baker's  employment with Sinclair shall end. If
          neither  Sinclair  nor Baker  specify  in  writing to the other such a
          date,  the  Agreement  Term  shall  end 


<PAGE>

          on April 8, 1999.  If either  Sinclair  or Baker  specify in writing a
          date between March 8 and April 8, 1999, the Agreement Term and Baker's
          employment  with Sinclair shall  terminate on the date  specified.  If
          Sinclair and Baker both specify a date, the Agreement Term and Baker's
          employment  with  Sinclair  shall  terminate on the earlier of the two
          dates  specified.  The date on which the Employment Term terminates is
          referred to herein as the "Employment  Termination  Date". Baker shall
          not receive  Base Salary under  Section 4.1 of the Amended  Employment
          Agreement after March 8, 1999.

     2.   On March 8, 1999,  Sinclair  shall comply with its  obligations  under
          clauses  (a) and  (b) of  Section  10.3.2  of the  Amended  Employment
          Agreement by wire transferring to Baker (to an account to be specified
          by  Baker  to  Sinclair  in  writing  no later  than  March  6,  1999)
          immediately  available funds in an amount equal to $5,802,303.40 which
          includes an amount equal to $575,615.00  which is the Bonus payable to
          Baker  in  respect  of 1998  under  Section  4.2.4  of the  Employment
          Agreement.  An  agreed  calculation  of such  amount  is set  forth in
          Exhibit A. Baker  waives his rights to payments of Bonus with  respect
          to the period from January 1, 1999 through the Employment  Termination
          Date under Section 4.2.4 of the Amended Employment Agreement.

     3.   Except as expressly provided otherwise  hereunder,  Sinclair and Baker
          each hereby  acknowledge  and confirm that they will strictly  perform
          all of their  obligations  according  to their terms under the Amended
          Employment Agreement and the Consulting Agreement.  Without limitation
          of the foregoing,  Sinclair  shall  strictly  perform all of its other
          obligations referred to under Sections 6.3(a), 7, 10.3.2, 10.4, 15 and
          Section  16.7 of the  Amended  Employment  Agreement  in  respect of a
          termination  of  Employment  under  Section  10.3.1(g).   Any  amounts
          credited to Baker's account under any Sinclair  deferred  compensation
          plan shall be paid to Baker as provided in such plan.

     4.   On or prior to the Employment  Termination Date, Sinclair shall pay in
          full all remaining  amounts for the membership and dues assessments of
          Baker as Cave's  Valley Golf Club so that the  membership  of Baker in
          such club is paid in full. Sinclair shall also thereafter cooperate to
          take such  additional  actions,  if any, as may be  necessary to fully
          transfer such membership to Baker.

     5.   Sinclair  and Baker agree that  Article VI.  (Exchange  Rights) of the
          Registration  Rights Agreement dated as of May 31, 1996, as amended as
          of  October  31,  1996  ("Registration  Rights  Agreement"),  provides
          Holders (as defined therein),  including without limitation Baker, (i)
          the right to sell  from  time to time  less than all of such  Holder's
          Class A Common Stock that was converted from Series B Preferred  Stock
          and (ii) to present  the  remainder  of such shares to the Company for
          conversion  into  Series B Preferred  Stock of Sinclair in  accordance
          with the terms of the Registration  Rights Agreement and the Company's
          charter.



                                       2
<PAGE>

     6.   Notwithstanding  the provisions of the Registration  Rights Agreement,
          Barry Baker shall have 160 days from the Employment  Termination  Date
          to present  the  remainder  of the shares  referred to in Section 5 of
          this Agreement to the Company for  conversion  into Series B Preferred
          Stock.  Baker  acknowledges that the Series B Preferred Stock referred
          to in this Section 6 may, if  necessary as a result of the  provisions
          of the  Articles  of  Incorporation  and  Maryland  law, be a class of
          preferred  stock  of  Sinclair   identical  in  all  respects  to  the
          attributes of the Series B Preferred Stock. With respect to any shares
          of Class A Common  Stock  referred  to in Section 5 of this  Agreement
          that Baker presents to Sinclair for conversion into Series B Preferred
          Stock,  and which have not been  presented for  conversion  within 120
          days of the Employment  Termination  Date,  Baker agrees that Sinclair
          may, if it desires,  fix the date and give notice of a  redemption  of
          such shares to occur 180 days after the  Employment  Termination  Date
          not less than 170 days after such  Employment  Termination  Date,  and
          Baker  waives the 30 day advance  notice  provision in Section 5(i) of
          the Articles Supplementary relating to the Series B Preferred Stock to
          the  extent  (and  only to the  extent)  inconsistent  with the  other
          provisions of this sentence.

     7.   Baker agrees that,  regardless of whether Sinclair or Baker shall have
          notified the other of a date pursuant to Section 1 of this  Agreement,
          Baker shall support Sinclair's  business  entertainment  activities in
          Park City, Utah scheduled for February 13, 1999 through March 8, 1999,
          including  by making  Baker's  house in Park City  available  for such
          activities.

     8.   Sinclair and Baker agree to the press release set forth as Exhibit B.

     9.   On or prior to February 18, 1999,  Sinclair  shall take or cause to be
          taken all commercially  reasonable  actions  (including actions by its
          board of directors or compensation  committee or both) as is necessary
          to permit  Baker to transfer  all or a portion of his  employee  stock
          options in  Sinclair,  and all  rights  associated  therewith,  to any
          member of his immediate family or one or more entities established for
          the benefit of any member of Baker's immediate family.

     10.  Baker  shall  have the same  rights  with  respect  to any  dispute or
          disagreement  arising  hereunder or related  hereto as is set forth in
          Section 16.7 of the Amended  Employment  Agreement with respect to any
          dispute  or  disagreement   arising  out  of  the  Amended  Employment
          Agreement.

     11.  Except with  respect to the  provisions  of Section 5, nothing in this
          Agreement,  express or  implied,  is  intended to confer on any person
          other  than the  parties  hereto or their  respective  successors  and
          permitted  assigns,  any rights  remedies,  obligations or liabilities
          under or by reason  of this  Agreement.  The

          Holders  referred  to in  Section 5 hereof  are  express  third  party
          beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement.

                  (b) As  promptly  as  possible  but no later  than  three  (3)

                  (b) The Purchase Price (less any amounts of the Purchase Price

          2.4 POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT.

                  (a) The  parties  agree that no later than  seventy-five  (75)
days  after  the  Transfer  Date (or such  later  date on which  such  statement
reasonably can be prepared and delivered in light of the compliance of Purchaser
and the  Company  with  their  obligations  set  forth  in next  two  succeeding
sentences),  the Company shall deliver to Purchaser, in the form received by the
Company from Gannett (i) a statement  of the actual Net  Financial  Assets as of
11:59 p.m.,  New York City time, on the day  immediately  preceding the Transfer
Date (the  "CLOSING  STATEMENT")  certified  by  PriceWaterhouseCoopers  L.L.P.,
independent  accountants  for  Gannett,  to be  prepared  (except  as  otherwise
provided  in  Section  9 of the  Disclosure  Schedule  to the  Gannett  Purchase
Agreement) in conformity with GAAP and on a basis consistent with the basis used
in preparing the Unaudited  Financial  Statements as of, and for the year ended,
December 27, 1997,  referred to in Section 3.5 of the Gannett Purchase Agreement
except to the  extent of any  position  taken as the  result of such  statements
being prepared on a consolidated  basis,  and (ii) a determination of the amount
by which the actual  Net  Financial  Assets  are less than or  greater  than the
Estimated Net Financial Assets. Purchaser shall provide the Company and Gannett,
and Gannett's  independent  accountants,  access at all reasonable  times to the
relevant  personnel,  properties,  books and  records of the  Business  for such
purposes  and to assist the  Company  and  Gannett,  and  Gannett's  independent
accountants,  in preparing the Closing Statement.  Purchaser's  assistance shall
include, without limitation,  the closing of the books of the Business as of the
Transfer Date, the preparation of schedules  supporting the amounts set forth in
the general  ledger and other books and records of the Business,  and such other
assistance  as the Company,  Gannett or Gannett's  independent  accountants


                                       11

may reasonably  request.  During the twenty-five  (25) day period  following the
delivery  by the  Company  of the  Closing  Statement  referred  to in the first
sentence of this Section 2.4(a),  Purchaser and its independent accountants will
be permitted to review the working  papers of the Company and of Gannett and its
independent  accountants relating to the preparation of the Closing Statement to
the same extent as such working  papers have been made  available to the Company
by Gannett pursuant to the Gannett Purchase  Agreement.  If, within  twenty-five
(25) days after  delivery  by the Company of the  Closing  Statement,  Purchaser
notifies the Company that it disagrees with the Closing  Statement,  the Company
shall attempt to resolve the disagreement with Gannett. In the event the Company
and Purchaser cannot agree with respect to the Closing Statement within five (5)
days of the notice of  disagreement  provided by Purchaser to the Company,  then
the determination  shall be submitted for resolution  promptly to an independent
nationally recognized accounting firm (the "ACCOUNTING FIRM"),  jointly selected
by  the  Company  and  Purchaser,  whose  determination  (the  "ACCOUNTING  FIRM
DETERMINATION") shall be instructed by the parties to be made within twenty (20)
days and be binding upon all parties hereto,  and the fees and expenses of which
shall be borne equally by Purchaser and the Company to the extent that such fees
and expenses are allocable to the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.
The  Purchaser  agrees  that the  accounting  firm  selected  by Gannett and the
Company  pursuant to Section 2.3(a) of the Gannett  Purchase  Agreement shall be
the  Accounting  Firm  hereunder  as long as such firm has not been  engaged  by
Gannett  or the  Company  during  the  three (3) year  period  prior to the date
hereof.  In the event that  (whether  expressly  or by failure of  Purchaser  to
provide  notice of any  disagreement  within the  applicable  period)  Purchaser
agrees with the determination of the final Net Financial Assets set forth in the
Closing  Statement  without   submitting  the  matter  for  an  Accounting  Firm
Determination, the Net Financial Assets set forth in the Closing Statement shall
be the  final  determination  of the Net  Financial  Assets.  The  amount of Net
Financial  Assets as of 11:59 p.m.,  New York City time, on the day  immediately
preceding the Closing Date, as definitively  determined pursuant to this Section
2.4(a) is referred to herein as the "ACTUAL NET FINANCIAL ASSETS".

                  (b) If the Actual Net  Financial  Assets are greater  than the
Estimated Net Financial  Assets,  then Purchaser  shall pay the Company in cash,
within two (2)  Business  Days  following  the  determination  of the Actual Net
Financial  Assets,  an amount  equal to such  difference,  plus  interest on the
amount of such  difference  at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum from the
Transfer  Date to the date of such  payment  to the  Company.  If the Actual Net
Financial  Assets are less than the  Estimated Net  Financial  Assets,  then the
Company shall pay the  Purchaser in cash within two (2) Business Days  following
the  determination of the Actual Net Financial  Assets,  an amount equal to such
difference,  plus interest on the amount of such difference at the rate of eight
percent  (8%) per annum from the 



                                       12

Transfer  Date to the  date of such  payment  to  Purchaser.  The  amounts  paid
pursuant  to this  Section  2.4(b)  shall  be by wire  transfer  of  immediately
available funds for credit to the recipient at a bank account identified by such
recipient in writing.

          2.5 ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

                  The Company and Purchaser  agree to allocate the Base Purchase
Price among the Stations for all purposes (including  financial,  accounting and
tax purposes) in accordance with Schedule 2.7 hereto.  The Company and Purchaser

                                       20


<PAGE>


and 5000 of the Code) and, to the Company's Knowledge,  Gannett has performed in
all material respects all obligations  required to be performed by it under, and
is not in default  under or in violation  of, any of the terms of such  Employee
Benefit Plans where any such noncompliance, nonperformance, default or violation
would,  individually  or in the aggregate,  be reasonably  expected to result in
liability in excess of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000).  To the Company's
Knowledge,  Gannett has no post-retirement  welfare  obligations with respect to
the Business. To the Company's Knowledge,  Gannett has not incurred, and, to the
Company's Knowledge,  no event,  transaction or condition has occurred or exists
which is reasonably expected to result in the occurrence of any liability to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation  (other than contributions to the plan and
premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation which, in either event, are
not in default) or any "withdrawal liability" within the meaning of Section 4201
of  ERISA,  or any  other  liability  pursuant  to Title I or IV of ERISA or the
penalty,  excise  tax or joint  and  several  liability  provisions  of the Code

Benefit Plan or any pension plan  maintained by any company that during the last

Company or Gannett,  as the case may be, under  Section 4001 of ERISA or Section
414 of the Code (an "ERISA AFFILIATE"),  where individually or in the aggregate,
in any of such  events,  any such  liability  would be in excess of  Twenty-Five
Thousand Dollars ($25,000).  To the Company's Knowledge,  except as set forth in
Section 3.14 of the  Disclosure  Schedule and except for such matters that would
not,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  reasonably  be  expected to result in
liability in excess of Twenty-Five  Thousand  Dollars  ($25,000),  each Employee
Benefit Plan  relating to the  Stations  intended to be  "qualified"  within the
meaning of Section  401(a) of the Code has  received a  favorable  determination
letter that such plan is so qualified and the trusts  maintained  thereunder are
exempt from  taxation  under  Section  501(a) of the Code and, to the  Company's
Knowledge,  is so qualified,  and no such Employee  Benefit Plan holds  employer
securities.  To the Company's  Knowledge and except as set forth in Section 3.14
of the Disclosure  Schedule,  neither  Gannett nor any ERISA  Affiliate has ever
made or been  obligated to make, or  reimbursed  or been  obligated to reimburse
another  employer for,  contributions to any  multiemployer  plan (as defined in
ERISA  Section  3(37)).  To the  Company's  Knowledge and except as set forth in
Section 3.14 of the  Disclosure  Schedule,  the Employee  Benefit  Plans are not
presently  under  audit or  examination  (and  have  not  received  notice  of a
potential audit or examination) by any  governmental  authority,  and no matters
are pending with respect to the Qualified Plan under any governmental compliance
programs. To the Company's Knowledge, with respect to each Employee Benefit Plan
of the  Stations,  there have been no  violations  of Code Section 4975 or ERISA
Sections 404 or 406 as to which successful claims would,  individually or in the
aggregate,  result  in  liability  in  excess of  Twenty-Five  Thousand  Dollars
($25,000) for Gannett,  the 



                                       21


<PAGE>

Company or any  Person  required  to be  indemnified  by either of them.  To the
Company's  Knowledge,  except as set  forth in  Section  3.14 of the  Disclosure
Schedule,  and except as expressly provided in this Agreement,  the consummation
of the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  will not (i) entitle any
current  or former  employee  or  officer  of the  Business  to  severance  pay,
unemployment  compensation  or other  payment,  or (ii)  accelerate  the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due any such employee
or officer.  To the Company's  Knowledge,  there are no pending or threatened or
anticipated  claims by or on behalf of any Employee Benefit Plan relating to the
Stations,  by any  employee  or  beneficiary  covered  under any such  plan,  or
otherwise involving any such plan (other than routine claims for benefits) where
any such pending, threatened or anticipated claims would, individually or in the
aggregate,   reasonably  be  expected  to  result  in  liability  in  excess  of
Twenty-Five  Thousand  Dollars  ($25,000).   The  Twenty-Five  Thousand  Dollars
($25,000)  liability threshold in this Section 3.14 is intended to apply only to
this Section 3.14, and is in no way intended to be used in defining  materiality
anywhere in this Agreement.

cost,  for  inspection  and/or  copying by the Company and any Person that was a
stockholder  of  Gannett  during  any of the tax  years  (or  portions  thereof)
immediately preceding the closing under the Gannett Purchase Agreement for which
the  relevant  statute of  limitations  (including  any waiver  thereof) has not
expired,  or their  respective  representatives,  the books and  records  of the
Business  transferred to Purchaser from the Company at the Non-License  Transfer
or the Closing, as the case may be. Such books and records shall be preserved by
Purchaser  until the later of the closing by tax audit of, or the  expiration of
the relevant statute of limitations  (including any waiver thereof) with respect
to, all open tax periods of Gannett and such stockholders prior to and including
the time  immediately  prior to the  Transfer  Date.  After the period set forth
above,  Purchaser  may destroy the books and records in its  possession  unless,
before  expiration of such notice  period the Company  objects in writing to the
destruction of any or all of such books and records,  in which case,  such books
and records shall be delivered to the Company.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,
Purchaser  shall  continue to preserve  and, at all  reasonable  times after the
Transfer Date, to make available  without cost, for inspection and/or copying by
any Person  that was a trustee or other  fiduciary  under the  Employee  Benefit
Plans  identified  in  Section  5.2 of the  Disclosure  Schedule,  the books and
records of such Employee  Benefit Plan transferred to Purchaser from the Company
at the  Non-License  Transfer or the Closing,  as the case may be, and the books
and records of the Business relating thereto.

                  (b) At least  five (5)  Business  Days  prior to the  Transfer
Date,  the Company  shall  provide to Purchaser a true and complete  list of the
names,  titles  and  annual  compensation  of each of the  employees  (including
inactive  employees) of the Stations.  Effective as of the Transfer Date, except
for such employees of the Stations which are retained by the Company pursuant to
the terms of the Time  Brokerage  Agreement  who shall be offered  employment by
Purchaser as of the Closing Date, and the employees identified in Section 5.2(b)
of the Disclosure  Schedule (the "EXCLUDED  EMPLOYEES"),  Purchaser  shall offer
employment to all then  employees of the Stations,  on such terms and conditions
as  Purchaser  shall


                                       32


<PAGE>


establish  (except  that base cash  compensation  shall be  comparable  to their
existing  base  cash  compensation),  subject  to the  terms  of any  collective
bargaining   agreement  assumed  by  Purchaser  under  Section  5.2(e)  and  any
employment  agreements  with  specific  Business  Employees,  and  shall  assume
responsibility for all inactive employees of the Stations,  subject to the terms
of  this  Section  5.2 and  the  collective  bargaining  agreements  assumed  by
Purchaser  under Section  5.2(e);  provided,  however,  that any employee of the
Stations  who is not  actively  employed on the  Transfer  Date shall be offered
employment  by Purchaser  following the end of any inactive  period  (whether on
account of leave, layoff,  injury or disability) but only to the extent that the
Company would have been obligated to offer active employment to such person upon
the  end  of  such  inactive  period  under  the  Gannett  Purchase   Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Purchaser shall not have any obligation to offer
employment  to  any  employees  of  the  Corporate  Office   ("CORPORATE  OFFICE
EMPLOYEES"),  as described in Section 5.2(b) of the Disclosure Schedule. Nothing
in this  Section  5.2(b)  is  intended  to limit the  ability  of  Purchaser  to
terminate the employment of any employee after the Transfer Date.

                  (c) Subject to applicable  law and the terms of any collective
bargaining agreement assumed pursuant to this Agreement, if any, Purchaser shall
establish  and maintain for a period of one (1) year after the Transfer  Date or
the term of their  employment by Purchaser,  whichever is less, for employees of
the Stations as of the Transfer Date,  benefits  that, in the aggregate,  are no
less  favorable  than the benefits  maintained  by the  Purchaser  for similarly
situated  employees of Purchaser,  provided that the foregoing will not prohibit
or in any manner restrict  Purchaser from terminating or changing the individual
terms of  employment of any Business  Employee or require  Purchaser to maintain
any specific benefits or Employee Benefit Plans.  Purchaser shall give employees
of the  Stations  as of the  Transfer  Date and  former  and  inactive  Business
Employees  credit for their service with the Company and Gannett or any of their
Subsidiaries  prior to the Transfer  Date,  to the same extent that such service
would have been  credited by Purchaser  (if they had been  employed by Purchaser
for such period of service),  for all purposes under all employee  benefit plans
or  arrangements  maintained  by  Purchaser  for  current,  former and  inactive
Business  Employees  (including  any waiting  periods).  In addition,  Purchaser
shall,  if applicable,  (i) cause any  pre-existing  condition  limitation to be
waived  and  (ii)  give  effect,  in  determining  any  deductible  and  maximum
out-of-pocket  limitations,  to claims incurred and amounts paid by, and amounts
reimbursed to current,  former and inactive  Business  Employees with respect to
similar plans maintained by the Company or Gannett prior to the Transfer Date.

                  (d) Purchaser  will assume and indemnify and hold harmless the
Company  Indemnified  Parties against all Liabilities  with respect to severance



                                       33



<PAGE>

benefits  arising in connection  with or following the Transfer Date pursuant to
the  agreements  set forth in  Sections  3.14.1  and  3.14.2  of the  Disclosure
Schedule  (subject  to the right of  recovery  set  forth in  Section  5.9),  or
pursuant  to any  collective  bargaining  agreement  or  other  agreements  with
Business  Employees assumed either pursuant to this Agreement or by operation of
law.  With respect to all current and inactive  Business  Employees  immediately
prior to the  Transfer  Date not  covered by the  agreements  referenced  in the
immediately  preceding sentence,  (i) for a period ending not less than one year
after the Transfer Date, Purchaser will provide such Business Employees with the
same severance  benefits as Purchaser  provides for similarly situated employees
of Purchaser  (which benefits,  as of the date hereof,  are described in Section
5.2(d) of the Disclosure  Schedule) and (ii) Purchaser will assume and indemnify
and hold harmless the Company  Indemnified  Parties against all Liabilities with
respect  to  severance  benefits  of  Purchaser  arising in  connection  with or
following the Transfer Date.

                  (e) From and after the Transfer Date,  Purchaser  shall assume
all of the collective  bargaining agreements and labor union contracts described
in Section 5.2(e) of the Disclosure  Schedule  (including,  without  limitation,
pursuant to the specified provisions of the collective bargaining agreements set
forth in Section 5.2(e) of the Disclosure Schedule) with respect to any Business
Employees existing immediately prior to the Transfer Date.

                  (f) From and after the Transfer Date,  Purchaser  shall assume
responsibilities  of all Employee  Benefits Plans described in Section 5.2(f) of
the Disclosure Schedule that provide  post-retirement  life insurance or health,
or  short-term  or  long-term  disability  benefits and be  responsible  for any
benefits under such Employee  Benefit Plans (i) to which any current,  former or
inactive Business Employee, or a beneficiary or dependent of any current, former
or inactive Business Employee  ("BENEFICIARY"),  has already become entitled, or
(ii) to which any  current,  former or inactive  Business  Employee  has already
become  qualified by reason of age and years of service as of the Transfer Date,
to the extent such persons are  identified in Section  5.2(f) of the  Disclosure
Schedule  (which  section  shall be updated,  if necessary,  at the  Non-License
Transfer or the  Closing,  as  applicable).  From and after the  Transfer  Date,
Purchaser shall also pay to the Business  Employees  listed in Section 5.2(f) of
the Disclosure Schedule the supplemental  retirement benefits provided under the
applicable Gannett supplemental retirement plan.

                  (g) From and after the Transfer Date,  Purchaser  shall assume
and be responsible for any workers'  compensation benefits payable to a Business
Employee,  Beneficiary  or  dependent  of a  Business  Employee  on or after the
Transfer Date,  including any such benefits that are  attributable to any injury
or



                                       34




<PAGE>

illness that  occurred or existed  prior to the Transfer  Date to the extent not
covered by the Company's workers' compensation insurance policy.

                  (h) For a period of ninety (90) days after the Transfer  Date,
Purchaser  shall not implement  any  employment  terminations,  layoffs or hours
reductions  or take any other action which could result in a "plant  closing" or
"mass  layoff",  as  those  terms  are  defined  in the  Worker  Adjustment  and
Retraining  Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN") or similar events under applicable
state law,  affecting in whole or in part any  facility,  site of  employment or
operating unit, or any employee employed by the Stations, or which could require
either Purchaser or the Company to give notice or take any other action required
by WARN or applicable state law.

                  (i) From and after the Transfer Date,  Purchaser  shall assume
the Company's and Gannett's  obligations and  liabilities  with respect to COBRA
continuation  coverage  under Section 4980B of the Code and Section 601 of ERISA
("CONTINUATION  COVERAGE") with respect to Business  Employees and shall provide
Continuation  Coverage to the Business  Employees under  Purchaser's  health and
medical  plans (A) with respect to any Business  Employees  who remain  employed
with either the Company or Gannett  through the Transfer  Date,  for a period of
eighteen  (18) months after the  Transfer  Date or, if earlier,  until  becoming
eligible for comparable  coverage from another  employer and (B) with respect to
any Business  Employees  whose  employment  shall have  terminated  prior to the
Transfer  Date,  for remainder of the period with respect to which  Continuation
Coverage would otherwise have been available to them had the Company or Gannett,
as the case may be,  continued to maintain a group health plan;  provided,  that
consistent  with the  Continuation  Coverage,  Purchaser shall have the right to
charge  each  Business  Employee  for such  Business  Employee's  portion of any
Continuation Coverage.

               5.3 COOPERATION.

                  Following the execution of this  Agreement,  Purchaser and the
Company agree as follows:

                  (a) The  parties  and their  Affiliates  shall  each use their
reasonable  efforts,  and shall  cooperate  fully with each other in  preparing,
filing,  prosecuting,  and taking any other actions with respect to, any filings
(other than filings  with the FCC,  which are provided for in clause (b) below),
applications,  requests,  or actions which are or may be necessary to obtain the
consents,  approvals,   authorizations  or  other  orders  of  any  Governmental
Authority which are or may be necessary in order to accomplish the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement;  and,  without  limiting the generality of the
foregoing,   the  parties  and  their  Affiliates  shall  use 


                                       36


<PAGE>

their  respective  reasonable  efforts  to  prepare  and  file  as  promptly  as
practicable,  but in any event no later  than five (5)  Business  Days after the
date hereof  (unless the Company  designates in writing that the filing shall be
delayed to a date no later than the first (1st) Business Day after the Diligence
Termination Deadline), all of the information called for in the Notification and
Report Form required under the HSR Act and to prepare and file any  supplemental
information,  also in a timely  fashion,  which may be  required  by the  United
States  Department of Justice or the Federal Trade  Commission  pursuant to such
Notification  and Report Form  Filings,  and  otherwise to use their  respective
reasonable efforts to obtain the requisite clearances.

                  (b) The parties and their  Affiliates  shall  cooperate  fully
with each other in preparing,  filing, prosecuting, and taking any other actions
with respect to filings with the FCC related to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, without limitation, preparation of an application for
the  assignment  of all of the FCC  Licenses  to  Purchaser  and any  filings by
Purchaser  requesting  temporary waivers for no more than nine (9) months of the
FCC's  applicable  ownership rules necessary to permit the parties to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As promptly as practicable, but
in any  event  not  later  than ten  (10)  Business  Days  after  the  Diligence
Termination  Deadline,   the  Company  and  Purchaser  shall  jointly  file  the
application  with  the  FCC  requesting  the  FCC  Consent,  including,  without
limitation,  requesting,  consenting  to, and taking and  otherwise  seeking any
action in connection  with a conditional  waiver of the FCC's Duopoly Rule.  The
Company  and  Purchaser  shall use their  respective  reasonable  best  efforts,
diligently  take all  necessary  and proper  actions and provide any  additional
information  requested  by the FCC in order to obtain  promptly the FCC Consent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,  neither
Purchaser  nor its officers,  directors or Affiliates  shall request a permanent
waiver of the FCC's applicable  ownership rules or request,  consent to, take or
otherwise seek or pursue any action that is inconsistent  with the  transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement  or  that  reasonably  could  be  expected  to
materially  impede or materially  delay the FCC Consent or otherwise  materially
impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement;  and the receipt of any  permanent  waiver of the foregoing FCC
rules shall not be a condition to the  obligation of Purchaser to consummate the
transactions  contemplated  hereby.  Neither  Purchaser nor any of its officers,
directors or Affiliates  will take any action that would result in any change in
the matters set forth in Section 4.7 hereof that would reasonably be expected to
materially  delay  or  otherwise   materially  impair  Purchaser's   ability  to
consummate  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby.  After  the  date  hereof,
Purchaser or its Affiliates may enter into  transactions  that implicate the FCC
multiple  ownership 



                                       37



<PAGE>

rules  so long  as  such  transactions  would  not  reasonably  be  expected  to
materially impede or materially delay the Closing

                  (c)  (i) If  Purchaser  (or  its  Affiliates)  or the  Company
receives  an  administrative  or other  order or  notification  relating  to any
violation or claimed  violation of the rules and  regulations  of the FCC, or of
any  Governmental  Authority,  that could affect  Purchaser's  or the  Company's
ability to  consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  or (ii) should
Purchaser (or its Affiliates)  become aware of any fact (including any change in
law or regulations (or any  interpretation  thereof by the FCC)) relating to the
qualifications of Purchaser (and its controlling  persons) that reasonably could
be expected to cause the FCC to withhold the FCC Consent, Purchaser (in the case
of  clauses  (i) and  (ii)) or the  Company  (in the case of clause  (i))  shall
promptly  notify the other party or parties thereof and shall use its reasonable
best  efforts  to take  such  steps  as may be  necessary  to  remove  any  such
impediment  to the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement;  and no such
notification  shall affect the  representations  or warranties of the parties or
the conditions to their respective obligations hereunder.

                  (d) The parties shall each use their  reasonable  best efforts
to obtain as promptly as reasonably  practical all consents that may be required
in connection with the assignment to the Purchaser at the  Non-License  Transfer
and the Closing,  as applicable,  of all the Company's right, title and interest
in and to all Material Contracts as such are acquired by the Company pursuant to
the Gannett Purchase Agreement and all other agreements of the Business to which
the  Company or Gannett is a party,  provided  that (i)  neither the Company nor
Purchaser  shall  be  required  to make  any  payment  to any  party to any such
Material Contract or other agreement in order to obtain any such consent (except
the Company agrees to pay any amounts  outstanding as of the Transfer Date under
any such Material Program Contracts as provided for in Section 5.1(a)(v).

                  (e)  To  the  extent  that  there  are  third-party  insurance
policies  maintained by Gannett  covering any Claims or Damages  relating to the
assets,  business,   operations,   conduct  and  employees  (including,  without
limitation,  former  employees)  of the  Business  arising out of or relating to
occurrences  prior to the Transfer  Date,  the Company shall use all  reasonable
efforts to cause Purchaser to be named as an additional  insured with respect to
such policies.

                  (f)  Subject to the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement,
each of the parties agrees to use its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,  proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the  Non-License  Transfer and the
Closing and the other transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable.

               5.4 CONFIDENTIALITY.

                  (a) The terms of the Confidentiality  Agreement by and between
Purchaser  and the Company are  herewith  incorporated  by  reference  and shall
continue  in full force and effect as between  Purchaser  and the Company at all
times  prior to the  Transfer  Date,  and shall  remain  in  effect  as  between
Purchaser and the Company in accordance with its terms even if this Agreement is
terminated.

                  (b) Before and after the  Transfer  Date,  each of the parties
shall maintain the  confidentiality  of the financial and tax information of the
Persons  other than the Company in the  possession  of the  Company  under terms
similar  to those  set forth in the  Confidentiality  Agreement  by and  between
Purchaser and the Company with respect to  "Evaluation  Material" as though such
terms continued after the Transfer Date.

               5.5 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.

                  Except as otherwise  required by law or the rules of any stock
exchange,  the form and  substance of the initial  public  announcement  of this
Agreement  and  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  and  the  time of such
announcement,  shall be approved in advance by the parties and the parties shall
not issue any other  report,  statement or press  release or otherwise  make any
public  announcement  with  respect  to  this  Agreement  and  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby  without  prior  consultation  in good faith with the other
party hereto;  provided,  however, no public announcement shall be made prior to
the Diligence Termination Deadline.

               5.6 NO SOLICITATION.

                  The  Company   shall  not,  and  shall  cause  its   officers,
directors,  representatives,  affiliates  and  associates  not to, (a)  initiate
contact with, solicit, encourage or respond to any inquiries or proposals by, or
(b) enter into any  discussions or negotiations  with, or disclose,  directly or
indirectly,  any  information  concerning,  the  Business,  the  Assets  or  the
Stations, or afford any access to the Company's or Gannett's  properties,  books
and  records to any Person in  connection  with any  possible  proposal  for the
acquisition (directly or indirectly,  whether by purchase, merger, consolidation
or otherwise)  of all or  substantially  all of the Business,  the Assets or the
Stations.  The Company agrees to terminate  immediately any such  discussions or
negotiations.

               5.7 EMPLOYEES.

                  From and after the date hereof to the first anniversary of the
Transfer Date,  neither the Company,  nor any of its Affiliates shall solicit or
offer  employment to or hire or employ or otherwise  compensate  any employee or
former  employee  (who is an employee of a Station as of the date hereof) of the
Stations  (including any individual who may become  employed  during the one (1)
year  period  following  the  Transfer  Date) at any other  location;  provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to the Excluded Employees, or to any
employee of a Station who is  terminated  by Purchaser  without  cause after the
Transfer Date.

               5.8 NO ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATIONS.

                  Purchaser  acknowledges that it and its  representatives  have
been permitted access to books and records, facilities,  equipment, tax returns,
contracts and agreements,  insurance policies (or summaries thereof),  and other
properties  and assets of the Stations  and that they and their  representatives
have had an  opportunity  to meet with the officers and employees of the Company
to discuss the  Stations  and the  Business,  properties  and assets.  PURCHASER
ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT  NEITHER  THE  COMPANY  NOR ANY  OTHER  PERSON  HAS  MADE ANY
REPRESENTATION  OR  WARRANTY,  EXPRESSED  OR  IMPLIED,  AS TO  THE  ACCURACY  OR
COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION  REGARDING THE STATION OR THE BUSINESS FURNISHED
OR MADE AVAILABLE TO PURCHASER AND ITS  REPRESENTATIVES  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET
FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.

               5.9 CERTAIN PAYMENTS.

                  (a) Pursuant to the terms of the Gannett  Purchase  Agreement,
the Company has certain  rights and  obligations  with respect to the  Severance
Agreements  listed in Sections  3.14.1 and 3.14.2 of the Disclosure  Schedule of
the Gannett Purchase Agreement,  which Severance Agreements include those listed
in  Sections  3.14.1  and 3.14.2 of the  Disclosure  Schedule  hereto  (the "STC
SCHEDULED SEVERANCE AGREEMENTS").  Promptly, but in no event later than five (5)
Business  Days  prior to any  payment  due  under  the STC  Scheduled  Severance
Agreements  to any employee of the  Stations  terminated  by Purchaser  prior to
ninety (90) days after the closing  date under the Gannett  Purchase  Agreement,
Purchaser  shall  notify the Company of the amount to be paid to such  employee,
and the Company shall make the payment to such  terminated  employee as provided
by the STC Scheduled Severance Agreements (a "STC SEVERANCE PAYMENT");  provided
that the  maximum  amount  that the  Company  shall be  required  to pay for all
Business  Employees as defined  hereunder  pursuant to this  Section 5.9,  after
reimbursement  from  the  Purchaser  in the  succeeding  sentence,  shall be the
greater  of  (i)  Two



                                       39

<PAGE>

Hundred Twenty Two Thousand  Ninety-Seven Dollars  ($222,097.00),  or (ii) Eight
Hundred Fifty Thousand  Dollars  ($850,000.00)  minus all amounts  reimbursed by
Gannett to the  Company  pursuant  to  Section  5.8(a) of the  Gannett  Purchase
Agreement  for all the  Gannett  Television  Stations  other than the  Stations.
Within five (5) Business Days after the Company makes an STC Severance  Payment,
Purchaser  shall  reimburse the Company for fifty percent (50%) of the amount of
such payment.  In addition to any  reimbursement by Purchaser under this Section
5.9, to the extent provided by Section 5.8(a) of the Gannett Purchase Agreement,
the  Company  will be  entitled  to  reimbursement  as  provided  by the Gannett
Purchase  Agreement,  and  nothing in this  Agreement  or the  Gannett  Purchase
Agreement  shall  be  construed  to give  Purchaser  any  right of  recovery  to
Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.8(a) of the Gannett Purchase Agreement.

         (b)  Pursuant  to Section  5.8(b) of the  Gannett  Purchase  Agreement,
Gannett will cease operations and vacate the Gannett Corporate Offices,  and the
Company has agreed that it will pay,  indemnify,  and hold harmless Gannett from
and against fifty percent  (50%) of all Claims and Damages  (including,  without
limitation,  all rent or other  payments made under the  Corporate  Office Lease
arising  out of or relating to the  Corporate  Office  Lease) to the extent such
Claims  and  Damages  arise  out of or  relate  to (x)  the  termination  of the
Corporate  Office Lease or (y) the  post-closing  period after the date in which
the Corporate Office Employees cease using the Corporate  Office.  Such payments
by the Company  thereunder are required under the Gannett Purchase  Agreement to
be made by the Company as the related  Claims and Damages are  incurred.  To the
extent the  Company  is  required  to make any such  payments,  Purchaser  shall
reimburse  and pay over to the Company  26.13% of all such  payments made by the
Company (up to the maximum amount of $52,258). Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that Gannett may terminate  the Corporate  Office Lease on such terms as Gannett
shall  determine  and  otherwise  take such  action  as  Gannett  determines  in
connection with Gannett vacating the Corporate Office.

               5.10 BULK SALES LAWS.

                  The parties agree to waive  compliance  with the provisions of
the bulk sales law of any  jurisdiction.  The Company  will  indemnify  and hold
harmless  Purchaser  from  and  against  any and all  Liabilities  which  may be
asserted by third parties against Purchaser as a result of such noncompliance.

               5.11 CONTROL OF THE STATIONS.

                  Prior to the Closing Date, control of the Stations (including,
without  limitation,  control over their  finances,  personnel and  programming)
shall  remain with the  Company or Gannett,  as the case may be. The Company and
Purchaser



                                       40

<PAGE>

acknowledge and agree that neither Purchaser nor any of its employees, agents or
representatives,  directly  or  indirectly,  shall,  or shall have any right to,
control,  direct or otherwise  supervise the Stations,  it being understood that
supervision of all programs,  equipment,  operations and other activities of the
Stations  shall be the sole  responsibility  of,  and at all times  prior to the
Closing Date remain under the complete control and direction of, the Company or,
if prior to the closing under the Gannett Purchase Agreement, Gannett.

               5.12 USE OF CERTAIN NAMES.

                  After the  Transfer  Date,  neither  Purchaser  nor any of its
Affiliates shall use "Sinclair",  "Sinclair Broadcast",  "Sinclair  Television",
"Sinclair  Communications",  "Guy  Gannett",  "Gannett",  or any  name  or  term
confusingly  similar  to the  "Sinclair"  names  in  any  corporate  name  or in
connection with the operation of any business.

               5.13 NEWS SHARING ARRANGEMENTS.

                  (a)  The  Company  and   Purchaser   shall  use   commercially
reasonable  and good faith efforts to enter into a news sharing  agreement  with
Purchaser for sharing of news operations  between  television  station  WEYI-TV,

under the  Gannett  Purchase  Agreement  or any  opinions  of counsel  delivered

the business of the Stations in the  ordinary  course of business in  accordance
with the terms of the Gannett Purchase Agreement (including, without limitation,
the  provisions of Section 5.1 of the Gannett  Purchase  Agreement),  and to the
extent consistent with the foregoing,  in the same manner in which the same have
heretofore  been conducted with the intent of preserving the ongoing  operations
and  business of the  Stations.  This  covenant  shall  survive the  Non-License
Transfer  and the Closing  for the period that the Company has any rights  under
the Gannett  Purchase  Agreement or any opinions of counsel  delivered  pursuant
thereto.

                  (b) The  Company  shall  use  the  Company's  reasonable  best
efforts to close the transactions contemplated by the Gannett Purchase Agreement
as they pertain to the Stations in a timely fashion consistent with the terms of

of the closing under the Gannett Purchase Agreement at least ten (10) days prior
to the date of such closing; provided, however, that the Company shall not waive
any of its rights or  conditions  under the Gannett  Purchase  Agreement as they
pertain to any of the Stations (including, without limitation, any conditions to

enforce the Company's  rights to the fullest  extent  possible under the Gannett
Purchase  Agreement as such rights  pertain to the  Stations,  unless  otherwise
directed by Purchaser.

                  (c) To the extent that the Company  receives  notifications or
information from Gannett with respect to the Stations under the Gannett Purchase
Agreement  or  otherwise  becomes  aware of any  breach  of any  representation,
warranty,  covenant or agreement in the Gannett Purchase Agreement, in each case

the Company shall  cooperate  with  Purchaser in  connection  with the Company's
review,  analysis and monitoring of the Assets,  the Business and the operations
of the  Stations  to the end that an  efficient  transfer  of the Assets and the
Business  may be made  at the  Non-License  Transfer  and  the  Closing  and the
operations  and the business of the  Stations  may continue on an  uninterrupted
basis. The Company shall obtain Purchaser's consent prior to the exercise of the
Company's rights under the Gannett Purchase  Agreement as such rights pertain to
the Stations (other than the right to consummate the acquisition of the Stations
upon  satisfaction  of  all  conditions  thereto).   In  addition  to  providing
information  required hereunder or reasonably  requested,  the Company agrees to
promptly notify Purchaser of any material  problems or developments of which the
Company becomes aware with respect to any Assets or the Business.

                  Whenever  the  Indemnitor  is required to  indemnify  and hold
harmless the Indemnitee from and against and hold the Indemnitee  harmless from,
or to reimburse the Indemnitee for, any item of Claim or Damage,  the Indemnitor
will, subject to the provisions of this Article 8, pay the Indemnitee the amount
of the Claim or Damage (a)  reduced by any  amounts to which the  Indemnitee  is
entitled  from  third   parties  in   connection   with  such  Claim  or  Damage
("REIMBURSEMENTS"),  (b)  reduced by the Net  Proceeds of any  insurance  policy
payable to the  Indemnitee  with respect to such Claim or Damage and (c) reduced
appropriately  to take into  account  any Tax  Benefit  to the  Indemnitee  with
respect to such Claim or Damage  through and including the tax year in which the
indemnification  payment is made, net of all income Taxes resulting or that will
result from the indemnification  payment.  For purposes of this Section 8.4, (i)
"NET PROCEEDS" shall mean the insurance proceeds payable,  less any deductibles,
co-payments,   premium   increases,   retroactive   premiums  or  other  payment
obligations  (including  attorneys'  fees and other  costs of  collection)  that
relates to or arises from the making of the claim for  indemnification  and (ii)
"TAX  BENEFIT"  shall mean any benefit to be  recognized  by the  Indemnitee  in
connection  with the Claim or Damage  based upon the highest  blended  (federal,
state,  local and foreign) marginal income Tax rate applicable to the Indemnitee
during  the  taxable  year for which a return was most  recently  filed with the
Internal  Revenue Service (based on the date of the claim for  indemnification).
The Indemnitor shall use commercially  reasonable efforts (the expenses of which
shall be  considered  Claims and Damages for purposes of the relevant  indemnity
claim) to pursue  Reimbursements  or Net  Proceeds  that may reduce or eliminate
Claims and Damages. If any Indemnitee receives any Reimbursement, Tax Benefit or
Net Proceeds after an  indemnification  payment is made which relates thereto or
if any Indemnitee  receives a Tax Benefit arising after the tax year in which an
indemnification  payment is made which relates  thereto,  the  Indemnitee  shall
promptly repay to the Indemnitor such amount of the  indemnification  payment as
would not have been paid had the  Reimbursement,  Tax  Benefit  or Net  Proceeds
reduced the original  payment (any such repayment  shall be a credit against any
applicable  indemnification  threshold or limitation set forth in Section 8.3(b)
hereof) at such time or times as and to the extent that such Reimbursement,  Tax
Benefit or Net Proceeds is actually received.

               8.5 NOTICE OF CLAIMS.

                  Upon  obtaining  knowledge  of any Claim or  Damage  which has
given  rise to, or could  reasonably  give rise to, a claim for  indemnification
hereunder,  the Person seeking  indemnification  (the  "INDEMNITEE")  shall,  as
promptly as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than thirty (30) days)
following  the date the  Indemnitee  has obtained such  knowledge,  give written
notice  (a  "NOTICE   OF  CLAIM")  of  such  claim  to  the  other   party  (the
"INDEMNITOR").  The Indemnitee shall furnish to the Indemnitor in good faith and
in reasonable detail such information as the Indemnitee may have with respect to
such indemnification claim (including copies of any summons,  complaint or other
pleading  which  may have  been  served  on it and any  written  claim,  demand,
invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting the same). No failure
or delay by the Indemnitee in the  performance of the foregoing  shall reduce or
otherwise  affect the  obligation  of the  Indemnitor  to indemnify and hold the
Indemnitee harmless,  except to the extent that such failure or delay shall have
adversely affected the Indemnitor's ability to defend against, settle or satisfy
any  liability,  damage,  loss,  claim or demand  for which such  Indemnitee  is
entitled to  indemnification  hereunder.  For  purposes of this  Section  8.5, a
Notice of Claim  given in good faith must  include a good faith  estimate of the
amount of the claim to the extent it is reasonably practicable to determine such
estimate.

               8.6 DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS.

                  If any  claim set  forth in the  Notice  of Claim  given by an
Indemnitee  pursuant to Section 8.5 hereof is a claim asserted by a third party,
the  Indemnitor  shall have  thirty  (30) days after the date that the Notice of
Claim is given by the  Indemnitee  to notify  the  Indemnitee  in writing of the
Indemnitor's  election  to  defend  such  third  party  claim on  behalf  of the
Indemnitee.  If the  Indemnitor  elects to defend  such third party  claim,  the
Indemnitee   shall  make   available  to  the  Indemnitor  and  its  agents  and
representatives all witnesses,  pertinent records,  materials and information in
the Indemnitee's  possession or under the Indemnitee's  control as is reasonably
required by the  Indemnitor  and shall  otherwise  cooperate with and assist the
Indemnitor  in the  defense  of  such  third  party  claim,  and so  long as the
Indemnitor  is defending  such third party claim in good faith,  the  Indemnitee
shall not pay,  settle or compromise  such third party claim.  If the Indemnitor
elects to defend such third party claim,  the Indemnitee shall have the right to
participate in the defense of such third party claim,  at the  Indemnitee's  own
expense. In the event,  however,  that the Indemnitee reasonably determines that
representation  by  counsel to the  Indemnitor  of both the  Indemnitor  and the
Indemnitee  may present  such  counsel  with a conflict of  interest,  then such
Indemnitee  may employ  separate  counsel to  represent or defend it in any such
action or proceeding and the 



                                       52



<PAGE>

Indemnitor will, subject to the provisions of this Article 8, pay the reasonable
fees and  disbursements  of such counsel.  If the  Indemnitor  does not elect to
defend  such third party claim or does not defend such third party claim in good
faith,  the Indemnitee  shall have the right,  in addition to any other right or
remedy it may have hereunder,  at the Indemnitor's expense, to defend such third
party  claim;  provided,  however,  that  such  Indemnitee's  defense  of or its
participation  in the defense of any such third party claim shall not in any way
diminish or lessen the indemnification  obligations of the Indemnitor under this
Article 8. If the Indemnitor shall assume the defense of a third party claim, it
shall not settle such claim without the prior written  consent of the Indemnitee
(a) unless such settlement  includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant of a release of the  Indemnitee  from all Liability with respect
to such claim or (b) if such  settlement  involves the  imposition  of equitable
remedies or the  imposition of any  obligations  on such  Indemnitee  other than
financial  obligations for which such Indemnitee will be indemnified  hereunder.
If the Indemnitee is defending a third party claim it will not settle such claim
without prior written consent of the Indemnitor,  which will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

<PAGE>

Purchaser  and any  purported  assignment  contrary to the terms hereof shall be
null, void and of no force and effect;  provided,  however, the Company shall be
entitled,  without  the consent of  Purchaser,  to assign the  Company's  rights
hereunder to any direct or indirect wholly-owned  subsidiaries of the Company to
which the Company shall have assigned the rights of the Company to the Assets of
the Stations under the Gannett  Purchase  Agreement in accordance with the terms
of the  Gannett  Purchase  Agreement  (each  a  "COMPANY  PERMITTED  ASSIGNEE");
provided,  that the Company gives Purchaser  written notice thereof and any such
Company  Permitted  Assignee  shall  be  responsible  for  all  representations,
covenants and agreements of the Company  hereunder as if such Company  Permitted
Assignee  was a party  hereto,  and any such  assignment  shall not  relieve the
Company of any of its Liabilities hereunder (including,  without limitation, any
obligation pursuant to Article 8 hereof).

                  (b) Purchaser shall not assign this Agreement,  in whole or in
part,  whether by  operation  of law or  otherwise,  without  the prior  written
consent of the Company and any purported assignment contrary to the terms hereof
shall be null,  void and of no force and effect;  provided,  however,  Purchaser
shall be  entitled,  without the consent of the Company,  to assign  Purchaser's
rights and interests hereunder (in whole or in part as to any Station) (i) prior
to the Transfer Date, to any Affiliate of Purchaser (each a "PURCHASER PERMITTED
ASSIGNEE");  provided,  that Purchaser  gives the Company written notice thereof
and  such  Purchaser   Permitted   Assignee   shall  be   responsible   for  all
representations,  covenants  and  agreements  of Purchaser  hereunder as if such
assignee was a party hereto, and any such assignment shall not relieve Purchaser
of  any  of  its  Liabilities  hereunder  (including,  without  limitation,  any
obligation  pursuant to Article 8 hereof),  and (ii) from and after the Transfer

                  (c) This  Agreement  shall be binding  upon and shall inure to

<PAGE>

herein or in any document  delivered by any other party  pursuant  hereto or (c)
waive  compliance  with any of the  agreements  or conditions of any other party
contained herein.  Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.  Any waiver
of any term or condition  shall not be  construed as a waiver of any  subsequent
breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition,  or a waiver of any
other term or condition,  of this Agreement.  The failure of any party to assert
any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of any such rights.

               10.7 SEVERABILITY.

                  If any term or other  provision of this  Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being  enforced by any Law or public  policy,  all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall  nevertheless  remain in full force
and  effect  so long as the  economic  or legal  substance  of the  transactions
contemplated  hereby is not  affected  in any manner  materially  adverse to any
party.  Upon such  determination  that any term or other  provision  is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being  enforced,  the parties hereto shall  negotiate in
good faith to modify this  Agreement so as to effect the original  intent of the
parties  as  closely  as  possible  in an  acceptable  manner in order  that the
transactions  contemplated hereby are consummated as originally  contemplated to
the greatest extent possible.

               10.8 AMENDMENT.

                  This Agreement may not be amended or modified except (a) by an
instrument  in writing  signed by, or on behalf of, the Company and Purchaser or
(b) by a waiver in accordance with Section 10.6 hereof.

               10.9 EFFECT AND CONSTRUCTION OF THIS AGREEMENT.

                  This Agreement embodies the entire agreement and understanding
of the parties with respect to the subject  matter hereof and supersedes any and
all prior agreements, arrangements and understandings,  whether written or oral,
relating to matters  provided for herein.  The language  used in this  Agreement
shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their
mutual  agreement,  and this Agreement shall not be deemed to have been prepared
by any single party  hereto.  Disclosure  of any fact or item in the  Disclosure
Schedule  referenced  by a  particular  paragraph  or section in this  Agreement
shall,  should the  existence of the fact or item or its contents be relevant to
any other  paragraph or section,  be deemed to be disclosed with respect to that
other paragraph or section whether or not a specific cross reference appears, if
the  disclosure  in  respect  of the one  paragraph  or  section  is  reasonably
sufficient to inform the reader of the  information  required to be disclosed in
respect such other  paragraph or section.



                                       73



<PAGE>

Disclosure of any fact or item in the Disclosure  Schedule shall not necessarily
mean that such item or fact,  individually  or in the aggregate,  is material to
the business, results of operations or financial condition of the Stations. Time
shall be of the essence in enforcing and applying the  covenants and  conditions
set forth in this  Agreement.  The headings of the sections and  subsections  of
this  Agreement  are  inserted  as a matter  of  convenience  and for  reference
purposes  only and in no respect  define,  limit or  describe  the scope of this
Agreement  or the intent of any section or  subsection.  This  Agreement  may be
executed in one or more  counterparts  and by the  different  parties  hereto in
separate  counterparts,  each of which  when  executed  shall be deemed to be an
original  but all of which  taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
agreement.  This  Agreement  and the rights and duties of the parties  hereunder
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York,  without  giving  effect to the  conflicts of law  principles  thereof
(other than Section 5-1401 of the New York General Obligations Law).

               10.10 TRANSFER AND CONVEYANCE TAXES.

                  Purchaser  and the Company  shall each be liable for and shall
pay one-half of all applicable sales, transfer, recording, deed, stamp and other
similar  non-income taxes,  imposed in connection with transfers and conveyances
of the Assets,  including,  without  limitation,  any real property  transfer or
gains  taxes (if  any),  resulting  from the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

               10.11 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.

                  Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that in the
event  of any  breach  of this  Agreement,  each  non-breaching  party  would be
irreparably  and  immediately  harmed  and could not be made  whole by  monetary
damages.  It is  accordingly  agreed that the parties  hereto (a) waive,  in any
action for specific performance,  the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law and
(b) shall be  entitled,  in  addition  to any other  remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or in equity,  to compel specific  performance of this Agreement
in any action  instituted  in any state or  federal  court  having  jurisdiction
thereover.

               10.12 SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.

                  The  respective  representations,  warranties,  covenants  and
agreements of the Company and Purchaser  contained  herein or in any certificate
and any and all  covenants  and  agreements  herein or therein shall survive the

the Company's  obligations  with respect to all  obligations and liabilities not
assumed by Purchaser shall survive until such  obligations and liabilities  have
been paid,  performed or discharged in full; (f)  Purchaser's  obligations  with
respect to all obligations and liabilities  assumed by Purchaser hereunder shall
survive until such  obligations  and  liabilities  have been paid,  performed or

in full force and effect  until fully  discharged;  and (h) any  representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement that is the subject of a claim which is asserted
prior to the expiration of the survival  period set forth in this Section 10.12,
shall survive with respect to such claim or dispute  until the final  resolution
thereof;  provided,  however,  that unless Purchaser shall notify the Company of
any  Claim or  Damages  at least ten (10) days  prior to the  expiration  of the
survival period set forth in clause (a) or (b) above,  the Company shall have no
obligation  to indemnify  Purchaser  under  Section  8.1(a) with respect to such
Claim or Damages.

     THIS TIME BROKERAGE  AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into as of the
___ day of , 1999,  by and among  [SINCLAIR  COMMUNICATIONS,  INC.,  a  Maryland
corporation]  ("Owner"),  and STC  BROADCASTING,  INC.  a  Delaware  corporation
("Programmer").

                                    RECITALS:

     WHEREAS,  Owner is the licensee,  pursuant to authorizations  issued by the
Federal  Communications  Commission  ("FCC"),  of television  broadcast  station
WICS-TV,  Channel  20,  Springfield,  Illinois  ("WICS"),  television  broadcast
station  WICD-TV,  Channel  15,  Champaign,  Illinois  ("WICD")  and  television
broadcast  station  KGAN-TV,  Channel 2, Cedar Rapids,  Iowa ("KGAN")  (each,  a
"Station" and collectively, the "Stations");

     WHEREAS, Programmer and Owner entered into a Purchase Agreement dated
as of March 5, 1999 (the  "Purchase  Agreement"),  pursuant  to which  Owner has
agreed to sell and  Programmer  has agreed to acquire  substantially  all of the
assets of the Stations (the "Assets"),  including,  without limitation,  the FCC
licenses  held by Owner in  connection  with its  ownership and operation of the
Stations;

     WHEREAS, Programmer is experienced in broadcast ownership and operation;

     WHEREAS,  during  the  term of  this  Agreement,  Owner  wishes  to  retain
Programmer to provide programming and related services for the Stations,  all in
conformity with Station policies and procedures, FCC rules and policies for time
brokerage arrangements, and the provisions hereof;

     WHEREAS,   Programmer   agrees  to  use  the  Stations  to  broadcast  such
programming of its selection that is in conformity  with all rules,  regulations
and policies of the FCC, subject to Owner's full authority to manage and control
the operation of the Stations;

     WHEREAS,  Programmer  and Owner agree to cooperate  to make this  Agreement

<PAGE>

                                   AGREEMENT:

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above recitals, and mutual promises
and covenants contained herein, the parties intending to be legally bound, agree
as follows:

     SECTION 1 USE OF STATION AIR TIME.

     1.1 Scope. During the term of this Agreement, Owner shall make available to
Programmer  broadcast  time on the  Stations  as set  forth  in this  Agreement.
Programmer  shall  deliver such  programming,  at its expense,  to the Stations'
transmitters  or other  authorized  remote control  points  designated by Owner.
Programmer  shall provide such  programming of Programmer's  selection  complete
with commercial  matter,  news, public service  announcements and other suitable
programming to the Stations for at least one hundred  sixty-six  (166) hours per
week. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,  Owner agrees to broadcast
such programming in its entirety,  including commercials at the times specified,
on the facilities of the Stations without interruption, deletion, or addition of
any kind.  Owner may use such time as Owner may  require up to two (2) hours per
week, for the broadcast of its own regularly-scheduled news, public affairs, and
other nonentertainment  programming on the Stations, to be scheduled at mutually
agreeable times. Owner may elect to set aside additional air time (up to two (2)
hours per week) (the "Additional  Time") to be scheduled at a mutually agreeable
time, for the broadcast of specific  non-entertainment  programming on issues of
importance to the local community.  Owner shall provide  Programmer with as much
notice as possible,  but in no event less than three (3) weeks'  notice,  of its
intention to set aside such Additional Time. All program time not reserved by or
designated for Owner shall be available for use by Programmer. Owner agrees that
Programmer may sell, or engage a third party to sell, commercial time during the
programming provided by Programmer to the Stations for Programmer's account.

     1.2 Term.  This  Agreement  shall  commence on the date of the  Non-License
Transfer as contemplated in the Purchase  Agreement (the "Effective  Date"), and
end on the Closing Date (the "Term"),  unless terminated earlier pursuant to any
of the provisions of Section 5 hereof.

     SECTION 2 STATION OPERATIONS.

     2.1 Owner Control Over Station Operations.

     (a)  Owner  shall  retain  full  authority,  power  and  control  over  the
management   and  operations  of  the  Stations   during  the  Term,   including
specifically,  control  over the  personnel,  programming  and  finances  of the
Stations.

     (b)  Subject  to  Owner's  full  authority,  power  and  control  over  the
management  and  operations  of  the  Stations,  Programmer  agrees  to  provide
programming and related  services to the Stations.  Such related  services shall
include: (i) the sale of advertising time on the Stations;  (ii) coordination of
traffic and billing functions; (iii) maintenance,  repair and replacement of the
Stations'  transmitting or studio equipment and the other Assets, and (iv) other
administrative  or  operational  functions as Owner and Programmer may agree to,
consistent with


                                      -2-

<PAGE>

FCC rules and  regulations  relating to time  brokerage  agreements.  Programmer
shall  provide and perform  Programmer's  obligations  hereunder,  including all
related services,  diligently and in a manner consistent with broadcast industry
practices.

     (c) When on the Owner's  premises,  all  employees  of  Programmer  used to
provide  Programmer's  programming  or other  services to the Stations  shall be
subject to the overall supervision of Owner's management personnel.

     2.2 Station Expenses.  During the Term, Programmer shall be responsible for
and shall  reimburse  Owner  within  fifteen  (15) days  following  receipt of a
request for reimbursement by Owner for any direct  out-of-pocket  costs incurred
by Owner as necessary to preserve and maintain the FCC Licenses and other Assets
of the Stations then owned by Owner (including the expenses of Owner as a result
of Section 2.1(c) above).

     2.3 Consideration.

     (a) Monthly Fee. As consideration for the air time made available hereunder
and the other agreements of the parties made hereunder, Programmer agrees to pay
Owner the  payments  set forth in  Attachment  2.3 hereto.  Notwithstanding  any
provision of this  Agreement to the  contrary,  in the event of a preemption  by
Owner of  Programmer's  programming  under  Sections  1.1 (with  respect  to the
Additional Time only), 3.2, 4.1 or 4.2 of this Agreement, the Monthly Payment as
defined in Attachment  2.3 shall be reduced by an amount equal to (a) the amount
of the Monthly  Payment  multiplied  by (b) a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of minutes of Programmer's programming preempted by Owner during such
month and the denominator of which is one hundred sixty-six (166).

     (b) Expense Reimbursement. On the fifteenth (15th) day of each month during
the Term, Programmer shall reimburse Owner for the salaries of the two employees
retained by Owner at each Station.

     SECTION 3 STATION PUBLIC INTEREST OBLIGATIONS.

     3.1  Owner  Authority.   Owner  shall  be  responsible  for  the  Stations'
compliance with all applicable  provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended  (the  "Act"),  the rules,  regulations  and policies of the FCC and all
other  applicable  laws.  Programmer shall cooperate with Owner, at Programmer's
expense,  in taking such actions as Owner may reasonably request to assist Owner
in maintaining the Stations'  compliance  with the Act,  rules,  regulations and
policies of the FCC and all other  applicable  laws.  Notwithstanding  any other
provision  of this  Agreement,  Programmer  recognizes  that  Owner has  certain
obligations  to operate the  Stations in the public  interest,  and to broadcast
programming  to meet the needs and  interests of the  Stations'  communities  of
license  and  service  area.  From time to time  Owner  shall  air,  or if Owner
requests, Programmer shall air, programming on issues of importance to the local
community.  Nothing in this Agreement  shall abrogate or limit the  unrestricted
authority of Owner to discharge Owner's  obligations to the public and to comply
with the Act and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, and Owner shall
have no liability or obligation to Programmer,  for


                                      -3-

<PAGE>

taking any action that Owner deems  necessary or  appropriate  to discharge such
obligations or comply with such laws, rules, regulations or policies.

     3.2 Additional Owner Obligations.  Although both Owner and Programmer shall
cooperate in the broadcast of emergency  information  over the  Stations,  Owner
shall retain the right,  without any liability or obligation to  Programmer,  to
interrupt  Programmer's  programming in case of an emergency or for  programming
which,  in the good faith  judgment  of Owner,  is of greater  local or national
public  importance.  In all such cases,  Owner  shall use  Owner's  commercially
reasonable  efforts  to  provide  Programmer  notice  of  Owner's  intention  to
interrupt Programmer's programming.  Owner shall coordinate with Programmer each
Station's hourly station  identification and any other announcements required to
be aired by FCC rules or  regulations.  Owner shall (a) continue to maintain and
staff a main studio in  compliance  with the rules of the FCC, (b) maintain each
Station's  local  public  inspection  file within each  Station's  community  of
license or at each  Station's  main  studio,  and (c)  prepare and place in such
inspection  file in a timely manner all material  required by Section 73.3526 of
the FCC's Rules,  including without  limitation each Station's  quarterly issues
and program  lists and FCC Form 398.  Programmer  shall,  upon request by Owner,
promptly provide Owner with such information  concerning  Programmer's  programs
and  advertising  as is  necessary to assist  Owner in the  preparation  of such
information or to enable Owner to verify  independently the Stations' compliance
with any other laws, rules,  regulations or policies applicable to the Stations'
operation.  Owner shall also maintain the station  logs,  receive and respond to
telephone  inquiries,  and control and oversee any remote  control point for the
Stations.

     SECTION 4 STATION PROGRAMMING & OPERATIONAL POLICIES.

     4.1 Broadcast Station  Programming  Policy  Statement.  Owner has adopted a
Broadcast Station Programming Policy Statement (the "Policy Statement"),  a copy
of which appears as Attachment  4.1 hereto and which may be amended from time to
time in order to comply with the rules and  regulations of the FCC by Owner upon
written notice to Programmer.  Programmer  agrees and covenants to comply in all
material respects with the Policy  Statement,  with all rules and regulations of
the FCC, and with all changes  subsequently made by Owner or the FCC. Programmer
shall furnish or cause to be furnished  the artistic  personnel and material for
the programs as provided by this  Agreement  and all programs  shall be prepared
and presented in conformity with the rules,  regulations and policies of the FCC
and with the Policy Statement. All advertising spots and promotional material or
announcements  shall  comply  with  all  applicable  federal,  state  and  local
regulations  and  policies  and the Policy  Statement,  and shall be produced in
accordance with quality standards established by Programmer. If Owner determines
that a program,  commercial  announcement  or promotional  material  supplied by
Programmer is for any reason, in Owner's reasonable  discretion,  unsatisfactory
or  unsuitable or contrary to the public  interest,  or does not comply with the
Policy  Statement  Owner may, upon written  notice to Programmer  (to the extent
time permits such notice), and without any liability or obligation to Programmer
suspend or cancel such program,  commercial announcement or promotional material
and substitute  its own  programming  or, if Owner  requests,  Programmer  shall
provide  promptly  suitable  programming,   commercial   announcement  or  other
announcement or promotional material.

     4.2 Owner  Control of Station  Programming.  Notwithstanding  any  contrary
provision  contained in this Agreement,  and consistent with Owner's obligations
pursuant to the Act and the rules and  regulations  of the FCC, Owner shall have
the right,  without any  liability or  obligation  to  Programmer  to delete any
material  contained  in  any  programming  or  commercial  matter  furnished  by
Programmer for broadcast  over the Stations that Owner  determines is unsuitable
for broadcast or the broadcast of which Owner  believes would be contrary to the
public interest. Owner shall have the right, without any liability or obligation
to  Programmer  to broadcast  Owner's own  programming  in place of such deleted
material.

     4.3 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

     4.4  Political  Advertising.  Owner shall  oversee and shall take  ultimate
responsibility  for the Stations'  compliance  with the  political  broadcasting
rules of the FCC and Sections 312 and 315 of the Act,  including but not limited
to, the  provision of equal  opportunities,  compliance  with lowest unit charge
requirements,  and the  provision  of  reasonable  access to  federal  political
candidates.  Programmer shall cooperate with Owner, at Programmer's  expense, to
assist  Owner in complying  with the  political  broadcasting  rules of the FCC.
Programmer shall supply such  information  promptly to Owner as may be necessary
to comply with the lowest unit charge and other applicable  political  broadcast
requirements  of federal  law.  To the  extent  that Owner  deems  necessary  or
appropriate,  Programmer shall release  advertising  availabilities  to Owner to
permit  Owner to comply  with the  political  broadcasting  rules of the FCC and
Sections  312 and 315 of the Act.  Programmer  shall be entitled to all revenues
received by Owner for such advertising.


                                      -5-

<PAGE>

     4.5 Advertising of Credit Terms.  To the extent  prohibited by the rules of
the Federal Trade Commission,  no advertising of credit terms shall be made over
broadcast  material supplied  hereunder by Programmer beyond mention of the fact
that credit terms are available.

     4.6 Payola/Plugola. In order to enable Owner to fulfill Owner's obligations
under Section 317 of the Act, Programmer,  in compliance with Section 507 of the
Act,  will, in advance of any scheduled  broadcast by the Stations,  disclose to
Owner  any  information  of which  Programmer  has  knowledge  or which has been
disclosed  to  Programmer  as  to  any  money,   service,   or  other   valuable
consideration  that any person has paid or accepted,  or has agreed to pay or to
accept,  for  the  inclusion  of any  matter  as a part  of the  programming  or
commercial matter to be supplied to Owner pursuant to this Agreement. Programmer
will  cooperate  with Owner,  at  Programmer's  expense,  as necessary to ensure
compliance  with this  provision.  Commercial  matter with  obvious  sponsorship
identifications  shall not require  disclosure in addition to that  contained in
the commercial copy.

     4.7 Programmer  Compliance  with Copyright Act.  Programmer  represents and
warrants that  Programmer  will have full authority to broadcast the programming
on the Stations;  that Programmer  shall not broadcast any material in violation
of the  Copyright  Act;  and the  performing  rights to all music  contained  in
broadcast  material supplied hereunder by Programmer are licensed by BMI, ASCAP,
or SESAC, are in the public domain, are controlled by Programmer, or are cleared
at the source by Programmer.

     SECTION 5 TERMINATION.

     5.1 Termination by Programmer.

     Unless terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.2, this Agreement
may be terminated by Programmer by written notice to Owner, if Programmer is not
then in material default or breach hereof,  upon the occurrence of either of the
following:

     (a)  five (5)  days  following  the  date of  termination  of the  Purchase
Agreement; or

     (b) Owner is in  material  breach of  Owner's  representations  or  Owner's
material obligations hereunder or under the Purchase Agreement and has failed to
cure such breach within thirty (30) days of written notice from Programmer.

     5.2 Termination by Owner.  Unless terminated  pursuant to the provisions of
Section 1.2, this  Agreement  may be  terminated  by Owner by written  notice to
Programmer,  if Owner is not then in material default or breach hereof, upon the
occurrence of any of the following:

     (a)  five (5)  days  following  the  date of  termination  of the  Purchase
Agreement; or


                                      -6-

<PAGE>

     (b) Programmer is in material  breach of  Programmer's  representations  or
Programmer's  material obligations hereunder or under the Purchase Agreement and
has failed to cure such breach within thirty (30) days of notice from Owner.

     5.3 Termination.  If not otherwise earlier terminated,  this Agreement will
terminate, upon the first to occur of any of the following:

     (a) this  Agreement is declared  invalid or illegal in whole or substantial
part by an order or decree  of an  administrative  agency or court of  competent
jurisdiction  and such order or decree has become final and no longer subject to
further  administrative or judicial review,  unless as a result of actions taken
by Programmer in violation of the terms hereof;

     (b) there has been a material  change in FCC rules or  policies  that would
cause this Agreement to be in violation thereof and such change is in effect and
not the subject of an appeal or further administrative review,  provided that in
such event the parties shall first  negotiate in good faith and attempt to agree
on an  amendment to this  Agreement  that will provide the parties with a valid,
binding and enforceable  agreement that conforms to the new FCC rules,  policies
or precedent; or

     (c) the mutual, written consent of both parties.

     5.4   Severability.   The  parties  hereto  intend  that  the  transactions
contemplated  hereunder  comply in all respects with the Act and all  applicable
rules, regulations,  and policies of the FCC. If any provision of this Agreement
shall be declared void, illegal,  or invalid by any governmental  authority with
jurisdiction thereof, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and  effect  without  such  offending   provision  so  long  as  such  remainder
substantially   reflects  the  original  agreement  of  the  parties  hereunder.
Furthermore,  in such event, the parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement promptly on lawful substitute  provisions in place of
said  offending  provision  so as to  effectuate  more  closely  their intent as
expressed hereunder. If any governmental authority grants to any other entity or
individual  rights which are not contained in this  Agreement,  then the parties
shall use their  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to amend this  Agreement  to
provide the parties hereto such lawful  provisions which comport with any rules,
regulations and policies adopted after the date of this Agreement.

     5.5 Force Majeure.  Any failure or impairment of the Assets or any delay or
interruption  in the  broadcast of  programs,  or failure at any time to furnish
facilities, in whole or in part, for broadcast, due to Acts of God, restrictions
by any governmental authority, civil riot, floods or any other similar cause not
reasonably  within the control of Owner,  shall not  constitute a breach of this
Agreement  and Owner  will not be  liable to  Programmer  for any  liability  or
obligation with respect thereto.

     5.6 Insurance; Risk of Loss.

     (a) From the date hereof through the end of the Term,  Owner shall maintain
with  reputable  insurance  companies   reasonably   acceptable  to  Programmer,
commercially  reasonable  amounts of insurance as is  conventionally  carried by
broadcasters operating television


                                      -7-

<PAGE>


stations in the area comparable to those of the Stations,  including replacement
cost insurance and general liability  insurance,  with respect to the Assets and
shall cause Programmer to be named as an additional insured on Owner's policies.
The risk of any loss, damage, impairment,  confiscation,  or condemnation of any
equipment or other personal property owned and used by Owner in the business and
operations of the Stations ("Risk of Loss") shall be borne by Owner at all times
throughout  the Term,  to the extent  of,  but solely to the extent of,  Owner's
receipt of  insurance  proceeds  in respect  thereof and in no event shall Owner
have any  liability or  obligation  to  Programmer  in respect of any such loss,
damage, impairment,  confiscation or condemnation.  The Risk of Loss beyond that
specifically  borne by the Owner in accordance  with the  immediately  preceding
sentence  shall  be borne by  Programmer.  Owner  shall  use  such  proceeds  of
insurance  to  repair or  replace  any such  equipment  or such  other  personal
property of Owner to the extent of such proceeds. At Owner's request and subject
to  Owner's  supervision  and  direction,  Programmer  shall  effect in a timely
fashion any repairs to or  replacement  of any of Owner's  damaged  equipment or
property.

     (b) From the date  hereof  through  the end of the Term,  Programmer  shall
maintain with  reputable  insurance  companies  reasonably  acceptable to Owner,
insurance  in such  amounts  and  with  respect  to such  risks,  as  reasonably
requested by Owner, including broadcast liability insurance,  naming Owner as an
additional insured, and general comprehensive insurance, also naming Owner as an
additional insured, each with a commercially reasonable amount of coverage as is
conventionally carried by broadcasters operating television stations in the area
comparable to those of the Stations.  The risk of any loss, damage,  impairment,
confiscation,  or condemnation of any equipment or other personal property owned
or leased and used by Programmer in the performance of its obligations hereunder
shall be borne by Programmer at all times throughout the Term.

     SECTION 6 INDEMNIFICATION.

     6.1  Indemnification  by Programmer.  Programmer  shall  indemnify and hold
harmless Owner from and against any and all claims, losses, costs,  liabilities,
damages, expenses,  including any FCC fines or forfeitures (including reasonable
legal fees and other expenses  incidental  thereto),  of every kind,  nature and
description  (collectively  "Damages")  arising or resulting from or relating to
(a)  Programmer's  breach of any  representation,  covenant,  agreement or other
obligation of Programmer  contained in this  Agreement,  (b) any action taken by
Programmer or Programmer's employees and agents with respect to the Stations, or
any  failure by  Programmer  or  Programmer's  employees  and agents to take any
action with respect to the  Stations,  including,  without  limitation,  Damages
relating to violations of the Act, or any rule, regulation or policy of the FCC,
slander,  defamation  or  other  claims  relating  to  programming  provided  by
Programmer  or  Programmer's  broadcast  and  sale  of  advertising  time on the
Stations,  or (c) the  business or  operations  of the  Stations  by  Programmer
(except where Damages are caused by Owner's  negligence,  recklessness,  willful
misconduct,  or a breach of Owner's  representations  or obligations  under this
Agreement or the Purchase Agreement) from and after the date of this Agreement.


                                      -8-

<PAGE>


     6.2  Indemnification  by Owner.  Owner shall  indemnify  and hold  harmless
Programmer  from and against any and all Damages  arising or  resulting  from or
relating to (a) Owner's  breach of any  representation,  covenant,  agreement or
other  obligation of Owner contained in this Agreement,  (b) any action taken by
Owner or Owner's  employees  and agents  with  respect to the  Stations,  or any
failure by Owner or Owner's employees and agents to take any action with respect
to the Stations,  including, without limitation,  Damages relating to violations
of the Act, or any rule, regulation or policy of the FCC, slander, defamation or
other claims relating to programming  provided by Owner or Owner's broadcast and
sale of advertising  time on the Stations,  or (c) the business or operations of
the  Stations  by  Owner  (except  where  Damages  are  caused  by  Programmer's
negligence,  recklessness,  willful  misconduct,  or a  breach  of  Programmer's
representations  or obligations under this Agreement or the Purchase  Agreement)
from and after the date of this Agreement.

     6.3  Indemnification  Procedure.  Neither  Owner  nor  Programmer  shall be
entitled to  indemnification  pursuant to this Section 6.3 unless (a) such claim
for  indemnification  is  asserted  in  writing  delivered  to the other  party,
together  with a statement as to the factual  basis for the claim and the amount
of the claim and (b) such claim,  in the aggregate with all other claims made by
such party under this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement,  exceeds Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($200,000),  and then only to the extent of the excess over the
amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000);  provided,  however, that the
aggregate  dollar  amount  of  claims  under  this  Agreement  and the  Purchase
Agreement shall not exceed Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000).  The party making
the  claim  (the  "Claimant")  shall  make  available  to the other  party  (the
"Indemnitor")  the information  relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate  the
claim. The Indemnitor under this Section 6.3 shall have the right to conduct and
control  through  counsel of such  Indemnitor's  own choosing the defense of any
third party claim,  action or suit (and the Claimant shall  cooperate fully with
the  Indemnitor),  but the Claimant  may, at its  election,  participate  in the
defense of any such claim, action or suit at its sole cost and expense; provided
that,  if the  Indemnitor  shall fail to defend any such claim,  action or suit,
then the Claimant  may defend  through  counsel of its own choosing  such claim,
action or suit,  and (so long as it gives the  Indemnitor  at least fifteen (15)
days'  notice of the terms of the  proposed  settlement  thereof and permits the
Indemnitor to then undertake the defense  thereof) settle such claim,  action or
suit, and to recover from the Indemnitor the amount of such settlement or of any
judgment and the costs and expenses of such defense.  The  Indemnitor  shall not
compromise  or settle any third party  claim,  action or suit  without the prior
written consent of the Claimant, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

     6.4  Arbitration.  To  the  fullest  extent  not  prohibited  by  law,  any
controversy,  claim or dispute  arising out of or  relating  to this  Agreement,
including the  determination  of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to
arbitrate,  shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance with
the rules then in effect of the American  Arbitration  Association  ("AAA"),  as
modified  or  supplemented  under  this  section,  and  subject  to the  Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.  ss.ss. 1-16. The decision of the arbitrators shall be
final and  binding  provided  that,  where a remedy  for  breach  is  prescribed
hereunder or limitations on remedies are prescribed,  the  arbitrators  shall be
bound  by such  restrictions,  and  judgment  upon  the  award  rendered  by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.


                                      -9-

<PAGE>

     If any series of claims  arising  out of the same or  related  transactions
shall involve  claims which are  arbitrable  under the  preceding  paragraph and
claims which are not, the  arbitrable  claims shall first be finally  determined
before suit may be  instituted  upon the others and the  parties  will take such
action as may be  necessary  to toll any  statutes of  limitations,  or defenses
based upon the passage of time, that are applicable to such nonarbitrable claims
during the period in which the arbitrable  claims are being  determined.  In the
event of any controversy,  claim or dispute that is subject to arbitration under
this  Section  6.4,  any party  thereto may  commence  arbitration  hereunder by
delivering notice to the other party or parties thereto; provided, in advance of
the commencement of any arbitration each of the parties agrees to participate in
a non-binding mediation effort (not to exceed thirty (30) days) in an attempt to
resolve such controversy,  claim or dispute. The arbitration panel shall consist
of three (3) arbitrators,  appointed in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this  paragraph.  Within ten (10)  business days of delivery of the notice of
commencement  of  arbitration  referred to above,  Owner,  on the one hand,  and
Programmer,  on the other hand,  shall each appoint one arbitrator,  and the two
arbitrators  so  appointed   shall  within  ten  (10)  business  days  of  their
appointment  mutually agree upon and appoint one additional  arbitrator  (or, if
such  arbitrators  cannot  agree on an  additional  arbitrator,  the  additional
arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA as provided under its rules); provided,
that  persons  eligible  to be  selected  as  arbitrators  shall be  limited  to
attorneys  at law who (a) are on the AAA's Large,  Complex Case Panel,  (b) have
practiced  law for at least  fifteen (15) years as an attorney  specializing  in
either  general  commercial  litigation  or  general  corporate  and  commercial
matters, and (c) are experienced in matters involving the broadcasting industry.

     The  arbitration  hearing  shall  be held in  Washington,  D.C.  and  shall
commence no later than thirty (30)  business  days after the  completion  of the
selection of the  arbitrators.  Consistent with the intent of the parties hereto
that the  arbitration  be conducted as  expeditiously  as possible,  the parties
agree that (a) discovery  shall be limited to the  production of such  documents
and the taking of such  depositions as the arbitrators  determine are reasonably
necessary to the  resolution  of the  controversy,  claim or dispute and (b) the
arbitrators  shall  limit  the  presentation  of  evidence  by each side in such
arbitration  to not more than ten (10) full days'  (equivalent  thereof) or such
shorter period as the  arbitrators  shall  determine to be necessary in order to
resolve the controversy,  claim or dispute.  The arbitrators shall be instructed
to  render  a  decision  within  ten  (10)  business  days of the  close  of the
arbitration  hearing.  If arbitration has not been completed  within ninety (90)
days of the commencement of such  arbitration,  any party to the arbitration may
initiate  litigation upon ten (10) days' written notice to the other party(ies);
provided,  however,  that if one party has requested the other to participate in
an arbitration and the other has failed to participate, the requesting party may
initiate  litigation  before the expiration of such ninety (90) day period;  and
provided further,  that if any party to the arbitration fails to meet any of the
time  limits  set forth in this  Section  6.4 or set by the  arbitrators  in the
arbitration,  any other party may provide ten (10) days'  written  notice of its
intent to institute litigation with respect to the controversy, claim or dispute
without the need to continue or complete the  arbitration  and without  awaiting
the expiration of such ninety (90) day period.  The parties hereto further agree
that if any of the rules of the AAA are  contrary to or in conflict  with any of
the time periods provided for hereunder, or with any other aspect of the matters
set forth in this  Section  6.4,  that


                                      -10-

<PAGE>

such rules shall be modified in respects necessary to accord with the provisions
of this Section 6.4 (and the arbitrators shall be so instructed by the parties).

     The  arbitrators  shall base their  decision on the terms of this Agreement
and  applicable  law and judicial  precedent in the State of New York, and shall
render their decision in writing and include in such decision a statement of the
findings of fact and  conclusions of law upon which the decision is based.  Each
party  agrees  to  cooperate  fully  with  the   arbitrator(s)  to  resolve  any
controversy,  claim, or dispute. The arbitrators shall not be empowered to award
punitive damages or damages in excess of actual damages.

     6.5 Damages; Specific Performance.

     (a) In the  event of a  material  breach  by Owner of  Owner's  obligations
hereunder,  Programmer shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against Owner.
The parties recognize, however, that given the unique nature of the Stations and
this  Agreement,  monetary  damages  alone will not be  adequate  to  compensate
Programmer  for any injury  resulting  from  Owner's  breach.  Programmer  shall
therefore  be  entitled,  as an  alternative  to the  right to seek and  collect
monetary damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement.

     (b) In the event of a  material  breach by  Programmer  of its  obligations
hereunder, Owner shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against Programmer.

     SECTION 7 REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS.

     7.1 Representations,  Warranties, and Covenants of Owner. Owner represents,
warrants, and covenants that:

     (a) Owner is legally  qualified,  empowered,  and  authorized to enter into
this Agreement,  and that the execution,  delivery and performance  hereof shall
not  constitute  a breach  or  violation  of any  agreement,  contract  or other
obligation to which Owner is subject or by which Owner is bound.

     (b) Owner is now,  and for so long as this  Agreement  shall be in  effect,
will be the holder of the FCC Licenses necessary for the operation of WICS, WICD
and KGAN as then being operated.

     (c)  Owner  does  not  know  of any  current  or  prospective  governmental
investigation having a material adverse effect on the Stations, their properties
or business.

     (d) As of this date, Owner does not know of any facts which would cause the
Commission to refuse to renew the FCC Licenses.

     (e) Owner shall not take any action or omit to take any action  which would
have a materially  adverse impact upon Owner,  the Assets,  the Stations or upon
Owner's ability to perform this Agreement.


                                      -11-

<PAGE>

     (f) This Agreement  constitutes the legal,  valid and binding obligation of
Owner,  enforceable in accordance with its terms,  except to the extent that the
enforcement   thereof   may   be   limited   by  (i)   bankruptcy,   insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium,  or similar  law  affecting  creditors'  rights and
remedies generally, and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

     7.2  Representations,  Warranties and Covenants of  Programmer.  Programmer
represents, warrants, and covenants that:

     (a)  Programmer is legally  qualified,  empowered,  and authorized to enter
into this Agreement,  and that the execution,  delivery and  performance  hereof
shall not constitute a breach or violation of any  agreement,  contract or other
obligation to which Programmer is subject or by which Programmer is bound.

     (b) This Agreement  constitutes the legal,  valid and binding obligation of
Programmer,  enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
the  enforcement   thereof  may  be  limited  by  (i)  bankruptcy,   insolvency,
reorganizations,  moratorium  or similar laws  affecting  creditors'  rights and
remedies generally, and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

     SECTION 8: MISCELLANEOUS.

     8.1  Assignment.  This Agreement  shall not be assigned by any party hereto
without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld,  except  that  Programmer  may  assign  its  rights  and
interests  hereunder to any reputable  broadcasting  entity  provided,  that (a)
Programmer  gives  Owner  written  notice  of  any  such  assignment;  (b)  such
assignment shall not relieve Programmer of any of its obligations or liabilities
hereunder; and (c) such assignment would not violate any applicable laws, rules,
regulations  or  policies  of  any  applicable  governmental  authority.  It  is
understood  and agreed that nothing  herein shall be deemed to expand the rights
granted  hereunder  to  any  permitted  assignee,   which  rights  shall  be  in
combination  with,  and not in  addition  to,  the  rights of  Programmer.  This
Agreement  shall be  binding  on the  parties'  respective  heirs and  permitted
assigns.

     8.2 Entire  Agreement;  Amendments.  This Agreement  constitutes the entire
agreement  between the parties  hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and,  except  for the  Purchase  Agreement,  and  documents  delivered  pursuant
thereto,  supersedes any and all prior agreements,  broadcasting commitments, or
any other  understandings  between  Programmer  and Owner  with  respect to such
subject matter. No provision of this Agreement shall be changed or modified, nor
shall this  Agreement be discharged in whole or in part,  except by an agreement
in  writing  signed by the  party  against  whom the  change,  modification,  or
discharge  is claimed or sought to be  enforced,  nor shall any waiver of any of
the  conditions or provisions of this  Agreement be effective and binding unless
such waiver shall be in writing and signed by the party  against whom the waiver
is asserted, and no waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
