     Other  matters set forth in this  report,  including  the risk  factors set

may also cause  actual  results in the  future to differ  materially  from those

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

     We are a diversified broadcasting company that owns or provides programming
services  pursuant  to local  marketing  agreements  (LMAs)  to more  television
stations than any other commercial  broadcasting  group in the United States. We
currently  own,  or  provide  programming  services  pursuant  to  LMAs  to,  61
television stations and 11 radio stations.  During 1999, we sold the majority of
our radio  stations and we have entered into  agreements  to sell,  or intend to
sell in the future,  our remaining  radio stations.  In addition,  we own equity
interests in three Internet-related companies.

     The 61  television  stations  that we own or program  pursuant  to LMAs are
located in 40 geographically diverse markets, with 33 of the stations in the top
47  television  designated  market  areas  (DMAs)  in  the  United  States.  Our
television  station  group is diverse in network  affiliation  with 20  stations
affiliated  with Fox  Broadcasting  Company  (Fox),  18 with  The WB  Television
Network (WB), eight with United Paramount  Television Network Partnership (UPN),
seven with ABC,  four with NBC and three with CBS.  One  station  operates as an
independent.

     Through our wholly owned  subsidiary,  Sinclair  Ventures,  Inc., we own or
have options to acquire equity  interests in three  Internet-related  companies,
namely  NetFanatics,  Inc., a web developer  offering  e-business  solutions and
applications;  Synergy Brands,  Inc., an incubator of on-line  consumer  product
companies; and BeautyBuys.com, Inc., an e-tailer of brand name health and beauty
products and also a majority-owned subsidiary of Synergy Brands.

     In July  1999,  we  entered  into an  agreement  to sell 46 of our 52 radio
stations  in nine of our ten  markets  to  Entercom  Communications  Corporation
(Entercom).  In December 1999, we completed the sale of 41 of our radio stations
in eight  markets  to  Entercom.  The sale of the  remaining  five  stations  is
expected  to close in the third  quarter of 2000.  We are  currently  engaged in
litigation  relating to the sale of the six radio  properties and one television
station in the St. Louis market.

     We underwent rapid and significant growth from 1991 to 1999. Since 1991, we
have  increased the number of stations we own or provide  services to from three
television stations to 61 television stations.  From 1991 to 1999, net broadcast
revenues and  Adjusted  EBITDA [as defined in Item 6,  Statement  of  Operations
Data, note (g)],  increased from $39.7 million to $670.3 million, and from $15.5
million to $313.3 million, respectively.

                                       2

<PAGE>

     During 1999, we modified our business strategy by:

     o    departing from our historical  television  broadcast asset acquisition
          strategy,

     o    refocusing on the consolidation of operations of television  broadcast
          assets acquired in previous years by reinvesting in these businesses,

     o    developing  our Internet  division as it  complements  our  television
          broadcast platform, and

     o    divesting our radio broadcast division.

     We  believe  that  our new  business  strategy  will  allow  us to focus on
maximizing  the  potential of the  broadcast  assets we currently  operate while
exploring Internet opportunities provided by our platform.

     We are a Maryland  corporation  formed in 1986.  Our principal  offices are
located at 10706  Beaver Dam Road,  Cockeysville,  MD 21030,  and our  telephone
number is (410) 568-1500.

OPERATING STRATEGY

     Our television operating strategy includes the following key elements:

ATTRACTING VIEWERSHIP

     We seek to  attract  viewership  and  expand  our  audience  share  through
selective, high-quality programming.

     Popular  Programming.  We seek to obtain,  at  attractive  prices,  popular
syndicated   programming  that  is   complementary  to  the  station's   network
affiliation.  We also believe that an important factor in attracting  viewership
to our stations is their  network  affiliations  with Fox, WB, ABC, CBS, NBC and
UPN. These  affiliations  enable us to attract  viewers by virtue of the quality
first-run  original  programming  provided by these  networks and the  networks'
promotion  of  such  programming.  We  focus  on  obtaining  popular  syndicated
programming for key programming  periods  (generally 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.) for
broadcast  on our  Fox,  WB and UPN  affiliates.  Examples  of this  programming
include  "Friends,"  "Frasier," "3rd Rock From the Sun," "The  Simpsons,"  "Drew
Carey"  and  "Seinfeld."  In  addition  to  network  programming,   our  network
affiliates broadcast news magazine, talk show, and game show programming such as
"Hard Copy," "Entertainment Tonight," "Regis and Kathie Lee," "Rosie O'Donnell,"
"Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy."

     Local News. We believe that the production and  broadcasting  of local news
is an important  link to the community  and an aid to the  station's  efforts to
expand its viewership. In addition, local news programming can provide access to
advertising  sources targeted  specifically to local news viewers.  We carefully
assess  the  anticipated  benefits  and costs of  producing  local news prior to
introduction at one of our stations because a significant  investment in capital
equipment  is  required  and  substantial  operating  expenses  are  incurred in
introducing,  developing  and  producing  local news  programming.  We currently
provide  local  news  programming  at 31 of the  television  stations  we own or
program located in 26 separate markets. The possible  introduction of local news
at our other stations is reviewed periodically and we have recently expanded our
news  programming  in some of the  markets in which we program a second  station
pursuant  to an LMA.  We can  produce  news  programming  in  these  markets  at
relatively low cost per hour of programming and the programming serves the local
community by providing  additional news outlets in these markets,  some of which
are  broadcast  at  different  times.  Our  policy is to  institute  local  news
programming  at a specific  station only if the expected  benefits of local news
programming at the station are believed to exceed the associated  costs after an
appropriate start-up period.

     Popular Sporting Events. Our WB and UPN affiliated and independent stations
generally face fewer  restrictions  on  broadcasting  live local sporting events
than do their competitors that are affiliates of Fox, ABC, NBC and CBS which are
subject to certain prohibitions  against preemptions of network programming.  We
have been able to acquire  the local  television  broadcast  rights for  certain
sporting events, including NBA basketball,  Major League Baseball, NFL football,
NHL hockey, ACC basketball,  Big Ten football and basketball,  and SEC football.
We seek to expand our sports  broadcasting  in DMAs as profitable  opportunities
arise. In addition,  our stations that are affiliated with FOX, ABC, NBC and CBS
broadcast certain Major League Baseball games, NFL football games and NHL hockey
games as well as other popular sporting events.

     Counter-Programming.  Our  programming  strategy  on our Fox,  WB,  UPN and
independent  stations also  includes  "counter-programming,"  which  consists of
broadcasting programs that are alternatives to the types of programs being shown
concurrently  on  competing  stations.  This  strategy  is  designed  to attract
additional  audience  share in  demographic  groups  not  served  by  concurrent
programming  on  competing  stations.  We believe  that  implementation  of this
strategy enables our stations to achieve  competitive  rankings in households in
the 18-49 and 25-54  demographics and to offer greater  diversity of programming
in each of our DMAs.

                                       5

<PAGE>

CONTROL OF OPERATING AND PROGRAMMING COSTS

     By employing a disciplined approach to managing programming acquisition and
other costs, we have been able to achieve  operating margins that we believe are
among the highest in the television broadcast industry.  We have sought and will
continue to seek to acquire  quality  programming  for prices at or below prices
paid in the past. As an owner or provider of programming services to 61 stations
in 40 DMAs reaching approximately 25% of U.S. television households,  we believe
that  we  are  able  to  negotiate   favorable  terms  for  the  acquisition  of
programming. Moreover, we emphasize control of each of our stations' programming
and  operating  costs  through   program-specific   profit  analysis,   detailed
budgeting,  tight control over staffing levels and detailed  long-term  planning
models.

ATTRACT AND RETAIN HIGH QUALITY MANAGEMENT

     We believe  that much of our  success is due to our  ability to attract and
retain  highly  skilled and  motivated  managers at both the corporate and local
station  levels.  A portion of the  compensation  provided to general  managers,
sales managers and other station  managers is based on their  achieving  certain
operating  results.  We also provide our  corporate  and station  managers  with
deferred compensation plans offering options to acquire class A common stock.

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT

     Each of our stations actively  participates in various community activities
and  offers  many  community  services.   Our  activities  include  broadcasting
programming  of local  interest  and  sponsorship  of community  and  charitable
events.  We also  encourage our station  employees to become  active  members of
their  communities  and to  promote  involvement  in  community  and  charitable
affairs.  We believe that active community  involvement by our stations provides
our stations with  increased  exposure in their  respective  DMAs and ultimately
increases viewership and advertising support.

LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENTS AND DUOPOLIES

     In the past,  we have  sought to  increase  our  revenues  and  improve our
margins by providing programming services pursuant to an LMA to a second station
in selected DMAs where we already own one station. In certain instances,  single
station  operators and stations operated by smaller ownership groups do not have
the  management  expertise or the  operating  efficiencies  available to us as a
multi-station   broadcaster.   In  addition  to  providing   additional  revenue
opportunities,   we  believe  that  these  arrangements  assist  stations  whose
operations  may have been  marginally  profitable  to  continue  to air  popular
programming and contribute to diversity of programming in their respective DMAs.
As a result of the FCC's  recent  revision  of its  duopoly  rules to permit the
ownership of up to two television stations in a market in certain instances,  we
have  entered  into  agreements  to  acquire  several   stations  we  have  been
programming  pursuant to LMA's in markets  where  duopolies are permitted by the
FCC's rules.

     We also enter into LMA  arrangements  in  connection  with a station  whose
acquisition  by us is pending  FCC  approval.  In these  transactions,  we first
obtain an option to acquire the station  assets  essential  for  broadcasting  a
television or radio signal in compliance with regulatory  guidelines,  generally
consisting  of the  FCC  license,  transmitter,  transmission  lines,  technical
equipment,  call letters and  trademarks,  and certain  furniture,  fixtures and
equipment  (the  License  Assets)  and then  acquire the  remaining  assets (the
Non-License Assets) at the time we enter into the option.  Following acquisition
of the  Non-License  Assets,  the  License  Assets  continue  to be owned by the
owner-operator and holder of the FCC license,  which enters into an LMA with us.
After FCC approval for  transfer of the License  Assets is obtained,  we acquire
the License Assets and the LMA arrangement is terminated.

ESTABLISHING DUOPOLIES

     We believe that we can attain  significant  growth in  operating  cash flow
through the  utilization  of duopolies.  By expanding our presence in certain of
our  markets in which we already own a station,  we can improve our  competitive
position with respect to a demographic sector. In addition, by programming

                                       6

<PAGE>

two  stations,  we are  able  to  realize  significant  economies  of  scale  in
marketing,  programming,  overhead and capital expenditures. Upon the completion
of all pending  acquisitions,  we will own duopolies in 12 markets and operate a
second station  pursuant to an LMA in eight markets.  We currently are permitted
under FCC  guidelines  to establish  new  duopolies in the  Minneapolis,  Tampa,
Indianapolis and Sacramento markets, if suitable  acquisitions can be identified
and negotiated under acceptable terms.

INNOVATIVE LOCAL SALES AND MARKETING

     We recognize that the national  market for  advertising has softened due to
increased competition from other forms of media, such as cable and the Internet.
We believe that we can ultimately grow faster by concentrating our sales efforts
on enhancing  local customer  relationships  for the  long-term.  Our goal is to
shift our  revenue  mix so that 75% of our time  sales are  derived in the local
markets by 2006.  For 1999,  54% of time sales were local.  Increasing our local
market penetration  requires increasing the number of account executives calling
on customers.  We believe that we need to add one to two additional salespersons
at  each  station,   approximately  100  new  account  executives  company-wide.
Currently,  we have filled over half those  positions.  Achieving  our goal also
requires  training and  providing a forum to exchange  best  practices.  For our
sales  managers,  we have added  programs to facilitate  cross-pollinization  of
ideas.  We are also  providing  organizational  training  programs  to our sales
managers and increasing  the number of sales  training  programs for our account
executives.  We believe our efforts will afford the stations the  resources  and
methodology  to attract  new  advertisers  and retain  them for the long term by
developing  a  sense  of  partnership  and  offering  new  marketing  ideas  and
promotional campaigns.

PROGRAMMING AND AFFILIATIONS

     We  continually  review  our  existing  programming  inventory  and seek to
purchase the most profitable and  cost-effective  syndicated  programs available
for each time period. In developing our selection of syndicated programming,  we
balance  the cost of  available  syndicated  programs  with their  potential  to
increase advertising revenue and the risk of their reduced popularity during the
term of the program  contract.  We seek to purchase  programs  with  contractual
periods that permit  programming  flexibility  and which  complement a station's
overall programming and counter-programming  strategy. Programs that can perform
successfully  in more than one time period are more  attractive  due to the long
lead time and multi-year commitments inherent in program purchasing.

     Sixty of the 61  television  stations  that we own or to  which we  provide
programming  services  currently operate as affiliates of Fox (20 stations),  WB
(18 stations),  ABC (seven stations), NBC (four stations), UPN (eight stations),
or CBS (three  stations).  The networks  produce and  distribute  programming in
exchange for each station's commitment to air the programming at specified times
and for  commercial  announcement  time  during the  programming.  In  addition,
networks other than Fox, WB and UPN pay each  affiliated  station a fee for each
network-sponsored program broadcast by the station.

     On  August  21,  1996,  we  entered  into an  agreement  with  Fox (the Fox
Agreement) which, among other things,  provides that the affiliation  agreements
between Fox and eight stations then owned or provided programming services by us
would be amended to have new five-year  terms  commencing on the date of the Fox
Agreement. The eight affected stations are: WPGH-TV in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
WBFF-TV in  Baltimore,  Maryland,  KABB-TV  in San  Antonio,  Texas,  WTTE-TV in
Columbus,  Ohio (which has been sold to a subsidiary of  Glencairn,  Ltd. and is
programmed by Sinclair pursuant to an LMA), WSMH-TV in Flint, Michigan,  KDSM-TV
in Des  Moines,  Iowa,  WDKY-TV in  Lexington,  Kentucky  and WYZZ-TV in Peoria,
Illinois. Fox has the option to extend the affiliation agreements for additional
five-year terms and must extend all of the affiliation  agreements if it extends
any, except that Fox may selectively renew affiliation agreements if any station
has breached its  affiliation  agreement.  The Fox Agreement also provides that,
during  the  term of the  affiliation  agreements,  we will  have  the  right to
purchase and operate as a Fox affiliate,  for fair market value, any station Fox
acquires in any of the  foregoing  markets if Fox  determines  to terminate  the
affiliation  agreement  with our  station in that market and operate the station
being acquired by Fox as a Fox affiliate.

     The Fox-affiliated stations acquired, to be acquired or being programmed by
us as a result of the Sullivan Acquisition and Max Media Acquisition continue to
carry Fox programming notwithstanding the fact that their affiliation agreements
have expired. Although we are not currently negotiating with Fox

                                       7

<PAGE>

to secure long term affiliation  agreements,  we do not believe that Fox has any
current  plans  to  terminate  the  affiliation  of any of  these  stations.  In
addition,  the  affiliation  agreements  of  three  ABC  stations  (WEAR-TV,  in
Pensacola,  Florida,  WCHS-TV,  in  Charleston,  West  Virginia and WXLV-TV,  in
Greensboro/Winston-Salem,  North  Carolina) have expired.  Sinclair and ABC have
discussed long term extensions of these agreements.

     On July 4, 1997, we entered into an agreement  with WB (the WB  Agreement),
pursuant to which we agreed to affiliate  certain of our stations  with WB for a
ten-year term expiring January 15, 2008. Under the terms of the WB Agreement, as
modified by the subsequent  letter  agreement  entered into between WB and us on
May 18,  1998,  WB agreed to pay us $64 million in  aggregate  amount in monthly
installments  during the first  eight  years  commencing  on January 16, 1998 in
consideration for entering into affiliation agreements with WB.

USE OF DIGITAL TELEVISION TECHNOLOGY

     We believe that television  broadcasting  may be enhanced  significantly by
the  development  and increased  availability  of digital  broadcasting  service
technology.  This  technology has the potential to permit us to provide  viewers
multiple  channels  of digital  television  over each of our  existing  standard
channels,  to provide certain programming in a high definition television format
(HDTV) and to deliver various forms of data, including data on the Internet,  to
home and business computers.  These additional  capabilities may provide us with
additional sources of revenue although we may incur significant additional costs
to do so.

     Implementation  of digital  television can improve the technical quality of
television signals received by viewers.  Under certain  circumstances,  however,
conversion to digital operation may reduce a station's  geographic coverage area
or result in some increased interference.

     Testing in Baltimore and Philadelphia,  using the FCC-mandated  8-vestigial
sideband  (8-VSB)  standard,  indicated that reception with simple  antennas was
highly  problematic.   These  reception  problems  prompted  us  to  explore  an
alternative  transmission  standard.  In June 1999,  we conducted a study of the
comparative ability of Coded Orthogonal Frequency Division  Multiplexing (COFDM)
and 8-VSB systems to deliver HDTV service to simple consumer grade antennas both
indoors and outdoors under real-world conditions.  This study demonstrated to us
that  while an 8-VSB  signal  cannot be  received  reliably  today with a simple
indoor antenna,  use of COFDM  technology  eliminates  interference  from moving
objects and permits robust reception with simple antennas even in highly dynamic
environments.  In October 1999, we filed a Petition for Rulemaking  with the FCC
urging it to permit  broadcasters  the flexibility to use COFDM modulation as an
alternative  to the current  8-VSB  standard.  Although  the FCC  dismissed  the
Petition,  it is considering the current status of the 8-VSB standard as part of
its  biennial  review  of the  digital  television  transition  process.  Absent
improvement in DTV receivers,  continued  reliance on the 8-VSB standard may not
allow us to provide the same reception  coverage with our digital  signals as we
can with our current analog signals.

     We cannot  predict what future  actions the FCC or Congress might take with
respect  to DTV,  nor  can we  predict  the  effect  of the  FCC's  present  DTV
implementation  plan or such  future  actions on our  business.  DTV  technology
currently is available in some of the top thirty viewing  markets.  A successful
transition from the current analog broadcast format to a digital format may take
many years.  There can be no assurance that our efforts to take advantage of the
new technology will be commercially successful.

INTERNET INVESTMENT STRATEGY

     We  believe  that  there  are  substantial   opportunities  for  television
broadcasters  to  work  with  Internet   related   businesses  to  increase  the
profitability  of  Internet-related  businesses  and to use the resources of the
Internet to enhance the offerings and value of broadcast stations.  Accordingly,
in 1999, we began to

                                       9

<PAGE>

invest in Internet  related  businesses.  Our strategy  includes  expanding this
involvement  and working with the businesses in which we invest to enhance their
value and to develop combined broadcast and Internet products.

     During  1999,  we  acquired  equity  interests  in  three  Internet-related
companies. Through our wholly owned subsidiary,  Sinclair Ventures, Inc., we own
or have options to acquire  equity  interests in the following  Internet-related
companies:  NetFanatics, Inc., a web developer offering e-business solutions and
applications;  Synergy Brands,  Inc., an incubator of on-line  consumer  product
companies; and BeautyBuys.com, Inc., an e-tailer of brand name health and beauty
products and also a majority  owned  subsidiary of Synergy  Brands.  We acquired
these  interests for a combination of cash and the award of advertising  time on
our stations to the Internet businesses.

     In furtherance of our Internet  strategy,  we routinely  review and conduct
investigations  of potential  Internet-related  acquisitions.  When we believe a
favorable  opportunity exists, we seek to enter into discussions with the owners
of  Internet-related  businesses  regarding the  possibility of an  acquisition,
equity  investment  or  barter  transaction.  At any  given  time,  we may be in
discussions with one or more parties.  We cannot assure you that any of these or
other  negotiations  will lead to definitive  agreements  or if  agreements  are
reached that any transactions would be consummated.

1999 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

     Guy Gannett  Acquisition.  In September 1998, we agreed to acquire from Guy
Gannett  Communications its television  broadcasting assets for a purchase price
of $317  million  in cash (the Guy  Gannett  Acquisition).  In April,  1999,  we
acquired from Guy Gannett Communications WGME-TV in Portland,  Maine, WGGB-TV in
Springfield,  Massachusetts,  WTWC-TV in  Tallahassee,  Florida  and  WOKR-TV in
Rochester,  New York. In July,  1999, we completed  the  acquisition  of the Guy
Gannett  stations  by  acquiring  WICD-TV  in  Champaign,  Illinois,  WICS-TV in
Springfield,  Illinois  and  KGAN-TV in Cedar  Rapids,  Iowa.  We  financed  the
acquisition  with a combination of bank  borrowings and the use of cash proceeds
resulting from our disposition of certain broadcast assets.

     Ackerley  Disposition. In  April  1999, we completed the sale of WOKR-TV in
Rochester,  New  York to Central NY News, Inc. for a sales price of $125 million
(the  Ackerley  Disposition).  We  acquired  WOKR-TV  as part of the Guy Gannett
Acquisition.

     CCA Disposition.  In April 1999, we sold to  Communications  Corporation of
America (CCA) the Non-License  Assets of KETK-TV and KLSB-TV in  Tyler-Longview,
Texas for a sales price of $36 million (the CCA Disposition).  In addition,  CCA
has an option to acquire  the License  Assets of KETK-TV for an option  purchase
price of $2 million.

     St.  Louis  Radio Acquisition. In August 1999, we completed the purchase of
radio  station  KXOK-FM  in  St.  Louis, Missouri from WPNT, Inc. for a purchase
price of $14.1 million in cash.

     Barnstable  Disposition. In  August  1999,  we  completed the sale of radio
stations   WFOG-FM  and  WGH-AM/FM  serving  the  Norfolk,  Virginia  market  to
Barnstable  Broadcasting, Inc. (the Barnstable Disposition) for a sales price of
$23.7 million.

     Entercom Disposition.  In August 1999, we entered into an agreement to sell
46  radio  stations  in nine  markets  to  Entercom  Communications  Corporation
(Entercom)  for $824.5  million in cash.  The  transaction  does not include our
radio  stations in the St.  Louis  market  which were  subject to the St.  Louis
Purchase Option described in "--Pending  Dispositions"  below. In December 1999,
we closed on the sale of 41 radio stations in eight markets for a purchase price
of $700.4  million.  We expect to close on the remaining  $124.1  million during
2000 which  represents  the Kansas City radio stations and the License Assets of
WKRF-FM in  Wilkes-Barre.  The  Entercom  transaction  contemplated  our sale to
Entercom of shares of stock we held in a company called USA Digital Radio,  Inc.
(USADR).  The exercise of preemptive  rights to buy stock by USADR  shareholders
precluded  our  completing  the sale of the shares to Entercom in its  entirety,
leading  Entercom  to assert a claim  against us of  approximately  $1  million.
Although we cannot predict the outcome of this claim, we believe we have certain
defenses available to us which may eliminate or reduce any potential liability.

PENDING ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

     Glencairn/WPTT, Inc. Acquisitions. On November 15, 1999, we entered into an
agreement  to purchase  substantially  all of the assets of  television  station
WCWB-TV, Channel 22, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with the owner of that television
station WPTT,  Inc. for a purchase  price of $17.8  million.  The waiting period
under the  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Act of 1976 has  expired and closing on
this  transaction is subject to FCC approval.  A petition to deny was filed with
the FCC against the application.  We have filed an opposition to the petition to
deny, which remains pending at the FCC.

     On November 15, 1999, we entered into five separate plans and agreements of
merger,  pursuant to which we would acquire through merger with  subsidiaries of
Glencairn,  Ltd.,  television broadcast stations WABM-TV,  Birmingham,  Alabama,
KRRT-TV, San Antonio, Texas, WVTV-TV,  Milwaukee,  Wisconsin,  WRDC-TV, Raleigh,
North Carolina,  and WBSC-TV (formerly WFBC-TV),  Andersen,  South Carolina. The
consideration  for these mergers is the issuance to Glencairn  shares of class A
common  voting stock of the Company.  The total value of the shares to be issued
in  consideration  for all the mergers is $8.0  million.  A petition to deny was
filed with the FCC against  these  applications.  We have filed an opposition to
the petition to deny, which remains pending at the FCC.

     We  currently  program  each of the stations we have agreed to acquire from
WPTT,  Inc. and Glencairn Ltd. pursuant to local market agreements. As described
more  fully  in  the  material  incorporated  by reference in Item 13, officers,
directors  and  shareholders  of  Sinclair (or their families) have interests in
WPTT, Inc. and Glencairn Ltd.

     Sullivan IV  Acquisition.  In November  1999,  we filed an  application  to
acquire the stock of Sullivan  Broadcasting  Company IV, Inc. which has obtained
FCC  approval  to  acquire  KOKH-TV,   Oklahoma  City,  Oklahoma  from  Sullivan
Broadcasting Company III, Inc. A petition to deny was filed with the FCC against
our  application.  We have filed an  opposition  to the petition to deny,  which
remains pending at the FCC.

     Montecito  Acquisition.  In February 1998, we entered into a Stock Purchase
Agreement  with  Montecito   Broadcasting   Corporation   (Montecito)   and  its
stockholders  to acquire all of the issued and  outstanding  stock of  Montecito
which owns the FCC License for television broadcast station KFBT-TV. The FCC has
granted initial approval to the  transaction,  which shall become final in April
2000.  We anticipate  acquiring the stock of Montecito in the second  quarter of
2000.

     Mission Option.  Pursuant to our merger with Sullivan  Broadcast  Holdings,
Inc.,  which  was  effective  July 1,  1998,  we  acquired  options  to  acquire
television  broadcast  station  WUXP-TV in  Nashville,  Tennessee  from  Mission
Broadcasting  I, Inc. and television  broadcast  station  WUPN-TV in Greensboro,
North  Carolina  from Mission  Broadcasting  II, Inc. On November  15, 1999,  we
exercised our option to acquire both of the foregoing stations. This acquisition
is subject to FCC approval.

     St. Louis Purchase  Option.  In connection with our 1996 acquisition of the
broadcasting  assets of River City  Broadcasting,  L.P. (River City), we entered
into a five year agreement  (the Baker  Agreement)  with Barry Baker,  the Chief
Executive  Officer  of River  City  pursuant  to which  Mr.  Baker  served  as a
consultant  to us and would  have  become an  officer  of  Sinclair  if  certain
conditions were  satisfied.  As of February 8, 1999, the conditions to Mr. Baker
becoming  an officer of  Sinclair  had not been  satisfied,  and on that date we
entered into an amendment to the Baker  Agreement  which  terminated Mr. Baker's
services  effective March 8, 1999. Mr. Baker had certain rights as a consequence
of termination of the Baker  Agreement,  including the right to purchase at fair
market  value  our  television  and radio  stations  that  serve the St.  Louis,
Missouri market (the St. Louis purchase option).

     In June 1999,  we received a letter from Mr. Baker  stating that he elected
to exercise his St. Louis purchase option. In his letter,  Mr. Baker named Emmis
Communications  Corporation  (Emmis) as his  designee to exercise  the St. Louis
purchase  option.  Notwithstanding  our belief that Emmis was not an appropriate
designee of Mr.  Baker,  we  negotiated  in good faith with Emmis  regarding the
potential sale of the St. Louis properties. Following unsuccessful negotiations,
however,  on January 18, 2000,  we filed suit in the Circuit  Court of Baltimore
County, Maryland against Mr. Baker and Emmis claiming,  alternatively,  that Mr.
Baker's designation of Emmis was invalid,  that the St. Louis purchase option is
void for  vagueness  and/or  that  Emmis  breached  a duty that it owed to us by
refusing to negotiate the acquisition agreement in good faith. We have requested
that the court grant us declaratory relief and/or monetary damages.

                                       11

<PAGE>

     On  March  17,  2000,  Emmis  and  Mr.  Baker  filed  a  joint  answer  and
counterclaim  generally  denying the allegations made by Sinclair in its lawsuit
and  claiming  that  Sinclair  has acted in bad faith in failing to fulfill  its
contractual  obligations,  has  mismanaged  the  St.  Louis  properties  and has
interfered  with the  contract  between Mr.  Baker and Emmis in which Mr.  Baker
purportedly   designated  Emmis  as  the  transferee  of  the  properties.   The
counterclaim  seeks  compensatory  and punitive  damages,  the  appointment of a
special receiver to manage the St. Louis broadcast  properties and a declaratory
judgment  requiring  Sinclair to complete the sale of those properties to Emmis.
We believe  we have  valid  defenses  to the Emmis  counterclaims  and intend to
vigorously contest the claims, although there can be no assurances regarding the
outcome of this litigation.

     In  light  of  this  ongoing  lawsuit,  we do not  expect  the  transaction
contemplated by the St. Louis purchase  option to be consummated.  We do intend,
however,  to sell our remaining six radio stations  serving the St. Louis market
which were, in part, the subject of the St. Louis purchase option.

     Entercom Disposition.  In August 1999, we entered into an agreement to sell
46 radio  stations in nine markets to Entercom for $824.5  million in cash.  The
transaction  does not include our radio  stations in the St. Louis markets which
were subject to the St. Louis  purchase  option.  In December 1999, we closed on
the sale of 41 radio  stations in eight  markets for a purchase  price of $700.4
million.  We expect to close on the remaining  $124.1  million during 2000 which
represents  the Kansas City radio  stations and the License Assets of WKRF-FM in
Wilkes-Barre.  The  completion of the Kansas City  transaction is subject to FCC
and  Department of Justice  approval.  The  completion of the sale of WKRF-FM is
subject only to FCC approval  and the outcome of pending  litigation  in which a
former  licensee  is  seeking  the  return  of the  WKRF-FM  license  based on a
fraudulent  conveyance claim; pending the receipt of these approvals Entercom is
providing  programming,  sales and marketing  services to WKRF-FM pursuant to an
LMA. The  Entercom  transaction  contemplated  our sale to Entercom of shares of
stock we held in USADR. The exercise of preemptive  rights to buy stock by USADR
shareholders  precluded our completing the sale of the shares to Entercom in its
entirety,  leading  Entercom to assert a claim  against us of  approximately  $1
million.  Although we cannot  predict  the outcome of this claim,  we believe we
have  certain  defenses  available  to us which  may  eliminate  or  reduce  any
potential liability.

FEDERAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING

     The  ownership,  operation  and sale of television  and radio  stations are
subject to the  jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under  authority  granted by
the  Communications  Act of 1934, as amended  (Communications  Act). Among other
things,  the FCC;  assigns  frequency  bands for  broadcasting;  determines  the
particular  frequencies,  locations  and  operating  power of stations;  issues,
renews,  revokes and modifies  station  licenses;  regulates  equipment  used by
stations;  adopts and  implements  regulations  and  policies  that  directly or
indirectly affect the ownership, operation and employment practices of stations;
and has the  power  to  impose  penalties  for  violations  of its  rules or the
Communications Act.

     The   following  is  a  brief   summary  of  certain   provisions   of  the
Communications  Act,  the  Telecommunications  Act of 1996  (the  1996  Act) and
specific  FCC  regulations  and  policies.  Reference  should  be  made  to  the
Communications  Act, the 1996 Act, FCC rules and the public  notices and rulings
of the FCC for further  information  concerning the nature and extent of federal
regulation of broadcast stations.

GENERAL

     License Grant and Renewal.  Television and radio stations  operate pursuant
to broadcasting  licenses that are granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight
years and are subject to renewal upon  application  to the FCC.  During  certain
periods  when  renewal  applications  are  pending,  petitions  to deny  license
renewals can be filed by interested  parties,  including  members of the public.
The FCC will generally grant a renewal application if it finds:

     o    that the  station  has  served the public  interest,  convenience  and
          necessity;

     o    that there  have been no serious  violations  by the  licensee  of the
          Communications Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC; and

     o    that  there  have  been no other  violations  by the  licensee  of the
          Communications  Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC that, when
          taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.

                                       12

<PAGE>

     All  of  the  stations  that  we  currently  own  and  operate  or  provide
programming  services  to  pursuant  to LMAs,  or intend to  acquire  or provide
programming  services pursuant to LMAs in connection with pending  acquisitions,
are presently operating under regular licenses,  which expire as to each station
on  the  dates  set  forth  under   "--Television   Broadcasting"  and  "--Radio
Broadcasting"  above.  Although  renewal  of a license  is  granted  in the vast
majority  of cases  even  when  petitions  to deny are  filed,  there  can be no
assurance that the licenses of a station will be renewed.

     General Ownership Matters.  The Communications Act prohibits the assignment
of a  broadcast  license or the  transfer  of control  of a  broadcast  licensee
without  the prior  approval of the FCC.  In  determining  whether to permit the
assignment  or  transfer  of control of, or the grant or renewal of, a broadcast
license,  the FCC  considers  a number of factors  pertaining  to the  licensee,
including  compliance  with various  rules  limiting  common  ownership of media
properties,   the   "character"  of  the  licensee  and  those  persons  holding
"attributable"   interests   in  that   licensee,   and   compliance   with  the
Communications Act's limitations on alien ownership.

     To obtain the FCC's prior consent to assign a broadcast license or transfer
control of a broadcast licensee, appropriate applications must be filed with the
FCC. If the application involves a "substantial change" in ownership or control,
the application must be placed on public notice for a period of approximately 30
days during which  petitions to deny the  application may be filed by interested
parties,  including members of the public. If the application does not involve a
"substantial  change" in ownership or control,  it is a "pro forma" application.
The "pro forma"  application  is not subject to petitions to deny or a mandatory
waiting period, but is nevertheless  subject to having informal objections filed
against it. If the FCC grants an assignment or transfer application,  interested
parties  have  approximately  30 days  from  public  notice of the grant to seek
reconsideration  or review of the  grant.  Generally,  parties  that do not file
initial  petitions to deny or informal  objections  against the application face
difficulty in seeking  reconsideration  or review of the grant. The FCC normally
has  approximately  an  additional  10 days to set aside  such  grant on its own
motion.  When  passing on an  assignment  or  transfer  application,  the FCC is
prohibited  from  considering  whether the public interest might be served by an
assignment  or  transfer  to any party  other than the  assignee  or  transferee
specified in the application.

     The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to "attributable"  interests
held by an individual,  corporation,  partnership or other  association.  In the
case of corporations  holding, or through  subsidiaries  controlling,  broadcast
licenses,  the  interests  of  officers,  directors  and those who,  directly or
indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation's stock (or 20%
or more of such stock in the case of insurance  companies,  investment companies
and  bank  trust   departments   that  are  passive   investors)  are  generally
attributable, except that, in general, no minority voting stock interest will be
attributable  if there is a single  holder of more  than 50% of the  outstanding
voting  power  of  the  corporation.  In  August,  1999,  the  FCC  revised  its
attribution and multiple ownership rules, and adopted the equity-debt-plus  rule
that causes  certain  creditors  or  investors  to be  attributable  owners of a
station,  regardless of whether there is a single majority  stockholder or other
applicable  exception  to the FCC's  attribution  rules.  Under this new rule, a
major programming supplier (any programming supplier that provides more than 15%
of the station's weekly  programming  hours) or same-market media entity will be
an attributable  owner of a station if the supplier or same-market  media entity
holds debt or equity,  or both,  in the station  that is greater than 33% of the
value of the station's total debt plus equity. For purposes of this rule, equity
includes all stock,  whether voting or non-voting,  and equity held by insulated
limited  partners  in  partnerships.   Debt  includes  all  liabilities  whether
long-term or short-term.

     The  Communications Act prohibits the issuance of broadcast licenses to, or
the holding of a broadcast license by, any corporation of which more than 20% of
the  capital  stock is owned of record or voted by  non-U.S.  citizens  or their
representatives  or by a foreign government or a representative  thereof,  or by
any corporation  organized  under the laws of a foreign  country  (collectively,
aliens).  The  Communications Act also authorizes the FCC, if the FCC determines
that it would be in the public interest, to prohibit the issuance of a broadcast
license to, or the holding of a broadcast  license by, any corporation  directly
or indirectly  controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the
capital  stock is owned  of  record  or  voted  by  aliens.  The FCC has  issued
interpretations  of existing law under which these restrictions in modified form
apply to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships.

                                       13

<PAGE>

     As a result of these  provisions,  the licenses granted to our subsidiaries
by the FCC could be revoked  if,  among other  restrictions  imposed by the FCC,
more than 25% of our stock were directly or indirectly owned or voted by aliens.
Sinclair and its subsidiaries are domestic corporations,  and the members of the
Smith  family  (who  together  hold  over 90% of the  common  voting  rights  of
Sinclair) are all United States citizens.  The amended and restated  articles of
incorporation of Sinclair (the amended certificate) contain limitations on alien
ownership and control that are  substantially  similar to those contained in the
Communications Act. Pursuant to the amended certificate,  Sinclair has the right
to  repurchase  alien-owned  shares at their  fair  market  value to the  extent
necessary,  in the judgment of its board of directors,  to comply with the alien
ownership restrictions.

     Radio/Television   Cross-Ownership   Rule.   The   FCC's   radio/television
cross-ownership  rule (the "one to a market" rule) generally  permits a party to
own a  combination  of up to two  television  stations  and six  radio  stations
depending on the number of independent media voices in the market.

     Local Television/Cable  Cross-Ownership Rule. While the 1996 Act eliminates
a previous  statutory  prohibition  against the common ownership of a television
broadcast station and a cable system that serve the same local market,  the 1996
Act leaves the current  FCC rule in place.  The  legislative  history of the Act
indicates  that the repeal of the  statutory ban should not prejudge the outcome
of any FCC review of the rule.

     Broadcast Network/Cable  Cross-Ownership Rule. The 1996 Act directs the FCC
to  eliminate  its rules which  formerly  prohibited  the common  ownership of a
broadcast  network and a cable  system,  subject to the  provision  that the FCC
revise its rules as  necessary  to ensure  carriage,  channel  positioning,  and
non-discriminatory  treatment  of  non-affiliated  broadcast  stations  by cable
systems  affiliated with a broadcast  network.  In March 1996, the FCC issued an
order implementing this legislative change.

     Broadcast/Daily  Newspaper  Cross-Ownership  Rule. The FCC's rules prohibit
the common  ownership  of a radio or  television  broadcast  station and a daily
newspaper in the same market.  In October  1996,  the FCC initiated a rulemaking
proceeding  to determine  whether it should  liberalize  its waiver  policy with
respect to  cross-ownership  of a daily newspaper and one or more radio stations
in the same market.

     Dual Network  Rule. A network  entity is permitted to operate more than one
television  network,  provided,  however,  that ABC,  CBS,  NBC,  and/or Fox are
currently  prohibited  from  merging  with each  other or with  another  network
television entity such as WB or UPN.

     Antitrust  Regulation.  The DOJ  and  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  have
increased their scrutiny of the television and radio industry since the adoption
of the 1996 Act,  and have  reviewed  matters  related to the  concentration  of
ownership  within markets  (including  LMAs and JSAs) even when the ownership or
LMA or JSA in question is permitted under the laws administered by the FCC or by
FCC rules and  regulations.  For  instance,  the DOJ has for some time taken the
position  that an LMA entered into in  anticipation  of a station's  acquisition
with the  proposed  buyer of the  station  constitutes  a change  in  beneficial
ownership of the station which,  if subject to filing under the HSR Act,  cannot
be implemented  until the waiting  period  required by that statute has ended or
been terminated.

     Expansion of our broadcast  operations  on both a local and national  level
will continue to be subject to the FCC's ownership rules and any changes the FCC
or  Congress  may adopt.  Concomitantly,  any  further  relaxation  of the FCC's
ownership  rules may  increase  the level of  competition  in one or more of the
markets in which our stations are located,  more specifically to the extent that
any of our competitors  may have greater  resources and thereby be in a superior
position to take advantage of such changes.

TELEVISION

     National  Ownership  Rule. No individual or entity may have an attributable
interest  in  television  stations  reaching  more  than  35%  of  the  national
television  viewing  audience.  Historically,  VHF stations have shared a larger
portion of the market than UHF stations.  Therefore, only half of the households
in the market area of any UHF station are included when  calculating  whether an
entity or  individual  owns  television  stations  reaching more than 35% of the
national television viewing audience. All but seven of

                                       14

<PAGE>

the  stations  owned  and  operated  by us, or to which we  provide  programming
services, are UHF. Upon completion of all pending acquisitions and dispositions,
we will reach approximately 25% of U.S. television households or 15% taking into
account the FCC's UHF discount.

     Duopoly  Rule. Under  the  FCC's  new  local  television ownership rules, a
party may own two television stations in the same market:

     o    if there is no Grade B overlap between the stations;

     o    if the stations are in two different Nielsen  Designated Market Areas;
          or

     o    if the market  containing  both the  stations  contains at least eight
          separately-owned  full-power television stations and not more than one
          station is among the top-four rated stations in the market.

     In  addition,  a party may request a waiver of the rule to acquire a second
station in the market if the station to be acquired is  economically  distressed
or unbuilt and there is no party who does not own a local television station who
would purchase the station for a reasonable price.

     Local  Marketing  Agreements.  A number of television  stations,  including
certain of our  stations,  have entered into what have commonly been referred to
as local marketing  agreements or LMAs.  While these agreements may take varying
forms, one typical type of LMA is a programming agreement between two separately
owned television stations serving a common service area, whereby the licensee of
one  station  programs  substantial  portions  of the  broadcast  day and  sells
advertising time during such program  segments on the other  licensee's  station
subject to ultimate  editorial and other controls being  exercised by the latter
licensee. The licensee of the station which is being substantially programmed by
another entity must maintain  complete  responsibility  for and control over the
programming, financing, personnel and operations of its broadcast station and is
responsible for compliance  with  applicable FCC rules and policies.  If the FCC
were to find that the  owners/licensees  of the stations with which we have LMAs
failed to maintain  control over their  operations  as required by FCC rules and
policies,  the licensee of the LMA station and/or Sinclair could be fined or set
for  hearing,  the outcome of which  could be a monetary  forfeiture  or,  under
certain circumstances, loss of the applicable FCC license.

                                       15

<PAGE>

     In the past, a licensee could own one station and program  another  station
pursuant  to an LMA  in  the  same  market  because  LMAs  were  not  considered
attributable  interests.  However,  under the new ownership rules,  LMAs are now
attributable  where  a  licensee  owns  a  television  station  and  programs  a
television  station in the same market.  The new rules provide that LMAs entered
into on or after  November  5,  1996  have  until  August  5,  2001 to come into
compliance  with the new ownership  rules,  otherwise such LMAs will  terminate.
LMAs  entered  into  before  November  5, 1996 will be  grandfathered  until the
conclusion of the FCC's 2004 biennial  review.  In certain  cases,  parties with
grandfathered LMAs, may be able to rely on the circumstances at the time the LMA
was entered into in advancing any proposal for  co-ownership of the station.  We
currently program 26 television  stations pursuant to LMAs. We have entered into
agreements to acquire 16 of the stations that we program pursuant to an LMA. See
"--  1999  Acquisitions  and  Dispositions"  and "--  Pending  Acquisitions  and
Dispositions".  Once we acquire these stations, the LMAs will terminate.  Of the
remaining 10 stations,  5 LMAs were entered into before  November 5, 1996, and 5
LMAs  were  entered  into  on  or  after   November  5,  1996.   Petitions   for
reconsideration  of the new rules,  including  a petition  submitted  by us, are
currently  pending  before  the FCC.  We cannot  predict  the  outcome  of these
petitions.

     The Satellite Home Viewer Act (SHVA). In 1988,  Congress enacted SHVA which
enabled satellite  carriers to provide broadcast  programming to those satellite
subscribers   who  were   unable  to  obtain   broadcast   network   programming
over-the-air.  SHVA  did not  permit  satellite  carriers  to  retransmit  local
broadcast  television signals directly to their subscribers.  The Satellite Home
Viewer  Improvement  Act of 1999 (SHVIA)  revised SHVA to reflect changes in the
satellite and  broadcasting  industry.  This new  legislation  allows  satellite
carriers  to provide  local  television  signals by  satellite  within a station
market,  but does not require satellite carriers to carry all local signals in a
market until 2002.  Satellite  carriers  now are  permitted to carry these local
television  station signals  without the express  consent of broadcasters  for a
six-month  period  until  the end of May 2000.  During  that  six-month  period,
broadcasters are required to participate in good faith in retransmission consent
negotiations with satellite  carriers and other  multichannel  video programming
distributors.  If an agreement  has not been reached by the end of the six-month
period,  the television  station  signal may not be carried  without the express
consent  of the  broadcaster.  We  cannot  predict  the  impact  of SHVIA or any
modifications of the FCC's regulations as a result of those changes.

     Must-Carry/Retransmission  Consent.  Pursuant  to the  Cable  Act of  1992,
television  broadcasters  are required to make  triennial  elections to exercise
either certain  "must-carry"  or  "retransmission  consent" rights in connection
with their  carriage by cable systems in each  broadcaster's  local  market.  By
electing the must-carry  rights,  a broadcaster  demands carriage on a specified
channel  on cable  systems  within its  Designated  Market  Area,  in general as
defined by the Nielsen DMA Market and Demographic Rank Report of the prior year.
These  must-carry  rights are not absolute,  and their  exercise is dependent on
variables such as

     o    the number of activated channels on a cable system,

     o    the location and size of a cable system, and

     o    the amount of programming on a broadcast  station that  duplicates the
          programming of another broadcast station carried by the cable system.

     Therefore, under certain circumstances, a cable system may decline to carry
a  given  station.   Alternatively,   if  a  broadcaster   chooses  to  exercise
retransmission  consent rights,  it can prohibit cable systems from carrying its
signal or grant the  appropriate  cable system the authority to  retransmit  the
broadcast signal for a fee or other  consideration.  In October 1999, we elected
must-carry  or  retransmission  consent  with  respect  to each  of the  non-Fox
affiliated  stations based on our  evaluation of the respective  markets and the
position of our owned or programmed  station(s) within the market.  Our stations
continue to be carried on all  pertinent  cable  systems,  and we do not believe
that our  elections  have  resulted  in the  shifting  of our  stations  to less
desirable cable channel locations. Many of the agreements we have negotiated for
cable   carriage  are  short  term,   subject  to   month-to-month   extensions.
Accordingly,  we may need to  negotiate  new long  term  retransmission  consent
agreements  for our stations to ensure  carriage on those relevant cable systems
for the balance of this triennial period (i.e., through December 31, 2002).

                                       16

<PAGE>

     The FCC has initiated a rulemaking  proceeding to consider whether to apply
must-carry rules to require cable companies to carry both the analog and digital
signals of local broadcasters  during the DTV transition period between 2002 and
2006 when television stations will be broadcasting both signals. If the FCC does
not require DTV  must-carry,  cable  customers in our broadcast  markets may not
receive the station's digital signal.

     Syndicated   Exclusivity/Territorial   Exclusivity.  The  FCC's  syndicated
exclusivity rules allow local broadcast television stations to demand that cable
operators  black out  syndicated  non-network  programming  carried on  "distant
signals"   (i.e.,   signals   of   broadcast   stations,   including   so-called
"superstations," which serve areas substantially removed from the cable system's
local community).  The FCC's network non-duplication rules allow local broadcast
network  television  affiliates  to  require  that  cable  operators  black  out
duplicating network programming carried on distant signals. However, in a number
of markets  in which we own or program  stations  affiliated  with a network,  a
station that is  affiliated  with the same network in a nearby market is carried
on cable  systems in our market.  This is not in violation of the FCC's  network
non-duplication rules. However, the carriage of two network stations on the same
cable system could result in a decline of  viewership  adversely  affecting  the
revenues of our owned or programmed station.

DIGITAL TELEVISION

     The FCC has taken a number of steps to implement  digital  television (DTV)
broadcasting  services. The FCC has adopted an allotment table that provides all
authorized television stations with a second channel on which to broadcast a DTV
signal.  The FCC has attempted to provide DTV coverage areas that are comparable
to stations' existing service areas. The FCC has ruled that television broadcast
licensees may use their digital  channels for a wide variety of services such as
high-definition television, multiple standard definition television programming,
audio, data, and other types of communications,  subject to the requirement that
each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the
current  technical   standard  and  further  subject  to  the  requirement  that
broadcasters pay a fee of 5% of gross revenues on all DTV subscription services.

     DTV channels are generally  located in the range of channels from channel 2
through channel 51. The FCC required that affiliates of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC in
the top 10 television markets begin digital broadcasting by May 1, 1999 and that
affiliates of these networks in markets 11 through 30 begin digital broadcasting
by November  1999. All other  commercial  stations are required to begin digital
broadcasting  by May 1, 2002.  The  majority  of our  stations  are  required to
commence digital operations by May 1, 2002.  Applications for digital facilities
for all of our stations were filed by November 1, 1999. The FCC's plan calls for
the DTV transition period to end in the year 2006, at which time the FCC expects
that television broadcasters will cease non-digital  broadcasting and return one
of their two channels to the government,  allowing that spectrum to be recovered
for other uses.  The FCC has been  authorized by Congress to extend the December
31, 2006 deadline for reclamation of a television station's  non-digital channel
if, in any given case:

     o    one or more television  stations  affiliated with ABC, CBS, NBC or Fox
          in a market is not broadcasting digitally, and the FCC determines that
          such stations have  "exercised due diligence" in attempting to convert
          to digital broadcasting, or

     o    less than 85% of the  television  households in the  station's  market
          subscribe to a multichannel  video service  (cable,  wireless cable or
          direct-to-home broadcast satellite television ("DBS")) that carries at
          least one  digital  channel  from each of the local  stations  in that
          market, or

     o    less than 85% of the  television  households in the market can receive
          digital  signals off the air using either a set-top  converter box for
          an analog television set or a new DTV television set.

     Congress  directed the FCC to auction  channels  60-69 for  commercial  and
public  safety  services  no sooner  than  January  1, 2001.  However,  Congress
recently  amended this directive to allow for the auction of these channels this
year. Five of our television  stations currently operate their analog facilities
on

                                       17

<PAGE>

channels between 60-69. Although not required to return these channels until the
end of the DTV  transition  period  (December 31 2006),  the FCC is  encouraging
broadcasters to consider  surrendering  these analog channels sooner.  We cannot
predict the outcome of these changes.

     Congress directed the FCC to auction the remaining  non-digital channels by
September  30, 2002 even though they are not to be reclaimed  by the  government
until at least  December  31,  2006.  Broadcasters  are  permitted to bid on the
non-digital  channels in cities with populations greater than 400,000,  provided
the channels are used for DTV. The FCC has  initiated  separate  proceedings  to
consider the surrender of existing television channels and how these frequencies
will be used after they are eventually recovered from broadcasters.

     Implementation   of  digital   television  will  also  impose   substantial
additional costs on television stations because of the need to replace equipment
and because some stations will need to operate at higher utility costs and there
can be no  assurance  that  our  television  stations  will be able to  increase
revenue to offset such costs. The FCC has proposed  imposing new public interest
requirements  on  television  licensees  in  exchange  for their  receipt of DTV
channels. In addition, Congress has held hearings on broadcasters' plans for the
use of their digital  spectrum.  As part of its first biennial review of the DTV
transition process, the FCC has issued a rulemaking seeking comments on a number
of  issues  effecting  the  transition,   including  a  review  of  the  digital
transmission standard.

RADIO

     National  Ownership  Rule. There  are  no  limits  on  the  number of radio
stations a single individual or entity may own nationwide.

     Local  Ownership  Rules. The  limits  on  the  number of radio stations one
entity may own locally are as follows:

     o    in a market with 45 or more commercial  radio stations,  an entity may
          own up to eight commercial radio stations, not more than five of which
          are in the same service (AM or FM);

     o    in a  market  with  between  30 and 44  (inclusive)  commercial  radio
          stations, an entity may own up to seven commercial radio stations, not
          more than four of which are in the same service;

     o    in a  market  with  between  15 and 29  (inclusive)  commercial  radio
          stations,  an entity may own up to six commercial radio stations,  not
          more than four of which are in the same service; and

     o    in a market with 14 or fewer commercial radio stations,  an entity may
          own up to five commercial radio stations, not more than three of which
          are in the same  service,  except that an entity may not own more than
          50% of the stations in such market.

     These numerical limits apply regardless of the aggregate  audience share of
the stations sought to be commonly owned. FCC ownership rules continue to permit
an entity  to own one FM and one AM  station  in a local  market  regardless  of
market size.  Irrespective of FCC rules governing radio ownership,  however, the
Department  of Justice and the Federal  Trade  Commission  have the authority to
determine, and in certain radio transactions have determined,  that a particular
transaction  presents  antitrust  concerns.  Moreover,  in certain cases the FCC
examined  issues  of  market   concentration   notwithstanding  a  transaction's
compliance with the numerical station limits. The FCC has also indicated that it
may propose further revisions to its radio multiple ownership rules.

     Local Marketing  Agreements.  As in television,  a number of radio stations
have entered into LMAs. The FCC's multiple ownership rules  specifically  permit
radio station LMAs to be entered into and  implemented,  so long as the licensee
of the  station  which is being  programmed  under  the LMA  maintains  ultimate
responsibility  for and control over programming and operations of its broadcast
station and assures  compliance with applicable FCC rules and policies.  For the
purposes of the multiple  ownership  rules,  in general,  a radio  station being
programmed  pursuant to an LMA by an entity is not  considered  an  attributable
ownership  interest of that  entity  unless  that  entity  already  owns a radio
station in the same market.  However,  a licensee that owns a radio station in a
market,  and brokers  more than 15% of the time on another  station  serving the
same market (i.e. a station whose principal community contour

                                       18

<PAGE>

overlaps  that of the  owned  market),  is  considered  to have an  attributable
ownership  interest in the brokered  station for purposes of the FCC's  multiple
ownership  rules. As a result,  in a market in which we own a radio station,  we
would not be  permitted to enter into an LMA with  another  local radio  station
which we could not own under the local ownership  rules,  unless our programming
constituted  15% or less of the  other  local  station's  programming  time on a
weekly basis.

     Joint Sales  Agreements.  A number of radio (and television)  stations have
entered into cooperative  arrangements commonly known as joint sales agreements,
or JSAs. While these agreements may take varying forms, under the typical JSA, a
station licensee obtains,  for a fee, the right to sell substantially all of the
commercial  advertising on a  separately-owned  and licensed station in the same
market.  The typical JSA also customarily  involves the provision by the selling
licensee of certain sales, accounting, and "back office" services to the station
whose advertising is being sold. The typical JSA is distinct from an LMA in that
a JSA (unlike an LMA) normally does not involve programming.

     The FCC has  determined  that issues of joint  advertising  sales should be
left to enforcement by antitrust  authorities,  and therefore does not generally
regulate joint sales practices between  stations.  Stations for which a licensee
sells time under a JSA are not deemed by the FCC to be attributable interests of
that licensee.

RESTRICTIONS ON BROADCAST ADVERTISING

     Advertising of cigarettes  and certain other tobacco  products on broadcast
stations  has been  banned for many years.  Various  states  also  restrict  the
advertising of alcoholic beverages.

     The  Communications  Act and  FCC  rules  also  place  restrictions  on the
broadcasting  of  advertisements  by legally  qualified  candidates for elective
office. Among other things,

     o    stations must provide  "reasonable access" for the purchase of time by
          legally qualified candidates for federal office,

     o    stations  must  provide  "equal  opportunities"  for the  purchase  of
          equivalent amounts of comparable broadcast time by opposing candidates
          for the same elective office, and

     o    during the 45 days preceding a primary or primary run-off election and
          during the 60 days  preceding a general or special  election,  legally
          qualified  candidates for elective  office may be charged no more than
          the   station's   "lowest   unit   charge"   for  the  same  class  of
          advertisement, length of advertisement, and daypart.

Both the  President of the United States and the Chairman of the FCC have called
for rules that would  require  broadcast  stations  to provide  free  airtime to
political candidates.  We cannot predict the effect of such a requirement on our
stations' advertising revenues.

PROGRAMMING AND OPERATION

     General. The Communications Act requires  broadcasters to serve the "public
interest."  The FCC has  relaxed  or  eliminated  many  of the  more  formalized
procedures  it had  developed  in the past to promote the  broadcast  of certain
types of  programming  responsive  to the  needs  of a  station's  community  of
license. FCC licensees continue to be required,  however, to present programming
that is responsive to their communities' issues, and to maintain certain records
demonstrating  such   responsiveness.   Complaints  from  viewers  concerning  a
station's  programming  may be considered  by the FCC when it evaluates  renewal
applications  of a licensee,  although such  complaints may be filed at any time
and generally  may be considered by the FCC at any time.  Stations also must pay
regulatory and application  fees, and follow various rules promulgated under the
Communications  Act that regulate,  among other things,  political  advertising,
sponsorship  identifications,  the  advertisement  of  contests  and  lotteries,
obscene and indecent broadcasts,  and technical operations,  including limits on
radio  frequency  radiation.  The FCC recently  adopted  rules  reaffirming  its
authority to have an Equal Employment  Opportunity (EEO)  nondiscrimination rule
and policies  and to require  broadcast  licensees  to create  equal  employment
outreach  programs and maintain records and make filings with the FCC evidencing
such efforts.

     Children's  Television  Programming. Television  stations  are  required to
broadcast  a  minimum  of  three hours per week of "core" children's educational
programming, which the FCC defines as programming that

     o    services the educational and informational  needs of children 16 years
          of age and under as a significant purpose;

     o    is  regularly  scheduled,  weekly and at least 30 minutes in duration;
          and

     o    is aired  between the hours of 7:00 a.m.  and 10:00 p.m.  Furthermore,
          "core" children's  educational  programs, in order to qualify as such,
          are  required  to  be  identified  as  educational  and  informational
          programs over the air at the time they are broadcast, and are required
          to be identified in the children's  programming reports required to be
          placed  quarterly  in  stations'  public  inspection  files  and filed
          annually with the FCC.

     Additionally,  television  stations  are  required to identify  and provide
information  concerning "core"  children's  programming to publishers of program
guides and listings.

     Television Violence. The television industry has developed a ratings system
that has  been  approved  by the  FCC.  Furthermore,  the FCC  requires  certain
television  sets to include the so-called  "V-chip," a computer chip that allows
blocking of rated programming.

PENDING MATTERS

     The  Congress and the FCC have under  consideration,  and in the future may
consider and adopt, new laws,  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety
of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly,  the operation,  ownership
and  profitability  of our  broadcast  stations,  result in the loss of audience
share and  advertising  revenues  for our  broadcast  stations,  and  affect our
ability to acquire  additional  broadcast stations or finance such acquisitions.
In addition to the changes and proposed  changes  noted above,  such matters may
include, for example, the license renewal process,  spectrum use fees, political
advertising rates, potential restrictions on the advertising of certain products
(beer,  wine and hard  liquor,  for  example),  and the rules and policies to be
applied in enforcing the FCC's equal employment opportunity regulations.

     Other   matters  that  could  affect  our  broadcast   properties   include
technological  innovations and developments  generally affecting  competition in
the mass communications  industry, such as direct radio and television broadcast
satellite service,  creation of low power radio and class A television services,
the continued  establishment  of wireless cable systems and low power television
stations, digital television and radio technologies, the Internet and the advent
of  telephone  company  participation  in the  provision  of  video  programming
service.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

     The foregoing  summary does not purport to be a complete  discussion of all
provisions  of the  Communications  Act or  other  congressional  acts or of the
regulations and policies of the FCC. For further  information,  reference should
be made to the Communications Act, other congressional acts, and regulations and
public  notices  promulgated  from time to time by the FCC. There are additional
regulations  and  policies  of the FCC and other  federal  agencies  that govern
political  broadcasts,  advertising,  equal  employment  opportunity,  and other
matters affecting our business and operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

     Prior to our ownership or operation of our facilities,  substances or waste
that are or might be considered  hazardous under applicable  environmental  laws
may have  been  generated,  used,  stored or  disposed  of at  certain  of those
facilities.  In  addition,  environmental  conditions  relating  to the soil and
groundwater  at or under our  facilities  may be  affected by the  proximity  of
nearby  properties  that have generated,  used,  stored or disposed of hazardous
substances.  As a  result,  it is  possible  that we  could  become  subject  to
environmental  liabilities  in the future in  connection  with these  facilities
under

                                       20

<PAGE>

applicable  environmental laws and regulations.  Although we believe that we are
in substantial compliance with such environmental requirements,  and have not in
the past been required to incur significant costs in connection therewith, there
can be no  assurance  that our costs to comply with such  requirements  will not
increase in the future.  We presently  believe that none of our properties  have
any condition that is likely to have a material  adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

COMPETITION

     Our  television   and  radio  stations   compete  for  audience  share  and
advertising revenue with other television and radio stations in their respective
DMAs or MSAs,  as well as with  other  advertising  media,  such as  newspapers,
magazines,  outdoor advertising,  transit advertising,  yellow page directories,
direct  mail,  satellite  and  local  cable and  wireless  cable  systems.  Some
competitors  are  part  of  larger  organizations  with  substantially   greater
financial, technical and other resources than we have.

     Television Competition. Competition in the television broadcasting industry
occurs  primarily in  individual  DMAs.  Generally,  a  television  broadcasting
station in one DMA does not compete with stations in other DMAs.  Our television
stations are located in highly  competitive  DMAs.  In addition,  certain of our
DMAs are  overlapped  by both  over-the-air  and cable  carriage  of stations in
adjacent DMAs,  which tends to spread  viewership and  advertising  expenditures
over a larger number of television stations.

     Broadcast  television  stations compete for advertising  revenues primarily
with other broadcast  television  stations,  radio stations,  cable channels and
cable system operators serving the same market.  Traditional network programming
generally  achieves  higher  household  audience  levels  than  Fox,  WB and UPN
programming and syndicated  programming aired by independent stations.  This can
be attributed to a combination of factors,  including the traditional  networks'
efforts to reach a broader audience,  generally better signal carriage available
when  broadcasting  over VHF channels 2 through 13 versus  broadcasting over UHF
channels  14 through 69 and the higher  number of hours of  traditional  network
programming being broadcast weekly. However, greater amounts of advertising time
are  available  for sale  during Fox,  UPN and WB  programming  and  non-network
syndicated  programming,  and  as a  result  we  believe  that  our  programming
typically  achieves a share of television  market  advertising  revenues greater
than its share of the market's audience.

     Television  stations  compete for audience share  primarily on the basis of
program  popularity,  which has a direct effect on  advertising  rates.  A large
amount of a station's  prime time  programming  is supplied by Fox, ABC, NBC and
CBS,  and to a lesser  extent  WB and  UPN.  In those  periods,  our  affiliated
stations are totally dependent upon the performance of the networks' programs in
attracting  viewers.  Non-network  time  periods are  programmed  by the station
primarily  with  syndicated  programs  purchased for cash,  cash and barter,  or
barter-only,  and also  through  self-produced  news,  public  affairs and other
entertainment programming.

     Television  advertising rates are based upon factors which include the size
of the DMA in which the  station  operates,  a  program's  popularity  among the
viewers  that an  advertiser  wishes  to  attract,  the  number  of  advertisers
competing for the available  time, the  demographic  makeup of the DMA served by
the  station,  the  availability  of  alternative  advertising  media in the DMA
including radio and cable, the  aggressiveness  and knowledge of sales forces in
the DMA and  development of projects,  features and programs that tie advertiser
messages to programming.  We believe that our sales and  programming  strategies
allow us to compete effectively for advertising within our DMAs.

     Other  factors  that are  material to a  television  station's  competitive
position include signal coverage, local program acceptance, network affiliation,
audience characteristics and assigned broadcast frequency. Historically, our UHF
broadcast  stations have suffered a  competitive  disadvantage  in comparison to
stations  with  VHF  broadcast  frequencies.   This  historic  disadvantage  has
gradually declined through

     o    carriage on cable systems,

     o    improvement in television receivers,

     o    improvement in television transmitters,

                                       21

<PAGE>

     o    wider use of all channel antennae,

     o    increased availability of programming, and

     o    the development of new networks such as Fox, WB and UPN.

     The broadcasting  industry is continuously faced with technical changes and
innovations, the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media,
changes in labor conditions, and governmental restrictions or actions of federal
regulatory  bodies,  including  the FCC,  any of  which  could  possibly  have a
material effect on a television  station's operations and profits. For instance,
the FCC currently is conducting a rule making concerning the implementation of a
Class A television service for qualifying low power television  stations.  A low
power  television  station that  qualifies for Class A status would have certain
rights currently  accorded to full-power  television  stations,  which may allow
them to compete more effectively with full power stations. We cannot predict the
outcome of this  proceeding  or the  effect of Class A  television  stations  in
markets where have full-power television stations.

     There are  sources  of video  service  other than  conventional  television
stations, the most common being cable television, which can increase competition
for  a  broadcast  television  station  by  bringing  into  its  market  distant
broadcasting signals not otherwise available to the station's audience,  serving
as a distribution system for national satellite-delivered  programming and other
non-broadcast  programming  originated on a cable system and selling advertising
time to local advertisers.  Other principal sources of competition  include home
video  exhibition  and Direct  Broadcast  Satellite  services  and  multichannel
multipoint  distribution  services (MMDS). DBS and cable operators in particular
are competing more aggressively than in the past for advertising revenues in our
TV stations'  markets.  This  competition  could adversely  affect our stations'
revenues and performance in the future.

     In  addition,  SHVIA  could  also have an adverse  effect on our  broadcast
stations' audience share and advertising  revenue because it may allow satellite
carriers  to  provide  the  signal of  distant  stations  with the same  network
affiliation as our stations to more television viewers in our markets than would
have been permitted  under previous law. The legislation  also allows  satellite
carriers  to provide  local  television  signals by  satellite  within a station
market, but does not require satellite carriers to carry all local stations in a
market until 2002.  Satellite  carriers  could decide to carry other stations in
our markets,  but not our stations,  which could adversely  affect our stations'
audience share.

     Moreover,  technology advances and regulatory changes affecting programming
delivery through fiber optic telephone lines and video  compression  could lower
entry  barriers  for  new  video  channels  and  encourage  the  development  of
increasingly specialized "niche" programming.  Telephone companies are permitted
to provide  video  distribution  services via radio  communication,  on a common
carrier basis,  as "cable  systems" or as "open video systems," each pursuant to
different  regulatory  schemes.  We are  unable  to  predict  what  other  video
technologies might be considered in the future, or the effect that technological
and regulatory changes will have on the broadcast television industry and on the
future profitability and value of a particular broadcast television station.

     We believe that television  broadcasting  may be enhanced  significantly by
the  development and increased  availability of DTV technology.  This technology
has the potential to permit us to provide viewers  multiple  channels of digital
television  over each of our  existing  standard  channels,  to provide  certain
programming in a high definition  television format and to deliver various forms
of data,  including  data on the Internet,  to PCs and handheld  devices.  These
additional  capabilities  may provide us with  additional  sources of revenue as
well as additional competition.

     While DTV  technology  is  currently  available  in the top thirty  viewing
markets,  a successful  transition from the current analog broadcast format to a
digital  format may take many  years.  We cannot  assure you that our efforts to
take advantage of the new technology will be commercially successful.

     We also compete for programming,  which involves  negotiating with national
program  distributors  or syndicators  that sell first-run and rerun packages of
programming. Our stations compete for exclusive access to those programs against
in-market broadcast station competitors for syndicated  products.  Cable systems
generally do not compete with local stations for  programming,  although various
national cable

                                       22

<PAGE>

networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise been
offered to local television  stations.  Public  broadcasting  stations generally
compete  with  commercial  broadcasters  for  viewers  but not  for  advertising
dollars.

     Historically,  the cost of programming has increased because of an increase
in the number of new independent stations and a shortage of quality programming.
However,  we believe that over the past five years program prices generally have
stabilized or fallen on a per station  basis,  but aggregate  programming  costs
have  risen  as we have  attempted  to  improve  the  quality  of our  stations'
programming line-ups.

     We believe we compete favorably  against other television  stations because
of our management  skill and  experience,  our ability  historically to generate
revenue share greater than our audience share, our network  affiliations and our
local  program  acceptance.  In  addition,  we believe  that we benefit from the
operation   of   multiple   broadcast    properties,    affording   us   certain
non-quantifiable  economies of scale and competitive  advantages in the purchase
of programming.

     Radio Competition. Radio broadcasting is a highly competitive business, and
each of the radio  stations  operated  by us  competes  for  audience  share and
advertising revenue directly with other radio stations in our geographic market,
as well as with other media, including television, cable television, newspapers,
magazines,  direct mail and  billboard  advertising.  The  audience  ratings and
advertising  revenue of each of such  stations  are  subject to change,  and any
adverse  change in a particular  market could have a material  adverse effect on
the revenue of such radio stations located in that market.  We cannot assure you
that any one of our radio  stations  will be able to maintain  or  increase  its
current audience ratings and radio advertising revenue market share.

     The radio  broadcasting  industry is also subject to  competition  from new
media technologies that are being developed or introduced,  such as the delivery
of  audio  programming  by  cable  television   systems  and  by  digital  audio
broadcasting  (DAB).  DAB may provide a medium for the  delivery by satellite or
terrestrial  means of  multiple  new  audio  programming  formats  to local  and
national  audiences.  Also, new technology has introduced the broadcast of radio
programming  over the Internet.  This new  capability  may provide an additional
source of competition in some of our markets. In addition, the FCC has created a
new low-power FM radio service,  which may create new competition in some of our
radio markets.

EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 1999, we had  approximately  3,700  employees.  With the
exception of certain employees of KOVR-TV,  KDNL-TV,  WSYX-TV, WCHS-TV, WGGB-TV,
WGME-TV,  KGAN-TV,  WICS-TV and certain  employees at two radio  stations in St.
Louis  (totaling  approximately  280  employees),   none  of  our  employees  is
represented by labor unions under any collective bargaining  agreement.  We have
not experienced  any  significant  labor problems and consider our overall labor
relations to be good.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

     Generally,  each of our  stations  has  facilities  consisting  of offices,
studios  and tower  sites.  Transmitter  and tower  sites are located to provide
maximum signal coverage of our stations' markets.  The following is a summary of
our  principal  owned and  leased  real  properties  as we  believe  that no one
property represents a material amount of the total properties owned or leased.

     We believe that all of our properties, both owned and leased, are generally
in good operating  condition,  subject to normal wear and tear, and are suitable
and adequate for our current business operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     Lawsuits and claims are filed  against us from time to time in the ordinary
course of  business.  These  actions  are in various  preliminary  stages and no
judgments or decisions have been rendered by hearing boards or courts. We do not
believe  that  these  actions,  individually  or in the  aggregate,  will have a
material adverse affect on our financial condition or results of operations.  In
addition to certain actions arising in the ordinary course, two actions relating
to  disposition  of assets have been asserted as described more fully in "Item 1
- -- Business--Pending Dispositions."

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     No matters were submitted to a vote of our  stockholders  during the fourth
quarter of 1999.

     As of March 24, 2000, there were  approximately  101 stockholders of record
of our common  stock.  This number does not include  beneficial  owners  holding
shares through nominee names.  Based on information  available to us, we believe
we have more than 5,000 beneficial owners of our class A common stock.

     We generally have not paid a dividend on our common stock and do not expect
to pay dividends on our common stock in the  foreseeable  future.  Our 1998 bank
credit  agreement and certain of our  subordinated  debt generally  prohibits us
from paying  dividends on our common stock.  Under the indentures  governing our
10% senior  subordinated  notes due 2005, 9% senior  subordinated notes due 2007
and 8 3/4%  senior  subordinated  notes due 2007,  we are not  permitted  to pay
dividends on our common stock unless certain specified conditions are satisfied,
including that

     o    no event of default then exists under the  indenture or certain  other
          specified agreements relating to our indebtedness and

     o    we, after  taking  account of the  dividend,  are in  compliance  with
          certain net cash flow  requirements  contained  in the  indenture.  In
          addition,  under certain of our senior  unsecured debt, the payment of
          dividends is not permissible during a default thereunder.

ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

     The selected  consolidated  financial data for the years ended December 31,
1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999 have been derived from our audited consolidated
financial statements.  The consolidated financial statements for the years ended
December 31, 1997, 1998 and 1999 are included elsewhere in this report.

(e)  "Broadcast cash flow" (BCF) is defined as broadcast  operating  income plus
     corporate expenses, special bonuses paid to executive officers, stock-based
     compensation,  depreciation and amortization  (including film  amortization
     and amortization of deferred compensation),  less cash payments for program
     rights.  Cash program  payments  represent  cash  payments made for current
     programs  payable and do not  necessarily  correspond to program usage.  We
     have  presented  BCF  data,  which we  believe  is  comparable  to the data
     provided by other companies in the industry, because such data are commonly
     used as a measure of performance for broadcast  companies;  however,  there
     can be no assurance that it is comparable. However, BCF does not purport to
     represent  cash  provided  by  operating  activities  as  reflected  in our
     consolidated  statements  of cash flows and is not a measure  of  financial
     performance under generally accepted  accounting  principles.  In addition,
     BCF should not be considered  in isolation or as a substitute  for measures
     of performance  prepared in accordance with generally  accepted  accounting
     principles.  Management  believes the  presentation  of BCF is relevant and
     useful  because 1) it is a  measurement  utilized by lenders to measure our
     ability to service its debt,  2) it is a  measurement  utilized by industry
     analysts to determine a private  market value of our  television  and radio
     stations  and  3)  it  is a  measurement  industry  analysts  utilize  when

(f)  "Broadcast  cash flow margin" is defined as broadcast  cash flow divided by
     net  broadcast  revenues.  "Adjust  EBITDA  margin" is defined as  Adjusted
     EBITDA divided by net broadcast revenues.

(g)  "Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as broadcast cash flow less corporate expenses
     and is a commonly used measure of performance for broadcast  companies.  We
     have presented  Adjusted EBITDA data, which we believe is comparable to the
     data  provided by other  companies in the  industry,  because such data are
     commonly used as a measure of performance for broadcast companies; however,
     there can be no assurances that it is comparable.  Adjusted EBITDA does not
     purport to represent cash provided by operating  activities as reflected in

     amortization),  stock-based  compensation,  unrealized  loss on  derivative
     instrument  (or minus the gain),  the  deferred  tax  provision  related to

     assets and deferred NOL carry backs.  We have presented after tax cash flow
     data,  which  we  believe  is  comparable  to the  data  provided  by other
     companies in the industry, because such data are commonly used as a measure
     of performance for broadcast companies; however, there can be no assurances
     that it is comparable. ATCF is presented here not as a measure of operating
     results  and does not  purport to  represent  cash  provided  by  operating
     activities.  ATCF should not be  considered in isolation or as a substitute
     for measures of performance  prepared in accordance with generally accepted
     accounting  principles.  Management  believes the  presentation  of ATCF is
     relevant  and useful  because  ATCF is a  measurement  utilized by industry
     analysts to  determine a public  market value of our  television  and radio
     stations and ATCF is a measurement  analysts  utilize when  determining our
     operating performance.

(i)  "Total debt" is defined as long-term debt, net of unamortized discount, and
     capital lease  obligations,  including current portion thereof.  Total debt

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

     We are a diversified broadcasting company that owns or provides programming
services pursuant to LMAs to more television  stations than any other commercial
broadcasting  group the United States. We currently own, or provide  programming
services  pursuant to LMAs to, 61  television  stations  and 11 radio  stations.
During 1999, we sold the majority of our radio stations and we have entered into
agreements  to sell or intend to enter into to sell in the future our  remaining
radio stations. In addition,  we own equity interests in three  Internet-related
companies.

     Our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and,
to a much lesser extent,  from  political  advertisers  and  television  network
compensation. Our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward
and revenues from national  advertisers  have  continued to trend  downward when
measured as a percentage of local  broadcast  revenue.  We believe this trend is
primarily  resulting  from an increase in the number of media outlets  providing
national advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services.  Our
efforts to mitigate this trend include  continuing our efforts to increase local
revenues  and  the  development  of  innovative  marketing  strategies  to  sell
traditional and non-traditional services to national advertisers.

     Our primary operating expenses involved in owning, operating or programming
the  television   and  radio  stations  are  syndicated   program  rights  fees,
commissions  on revenues,  employee  salaries,  and  news-gathering  and station
promotional  costs.  Amortization  and depreciation of costs associated with the
acquisition  of the  stations  and  interest  carrying  charges are  significant
factors in determining our overall profitability.

     Our primary types of programming and their approximate  percentages of 1999
net broadcast revenues were syndicated programming (64.1%),  network programming
(24.2%),  direct advertising  programming (5.8%),  sports programming (4.0%) and
children's  programming  (1.9%).  Similarly,  our  four  largest  categories  of

were automotive (22.0%), fast food advertising (8.0%),  retail/department stores
(7.0%) and professional services (5.6%). No other advertising category accounted
for more than 5% of our net broadcast revenues in 1999. No individual advertiser
accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated net broadcast revenues in 1999.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1999 AND 1998

     Net broadcast  revenues  increased $105.6 million to $670.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999 from $564.7 million for the year ended December 31,
1998,  or 18.7%.  The  increase  in net  broadcast  revenue  for the year  ended
December 31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998  comprised of
$106.9 million  related to businesses  acquired or disposed of by us in 1998 and
1999  (collectively  the 1998 and 1999  Transactions)  offset by a $1.3  million
decrease in net broadcast revenues on a same station basis,  representing a 0.3%
decrease over prior year's net broadcast  revenue for these stations.  On a same
station basis,  revenues were  negatively  impacted by a decrease in revenues in
the Raleigh,  Norfolk and Sacramento  markets.  Our  television  stations in the
Raleigh and Norfolk markets  experienced a decrease in ratings which resulted in
a loss in revenues and market  revenue share  primarily due to the loss of their
affiliation  agreements  with Fox,  which  expired  on August 31,  1998.  In the
Sacramento  market,  revenues  decreased for the year ended December 31, 1999 as
compared to the same period in 1998 due to the absence of political  and olympic
revenues experienced during 1998.

     On a same station basis, our national revenues decreased approximately 4.0%
and our local  revenues  increased  approximately  4.2%. Our revenues from local
advertisers   have   continued  to  trend  upward  and  revenues  from  national
advertisers  have  continued to trend  downward when measured as a percentage of
local broadcast  revenue.  We believe this trend is primarily  resulting from an
increase in the number of media outlets providing  national  advertisers a means
by which to advertise their goods or services.

     Total  operating  costs  increased  $62.8 million to $283.3 million for the
year ended December 31, 1999 from $220.5 million for the year ended December 31,
1998, or 28.5%.  The increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31,
1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998 comprised of $55.4 million
related to the 1998 and 1999  Transactions,  $2.4 million related to an increase
in  corporate  overhead  expenses,  and $5.0  million  related to an increase in
operating costs on a same station basis, representing a 3.5% increase over prior
year's  operating costs for those stations.  The increase in corporate  overhead
expenses  for the year  ended  December  31,  1999  primarily  resulted  from an
increase  in legal fees and an  increase  in salary  costs  incurred to manage a
larger base of  operations.  The increase in  operating  costs on a same station
basis  primarily  resulted  from  costs  incurred  during  1999  related  to our
agreements  with the Fox and WB networks  which were not  incurred in 1998.  Our
payments to the Fox network  related to the  purchase of  additional  prime time
inventory and our payments to the WB network  related to our agreement  with the
network  which  requires us to make payments as ratings  increase.  We expect to
incur these costs in future periods. In addition,  we experienced an increase in
commissions  due to a larger number of local account  executives.  The increased
number of account  executives is part of our strategy to increase the percentage
of our revenues  derived from local  advertising  and we expect this to increase
further in 2000 as we add additional account  executives.  See "Item 1. Business
- -- Television Broadcasting (Innovative Local Sales and Marketing)".

     Depreciation and amortization increased $47.4 million to $224.6 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999 from $177.2 million for the year ended December
31, 1998. The increase in depreciation and amortization  related to fixed asset,
intangible  asset,  and program  contract  additions  associated with businesses
acquired during 1998 and 1999.

     Interest  expense  increased  $39.3 million to $178.3  million for the year
ended  December  31, 1999 from $139.0  million for the year ended  December  31,
1998, or 28.3%. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31,
1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998  primarily  resulted  from
higher interest  expense  related to  acquisitions  closed in the second half of
1998 and a high  applicable  interest rate margin for  borrowing  under our bank
credit  agreement.  Subsidiary trust minority  interest expense of $23.3 million
for the year ended December 31, 1999 is related to the private  placement of the
$200  million  aggregate  liquidation  value 11 5/8 % high yield  trust  offered
preferred securities (the HYTOPS) completed March 12, 1997.

     Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $3.5  million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 from $6.7 million for the year ended  December 31, 1998.  This
decrease was  primarily  due to the decrease in the average cash balance  during
the 1999 fiscal year as compared to the same period in 1998.

                                       31

<PAGE>

     Net income for the year ended December 31, 1999 was $167.8 million or $1.63
per share  compared  to a net loss of $16.9  million  or $0.29 per share for the
year  ended  December  31,  1998.  The  change in net  income for the year ended
December  31, 1999 as compared to the net loss for the year ended  December  31,
1998 was primarily due to the gain on the sale of radio broadcast assets related
to discontinued  operations.  In addition, the change in net income for the year
ended  December 31, 1999 as compared to the net loss for the year ended December
31, 1998 was also  attributable  to the  recognition of an unrealized  gain on a
treasury  option  derivative  instrument,  offset  by an  increase  in  interest
expense.

     As noted  above,  our net  income  for the year  ended  December  31,  1999
included recognition of an unrealized gain of $15.7 million on a treasury option
derivative  instrument.   Upon  execution  of  the  treasury  option  derivative
instrument,  we received a cash payment of $9.5  million.  The  treasury  option
derivative  instrument will require us to make five annual payments equal to the
difference  between  6.14% minus the interest  rate yield on five-year  treasury
securities on September 30, 2000 times the $300 million  notional  amount of the
instrument.  If the yield on  five-year  treasuries  is equal to or greater than
6.14% on September  30, 2000,  we will not be required to make any payment under
the terms of this  instrument.  If the rate is below 6.14% on that date, we will
be required to make payments,  as described  above,  and the size of the payment
will increase as the rate goes down.  Each year, we recognize  income or expense
equal to the change in the projected  liability under this arrangement  based on
interest  rates at the end of the year. If the yield on five-year  treasuries at
September 30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year treasury rate on
December 31, 1999 for treasuries  settled on September 30, 2000, we would not be
required to make payments.

     Broadcast cash flow increased  $27.0 million to $332.3 million for the year
ended  December  31, 1999 from $305.3  million for the year ended  December  31,
1998, or 8.8%.  The increase in broadcast  cash flow for the year ended December
31, 1999 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1998 was comprised of $36.0
million  related  to the 1998 and 1999  Transactions  offset  by a $9.0  million
decrease in broadcast  cash flow on a same station  basis,  representing  a 4.1%
decrease over prior year's broadcast cash flow for those stations. This decrease
in  broadcast  cash flow on a same  station  basis  primarily  resulted  from an
increase in operating expenses and film payments combined with a slight decrease
in net broadcast revenues. Our broadcast cash flow margin decreased to 49.6% for
the year ended  December  31,  1999 from 54.1% for the year ended  December  31,
1998. On a same station basis,  broadcast cash flow margin  decreased from 52.9%
for the year ended  December  31, 1998 to 50.9% for the year ended  December 31,
1999. The decrease in broadcast cash flow margin for the year ended December 31,
1999 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily  resulted from an
increase in operating expenses and film payments combined with a slight decrease
in net broadcast revenues.

     Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses.
Adjusted  EBITDA  increased  $24.6 million to $313.3  million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 from $288.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 1998, or
8.5%.  The increase in adjusted  EBITDA for the year ended  December 31, 1999 as
compared to the year ended  December  31, 1998  resulted  from the 1998 and 1999
Transactions  offset by a $2.4 million increase in corporate  overhead expenses,
as described  above.  Our adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 46.7% for the year
ended  December 31, 1999 from 51.1% for the year ended  December 31, 1998.  This
decrease in adjusted  EBITDA margin  resulted  primarily from the  circumstances
affecting  broadcast  cash flow margins as noted above combined with an increase
in corporate expenses.

     After tax cash flow decreased  $12.6 million to $137.2 million for the year
ended  December  31, 1999 from $149.8  million for the year ended  December  31,
1998, or 8.4%.  The decrease in after tax cash flow for the year ended  December
31, 1999 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1998 primarily resulted from
an increase in interest expense offset by a net increase in broadcast  operating
income relating to the 1998 and 1999 Transactions.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1998 AND 1997

     Net broadcast  revenue  increased  $157.3 million to $564.7 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 from $407.4 million for the year ended December 31,
1997,  or 38.6%.  The  increase  in net  broadcast  revenue  for the year  ended
December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997

                                       32

<PAGE>

comprised of $152.6 million related to businesses  acquired or disposed of by us
in 1998 (the 1998  Transactions)  and $4.7 million  resulted from an increase in
net broadcast  revenues on a same station  basis,  representing  a 1.2% increase
over prior year's net broadcast  revenue for these  stations.  On a same station
basis,  revenues  were  negatively  impacted  by a decrease  in  revenues in the
Baltimore,  Milwaukee,  Norfolk and Raleigh markets.  Our television stations in
these  markets  experienced  a decrease in ratings  which  resulted in a loss in
revenues  and market  revenue  share.  In the  Raleigh  and  Norfolk  television
markets,  our  affiliation  agreements with Fox expired on August 31, 1998 which
further  contributed  to a decrease in ratings and  revenues.  In the  Baltimore
market, the addition of a new UPN affiliate competitor  contributed to a loss in
ratings and market revenue share. An additional factor which negatively impacted
station  revenues  for the  year  was the  loss of  General  Motors  advertising
revenues  caused by a strike of its employees.  These  decreases in revenue on a
same  station  basis  were  offset by  revenue  growth at  certain  of our other
television  stations combined with an increase in network  compensation  revenue
and political advertising revenue.

     Total  operating  costs  increased  $66.6 million to $220.5 million for the
year ended December 31, 1998 from $153.9 million for the year ended December 31,
1997, or 43.3%.  The increase in operating costs for the year ended December 31,
1998 as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997 comprised of $64.3 million
related  to the 1998  Transactions,  $4.2  million  related  to an  increase  in
corporate  overhead  expenses,  and  $2.3  million  related  to an  increase  in
operating costs on a same station basis, representing a 1.7% increase over prior
year's  operating costs for those stations.  The increase in corporate  overhead
expenses  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998  primarily  resulted  from an
increase  in legal fees and an  increase  in salary  costs  incurred to manage a
larger base of operations.

     Depreciation and amortization increased $39.9 million to $177.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 1998 from $137.3 million for the year ended December
31, 1997, or 29.1%.  The increase in depreciation  and  amortization  related to
fixed asset and intangible asset additions  associated with businesses  acquired
during 1997 and 1998.

     Broadcast  operating  income  increased $50.6 million to $169.7 million for
the year  ended  December  31,  1998,  from  $119.1  million  for the year ended
December 31, 1997, or 42.5%. The net increase in broadcast  operating income for
the year ended December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997
was primarily attributable to the 1998 Transactions.

     Interest  expense  increased  $40.6 million to $139.0  million for the year
ended December 31, 1998 from $98.4 million for the year ended December 31, 1997,
or 41.3%.  The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1998
primarily  related to indebtedness  incurred by us to finance the  Acquisitions.
Subsidiary  trust minority  interest expense of $23.3 million for the year ended
December  31,  1998 is  related to the  private  placement  of the $200  million
aggregate liquidation value 115/8% high yield trust offered preferred securities
(HYTOPS)  completed  March 12, 1997.  The increase in subsidiary  trust minority
interest  expense for the year ended  December  31, 1998 as compared to the year
ended  December 31, 1997 related to the HYTOPS being  outstanding  for a partial
period during 1997.

     Interest  and other  income  increased  to $6.7  million for the year ended
December 31, 1998 from $2.2 million for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  This
increase was primarily due to higher average cash balances during these periods.
However,  cash  balances  were lower at December  31, 1998 than at December  31,
1997.

     Net loss for the year ended  December  31, 1998 was $16.9  million or $0.29
per share  compared to net loss of $10.6 million or $0.19 per share for the year
ended December 31, 1997. Net loss increased for the year ended December 31, 1998
as compared to the year ended  December 31, 1997 due to an increase in operating
expenses,  depreciation and  amortization,  interest  expense,  subsidiary trust
minority interest expense, the recognition of an unrealized loss of $9.1 million
on a derivative  instrument and the recognition of an extraordinary  loss offset
by an increase in total revenues,  a gain on the sale of broadcast assets and an
increase in interest and other income.  Our extraordinary  loss of $11.1 million
net of a related tax benefit of $7.4 million resulted from the write-off of debt
acquisition costs associated with indebtedness  replaced by the 1998 bank credit
agreement.

                                       33

<PAGE>

     As noted above,  our net loss for the year ended December 31, 1998 included
recognition  of  a  loss  of  $9.1  million  on  a  treasury  option  derivative
instrument.  Upon execution of the treasury  option  derivative  instrument,  we
received  a cash  payment  of  $9.5  million.  The  treasury  option  derivative
instrument  will require us to make five annual payments equal to the difference
between 6.14% minus the interest rate yield on five-year treasury  securities on
September 30, 2000 times the $300 million notional amount of the instrument.  If
the yield on five-year treasuries is equal to or greater than 6.14% on September
30,  2000,  we will not be required to make any payment  under the terms of this
instrument. If the rate is below 6.14% on that date, we will be required to make
payments,  as described  above, and the size of the payment will increase as the
rate goes down.  Each year,  we recognize an expense  equal to the change in the
projected liability under this arrangement based on interest rates at the end of
the year.  The loss  recognized in the year ended  December 31, 1998 reflects an
adjustment of our liability under this instrument to the present value of future
payments based on the two-year  forward  five-year  treasury rate as of December
31, 1998.  If the yield on five-year  treasuries  at September  30, 2000 were to
equal the two year forward five year  treasury rate on December 31, 1998 (4.6%),
we would be required to make five annual payments of approximately  $4.6 million
each. If the yield on five-year  treasuries  declines  further in periods before
September  30, 2000,  we will be required to recognize  further  losses.  In any
event, we will not be required to make any payments until September 30, 2000.

     Broadcast cash flow increased  $83.7 million to $305.3 million for the year
ended  December  31, 1998 from $221.6  million for the year ended  December  31,
1997, or 37.8%.  The increase in broadcast cash flow for the year ended December
31, 1998 as  compared to the year ended  December  31, 1997  comprised  of $86.7
million related to the 1998  Transactions  offset by a $3.0 million  decrease in
broadcast cash flow on a same station  basis,  representing a 1.4% decrease over
prior year's  broadcast cash flow for those stations.  The decrease in broadcast
cash flow primarily related to an increase in film payments.  Our broadcast cash
flow margin  decreased to 54.1% for the year ended  December 31, 1998 from 54.4%
for the year ended December 31, 1997. The decrease in broadcast cash flow margin
for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31,
1998  primarily  resulted  from an increase  in film  payments  combined  with a
disproportionate  increase in net broadcast  revenue.  On a same station  basis,
broadcast cash flow margin  decreased from 54.4% for the year ended December 31,
1997 to 53.0% for the year ended December 31, 1998.

     Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses.
Adjusted  EBITDA  increased  $79.5 million to $288.7  million for the year ended
December 31, 1998 from $209.2  million for the year ended  December 31, 1997, or
38.0%.  The increase in adjusted  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1998 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 resulted from the 1998 Transactions
offset by a $4.2 million increase in corporate overhead  expenses,  as described
above. Our adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 51.1% for the year ended December
31,  1998 from 51.4% for the year ended  December  31,  1997.  This  decrease in
adjusted  EBITDA margin  resulted  primarily  from the  circumstances  affecting
broadcast  cash  flow  margins  as noted  above  combined  with an  increase  in
corporate expenses.

     After tax cash flow increased  $44.9 million to $149.8 million for the year
ended  December  31, 1998 from $104.9  million for the year ended  December  31,
1997, or 42.8%.  The increase in after tax cash Flow for the year ended December
31, 1998 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1997 primarily resulted from
a net increase in broadcast  operating income relating to the 1998  Transactions
offset by an increase in interest expense and subsidiary trust minority interest
expense relating to the HYTOPS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     Our  primary  source  of  liquidity  is cash  provided  by  operations  and
availability  under our 1998 bank credit agreement.  As of December 31, 1999, we
had $16.4  million in cash  balances and excluding the effect of assets held for
sale,  broadcast  assets  related to  discontinued  operations  and income taxes
payable,  working capital of approximately  $44.5 million. As of March 15, 2000,
the remaining  balance  available under the revolving credit facility was $650.0
million.  Based on pro forma  trailing  cash flow  levels for the twelve  months
ended December 31, 1999, we had approximately $224.2 million available of

                                       34

current  borrowing  capacity under our revolving credit facility.  Our 1998 bank
credit  agreement also provides for an incremental  term loan  commitment in the
amount of up to $400 million  which can be utilized  upon  approval by the agent
bank and the raising of sufficient commitments from banks to fund the additional
loans.

     In July 1999,  we entered into an  agreement  to sell 46 radio  stations in
nine  markets  to  Entercom  Communications  Corporation  (Entercom)  for $824.5
million in cash. The transaction  does not include our radio stations in the St.
Louis  market which are subject to the St. Louis  purchase  option.  In December
1999, we closed on the sale of 41 radio stations in eight markets for a purchase
price of $700.4  million.  We expect to close on the  remaining  $124.1  million
during  2000 which  represents  the Kansas  City radio  stations  and WKRF-FM in
Wilkes-Barre.  The  completion of the Kansas City  transaction is subject to FCC
and  Department  of  Justice  approval.   The  completion  of  the  Wilkes-Barre
transaction  is  subject  only  to FCC  approval  and  the  outcome  of  pending
litigation  in which a former  licensee  is seeking  the  return of the  WKRF-FM
license based on a fraudulent conveyance claim.

     On April 19, 1999, we entered into an agreement  (the ATC  Agreement)  with
American  Tower  Corporation,  an independent  owner,  operator and developer of
broadcast  and  wireless  communication  sites in the United  States.  Under the
agreement,  we would provide American Tower access to tower sites in a number of
our markets  including  Nashville,  TN, Dayton,  OH, Richmond,  VA, Mobile,  AL,
Pensacola, FL, San Antonio, TX, and Syracuse, NY. American Tower would construct
new towers in each of these  markets  and would lease space on the towers to us.
This is expected to provide us the additional tower capacity required to develop
its digital television transmission needs in these markets at an initial capital
outlay lower than would be required if we  constructed  these towers  ourselves.
The form of the master lease has been  completed  and agreed to;  however,  each
market is subject to individual  negotiations  on terms specific to that market,
which are still being negotiated with American Tower  Corporation.  If we cannot
agree with American Tower on the terms and  conditions of the individual  market
leases,  neither  party  will have any  obligation  to the  other  under the ATC
Agreement, which will then become a nullity.

     Net cash flows from  operating  activities  decreased to $130.2 million for
the year ended December 31, 1999 from $150.5 million for the year ended December
31, 1998 primarily as a result of the increase in program contract payments.  We
made  payments of interest on  outstanding  indebtedness  and  subsidiary  trust
minority interest expense totaling $227.2 million during the year ended December
31, 1999 as compared to $140.9  million for the year ended  December  31,  1998.
Program rights  payments for the year ended  December 31, 1999  increased  $18.4
million or 30.1%.  This  increase in program  rights  payments was  comprised of
$15.7 million related to the 1998 and 1999 Transactions and $2.7 million related
to an increase in  programming  costs on a same  station  basis which  increased
4.9%.

     Net cash flows from  investing  activities  was $453.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999 compared to net cash flows used in investing  activities
of $1.8  billion  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998.  For the year  ended
December 31, 1999, we made cash payments of approximately $237.3 million related
to the  acquisition  of  television  and radio  broadcast  assets  primarily  by
utilizing  available  indebtedness  under our 1998 bank credit agreement.  These
payments  included  $118.6  million  related  to  the  April  1999  Guy  Gannett
acquisition,  $83.6  million  related to the July 1999 Guy Gannett  acquisition,
$14.1  million  related to the St. Louis Radio  acquisition,  and $21.0  million
related to other acquisitions. For the year ended December 31, 1999, we received
approximately  $733.9  million of cash  proceeds  related to the sale of certain
television  and radio  broadcast  assets which was  primarily  utilized to repay
indebtedness under the 1998 bank credit agreement.  These cash proceeds included
$674.1 million related to the Entercom disposition, $23.7 million related to the
Barnstable disposition,  $35.9 million related to the CCA disposition,  and $0.2
million related to other dispositions.  During the year ended December 31, 1999,
we made equity interest  investments of approximately  $14.2 million,  including
$7.6 million  related to an investment in Acrodyne,  $2.4 million  related to an
investment in Allegiance Capital Limited Partnership, $2.2 million related to an
investment  in  BeautyBuys.com,  and $2.0 million  related to an  investment  in
Tuscaloosa  Tower.  We made payments for property and equipment of $30.9 million
for the year ended  December 31, 1999. In addition,  we  anticipate  that future
requirements for capital

                                       35

<PAGE>

expenditures  will include  capital  expenditures  incurred  during the ordinary
course of business and  additional  strategic  station  acquisitions  and equity
investments if suitable investments can be identified on acceptable terms.

     Net cash flows used in financing activities was $570.0 million for the year
ended December 31, 1999 compared to net cash flows from financing  activities of
$1.5  billion  for the year  ended  December  31,  1998.  During  the year ended
December  31,  1999,  we  repaid  $857.5  million  and $50.0  million  under the
revolving  credit  facility and term loan  facility  components of the 1998 bank
credit  agreement,  respectively,  primarily  from proceeds of the sale of radio
stations.  In  addition,  we  utilized  borrowings  under the  revolving  credit
facility of $357.5 million primarily to fund acquisition  activity including the
Guy Gannett acquisition. During 1999 and as of December 31, 1999, we repurchased
and retired  320,000 shares of our class A common stock for  approximately  $3.5
million.  During  2000 and as of March 24,  2000,  we  repurchased  and  retired
3,460,066 shares of our class A common stock for aproximately $32.7 million.

INCOME TAXES

     The income tax  provision  increased  to $174.9  million for the year ended
December 31, 1999 from a provision of $45.7 million for the year ended  December
31, 1998.  For the year ended  December 31, 1999,  the provision for  continuing
operations  and  discontinued  operations  is $25.1  million and $149.8  million
respectively. For the year ended December 31, 1998, the provision for continuing
operations and discontinuing operations is $32.6 and $13.1 million respectively.
For 1999, our pre-tax book loss from continuing operations was $17.0 million and
we recorded a tax expense of $25.1  million.  We recognized  this provision on a
pre-tax loss because our  non-deductible tax items were in excess of the pre-tax
loss and these items caused continuing  operations to have taxable income. These
non-deductible  tax  items  primarily   consisted  of  non-deductible   goodwill
associated with stock acquisitions.

     As of December  31, 1999,  we have a net  deferred tax  liability of $228.7
million as compared to a net  deferred  tax  liability  of $165.5  million as of
December 31, 1998.  The  increase in net  deferred tax  liability  from the year
ended December 31, 1998 to the year ended December 31, 1999 is due to the use of
federal and state net operating losses and alternative  minimum tax credits as a
result of the sale of radio assets.  Additionally,  accelerated tax depreciation
and  amortization of fixed and intangible  assets  contributed to an increase in
deferred tax liabilities.

     The income tax  provision  increased  to $45.7  million  for the year ended
December 31, 1998 from a provision of $16.0 million for the year ended  December
31, 1997. Our effective tax rate increased to 511.9% for the year ended December
31, 1998 from 302.0% for the year ended  December 31, 1997.  The increase in the
effective tax rate for the year ended  December 31, 1998 as compared to the year
ended  December 31, 1997 primarily  resulted from an increase in  non-deductible
tax items including the deferred tax liability related to the HYTOPS transaction
and non-deductible goodwill related to stock acquisitions.

SEASONALITY

     Our results usually are subject to seasonal  fluctuations,  which result in
fourth  quarter  broadcast  operating  income being greater  usually than first,
second  and third  quarter  broadcast  operating  income.  This  seasonality  is
primarily  attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation
of holiday season spending and an increase in viewership  during this period. In
addition, revenues from political advertising tend to be higher in even numbered
years.

YEAR 2000

     We spent  approximately  $2.5  million  over the  past two  years  updating
hardware and software systems to ensure Year 2000 compliance. The four phases of
our Year 2000 plan  consisted  of:  inventory  and data  collection;  compliance
requests;  test fix and verify;  final testing and new item compliance.  Each of
the four phases of our Year 2000 process have been successfully completed and no
disruptions to operations occurred as a result of Year 2000.

     Although we have completed all phases of our Year 2000  compliance  project
and currently  believe all of our systems to be Year 2000  compliant,  we cannot
assure you that any of our systems will be Year 2000  compliant in future dates.
In addition, we cannot assure you that outside systems indirectly related to our
operations  are Year 2000  compliant  or will be Year 2000  compliant  in future
dates.

RISK FACTORS

     We believe  that our future  operating  results  and funds  generated  from
operations  and available  under our credit  facility will be sufficient to meet
general  corporate   requirements  and  planned  capital  expenditures  for  the
foreseeable  future.  However,  we  cannot  identify  nor  can  we  control  all
circumstances  that could  occur in the  future  that may  adversely  affect our
business and results of operations. Some of the circumstances that may occur and
may  impair  our  business  are  described   below.  If  any  of  the  following
circumstances  were  to  occur,  our  business  could  be  materially  adversely
affected.

                                       37

OUR  SUBSTANTIAL  INDEBTEDNESS  COULD  ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR  OPERATIONS AND OUR
ABILITY TO FULFILL OUR OBLIGATIONS TO YOU.

     We  have  a  high  level  of  debt  and  other   obligations   compared  to
stockholders' equity. Our obligations include the following:

     Indebtedness  under the bank credit agreement.  As of December 31, 1999, we
     owed  $1,003  million  under  our bank  credit  agreement  and had a $650.0
     million remaining balance available.  Based on pro forma trailing cash flow
     levels for the twelve months ended December 31, 1999, we had  approximately
     $224.2  million  available  of current  borrowing  capacity  under our bank
     credit agreement.

     Indebtedness  under notes. We have issued and  outstanding  three series of
     senior  subordinated  notes. The total amount outstanding under these notes
     as of December 31, 1999 was $750.0 million.

     Obligations under High Yield Trust Offered Preferred  Securities  (HYTOPS).
     Sinclair Capital,  a subsidiary trust of Sinclair,  has issued $200 million
     aggregate  liquidation  amount of HYTOPS.  "Aggregate  liquidation  amount"
     means the amount  Sinclair  Capital must pay to the holders when it redeems
     the HYTOPS or upon liquidation.  Sinclair Capital must redeem the HYTOPS in
     2009. We are indirectly liable for the HYTOPS obligations because we issued
     $206.2  million  liquidation  amount of series C  preferred  stock to KDSM,
     Inc.,  our wholly  owned  subsidiary,  to support  $200  million  aggregate
     principal  amount of 11 5/8%  notes  that  KDSM,  Inc.  issued to  Sinclair
     Capital to support the HYTOPS.

     Series D Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock. We have issued 3,450,000
     shares  of  series  D  convertible  exchangeable  preferred  stock  with an
     aggregate  liquidation  preference of  approximately  $172.5  million.  The
     liquidation  preference  means we would be  required  to pay the  holder of
     series D convertible  exchangeable preferred stock $172.5 million before we
     paid  holders  of common  stock (or any other  stock  that is junior to the
     series D convertible  exchangeable  preferred  stock) in any liquidation of
     Sinclair.  We are  not  obligated  to buy  back  or  retire  the  series  D
     convertible  exchangeable  preferred  stock,  but  may do so at our  option
     beginning  in 2000 at a  conversion  rate of  $22.8125  per share.  In some
     circumstances,  we may also exchange the series D convertible  exchangeable
     preferred stock for 6%  subordinated  debentures due 2012 with an aggregate
     principal amount of $172.5 million.

     Program  Contracts  Payable  and  Programming  Commitments.  We enter  into
     contracts to purchase future  programming.  Under these contracts,  we were
     obligated  on December  31, 1999 to make future  payments  totaling  $176.1
     million.

     Our relatively  high level of debt poses the following  risks to you and to
Sinclair:

     o    We use a  significant  portion of our cash flow to pay  principal  and
          interest on our  outstanding  debt and to pay  dividends  on preferred
          stock.  This will limit the amount  available for other purposes.  For
          the year ended  December 31, 1999,  we would have been required to pay
          $159.7 million in interest and preferred dividends (including dividend
          payments  on  the  HYTOPS)  if  all of  our  material  securities  and
          acquisition  and  divestiture   transactions   during  1999  had  been
          completed as of January 1, 1999.

     o    Our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for
          future  working  capital  needs,  additional  acquisitions,  or  other
          purposes.

     o    The interest rate under our bank credit  agreement is a floating rate,
          and will  increase  if  general  interest  rates  increase.  This will
          increase  the  portion of our cash flow that must be spent on interest
          payments.

     o    We may be more  vulnerable to adverse  economic  conditions  than less
          leveraged  competitors  and thus  less able to  withstand  competitive
          pressures.

                                       38

<PAGE>

     o    If our cash  flow  were  inadequate  to make  interest  and  principal
          payments,  we might have to refinance our  indebtedness or sell one or
          more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations.

     Any of these effects could reduce the trading value of our securities.

OUR FLEXIBILITY IS LIMITED BY PROMISES WE HAVE MADE TO OUR LENDERS.

     Our existing  financing  agreements  prevent us from taking certain actions
and require us to meet certain tests.  These  restrictions and tests include the
following:

          o    Restrictions on additional debt,

          o    Restrictions  on our ability to pledge our assets as security for
               our indebtedness,

          o    Restrictions on payment of dividends, the repurchase of stock and
               other payments relating to capital stock,

          o    Restrictions  on some sales of assets and the use of  proceeds of
               asset sales,

          o    Restrictions on mergers and other  acquisitions,  satisfaction of
               conditions for  acquisitions,  and a limit on the total amount of
               acquisitions without consent of bank lenders,

          o    Restrictions  on the type of businesses  we and our  subsidiaries
               may be in,

          o    Restrictions  on  type  and  amounts  of  investments  we and our
               subsidiaries may make, and

          o    Financial  ratio  and  condition  tests  including  the  ratio of
               earnings before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation and amortization
               (EBITDA)  to total  interest  expense,  the  ratio of  EBITDA  to
               certain of our fixed  expenses,  and the ratio of indebtedness to
               EBITDA.

     Future  financing  arrangements  may contain  additional  restrictions  and
tests. These restrictions and tests may prevent us from taking action that could
increase the value of our  securities,  or may require actions that decrease the
value of  securities.  In  addition,  we may fail to meet the tests and  thereby
default on one or more of our  obligations.  If we  default on our  obligations,
creditors  could require  immediate  payment of the  obligations or foreclose on
collateral.  If this  happened,  we could be forced to sell assets or take other
action that would reduce the value of our securities.

KEY OFFICERS AND  DIRECTORS  HAVE  FINANCIAL  INTERESTS  THAT ARE  DIFFERENT AND
SOMETIMES OPPOSITE TO THOSE OF SINCLAIR.

     Some of our officers and  directors own stock or  partnership  interests in
businesses  that engage in  television  broadcasting,  do  business  with us, or
otherwise  do  business  that  conflicts  with our  interests.  David D.  Smith,
Frederick  G.  Smith,  and J. Duncan  Smith are each an officer and  director of
Sinclair, and Robert E. Smith is a director. Together, the Smiths hold shares of
our stock that have a majority  of the voting  power.  The Smiths own a business
that operates a television station in St. Petersburg,  Florida.  The Smiths also
own businesses  that lease real property and tower space to us, buy  advertising
time from us, and engage in other  transactions with us. In addition,  relatives
of the Smiths  hold a majority  of the equity,  but not the voting  control,  of
Glencairn,  Ltd.  Glencairn  holds the licenses for television  stations that we
program under local marketing agreements with Glencairn.

     Maryland  law and our  financing  agreements  limit the extent to which our
officers,  directors and majority stockholders may transact business with us and
pursue business  opportunities that Sinclair might pursue.  These limitations do
not, however, prohibit all such transactions.  Officers,  directors and majority
stockholders  may therefore  transact some business with us even when there is a
conflict of interest.

                                       39

<PAGE>

THE SMITHS EXERCISE  CONTROL OVER ALL MATTERS  SUBMITTED TO A STOCKHOLDER  VOTE,
AND MAY HAVE INTERESTS THAT DIFFER FROM YOURS.

     David D. Smith,  Frederick  G. Smith,  J. Duncan  Smith and Robert E. Smith
control the  outcome of all matters  submitted  to a vote of  stockholders.  The
Smiths hold class B common stock,  which  generally has 10 votes per share.  Our
class A common stock has only one vote per share.  Our other series of preferred
stock  generally  do not have  voting  rights.  We describe in detail the voting
rights of shares of our capital stock in portions of Sinclair's  proxy statement
for the  2000  annual  meeting  of  shareholders  under  the  heading  "Security
Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners", which we have incorporated by reference
in this report. As of December 31, 1999, the Smiths held shares representing 90%
of the vote on most matters and  representing 50% of the vote on the few matters
for which  class B shares  have only one vote per share.  The Smiths have agreed
with each other that until 2005 they will vote for each other as director.

CERTAIN  FEATURES OF OUR CAPITAL  STRUCTURE MAY DETER OTHERS FROM  ATTEMPTING TO
ACQUIRE SINCLAIR.

     The control the Smiths have over  stockholder  votes may  discourage  other
companies  from trying to acquire us. In addition,  our board of  directors  can
issue  additional  shares of  preferred  stock with  rights  that might  further
discourage  other  companies from trying to acquire us. Anyone trying to acquire
us would  likely  offer to pay more for shares of class A common  stock than the
amount those shares were trading for in market  trades at the time of the offer.
If the  voting  rights  of the  Smiths  or the  right to issue  preferred  stock
discourage such takeover attempts, stockholders may be denied the opportunity to
receive  such a premium.  The general  level of prices for class A common  stock
might also be lower than it would be if these  deterrents  to takeovers  did not
exist.

WE DEPEND ON ADVERTISING  REVENUE,  WHICH MAY DECREASE  DEPENDING ON A NUMBER OF
CONDITIONS.

     Our main  source of revenue is sales of  advertising  time.  Our ability to
     sell advertising time depends on:

          o    the health of the  economy in the areas  where our  stations  are
               located and in the nation as a whole;

          o    the popularity of our programming;

          o    changes in the makeup of the  population  in the areas  where our
               stations are located;

          o    the activities of our competitors; and

          o    other factors that may be beyond our control.

     For  example,  a labor  dispute  or other  disruption  at a major  national
advertiser,  or a recession in a particular market, would make it more difficult
to sell advertising time and could reduce our revenue.

WE MUST PURCHASE  TELEVISION  PROGRAMMING  IN ADVANCE,  BUT CANNOT  PREDICT IF A
PARTICULAR SHOW WILL BE POPULAR ENOUGH TO COVER ITS COST.

     One  of  our  most  significant  costs  is  television  programming.  If  a
particular program is not popular, we may not be able to sell enough advertising
time to cover the costs of the program.  Since we purchase  programming  content
from  others,  we also have little  control  over the costs of  programming.  We
usually must  purchase  programming  several  years in advance,  and may have to
commit to purchase more than one year's worth of  programming.  Finally,  we may
replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant
portion of the costs we incurred,  or accounted fully for the costs on our books
for financial reporting purposes. Any of these factors could reduce our revenues
or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues.

WE  MAY  LOSE  A  LARGE  AMOUNT  OF  PROGRAMMING  IF  A  NETWORK  TERMINATES ITS
AFFILIATION  WITH  US.  WE  ALSO  CANNOT  BE  SURE  THE  NETWORKS  WILL  PROVIDE
ATTRACTIVE PROGRAMMING.

     All but one of our television  stations operate as affiliates of a network.
The vast majority of our prime time programming in  network-affiliated  stations
comes from their  networks.  Our Fox affiliates  acquired in connection with the
Sullivan and Max Media  acquisitions in 1998 (as further discussed in note 11 to
the

                                       40

<PAGE>

attached  financial  statements)  and  three of our ABC  affiliates  do not have
affiliation agreements with their respective network. The networks may terminate
the affiliation of stations that do have affiliation  agreements,  under certain
circumstances,  with between 15 days and six months'  notice.  The  relationship
between networks and station owners is currently undergoing  significant change,
and the networks  may seek  reduced or no fees to owners and may seek  increased
compensation  in the form of additional  advertising,  cash payments or in other
forms.  Networks may seek and receive  terms that reduce our revenue or increase
our costs. If a network  terminates or fails to renew our  affiliation,  we will
lose access to the  programming  offered by that  network.  We will need to find
alternative  sources  of  programming,  which  may be  less  attractive  or more
expensive.

COMPETITION FROM OTHER  BROADCASTERS AND OTHER SOURCES MAY CAUSE OUR ADVERTISING
SALES TO GO DOWN OR OUR COSTS TO GO UP.

     We face intense competition in our industry and markets from the following:

     New Technology and the Subdivision of Markets.  New technologies enable our
competitors to tailor their  programming for specific  segments of the listening
and viewing  public to a degree not possible  before.  As a result,  the overall
market share of  broadcasters,  such as us whose equipment may not permit such a
discriminating approach is under new pressures. The new technologies include:

          o    cable,

          o    satellite-to-home distribution,

          o    pay-per-view, and

          o    home video and entertainment systems.

     Future Technology under  Development.  Cable providers and direct broadcast
satellite  companies are developing  new techniques  that allow them to transmit
more channels on their existing  equipment.  These so-called "video  compression
techniques"  will  reduce  the cost of  creating  channels,  and may lead to the
division of the television  industry into ever more  specialized  niche markets.
Video  compression  is  available  to us as well,  but  competitors  who  target
programming  to such sharply  defined  markets may gain an advantage over us for
television advertising revenues. Lowering the cost of creating channels may also
encourage  new  competitors  to  enter  our  markets  and  compete  with  us for
advertising revenue.

     In-Market  Competition.  We also face more  conventional  competition  from
rivals that may be larger and have greater resources than us. These include:

          o    other local free over-the-air radio and broadcast stations, and

          o    other media, such as newspapers and periodicals.

     Deregulation.  Recent changes in law have also increased  competition.  The
Telecommunications  Act of 1996 (the 1996 Act) created  greater  flexibility and
removed some limits on station ownership.  The prices for stations have risen as
a result.  Telephone,  cable,  and some other companies are also free to provide
video services in competition  with us. Other proposed  legislation  would relax
existing  prohibitions  on the  simultaneous  ownership of  telephone  and cable
businesses.  As a result of these  changes,  new companies are able to enter our
markets and compete with us.

OUR RECENT INVESTMENTS IN INTERNET  BUSINESSES MAY NOT DELIVER THE VALUE WE PAID
FOR THEM OR REACH OUR STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES.

     Our strategy now  includes  investing in and working with  Internet-related
businesses.  In pursuit of this  strategy,  we made three equity  investments in
Internet related businesses in 1999 and intend to make additional investments as
appropriate  opportunities  arise.  The  long  term  value of  Internet  related
businesses  has yet to be  determined,  and we  cannot  assure  you  that  these
investments will be worth the amount of our investment,  or that we will be able
to develop  services that are profitable for Sinclair or the businesses in which
we have  invested.  If the businesses in which we have invested fail to succeed,
we may  lose as much as all of our  investment  in the  businesses.  We may also
spend additional funds and devote additional resources to these businesses,  and
these additional investments may also be lost.

THE PHASED  INTRODUCTION OF DIGITAL TELEVISION WILL INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS
AND MAY EXPOSE US TO INCREASED COMPETITION.

     The FCC has mandated the phased  introduction  of digital  television  from
1999 to 2006,  starting with the  affiliates of ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC in the top
ten markets.  These stations were required to commence  broadcasting  in digital
format by May 1, 1999.  The  affiliates of these networks in the next 20 markets
were  required to commence  digital  broadcasting  by November  1999.  We had no
stations that needed to have digital  operations by the May 1, 1999 deadline and
5 stations  that needed to meet the November  1999  deadline.  As of the date of
this 10-K, none of our stations are broadcasting in digital format.  The FCC has
granted DTV construction  permits and extensions to commence digital  operations
until May 2000 with respect to two of these  stations.  We informed the FCC that
these  stations,  like  many  other  stations,  were  unable  to  begin  digital
operations by November 1999 due to delays in procuring and installing  necessary
equipment.  We have  informed  the FCC that we expect to  construct  our digital
facilities  for these  stations by the end of the second  quarter of 2000.  With
respect  to the other  three  stations,  we have  applications  pending  for DTV
construction  permits and the FCC has granted us special temporary authority for
two of  these  stations  to  begin  digital  operations  prior  to  grant of the
construction  permit.   During  the  transition  period,  each  existing  analog
television  station  will be  permitted  to operate a second  station  that will
broadcast using the digital standard. After completion of the transition period,
the FCC will reclaim the non-digital channels.

     There is considerable  uncertainty  about the final form of the FCC digital
regulations.  Even so,  we  believe  that  these new  developments  may have the
following effects on us:

          Signal  Quality  Issues.  Our tests have  indicated  that the  digital
          standard mandated by the FCC, 8-level vestigial  sideband (8-VSB),  is
          currently  unable to provide for  reliable  reception  of a DTV signal
          through a simple indoor antenna. Absent improvements in DTV receivers,
          or an FCC ruling allowing us to use an alternative standard, continued
          reliance on the 8-VSB digital standard may not allow us to provide the
          same  reception  coverage with our digital  signals as we can with our
          current analog signals.  Additionally,  because of this poor reception
          quality and coverage,  we may be forced to rely on cable television or
          other  alterative means of transmission to deliver our digital signals
          to all of the  viewers  we are able to reach with our  current  analog
          signals.

          Reclamation  of Analog  Channels.  Congress  directed the FCC to begin
          auctioning   analog   channels  60-69  this  year  and  the  remaining
          non-digital channels by September 30, 2002, even though the FCC is not
          to reclaim them until 2006. Congress further permitted broadcasters to
          bid on the  non-digital  channels  in  cities  with  populations  over
          400,000. If the channels are owned by our competitors,  they may exert
          increased competitive pressure on our operations.

          Capital and Operating Costs. We will incur costs to replace  equipment
          in our stations in order to provide  digital  television.  Some of our
          stations  will also  incur  increased  utilities  costs as a result of
          converting to digital operations. We cannot be certain we will be able
          to increase revenues to offset these additional costs.

          Subscription Fees and System Compatibility.  The FCC has determined to
          assess  a fee  in  the  amount  of 5% of  gross  revenues  on  digital
          television  subscription  services. If we are unable to pass this cost
          through to our subscribers, this fee will reduce our earnings from the
          digital television subscription services we are planning. The FCC also
          is  considering  whether to  require  cable  systems to carry  digital
          television signals. Under current regulations,  cable systems are only
          required to carry  non-digital  signals.  Given this climate of market
          uncertainty and regulatory  change,  we cannot be sure what impact the
          FCC's  actions  might  have on our  plans and  results  in the area of
          digital television.

FEDERAL   REGULATION   OF   THE   BROADCASTING  INDUSTRY  LIMITS  OUR  OPERATING
FLEXIBILITY.

     The FCC regulates our business,  just as it does all other companies in the
broadcasting  industry.  We must ask the FCC's  approval  whenever we need a new
license, seek to renew or assign a license, purchase

                                       42

<PAGE>

a new station,  or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries  that holds a
license.  Our FCC licenses and those of the stations we program pursuant to LMAs
are critical to our  operations;  we cannot  operate  without them. We cannot be
certain  that the FCC will renew these  licenses  in the future,  or approve new
acquisitions.

     Federal  legislation  and FCC rules have  changed  significantly  in recent
years.  We anticipate  further  changes in the rules on digital  television.  We
discuss some of the possible  effects of these  changes  elsewhere in this 10-K,
but we  cannot  predict  all the  effects  that  such  changes  may  have on our
business.

THE  FCC'S  OWNERSHIP   RESTRICTIONS  LIMIT  OUR  ABILITY  TO  OPERATE  MULTIPLE
TELEVISION STATIONS, AND FUTURE CHANGES IN THESE RULES MAY THREATEN OUR EXISTING
STRATEGIC APPROACH TO CERTAIN TELEVISION MARKETS.

General Limitations

     The FCC's ownership rules limit us from having "attributable  interests" in
television stations that reach more than 35% of all television households in the
U.S. Under the FCC's method for calculating this limit, our television  stations
will reach approximately 15% of U.S. television households after we complete our
pending purchases and sales of stations.

Changes in the Rules on Television Ownership and Local Marketing Agreements

     In 1999, the FCC revised its local television ownership and LMA attribution
rules. In the past, a licensee could not own two television stations in a market
but could own one station and program another station pursuant to an LMA because
LMAs were not considered  attributable  interests.  The new television ownership
rules allow us to own more than one television station in a market: (1) if there
is no Grade B overlap  between  the  stations;  (2) if the  stations  are in two
different Nielsen  Designated Market Areas; or (3) if the market containing both
the stations  contains at least eight  separately  owned  full-power  television
stations,  and not more than one is among the  top-four  rated  stations  in the
market.  In  addition,  we may  request a waiver of the rule to acquire a second
station in the market if the station to be acquired is  economically  distressed
or unbuilt and there is no party who does not own a local television station who
would  purchase the station for a  reasonable  price.  We  currently  program 26
television stations pursuant to LMAs. We have entered into agreements to acquire
16 of the stations  that we program  pursuant to an LMA.  Once we acquire  these
stations, the LMAs will terminate.

     Under the new ownership rules,  LMAs are now attributable  where a licensee
owns a television  station and programs a television station in the same market.
The new rules  provide that LMAs entered into on or after  November 5, 1996 have
until  August 5,  2001 to come into  compliance  with the new  ownership  rules,
otherwise such LMAs will  terminate.  LMAs entered into before  November 5, 1996
will be grandfathered until the conclusion of the FCC's 2004 biennial review. In
certain  cases,  parties  with  grandfathered  LMAs,  may be able to rely on the
circumstances at the time the LMA was entered into in advancing any proposal for
co-ownership  of the  station.  Of the  remaining  10  stations  that we program
pursuant  to an LMA and are not  acquiring,  5 LMAs  were  entered  into  before
November 5, 1996,  and 5 LMAs were entered into on or after November 5, 1996. As
a result of these  changes,  we may be forced to terminate or modify some of our
remaining LMAs.

     Terminating  or  modifying  our  LMAs  could  affect  our  business  in the
following ways:

          Losses on  Investments.  As part of our LMA  arrangements,  we own the
          non-license  assets used by the stations  with which we have LMAs.  If
          LMA arrangements are no longer  permitted,  we would be forced to sell
          these assets,  or find another use for them.  If LMAs are  prohibited,
          the  market for such  assets  may not be as good as when we  purchased
          them and we would need to sell the assets to the owner or a  purchaser
          of the related license assets. Therefore, we cannot be certain we will
          recoup our investments.

          Termination  Penalties.  If the FCC requires us to modify or terminate
          existing LMAs before the terms of the LMAs expire, we may be forced to
          pay termination penalties under the terms of some of our LMAs.

                                       43

<PAGE>

     The FCC requires the  owner/licensee  of a station to maintain  independent
control over the  programming  and operations of the station.  As a result,  the
owners/licensees of the stations with which we have LMAs can exert their control
in ways that may be counter  to our  interests,  including  the right to preempt
programming or terminate in certain instances.

     These  preemption and termination  rights cause us some uncertainty that we
will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased, and therefore
uncertainty   about  the   advertising   revenues  we  will  receive  from  such
programming.

     Failure of  Owner/Licensee  to Exercise  Control.  In addition,  if the FCC
determines that the owner/licensee is not exercising  sufficient control, it may
penalize the owner/licensee by a fine, revocation of the license for the station
or a denial of the renewal of the license.

     Any one of these scenarios might affect our financial  results,  especially
the  revocation  of or denial of renewal of a license.  In  addition,  penalties
might also affect our qualifications to hold FCC licenses,  and thus place those
licenses at risk.

WE HAVE LOST MONEY IN THREE OF THE LAST FOUR YEARS, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO DO
SO INDEFINITELY.

     We have  suffered net losses in three of the last five years.  In 1999,  we
reported  earnings,  but this was largely due to a gain on the sale of our radio
stations and recognition of an unrealized gain on a derivative  instrument.  Our
losses are due to the following significant cash and non-cash expenses:

          o    Cash Expenses:       Interest

          o    Non-cash  Expenses:  Depreciation,   amortization  (primarily  of
                                    programming and  intangibles),  and deferred
                                    compensation.

     We expect our net losses to continue indefinitely for the same reasons.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

     We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. To manage our
exposure to changes in interest  rates,  we enter into interest rate  derivative
hedging agreements.  We have entered into an additional derivative instrument to
monetize  the  benefit  of  a  call  option  on a  portion  of  our  outstanding
indebtedness  at  interest  rates  prevailing  at the time we  entered  into the
instrument.   This  derivative   instrument  (the  treasury  option   derivative
instrument) exposes us to market risk from a further decrease in interest rates,
but we  believe  that  this risk is offset  by the  benefit  to us from  reduced
interest  rate expense on a portion of our floating rate debt and the ability to
call some of our  indebtedness  and replace it with debt at the lower prevailing
interest rates.

     Finally,  we  have  entered  put and  call  option  derivative  instruments
relating  to our class A common  stock in order to hedge  against  the  possible
dilutive  effects of employees  exercising  stock options  pursuant to our stock
option plans.

     We do  not  enter  into  derivative  instruments  for  speculative  trading
purposes.  With the  exception  of our  treasury  option  derivative  instrument
(described below), we do not reflect the changes in fair market value related to
derivative instruments in the accompanying financial statements.

INTEREST RATE RISKS

     We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates,  which arises
from the floating rate debt. As of December 31, 1999, we were  obligated on $1.0
billion  of  indebtedness  carrying  a  floating  interest  rate.  We enter into
interest rate  derivative  agreements to reduce the impact of changing  interest
rates on our floating rate debt. The 1998 bank credit agreement,  as amended and
restated, requires us to enter into interest rate protection agreements at rates
not to exceed 10% per annum as to a notional  principal amount at least equal to
60% of the term loan,  revolving credit facility and senior  subordinated  notes
scheduled to be outstanding from time to time.

     As of December 31, 1999, we had several interest rate swap agreements which
expire from July 23, 2000 to July 15, 2007. The swap agreements  effectively set
fixed  rates on our  floating  rate debt in the range of 5.5% to 8.1%.  Floating
interest  rates are based upon the three month  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate
(LIBOR), and the measurement and settlement is performed quarterly.

     Settlements  of these  agreements  are recorded as  adjustments to interest
expense  in  the  relevant  periods.  The  notional  amounts  related  to  these
agreements  were $1.0 billion at December 31, 1999, and decrease to $200 million
through the  expiration  dates.  In  addition,  we entered  into  floating  rate
derivatives with notional amounts totaling $750 million.  Based on our currently
hedged position, $1.8 billion or 96% of our outstanding indebtedness is hedged.

     Based on our debt levels and the amount of floating rate debt not hedged as
of March 15,  2000,  a 1% increase in the LIBOR rate would result in an increase
in annualized interest expense of approximately $14.0 million.

TREASURY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

     In August 1998, we entered into a treasury option derivative contract.  The
option derivative  contract provides for 1) an option exercise date of September
30,  2000,  2) a notional  amount of $300  million and 3) a  five-year  treasury
strike  rate  of  6.14%.  If the  interest  rate  yield  on five  year  treasury
securities is less than the strike rate on the option exercise date, we would be
obligated  to pay five  consecutive  annual  payments in an amount  equal to the
strike rate less the five year treasury rate  multiplied by the notional  amount
beginning  September  30, 2001 through  September 30, 2006. If the interest rate
yield on five year  treasuries  at September 30, 2000 were to equal the two year
forward five year treasury rate on December 31, 1999 for  treasuries  settled on
September 30, 2000, we would not be required to make payments.

     Upon the execution of the option  derivative  contract,  we received a cash
payment  representing  an option  premium of $9.5 million  which was recorded in
"Other long-term  liabilities" in the accompanying  consolidated balance sheets.
We are required to periodically adjust our liability to the present value of

                                       45

<PAGE>

the future  payments of the  settlement  amounts  based on the forward five year
treasury  rate  at the  end of an  accounting  period.  The  fair  market  value
adjustment for 1999 resulted in an income statement benefit (unrealized gain) of
$15.7  million for the year ended  December 31, 1999.  If the yield on five year
treasuries  at  September  30, 2000 were to equal the two year forward five year
treasury  rate on  December  31, 1999  (6.4%),  we would not be required to make
payments.

     We have the ability to call our 10% senior  subordinated  notes due 2005 on
September 15, 2000. The value of this call is determined by new issuance  yields
for senior  subordinated  debt at that  time.  The value of this call rises when
yields  fall and falls when  yields  rise.  New  issuance  yields are based on a
spread over treasury yields. If the yield on five-year  treasuries remains below
6.14% until  September  30,  2000,  we expect to be able to call those notes and
refinance  at the lower  prevailing  rates,  thus  offsetting  the effect of the
payments  required  under  the  treasury  option  derivative.  There  can  be no
assurance,  however,  that we would be able to refinance  the 1995 Notes at such
time at favorable interest rates.

     We are also  exposed to risk from a change in interest  rates to the extent
we are required to refinance  existing fixed rate  indebtedness  at rates higher
than those prevailing at the time the existing  indebtedness was incurred. As of
December 31, 1999, we have senior  subordinated  notes totaling $300 million and
$450 million expiring in the years 2005 and 2007,  respectively.  Based upon the
quoted  market  price,  the fair  value of the notes was  $713.6  million  as of
December 31, 1999.  Generally,  the fair market value of the notes will decrease
as interest  rates rise and increase as interest  rates fall. We estimate that a
1% increase from  prevailing  interest  rates would result in a decrease in fair
value of the notes by approximately $33.6 million as of December 31, 1999.

EQUITY PUT OPTION DERIVATIVES

     We are exposed to market risk relating to our equity put option  derivative
instruments  . The  contract  terms  relating to these  instruments  provide for
settlement  on the  expiration  date.  The  equity  puts  require  us to  make a
settlement  payment to the  counterparties to these contracts (payable in either
cash or shares of our class A common  stock) in an amount that is  approximately
equal to the put strike  price minus the price of our class A common stock as of
the  termination  date.  If the put  strike  price is less than the price of our
class A common stock as of the  termination  date,  we would not be obligated to
make a settlement payment. In addition, certain of these contracts include terms
allowing  the put  option to  become  immediately  exercisable  upon our class A
common stock trading at certain  levels.  The  following  table  summarizes  our
position  relating to the equity puts and illustrates the market risk associated
with these instruments.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS


To the Stockholders of
Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.:

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Sinclair
Broadcast Group,  Inc. (a Maryland  corporation) and Subsidiaries as of December
31,  1998 and 1999,  and the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,
stockholders'  equity and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the period
ended December 31, 1999. These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

     We conducted our audits in accordance  with  auditing  standards  generally
accepted in the United States.  Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
audit also includes  assessing the accounting  principles  used and  significant
estimates  made by  management,  as well as  evaluating  the  overall  financial
statement  presentation.  We believe that our audits provide a reasonable  basis
for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Sinclair Broadcast Group,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1998 and 1999, and the results of their
operations  and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1999, in conformity with accounting  principles  generally accepted
in the United States.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                        DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1998 AND 1999


1.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of
Sinclair  Broadcast Group,  Inc.,  Sinclair  Communications,  Inc. and all other
consolidated subsidiaries,  which are collectively referred to hereafter as "the
Company,  Companies or SBG." The Company owns and operates  television and radio
stations   throughout   the  United  States.   Additionally,   included  in  the
accompanying  consolidated financial statements are the results of operations of
certain  television  stations pursuant to local marketing  agreements (LMAs) and
radio stations pursuant to joint sales agreements (JSAs).

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In July 1999,  the Company  entered  into an  agreement  to sell 46 of its radio
stations in nine markets to Entercom Communications Corporation ("Entercom") for
$824.5 million in cash. In December  1999, the Company  completed the sale of 41
of its radio  stations in eight  markets to Entercom for $700.4  million in cash
recognizing a gain net of tax of $192.4 million.  The sale of the remaining five
stations is expected to close in 2000 for a purchase price of $124.1 million. In
addition,  the Company intends to sell its remaining radio stations  serving the
St.  Louis  market.  Based on the  Company's  strategy  to  divest  of its radio
broadcasting segment,  "Discontinued Operations" accounting has been adopted for
the periods  presented in the  accompanying  financial  statements and the notes
thereto.  As such, the results from operations of the radio  broadcast  segment,
net of related income taxes, has been  reclassified  from income from operations
and  reflected  as  income  from  discontinued  operations  in the  accompanying
consolidated  statements of operations for all periods  presented.  In addition,
assets and liabilities  relating to the radio broadcast segment are reflected in
"Broadcast assets related to discontinued operations, net of liabilities" in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets for all periods presented.  Included in
the balance of  "Broadcast  assets  related to  discontinued  operations  net of
liabilities" as of December 31,1999 was property and programming assets of $13.8
million,  intangible  assets of $163.9 million,  other long-term  assets of $1.3
million, programming liabilities of $5.0 million and other long-term liabilities
of $1.0 million.

Discontinued   operations   have  not  been   segregated  in  the  Statement  of
Consolidation Cash Flows and,  therefore,  amounts for certain captions will not
agree with the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
all  its  wholly-owned  and  majority-owned   subsidiaries.   Minority  interest
represents a minority  owner's  proportionate  share of the equity in certain of
the Company's  subsidiaries.  In addition, the Company uses the equity method of
accounting for 20% to 50% ownership  investments.  All significant  intercompany
transactions and account balances have been eliminated.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the
financial   statements  and  in  the   disclosures  of  contingent   assets  and
liabilities. While actual results could differ from those estimates,  management
believes  that actual  results  will not be  materially  different  from amounts
provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

PROGRAMMING

The Companies have  agreements  with  distributors  for the rights to television
programming  over contract  periods which generally run from one to seven years.
Contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally shorter
than the contract period. Each contract is recorded as an asset and a

                                      F-10

                 SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1998 AND 1999 - (CONTINUED)

liability  at an  amount  equal to its  gross  contractual  commitment  when the
license  period begins and the program is available for its first  showing.  The
portion of program  contracts  which become payable within one year is reflected
as a current liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The rights to program  materials are reflected in the accompanying  consolidated
balance  sheets at the lower of  unamortized  cost or estimated  net  realizable
value.  Estimated net realizable values are based upon management's  expectation
of future  advertising  revenues net of sales commissions to be generated by the
program material.  Amortization of program contract costs is generally  computed
using either a four year accelerated method or based on usage,  whichever yields
the greater amortization for each program.  Program contract costs, estimated by
management to be amortized in the  succeeding  year,  are  classified as current
assets.  Payments  of  program  contract  liabilities  are  typically  paid on a
scheduled  basis  and  are not  affected  by  adjustments  for  amortization  or
estimated net realizable value.

BARTER ARRANGEMENTS

Certain  program  contracts  provide for the exchange of advertising air time in
lieu of cash payments for the rights to such  programming.  These  contracts are
recorded  as  the  programs  are  aired  at  the  estimated  fair  value  of the
advertising  air  time  given  in  exchange  for  the  program  rights.  Network
programming is excluded from these calculations.

The Company broadcasts certain customers' advertising in exchange for equipment,
merchandise and services. The estimated fair value of the equipment, merchandise
or services  received is recorded as deferred barter costs and the corresponding
obligation to broadcast advertising is recorded as deferred barter revenues. The
deferred barter costs are expensed or capitalized as they are used,  consumed or
received.  Deferred barter revenues are recognized as the related advertising is
aired.

Other  assets as of December  31,  1998 and 1999  consist of the  following  (in

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE BROADCASTING ASSETS

Acquired  intangible  broadcasting assets are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over periods of 1 to 40 years.  These amounts result from the  acquisition
of certain  television and radio station  license and  non-license  assets.  The
Company  monitors the individual  financial  performance of each of the stations
and continually  evaluates the  realizability  of intangible and tangible assets
and the existence of any impairment to its recoverability based on the projected
undiscounted  cash flows of the  respective  stations.  As of December 31, 1999,
management  believes  that the carrying  amounts of the  Company's  tangible and
intangible assets have not been impaired.

LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENTS

The Company  generally enters into LMAs and similar  arrangements  with stations
located in markets in which the Company already owns and operates a station, and
in connection  with  acquisitions,  pending  regulatory  approval of transfer of
License Assets. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company makes specified
periodic payments to the owner-operator in exchange for the grant to the Company
of the right to  program  and sell  advertising  on a  specified  portion of the
station's  inventory  of  broadcast  time.  Nevertheless,  as the  holder of the
Federal  Communications  Commission (FCC) license,  the  owner-operator  retains
control  and  responsibility  for  the  operation  of  the  station,   including
responsibility over all programming broadcast on the station.

3.   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS:

The Company  enters into  derivative  instruments  primarily  for the purpose of
reducing the impact of changing  interest  rates on its floating  rate debt.  In
addition,   the  Company  has  entered  into  put  and  call  option  derivative
instruments relating to the Company's Class A Common Stock in order to hedge the
possible  dilutive effect of employees  exercising stock options pursuant to the
Company's  stock  option  plans.  The  Company  does not enter  into  derivative
instruments  for  speculative  trading  purposes.  With  the  exception  of  the
Company's Treasury Option Derivative  Instrument  (described below), the Company
does not  reflect  the  changes  in fair  market  value  related  to  derivative
instruments in its financial statements.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1998 AND 1999 - (CONTINUED)

During 1998, the Financial  Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
No. 133  "Accounting  for  Derivative  Instruments  and for Hedging  Activities"
("SFAS  133").  SFAS 133  establishes  accounting  and  reporting  standards for
derivative  investments and for hedging  activities.  It requires that an entity
recognize all  derivatives  as either assets or  liabilities in the statement of
financial  position  and measure  those  instruments  at fair value.  If certain
conditions are met, a derivative may be specifically  designated as a hedge. The
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended
use of the derivative and the resulting  designation.  SFAS 133 is effective for
the Company  beginning  January 1, 2001.  The Company is evaluating its eventual
impact on its financial statements.

INTEREST RATE HEDGING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The 1998 Bank Credit Agreement, as amended and restated, requires the Company to
enter into  interest rate  protection  agreements at rates not to exceed 10% per
annum as to a notional  principal amount at least equal to 60% of the Term Loan,
Revolving  Credit  Facility  and  Senior  Subordinated  Notes  scheduled  to  be
outstanding from time to time.

As of December 31, 1999, the Company had several  interest rate swap  agreements
which expire from July 23, 2000 to July 15, 2007. The swap  agreements set rates
in the range of 5.5% to 8.1%.  Floating  interest rates are based upon the three
month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR),  and the measurement and settlement
is  performed  quarterly.  Settlements  of  these  agreements  are  recorded  as
adjustments to interest  expense in the relevant  periods.  The notional amounts
related to these agreements were $1.0 billion at December 31, 1999, and decrease
to $200 million  through the  expiration  dates.  In  addition,  the Company has
entered into  floating rate  derivatives  with  notional  amounts  totaling $750
million.  Based on the Company's currently hedged position,  $1.8 billion or 96%
of the Company's outstanding indebtedness is hedged.

The Company has no intentions of terminating  these  instruments  prior to their
expiration  dates  unless  it were to  prepay a portion  of its bank  debt.  The
counter parties to these agreements are  international  financial  institutions.
The Company  estimates the fair value of these  instruments at December 31, 1998
and 1999 to be $3.0 million and $4.5  million,  respectively.  The fair value of
the  interest  rate  hedging  derivative  instruments  is estimated by obtaining
quotations  from the financial  institutions  which are a party to the Company's
derivative  contracts  (the  "Banks").  The fair value is an estimate of the net
amount that the Company  would pay at December  31, 1999 if the  contracts  were
transferred to other parties or canceled by the Banks.

TREASURY OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

In August 1998, the Company entered into a treasury option  derivative  contract
(the "Option  Derivative").  The Option  Derivative  contract provides for 1) an
option exercise date of September 30, 2000, 2) a notional amount of $300 million
and 3) a five-year  treasury strike rate of 6.14%. If the interest rate yield on
five  year  treasury  securities  is less  than the  strike  rate on the  option
exercise  date,  the Company would be obligated to pay five  consecutive  annual
payments in an amount equal to the strike rate less the five year  treasury rate
multiplied by the notional amount beginning September 30, 2001 through September
30, 2006. If the interest rate yield on five year treasury securities is greater
than the strike  rate on the option  exercise  date,  the  Company  would not be
obligated to make any payments.

Upon the execution of the Option  Derivative  contract,  the Company  received a
cash payment  representing  an option premium of $9.5 million which was recorded
in  "Other  long-term  liabilities"  in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance
sheets.  The Company is required to  periodically  adjust its  liability  to the
present  value of the future  payments of the  settlement  amounts  based on the
forward five year

treasury rate at the end of an accounting  period,  which was $2.7 million as of
December 31,  1999.  The fair market value  adjustment  for 1999  resulted in an
income statement  benefit  (unrealized gain) of $15.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 1999.

EQUITY PUT AND CALL OPTION DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS:

1997 OPTIONS

In April 1997, the Company entered into additional put and call option contracts
related to its common  stock for the  purpose of  hedging  the  dilution  of the
common stock upon the exercise of stock  options  granted.  The Company  entered
into 1,100,000 European style (that is, exercisable on the expiration date only)
put  options  for  common  stock with a strike  price of $12.89 per share  which
provide for settlement in cash or in shares, at the election of the Company. The
Company entered into 1,100,000  American style (that is, exercisable any time on
or before the expiration date) call options for common stock with a strike price
of $12.89 per share which provide for  settlement  in cash or in shares,  at the
election of the Company.

1998 OPTIONS

In July 1998, the Company entered into put and call option contracts  related to
the Company's common stock (the "July Options").  In September 1998, the Company
entered into additional put and call option  contracts  related to the Company's
common  stock  (the  "September  Options").  These  option  contracts  allow for
settlement in cash or net physically in shares,  at the election of the Company.
The Company  entered into these option  contracts for the purpose of hedging the
dilution  of the  Company's  common  stock upon the  exercise  of stock  options
granted.  The July Options included  2,700,000 call options for common stock and
2,700,000 put options for common stock, with a strike price of $33.27 and $28.93
per common share,  respectively.  The September  Options  included  467,000 call
options for common stock and 700,000 put options for common stock, with a strike
price of $28.00 and $16.0625 per common share, respectively.  For the year ended
December 31, 1998,  option  premium  payments of $12.2  million and $0.7 million
were made relating to the July and September Options,  respectively. The Company
recorded these premium payments as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. To
the extent  that the  Company  entered  into put  options  related to its common
stock, the additional paid-in capital amounts were reclassified  accordingly and
reflected as Equity Put Options in the accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet
as of December 31,  1998.  For the year ended  December  31,  1999,  the Company
recorded  receipts of $1.25 million relating to the 1998 September Options as an
increase  in  additional  paid-in  capital.  Additionally,  200,000  of the 1998
September Options were retired during 1999.

1999 OPTIONS

In  September  1999,  the Company  entered  into put and call  option  contracts
related to the  Company's  common  stock.  The Company  entered  into  1,700,000
European  style put  options for common  stock with a strike  price of $9.45 per
share which provide for settlement in cash or in shares,  at the election of the
Company.  In September 1999, the Company  entered into 1,000,000  American style
call options for common stock with a strike price $10.45 per share which provide
for  settlement  in cash or in shares,  at the election of the Company.  For the
year ended December 31, 1999,  option premium payments of $0.5 million were made
relating to the  September  call  options.  The Company  recorded  these premium
payments as a reduction of additional  paid-in  capital.  To the extent that the
Company  entered into put options  related to its common stock,  the  additional
paid-in  capital amounts were  reclassified  accordingly and reflected as Equity
Put Options in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheet as of December 31,
1999.

4.   NOTES PAYABLE AND COMMERCIAL BANK FINANCING:

1997 BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT

In order to expand  its  capacity  and  obtain  more  favorable  terms  with its
syndicate  of banks,  the  Company  amended  and  restated  the 1996 Bank Credit
Agreement in May 1997 (the "1997 Bank Credit Agreement"). Contemporaneously with
the 1997  Preferred  Stock Offering and the 1997 Common Stock Offering (see Note
12)  consummated  in September  1997,  the Company  amended its 1997 Bank Credit
Agreement. The 1997 Bank Credit Agreement, as amended, consisted of two classes:
Tranche A Term loan and a Revolving Credit Commitment.

The Tranche A Term Loan was a term loan in a principal amount not to exceed $325
million and was scheduled to be paid in quarterly  installments through December
31, 2004. The Revolving  Credit  Commitment was a revolving credit facility in a
principal  amount not to exceed $675  million and was  scheduled to have reduced
availability  quarterly  through  December  31,  2004.  As of December 31, 1997,
outstanding  indebtedness under the Tranche A Term Loan and the Revolving Credit
Commitment were $307.1 million and $-0- respectively.

The  applicable  interest  rate for the  Tranche A Term  Loan and the  Revolving
Credit  Commitment was either LIBOR plus 0.5% to 1.875% or the alternative  base
rate plus zero to 0.625%.  The  applicable  interest rate for the Tranche A Term
Loan and the Revolving  Credit  Commitment was to be adjusted based on the ratio
of total  debt to four  quarters'  trailing  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,
depreciation  and   amortization.   The  weighted  average  interest  rates  for
outstanding  indebtedness relating to the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement during 1997
and as of  December  31,  1997 were 7.4% and 8.5%,  respectively.  The  interest
expense  relating to the 1997 Bank Credit  Agreement  was $46.7  million for the
year  ended  December  31,  1997.  The  Company  replaced  the 1997 Bank  Credit
Agreement with the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement in May 1998 as discussed below.

1998 BANK CREDIT AGREEMENT

In order to expand its borrowing  capacity to fund  acquisitions and obtain more
favorable  terms with its syndicate of banks,  the Company  obtained a new $1.75
billion senior secured credit facility (the "1998 Bank Credit  Agreement").  The
1998 Bank Credit Agreement was executed in May of 1998 and includes (i) a $750.0
million Term Loan  Facility  repayable  in  consecutive  quarterly  installments
commencing on March 31, 1999 and ending on September  15, 2005;  and (ii) a $1.0
billion reducing  Revolving Credit  Facility.  Availability  under the Revolving
Credit Facility reduces quarterly,  commencing March 31, 2001 and terminating on
September  15,  2005.  Not more than  $350.0  million  of the  Revolving  Credit
Facility  will be available  for  issuances of letters of credit.  The 1998 Bank
Credit  Agreement  also includes a standby  uncommitted  multiple draw term loan
facility  of $400.0  million.  The  Company is  required to prepay the term loan
facility  and  reduce the  revolving  credit  facility  with (i) 100% of the net
proceeds of any casualty loss or condemnation;  (ii) 100% of the net proceeds of
any sale or other  disposition  by the Company of any assets in excess of $100.0
million in the  aggregate for any fiscal year, to the extent not used to acquire
new  assets;  and (iii) 50% of excess cash flow (as  defined)  if the  Company's
ratio of debt to EBITDA (as defined) exceeds a certain threshold.  The 1998 Bank
Credit Agreement contains  representations  and warranties,  and affirmative and
negative  covenants,   including  among  other   restrictions,   limitations  on
additional indebtedness,  customary for credit facilities of this type. The 1998
Bank  Credit  Agreement  is  secured  only  by a  pledge  of the  stock  of each
subsidiary of the Company other than KDSM,  Inc.,  KDSM Licensee,  Inc.,  Cresap
Enterprises,  Inc., Sinclair Capital and Sinclair Ventures,  Inc. The Company is
required to maintain  certain debt  covenants in  connection  with the 1998 Bank
Credit  Agreement.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company was in compliance  with
all debt covenants.

                 DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1998 AND 1999 - (CONTINUED)

The applicable interest rate for the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Credit
Facility is either LIBOR plus 0.5% to 1.875% or the  alternative  base rate plus
zero to 0.625%. The applicable  interest rate for the Term Loan Facility and the
Revolving  Credit  Facility is adjusted based on the ratio of total debt to four
quarters'   trailing   earnings  before   interest,   taxes,   depreciation  and
amortization.  As of December 31, 1999, the Company's  applicable  interest rate
for borrowings under the 1998 Bank Credit Agreement is either LIBOR plus 1.5% or
the alternative base rate plus .25%.

As a result of  entering  into the  Company's  1998 Bank Credit  Agreement,  the
Company  incurred  debt  acquisition  costs of $11.1  million and  recognized an
extraordinary  loss of $11.1 million net of a tax benefit of $7.4  million.  The
extraordinary loss represents the write-off of debt acquisition costs associated
with  indebtedness  replaced by the new facility.  The weighted average interest
rates for outstanding  indebtedness  relating to the 1998 Bank Credit  Agreement
during  1999 and as of  December  31,  1999 were  6.7% and  7.7%,  respectively.
Combined  interest expense relating to the 1997 and 1998 Bank Credit  Agreements
was $66.1 million and $108.9 million for years ended December 31, 1998 and 1999,
respectively.

     paid to KDSM,  Inc. are considered  taxable income for Federal tax purposes
     and not considered income for book purposes. Also for Federal tax purposes,
     KDSM, Inc. is allowed a tax deduction for dividends  received on the Parent
     Preferred  Stock in an amount  equal to Parent  Preferred  Stock  dividends
     received  in each  taxable  year  limited to the extent  that the  Parent's
     consolidated group has "earnings and profits." To the extent that dividends
     received by KDSM,  Inc.  are in excess of the Parent's  consolidated  group
     earnings  and  profits,  the Parent will reduce its tax basis in the Parent
     Preferred  Stock  which  gives  rise to a  deferred  tax  liability  (to be
     recognized upon redemption) and KDSM,  Inc.'s dividend income is treated as
     a permanent  difference between taxable income and book income.  During the
     years  ended  December  31,  1997 and 1998,  the  Parent  did not  generate
     "earnings and profits" in an amount greater than or equal to dividends paid
     on the Parent Preferred Stock. This resulted in a reduction in basis of the
     Parent's  Series C Preferred  Stock and  generated a related  deferred  tax
     liability.  During the year ended December  31,1999,  the Parent  generated
     "earnings  and  profits"  and  avoided a  reduction  in basis of its Parent
     Preferred Stock.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                 DECEMBER 31, 1997, 1998 AND 1999 - (CONTINUED)

Temporary  differences  between the financial reporting carrying amounts and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities give rise to deferred taxes. The Company had
a net deferred tax liability of $165.5 million and $228.7 million as of December
31, 1998 and 1999,  respectively.  The  realization  of  deferred  tax assets is
contingent  upon the Company's  ability to generate  sufficient  future  taxable
income to realize the future tax benefits  associated  with the net deferred tax
asset.  Management believes that deferred assets will be realized through future
operating results.

The Company's remaining Federal NOL's will expire during various years from 2008
to 2012,  and are subject to annual  limitations  under  Internal  Revenue  Code
Section 382 and  similar  state  provisions.  The tax effects of these NOL's are
recorded in the deferred tax accounts in the accompanying  consolidated  balance
sheets as of December 31, 1999.

Total  deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities as of December 31, 1998
and 1999 are as follows (in thousands):

During 1998, the Company acquired the stock of Sullivan Broadcast Holdings, Inc.
(Sullivan),  Lakeland  Group  Television,  Inc.  (Lakeland)  and the  direct and
indirect interests of Max Media Properties LLC (Max Media). The Company recorded
net deferred tax  liabilities  resulting from these  purchases of  approximately
$114.0  million.  These net deferred  tax  liabilities  primarily  relate to the
permanent differences between financial reporting carrying amounts and tax basis
amounts measured upon the purchase date.

LITIGATION

Lawsuits  and  claims are filed  against  the  Company  from time to time in the
ordinary course of business.  These actions are in various  preliminary  stages,
and no judgments or decisions  have been  rendered by hearing  boards or courts.
Management,  after reviewing  developments to date with legal counsel, is of the
opinion that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect
on the Company's  financial  position,  results of operations or cash flows. The
Company is currently  involved in  litigation  related  to the St. Louis  option
(see Note 11).

period  ending  December  31, 2004 in exchange  for options to acquire an equity
interest.  Advertising  and  promotional  support will be provided to BeautyBuys
from the Company's unutilized  inventory,  valued as if each spot was being sold
at the  then-current  street  rates at the time of the airing.  The Company will
recognize no revenue related to its advertising, promotion or other services and
will recognize  revenue as the Company's  options vest in an amount equal to the
fair value of the options.

OPERATING LEASES

under  terms  ranging  from three to ten years.  The rent  expense  under  these

Baker had certain rights as a consequence of termination of the Baker Agreement,
including Mr.  Baker's right to purchase at fair market value our television and
radio stations that serve the St. Louis, Missouri market (the St. Louis purchase
option).

In June 1999,  we received a letter from Mr.  Baker  stating  that he elected to
exercise his St. Louis  purchase  option.  In his letter,  Mr. Baker names Emmis
Communications  Corporation  (Emmis) as his  designee to exercise  the St. Louis
purchase  option.  Notwithstanding  our belief that Emmis was not an appropriate
designee of Mr.  Baker,  we  negotiated  in good faith with Emmis  regarding the
potential sale of the St. Louis properties. Following unsuccessful negotiations,
however,  on January 18, 2000,  we filed suit in the Circuit  Court of Baltimore
County, Maryland against Mr. Baker and Emmis claiming,  alternatively,  that Mr.
Baker's designation of Emmis was invalid,  that the St. Louis purchase option is
void for  vagueness  and/or  that  Emmis  breached  a duty that it owed to us by
refusing to negotiate the acquisition agreement in good faith. We have requested
that the court grant us declaratory relief and/or monetary damages.

On March 17,  2000 Emmis and Mr.  Baker  filed a joint  answer and  counterclaim
generally  denying the allegations  made by Sinclair in its lawsuit and claiming
that  Sinclair  has acted in bad faith in  failing to  fulfill  its  contractual
obligations, has mismanaged the St. Louis properties and has interfered with the
contract  between Mr.  Baker and Emmis in which Mr.  Baker  agreed to  designate
Emmis to buy the properties.  The counterclaim  seeks  compensatory and punitive
damages, the appointment of a special receiver to manage the St. Louis broadcast
properties and a declaratory judgment requiring Sinclair to complete the sale of
those  properties  to Emmis.  We  believe we have  valid  defenses  to the Emmis
counterclaims and intend to vigorously contest the claims, although there can be
no assurances regarding the outcome of this litigation.

In light of this ongoing lawsuit, we do not expect the transaction  contemplated
by the St. Louis purchase option to be consummated.  We do intend,  however,  to
sell our remaining six radio  stations  serving the St. Louis market which were,
in part, the subject of the St. Louis purchase option.

GLENCAIRN/WPTT,  INC.  ACQUISITION.  On  November  15,  1999, we entered into an
agreement  to  purchase  substantially  all  of the assets of television station
WCWB-TV,   Channel   22,  Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania,  with  the  owner  of  that
television  station  WPTT, Inc. for a purchase price of $17,808,000. The waiting
period  under  the  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Act  of  1976  has expired and
closing on this transaction is subject to FCC approval.

On November 15, 1999,  we entered into five  separate  plans and  agreements  of
merger,  pursuant to which we would acquire through merger with  subsidiaries of
Glencairn,  Ltd.,  television broadcast stations WABM-TV,  Birmingham,  Alabama,
KRRT-TV, San Antonio, Texas, WVTV-TV,  Milwaukee,  Wisconsin,  WRDC-TV, Raleigh,
North Carolina,  and WBSC-TV (formerly WFBC-TV),  Andersen,  South Carolina. The
consideration  for these mergers is the issuance to Glencairn  shares of class A
common  voting stock of the Company.  The total value of the shares to be issued
in consideration for all the mergers is $8.0 million.

MONTECITO  ACQUISITION.  In  February  1998,  the Company  entered  into a Stock
Purchase Agreement with Montecito Broadcasting  Corporation  (Montecito) and its
stockholders  to acquire all of the issued and  outstanding  stock of  Montecito
which owns the FCC License for television broadcast station KFBT-TV. The FCC has
granted initial approval to the  transaction,  which shall become final in April
2000.  The Company  anticipates  acquiring  the stock of Montecito in the second
quarter of 2000.

MISSION OPTION.  Pursuant to our merger with Sullivan Broadcast Holdings,  Inc.,
which was  effective  July 1,  1998,  the  Company  acquired  options to acquire
television  broadcast  station  WUXP-TV in  Nashville,  Tennessee  from  Mission
Broadcasting  I, Inc. and television  broadcast  station  WUPN-TV in Greensboro,
North  Carolina  from Mission  Broadcasting  II, Inc. On November 15, 1999,  the
Company  exercised  its option to acquire both of the foregoing  stations.  This
acquisition is subject to approval.

12.  SECURITIES ISSUANCES AND COMMON STOCK SPLIT:

COMMON STOCK SPLIT

On April 30, 1998, the Company's Board of Directors approved a two-for-one stock
split of its Class A and Class B Common Stock to be distributed in the form of a
stock dividend. As a result of this action,  23,963,013 and 24,984,432 shares of
Class A and Class B Common Stock,  respectively,  were issued to shareholders of
record as of May 14, 1998. The stock split has been  retroactively  reflected in
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto.

In September 1997, the Company and certain stockholders of the Company completed
a public  offering of 8,690,000 and 3,500,000  shares,  respectively  of Class A
Common Stock (the "1997 Common Stock  Offering").  The shares were sold pursuant
to the  Shelf  Registration  for an  offering  price of  $18.25  per  share  and
generated  proceeds  to the  Company  of $151.0  million,  net of  underwriters'
discount  and other  offering  costs of $7.6  million.  The  Company  utilized a
significant  portion  of the  1997  Common  Stock  Offering  proceeds  to  repay
indebtedness under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement.

1997 PREFERRED STOCK OFFERING

Concurrent with the 1997 Common Stock Offering,  the Company  completed a public

Stock (the "1997  Preferred Stock  Offering").  The shares were sold pursuant to
the Shelf  Registration  at an  offering  price of $50 per  share and  generated
proceeds to the Company of $166.9  million,  net of  underwriters'  discount and
other offering costs of $5.0 million.

The Convertible  Exchangeable  Preferred Stock have a liquidation  preference of
$50 per share and a stated annual dividend of $3.00 per share payable  quarterly
out of legally available funds and are convertible into shares of Class A Common
Stock at the option of the holders thereof at a conversion  price of $22.813 per
share, subject to adjustment.  The shares of Convertible  Exchangeable Preferred
Stock  are  exchangeable  at the  option  of  the  Company,  for 6%  Convertible
Subordinated  Debentures  of the Company,  due 2012,  and are  redeemable at the
option of the Company on or after  September  20, 2000 at specified  prices plus
accrued dividends.

The  Company  received  total  net  proceeds  of  $317.9  million  from the 1997
Preferred  Stock  Offering  and the 1997  Common  Stock  Offering.  The  Company
utilized  $285.7  million  of the net  proceeds  from the 1997  Preferred  Stock
Offering  and the 1997 Common  Stock  Offering to repay  outstanding  borrowings
under the revolving credit facility,  $8.9 million to repay outstanding  amounts
under the Tranche A term loan of the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement and retained the
remaining  net proceeds of  approximately  $23.3  million for general  corporate
purposes.

1997  OFFERING  OF COMPANY OBLIGATED MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED SECURITIES
OF SUBSIDIARY TRUST

In March  1997,  the  Company  completed  a private  placement  of $200  million
aggregate  liquidation  value of 11 5/8%  High  Yield  Trust  Offered  Preferred
Securities  (the  "HYTOPS")  of  Sinclair  Capital,  a  subsidiary  trust of the
Company.  The HYTOPS were issued  March 12, 1997,  mature  March 15,  2009,  and
provide for quarterly  distributions  to be paid in arrears  beginning  June 15,
1997.  The HYTOPS were sold to "qualified  institutional  buyers" (as defined in
Rule 144A under the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and a limited number of
institutional   "accredited   investors"   and  the  offering  was  exempt  from
registration  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended  ("the  Securities
Act"),  pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 144A thereunder.
The Company  utilized  $135.0  million of the  approximately  $192.8 million net
proceeds of the private  placement  to repay  outstanding  debt and retained the
remainder for general corporate purposes.

Pursuant to a Registration  Rights Agreement entered into in connection with the
private  placement of the HYTOPS,  the Company offered holders of the HYTOPS the
right to  exchange  the  HYTOPS  for new  HYTOPS  having  the same  terms as the
existing securities, except that the exchange of the new HYTOPS for the existing
HYTOPS has been registered under the Securities Act. On May 2, 1997, the Company
filed a  registration  statement on Form S-4 with the Commission for the purpose
of registering  the new HYTOPS to be offered in exchange for the  aforementioned
existing HYTOPS issued by the Company in March 1997 (the "Exchange Offer").  The
Company's  Exchange  Offer was closed and became  effective  August 11, 1997, at
which time all of the existing HYTOPS were exchanged for new HYTOPS.

Amounts  payable to the  holders of HYTOPS are  recorded  as  "Subsidiary  trust
minority  interest  expense" in the accompanying  financial  statements and were
$18.6 million,  23.3 million, and $23.3 million for the years ended December 31,

approximately  $14.4  million.  The  Company  utilized  the  proceeds  to  repay
indebtedness under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement.

13.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS:

STOCK OPTION PLANS

DESIGNATED  PARTICIPANTS  STOCK OPTION PLAN - In  connection  with the Company's
initial public offering in June 1995 (the "IPO"),  the Board of Directors of the
Company adopted an Incentive Stock Option Plan for Designated  Participants (the
Designated  Participants Stock Option Plan) pursuant to which options for shares
of Class A common  stock were  granted to certain key  employees of the Company.
The Designated Participants Stock Option Plan provides that the number of shares
of Class A Common Stock reserved for issuance under the Designated  Participants
Stock  Option  Plan is  136,000.  Options  granted  pursuant  to the  Designated
Participants  Stock Option Plan must be exercised  within 10 years following the
grant date.  As of December 31, 1999,  all 136,000  available  options have been
granted.

LONG-TERM  INCENTIVE PLAN - In June 1996, the Board of Directors  adopted,  upon
approval of the stockholders by proxy, the 1996 Long-Term  Incentive Plan of the
Company (the "LTIP").  The purpose of the LTIP is to reward key  individuals for
making major  contributions  to the success of the Company and its  subsidiaries
and to attract and retain the  services  of  qualified  and  capable  employees.
Options granted pursuant to the LTIP must be exercised within 10 years following
the  grant  date.  A total of  14,000,000  shares  of Class A Common  Stock  are
reserved for awards under the plan.  As of December 31, 1999,  9,635,670  shares
have been granted under the LTIP and  6,449,580  shares are available for future
grants.

INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN - In June 1996, the Board of Directors adopted, upon
approval of the  stockholders by proxy, an amendment to the Company's  Incentive
Stock Option Plan.  The purpose of the  amendment was (i) to increase the number
of shares of Class A Common  Stock  approved  for  issuance  under the plan from
800,000 to  1,000,000,  (ii) to lengthen  the period  after date of grant before
options  become  exercisable  from  two  years  to three  and  (iii) to  provide
immediate  termination  and  three-year  ratable  vesting  of options in certain
circumstances.  Options granted pursuant to the ISOP must be exercised within 10
years  following  the grant date. As of December 31, 1999,  714,200  shares have
been granted under the ISOP and 557,500 shares are available for future grants.

plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25,  "Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees,"  and provides pro
forma  disclosures  of  net  income  and  earnings  per  share  as if  the  fair
value-based  method  prescribed  by  SFAS  123 had  been  applied  in  measuring
compensation expense.

stock-based  compensation  plans been  determined  consistent with SFAS 123, the
Company's net income, net income applicable to common share before extraordinary

15.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT:

2000 STC  DISPOSITION.  In March 1999, the Company  entered into an agreement to
sell to STC the television  stations  WICS/WICD-TV in the Springfield,  Illinois
market and KGAN-TV in the Cedar Rapids, Iowa market (the "STC Disposition").  In
addition,  the  Company  agreed to sell the  Non-License  Assets  and  rights to
program WICD in the Springfield,  Illinois market.  The stations were being sold
to STC for a sales price of $81.0  million  and were  acquired by the Company in
connection  with  the Guy  Gannett  Acquisition.  In  April  1999,  the  Justice
Department  requested  additional  information in response to STC's filing under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act. According to the agreement, if
the  transaction  did not close by March 16,  2000 either STC or the Company may
terminate  the agreement at that time.  On March 15, 2000,  the Company  entered
into  an  agreement  to  terminate  the  STC  transaction.  As a  result  of its
termination,  the Company will record a cumulative  accounting adjustment during
the first quarter of 2000.
