ITEM 1. BUSINESS

                              BUSINESS OF SINCLAIR

     The Company is a diversified  broadcasting  company that  currently owns or
programs pursuant to LMAs 35 television  stations,  and upon consummation of all
pending acquisitions and dispositions,  the Company will own or program pursuant
to LMAs 56 television stations. The Company owns or programs pursuant to LMAs 52
radio  stations  and  upon   consummation  of  all  pending   acquisitions   and
dispositions,  the  Company  will  own or  program  pursuant  to LMAs  51  radio
stations. The Company also has options to acquire two additional radio stations.
The  Company  believes  that upon  completion  of all pending  acquisitions  and
dispositions  it will be one of the top 10 radio  groups in the  United  States,
when measured by the total number of radio stations owned or programmed pursuant
to LMAs.

     The 35  television  stations the Company owns or programs  pursuant to LMAs
are located in 24 geographically diverse markets, with 23 of the stations in the
top 51 television  DMAs in the United States.  Upon  consummation of all pending
acquisitions  and  dispositions,  the  Company  will own or  program  television
stations in 37  geographically  diverse markets (with 30 of such stations in the
top 51 DMAs) and will reach approximately 22.5% of the television  households in
the United States. The Company currently owns or programs 11 stations affiliated
with Fox, 10 with WB, four with ABC,  two with NBC,  two with UPN,  and one with
CBS. Five stations  operate as  independents.  Upon  consummation of all pending
acquisitions  and  dispositions  and the  transfer of  affiliations  pursuant to
existing agreements, 23 of the Company's owned or programmed television stations
will be Fox affiliates, 11 will be WB affiliates,  seven will be UPN affiliates,
five will be ABC  affiliates,  three will be NBC  affiliates,  one will be a CBS
affiliate and six will be operated as  independents.  Upon  consummation  of all
pending acquisitions and dispositions and transfers of affiliations  pursuant to
existing  agreements,  the Company will own or program more stations  affiliated
with Fox than any other broadcaster.

     The Company's radio station group is geographically  diverse with a variety
of programming  formats including  country,  urban,  news/talk/sports,  rock and
adult contemporary. Of the 52 stations owned or provided programming services by
the Company, 19 broadcast on the AM band and 33 on the FM band. The Company owns
between  three  and eight  stations  in all but one of the 12 radio  markets  it
serves.

     The Company has undergone rapid and  significant  growth over the course of
the last seven  years.  Since  1991,  the Company  has  increased  the number of
stations  it owns or  provides  programming  services  to from three  television
stations to 35 television stations and 52 radio stations. From 1991 to 1997, net
broadcast  revenues and Adjusted EBITDA (as defined herein) increased from $39.7
million  to  $471.2   million,   and  from  $15.5  million  to  $229.0  million,
respectively.  Pro forma for pending  acquisitions  and  dispositions  described
below  (except the  Montecito  Acquisition,  the Lakeland  Acquisition,  and the
execution of an LMA with respect to WSYX-TV), net broadcast revenue and Adjusted
EBITDA would have been $715.1 million and $345.7 million, respectively.

Operating Strategy

     The  Company's  television  operating  strategy  includes the following key
elements:

Attracting Viewership
- ---------------------

     The  Company  seeks to attract  viewership  and expand its  audience  share
through selective, high-quality programming.

     Popular  Programming.  The Company  believes  that an  important  factor in
attracting  viewership to its stations is their network  affiliations  with Fox,
WB, ABC,  NBC,  CBS and UPN.  These  affiliations  enable the Company to attract
viewers by virtue of the  quality  first-run  original  programming  provided by
these networks and the networks' promotion of such programming. The Company also
seeks to obtain, at attractive prices,  popular  syndicated  programming that is
complementary  to  the  station's  network  affiliation.   Examples  of  popular
syndicated  programming obtained by the Company for broadcast on its Fox, WB and
UPN affiliates and  independent  stations are "Mad About You,"  "Frasier,"  "The
Simpsons,"   "Home   Improvement"   and   "Seinfeld."  In  addition  to  network
programming,  the Company's ABC and CBS affiliates broadcast news magazine, talk
show, and game show  programming such as "Hard Copy,"  "Entertainment  Tonight,"
"Regis and Kathie Lee," "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy."

     Children's  Programming.  The  Company  seeks to be a leader in  children's
programming in each of its respective DMAs. The Company's nationally  recognized
"Kids  Club" was the  forerunner  and model for the Fox  network-wide  marketing
efforts promoting  children's  programming.  Sinclair carries the Fox Children's
Network  ("FCN") and WB and UPN  children's  programming,  all of which  include
significant  amounts  of  animated  programming  throughout  the week.  In those
markets  where the Company  owns or programs  ABC,  NBC or CBS  affiliates,  the
Company  broadcasts those networks'  animated  programming  during weekends.  In
addition to this animated  programming,  the Company  broadcasts  other forms of
children's programming, which may be produced by the Company or by an affiliated
network or supplied by a syndicated programmer.

     Counter-Programming. The Company's programming strategy on its Fox, WB, UPN
and independent stations also includes  "counter-programming," which consists of
broadcasting programs that are alternatives to the types of programs being shown
concurrently  on  competing  stations.  This  strategy  is  designed  to attract
additional  audience  share in  demographic  groups  not  served  by  concurrent
programming on competing  stations.  The Company believes that implementation of
this strategy enables its stations to achieve competitive rankings in households
in the 18-34,  18-49 and 25-54  demographics  and to offer greater  diversity of
programming in each of its DMAs.

     Local News. The Company  believes that the production and  broadcasting  of
local news can be an important link to the community and an aid to the station's
efforts to expand its  viewership.  In  addition,  local  news  programming  can
provide access to advertising  sources targeted  specifically to local news. The
Company carefully assesses the anticipated benefits and costs of producing local
news prior to introduction at a Company station because a significant investment
in capital equipment is required and substantial operating expenses are incurred
in  introducing,  developing and producing local news  programming.  The Company
currently provides local news programming at WBFF and WNUV in Baltimore, WLFL in
Raleigh/Durham, KDNL in St. Louis, KABB in San Antonio, KOVR in Sacramento, WPGH
in  Pittsburgh  and WLOS in Asheville and  Greenville/Spartanburg/Anderson.  The
Company also

                                        4

<PAGE>



broadcasts news programs on WDKY in Lexington, which are produced in part by the
Company  and in  part  through  the  purchase  of  production  services  from an
independent  third party, and on WTTV in  Indianapolis,  which are produced by a
third party in exchange for a limited  number of advertising  spots.  River City
provides the Company  certain  services  with respect to the  production of news
programming  and on air talent on WTTE in  Columbus.  Pursuant to an  agreement,
River City provides  these  services to the Company in return for a fee equal to
approximately  $416,000 per year. The possible introduction of local news at the
other Company  stations is reviewed  periodically.  The  Company's  policy is to
institute  local news  programming  at a specific  station  only if the expected
benefits of local news  programming  at the  station are  believed to exceed the
associated costs after an appropriate start-up period.

     Popular  Sporting  Events.  The  Company  attempts  to capture a portion of
advertising  dollars  designated to sports  programming  in selected  DMAs.  The
Company's WB, UPN and independent  stations generally face fewer restrictions on
broadcasting  live local  sporting  events  than do their  competitors  that are
affiliates of the major networks and Fox since  affiliates of the major networks
and Fox are subject to prohibitions  against preemptions of network programming.
The Company has been able to acquire the local  television  broadcast rights for
certain sporting events,  including NBA basketball,  Major League Baseball,  NFL
football, NHL hockey, ACC basketball,  Big Ten football and basketball,  and SEC
football.  The  Company  seeks to  expand  its  sports  broadcasting  in DMAs as
profitable  opportunities  arise. In addition,  the Company's  stations that are
affiliated  with Fox, NBC, ABC and CBS broadcast  certain Major League  Baseball
games, NFL football games and NHL hockey games as well as the Olympics and other
popular sporting events.

Innovative Local Sales and Marketing
- ------------------------------------

     The  Company  believes  that it is able to attract new  advertisers  to its
stations and increase its share of existing  customers'  advertising  budgets by
creating a sense of partnership  with those  advertisers.  The Company  develops
such relationships by training its sales forces to offer new marketing ideas and
campaigns to  advertisers.  These  campaigns  often involve the  sponsorship  by
advertisers of local  promotional  events that capitalize on the station's local
identity  and  programming  franchises.  For example,  several of the  Company's
stations  stage local "Kids Fairs" which allow station  advertisers to reinforce
their on-air  advertising with their target  audience.  Through its strong local
sales and marketing  focus,  the Company seeks to capture an increasing share of
its revenues from local  sources,  which are generally more stable than national
advertising.

Control of Operating and Programming Costs
- ------------------------------------------

     By employing a disciplined approach to managing programming acquisition and
other  costs,  the Company has been able to achieve  operating  margins that the
Company believes are among the highest in the television broadcast industry. The
Company has sought and will continue to seek to acquire quality  programming for
prices  at or  below  prices  paid in the  past.  As an  owner  or  provider  of
programming  services to a substantial number of television  stations throughout
the country,  the Company believes that it is able to negotiate  favorable terms
for the acquisition of programming.  Moreover, the Company emphasizes control of
each of its stations'  programming and operating costs through  program-specific
profit  analysis,  detailed  budgeting,  tight control over staffing  levels and
detailed long-term planning models.

Attract and Retain High Quality Management
- ------------------------------------------

     The  Company  believes  that much of its  success is due to its  ability to
attract and retain highly skilled and motivated managers,  both at the corporate
and local station  levels.  A portion of the  compensation  provided to regional
managers,  general managers,  sales managers and other station managers is based
on their  achieving  certain  operating  results.  The Company also provides its
corporate and station managers with deferred compensation plans offering options
to acquire Class A Common Stock.

Community Involvement
- ---------------------

     Each of the Company's  stations actively  participates in various community
activities and offers many community services.  The Company's activities include
broadcasting  programming  of local  interest and  sponsorship  of community and
charitable events. The Company also encourages its station employ-

                                       5

<PAGE>



ees to become active members of their communities and to promote  involvement in
community and charitable  affairs.  The Company  believes that active  community
involvement  by its stations  provides its stations with  increased  exposure in
their  respective  DMAs and  ultimately  increases  viewership  and  advertising
support.

Establish LMAs
- --------------

     The Company  believes  that it can attain  significant  growth in operating
cash flow through the utilization of LMAs. By expanding its presence in a market
in which it owns a station,  the Company can  improve its  competitive  position
with respect to a  demographic  sector.  In addition,  by providing  programming
services to an  additional  station in a market,  the Company is able to realize
significant economies of scale in marketing,  programming,  overhead and capital
expenditures.  After giving effect to all pending acquisitions and dispositions,
the  Company  will  provide  programming  services  pursuant  to  an  LMA  to an
additional  station in 18 of the 37 television markets in which the Company will
own or program a station.

Programming and Affiliations

     The Company  continually  reviews its existing  programming  inventory  and
seeks to purchase the most  profitable and  cost-effective  syndicated  programs
available  for each time period.  In  developing  its  selection  of  syndicated
programming, the Company balances the cost of available syndicated programs with
their  potential to increase  advertising  revenue and the risk of their reduced
popularity  during  the  term of the  program  contract.  The  Company  seeks to
purchase only those programs with  contractual  periods that permit  programming
flexibility  and which  complement  a station's  overall  programming  strategy.
Programs  that can  perform  successfully  in more than one time period are more
attractive  due to the long lead time and  multi-year  commitments  inherent  in
program purchasing.

     Of the 35 stations owned or provided  programming  services by the Company,
11 stations are Fox affiliates, 10 stations are WB affiliates, four stations are
ABC  affiliates,   two  stations  are  NBC  affiliates,  two  stations  are  UPN
affiliates,  and one  station  is a CBS  affiliate.  The  networks  produce  and
distribute  programming  in exchange for each  station's  commitment  to air the
programming at specified times and for commercial  announcement  time during the
programming.  In addition,  networks other than Fox and UPN pay each  affiliated
station a fee for each network-sponsored program broadcast by the stations.

     On August 21, 1996,  the Company  entered  into an agreement  with Fox (the
"Fox  Agreement")  which,  among other  things,  provides  that the  affiliation
agreements between Fox and eight stations owned or provided programming services
by the Company  (except as noted below)  would be amended to have new  five-year
terms commencing on the date of the Fox Agreement.  Fox has the option to extend
the affiliation agreements for additional five-year terms and must extend all of
the  affiliation  agreements if it extends any (except that Fox may  selectively
renew  affiliation  agreements  if any  station  has  breached  its  affiliation
agreement). The Fox Agreement also provides that the Company will have the right
to  purchase,  for fair  market  value,  any  station  Fox  acquires in a market
currently  served by a  Company-owned  Fox  affiliate  (other than the  Norfolk,
Virginia  and  Raleigh/Durham,  North  Carolina  markets) if Fox  determines  to
terminate the  affiliation  agreement with the Company's  station in that market
and operate the station  acquired by Fox as a Fox  affiliate.  The Fox Agreement
confirmed  that the  affiliation  agreements  for WTVZ-TV  (Norfolk) and WLFL-TV
(Raleigh/Durham)  will  terminate on August 31,  1998.  The Fox  Agreement  also
includes  provisions  limiting  the  ability  of  the  Company  to  preempt  Fox
programming  except  where it has  existing  programming  conflicts or where the
Company preempts to serve a public purpose.

     On July 4, 1997,  the Company  entered into the WB  Agreement,  pursuant to
which  the  Company  agreed  that  certain  stations  affiliated  with UPN would
terminate their affiliations with UPN at the end of the current affiliation term
in January 1998, and would enter into  affiliation  agreements with WB effective
as of that date.  With respect to the  following  stations,  the Company did not
renew their  affiliation  agreements with UPN when their  agreements  expired on
January  15,  1998:  WCWB-TV,  Pittsburgh,   Pennsylvania,  WNUV-TV,  Baltimore,
Maryland,  WSTR-TV,  Cincinnati,  Ohio, KRRT-TV,  San Antonio,  Texas,  KOCB-TV,
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, KSMO-TV, Kansas City, Missouri, KUPN-TV, Las

Vegas, Nevada, WCGV-TV, Milwaukee,  Wisconsin, and WABM-TV, Birmingham, Alabama.
Additionally,   the  Company  cancelled  its  UPN  affiliation   agreement  with
WTTV-TV/WTTK-TV,  Indianapolis, Indiana. These stations (other than WCGV-TV, and
WABM-TV, which will either operate as independents or enter into new affiliation
agreements  with  WB or  another  network)  entered  into  ten-year  affiliation
agreements  with WB which  became  effective  on January  16,  1998  (other than
WTTV-TV/ WTTK-TV, with respect to which the affiliation agreement is expected to
begin April 6, 1998 and KSMO-TV, with respect to which the affiliation agreement
is expected  to begin March 30,  1998).  Pursuant  to the WB  Agreement,  the WB
affiliation   agreements  of  WVTV-TV,   Milwaukee,   Wisconsin,   and  WTTO-TV,
Birmingham,  Alabama  (whose  programming  is simulcast on WDBB-TV,  Tuscaloosa,
Alabama),  have been extended to January 16, 2008.  In addition,  WFBC-TV in the
Asheville,  North Carolina and  Greenville/Spartanburg/Anderson,  South Carolina
market will  become  affiliated  with WB on  November 1, 1999 when WB's  current
affiliation  with  another  station in that market  expires.  WTVZ-TV,  Norfolk,
Virginia and WLFL-TV, Raleigh/Durham North Carolina, will become affiliated with
WB when their affiliations with Fox expire. These Fox affiliations are scheduled
to expire on August 31, 1998.

     Under the terms of the WB  Agreement,  WB has agreed to pay the Company $64
million in aggregate amount in monthly installments during the first eight years
commencing on January 16, 1998 in consideration for the Company's  entering into
affiliation  agreements  with WB. In  addition,  WB will be  obligated to pay an
additional $10 million  aggregate amount in monthly  installments in each of the
following two years provided that WB is in the business of supplying programming
as a television network during each of those years.

     The affiliation  agreements relating to stations that have been acquired by
the Company are  terminable  by the network upon  transfer to the Company of the
License  Assets  of the  station.  The  Company  does not seek  consents  of the
affected  network to the  transfer  of  License  Assets in  connection  with its
acquisitions.  As of the date of this Form 10-K,  no network has  terminated  an
affiliation agreement following transfer of License Assets to the Company.

Radio Operating Strategy

     The Company's  radio  strategy is to operate a cluster of radio stations in
selected  geographic markets throughout the country.  In each geographic market,
the  Company  employs  broadly  diversified  programming  formats to appeal to a
variety of demographic groups within the market. The Company seeks to strengthen
the identity of each of its stations  through its  programming  and  promotional
efforts,  and emphasizes that identity to a far greater degree than the identity
of any local radio personality.

     The Company believes that its strategy of appealing to diverse  demographic
groups in selected  geographic  markets allows it to reach a larger share of the
overall  advertising  market  while  realizing  economies  of scale and avoiding
dependence  on one  demographic  or  geographic  market.  The  Company  realizes
economies  of scale  by  combining  sales  and  marketing  forces,  back  office
operations and general  management in each geographic  market. At the same time,
the  geographic  diversity of its portfolio of radio  stations  helps lessen the
potential impact of economic  downturns in specific markets and the diversity of
target  audiences  served  helps  lessen  the  impact of  changes  in  listening
preferences.  In addition,  the geographic and demographic  diversity allows the
Company to avoid dependence on any one or any small group of advertisers.

     The  Company's  group of radio  stations  includes the top billing  station
group in four markets and one of the top three billing station groups in each of
its  markets  other  than  Los  Angeles,  Milwaukee,   Portland,  Rochester  and
Nashville. Through ownership or LMAs, the group also includes duopolies in 12 of
its 13 markets.

     Depending on the programming  format of a particular  station,  there are a
predetermined  number  of  advertisements   broadcast  each  hour.  The  Company
determines the optimum number of  advertisements  available for sale during each
hour without jeopardizing listening levels (and the resulting ratings). Although
there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements  available
for sale during a particular  time of day,  the total  number of  advertisements
available for sale on a particular station normally does not vary significantly.
Any  change in net  radio  broadcasting  revenue,  with the  exception  of those
instances  where  stations  are  acquired or sold,  is  generally  the result of
pricing adjustments made to ensure that the station effectively uses advertising
time  available  for sale,  an increase in the number of  commercials  sold or a
combination of these two factors.

     Large,  well-trained  local sales forces are  maintained  by the Company in
each of its radio markets.  The Company's principal goal is to utilize its sales
efforts to develop long-standing  customer relationships through frequent direct
contacts,  which the Company believes  provide it with a competitive  advantage.
Additionally,  in some radio  markets,  duopolies  permit  the  Company to offer
creative advertising packages to local, regional and national advertisers.  Each
radio  station  owned by the Company also engages a national  independent  sales
representative to assist it in obtaining national  advertising  revenues.  These
representatives  obtain advertising  through national  advertising  agencies and
receive a commission  from the radio station based on its gross revenue from the
advertising obtained.

BROADCASTING ACQUISITION STRATEGY

     On February 8, 1996,  the  Telecommunications  Act of 1996 (the "1996 Act")
was signed into law. The 1996 Act represents  the most sweeping  overhaul of the
country's  telecommunications  laws  since the  Communications  Act of 1934,  as
amended (the "Communications Act"). The 1996 Act relaxes the broadcast ownership
rules and simplifies the process for renewal of broadcast station licenses.

     The Company  believes  that the  enactment of the 1996 Act has  presented a
unique opportunity to build a larger and more diversified  broadcasting company.
Additionally,  the Company  expects  that the  opportunity  to act as one of the
consolidators  of the  industry  will  enable  the  Company  to gain  additional
influence  with program  suppliers,  television  networks,  other  vendors,  and
alternative delivery media.

                                       10

<PAGE>



The  additions to the  Company's  management  team as a result of the River City
Acquisition  have  given it  additional  resources  to take  advantage  of these
developments.

     In implementing its acquisition strategy, the Company seeks to identify and
pursue favorable  station or group  acquisition  opportunities  primarily in the
15th to 75th  largest  DMAs and  Metro  Service  Areas  ("MSAs").  In  assessing
potential  acquisitions,  the Company examines  opportunities to improve revenue
share, audience share and/or cost control.  Additional factors considered by the
Company in a potential  acquisition  include  geographic  location,  demographic
characteristics  and  competitive  dynamics  of the  market.  The  Company  also
considers the opportunity for  cross-ownership  of television and radio stations
and the opportunity it may provide for cross-promotion and cross-selling.

     In  conjunction  with its  acquisitions,  the  Company may  determine  that
certain  of the  acquired  stations  may not be  consistent  with the  Company's
strategic plan. In such an event, the Company reviews opportunities for swapping
such  stations  with third  parties for other  stations or selling such stations
outright.  The Heritage,  Max Media, and Sullivan  Acquisitions may provide such
opportunities.

     Certain terms of the  Company's  acquisitions  in 1998 and 1997,  and other
pending acquisitions, are described below.

1998 ACQUISITIONS

     Sullivan  Acquisition.  In February 1998,  the Company  entered into merger
agreements  by which  the  Company  agreed  to  acquire  all of the  issued  and
outstanding  capital  stock of  Sullivan  Broadcast  Holdings,  Inc.  ("Sullivan
Holdings")  and  Sullivan  Broadcasting  Company  II, Inc.  ("Sullivan  II" and,
together with Sullivan  Holdings,  "Sullivan")  for an aggregate  purchase price
expected to be  approximately  $950  million to $1  billion,  less the amount of
outstanding  indebtedness  of  Sullivan  Holdings  assumed by the  Company  (the
"Sullivan  Acquisition").  The Sullivan  Acquisition will be accomplished by two
separate merger closings.

     At the  initial  closing,  the Company  will  acquire all of the issued and
outstanding  capital  stock of Sullivan  Holdings,  after which the Company will
indirectly own all of the operating  assets  (excluding the License  Assets) of,
and  pursuant  to LMAs will  provide  programming  services  to,  13  additional
television  stations  (the  "Sullivan   Stations")  in  the  following  markets:
Nashville,    Tennessee;   Buffalo,   New   York;   Oklahoma   City,   Oklahoma;
Greensboro/Winston-Salem/High    Point,    North   Carolina;    Dayton,    Ohio;
Charleston/Huntington,  West Virginia;  Richmond,  Virginia;  Las Vegas, Nevada;
Rochester, New York; Madison, Wisconsin; and Utica, New York.

     The  purchase  price to be paid at the initial  closing  will be based on a
multiple of Sullivan's projected 1998 cash flow calculated as of the time of the
initial  closing.  As part of the total  consideration to be paid at the initial
closing,  the Company, at its option, may issue to the Sullivan  shareholders up
to $100  million  of the  Company's  Class A Common  Stock  based on an  average
closing  price of the Class A Common  Stock.  The initial  closing is subject to
termination of the  applicable  waiting period under the HSR Act and is expected
to occur during the second quarter of 1998.

     At the second  closing,  the  Company  will  acquire  all of the issued and
outstanding  capital  stock of  Sullivan  II. The second  closing is subject to,
among other  things,  FCC  approval  and is  expected to close  during the third
quarter of 1998. FCC regulations  require the Company to obtain waivers from the
FCC of  multiple  ownership  rules  prior to the second  closing.  Although  the
Company is  confident  that it will  receive  FCC  consents  for the merger with
Sullivan  II,  there can be no assurance  that such  consents  will be obtained.
After the second closing,  the Company will indirectly own the License Assets of
six of the 13 Sullivan  Stations,  and will  continue  to program the  remaining
seven Sullivan  Stations  pursuant to seven LMAs,  five with Sullivan  Broadcast
Company III, Inc. ("Sullivan III"), which at the time of the second closing will
hold the License Assets for such stations,  and two with the existing  owners of
the License Assets of such stations.

     In connection with the Sullivan Acquisition,  Glencairn, Ltd. ("Glencairn")
has entered into a plan of merger with Sullivan III which,  if completed,  would
result in Glencairn's  ownership of all the issued and outstanding capital stock
of Sullivan III. After the merger, the Company intends to enter into an

                                       11

<PAGE>



LMA with  Glencairn  and  continue to provide  programming  services to the five
stations the License Assets of which are acquired by Glencairn in the merger.

     Montecito  Acquisition.  In  February  1998,  the Company  entered  into an
agreement to acquire all of the capital stock of Montecito for approximately $33
million.  Montecito owns all of the issued and outstanding  stock of Channel 33,
Inc.,  which owns and operates  KFBT-TV in Las Vegas,  Nevada.  Sinclair  cannot
acquire  Montecito  unless  and  until  FCC  rules  permit  Sinclair  to own the
broadcast  license for more than one station in the Las Vegas market,  or unless
Sinclair no longer  owns the  broadcast  license  for KUPN-TV in Las Vegas.  The
Company will operate  KFBT-TV  through an LMA, upon expiration of the applicable
HSR Act waiting period.  The Company expects to be able to enter into the LMA in
the second quarter of 1998.

     Columbus Purchase Option. In connection with the Company's 1996 acquisition
of the radio and television broadcasting assets of River City Broadcasting, L.P.
("River City"),  the Company acquired a three-year option to purchase the assets
of WSYX-TV in Columbus, Ohio (the "Columbus Option"). The exercise price for the
Columbus  Option is  approximately  $100 million plus an amount of  indebtedness
relating to the WSYX-TV assets on the date of exercise (such indebtedness not to
exceed $135  million).  The  exercise  price is expected to be financed  through
borrowings under the Company's Bank Credit  Agreement.  Pursuant to the Columbus
Option, the Company is required to make certain quarterly "Option Extension Fee"
payments,  as defined in the  Columbus  Option . These fees began  December  31,
1996, and continue until the exercise price on the Columbus  Option is paid. The
Option  Extension  Fees are  calculated  as 8% per annum of the option  exercise
price through the first  anniversary of the date of grant,  15% per annum of the
option  exercise  price through the second  anniversary of the date of grant and
25% per annum of the option exercise price thereafter.  As of December 31, 1997,
the Company  incurred Option  Extension Fees and other costs relating to WSYX-TV
totaling $22.9 million. The Company currently intends to pay $100 million of the
option  exercise  price  prior to May 31,  1998 (the  date on which  the  Option
Extension  fee of 25% per annum  goes into  effect) in order to  extinguish  the
Company's  obligations to make continuing Option Extension Fee payments.  Due to
the Company's  ownership of another  television  station in the  Columbus,  Ohio
market, the Antitrust  Division of the DOJ is currently  reviewing the Company's
acquisition of and the right to operate WSYX-TV  pursuant to an LMA. The Company
has  entered  into an  agreement  with the DOJ  pursuant to which the Company is
required to notify the DOJ 10 business days before it begins programming WSYX-TV
pursuant to on LMA or exercises  the  Columbus  Option or enters into a LMA with
respect  to  WSYX-TV,  which  will give the DOJ the  opportunity  to enjoin  the
Company's action, if it chooses to do so.

     The Company has agreed to sell the License  Assets of WTTE-TV in  Columbus,
Ohio to Glencairn and to enter into an LMA with Glencairn to provide programming
services to WTTE-TV. The FCC has approved this transaction, but the Company does
not believe that this  transaction will be completed unless the Company acquires
WSYX-TV.

     Other Dispositions. The Company has entered into on agreement to sell three
radio stations in the Nashville, Tennessee market for approximately $35 million.
The Company expects the closing to occur in the fourth quarter of 1998.

1997 ACQUISITIONS

     Max Media  Acquisition.  On December  2, 1997,  the  Company  entered  into
agreements to acquire,  directly or indirectly,  all of the equity  interests of
Max Media. As a result of this transaction, the Company will acquire, or acquire
the right to program pursuant to LMAs, nine television  stations and eight radio
stations in eight markets.  The television stations serve the following markets:
Dayton,  Ohio;  Syracuse,  New  York;  Paducah,  Kentucky  and  Cape  Girardeau,
Missouri; Tri-Cities, Tennessee/Virginia; Tyler/Longview, Texas; and Charleston,
South   Carolina.   The  radio   stations   serve  the  Norfolk,   Virginia  and
Greensboro/Winston  Salem/High  Point,  North  Carolina  markets.  The aggregate
purchase price is approximately  $255 million payable in cash at closing (less a
deposit of $12.8 million paid at the time of signing the acquisition agreement),
a portion of which will be used to retire existing debt of Max Media at closing.
Max  Media's  television  station  WKEF-TV  in Dayton,  Ohio has an  overlapping
service area with the Company's  television  stations WTTE-TV in Columbus,  Ohio
and WSTR-TV in Cincinnati,

                                       12

<PAGE>



Ohio as well as with Company LMA station WTTV-TV in  Indianapolis,  Indiana.  In
addition,    Max   Media's    television    station   WEMT-TV   in   Tri-Cities,
Tennessee/Virginia has an overlapping service area with the Company's television
station    WLOS-TV   in    Asheville,    North    Carolina    and    Greenville/
Spartanburg/Anderson,  South Carolina and Max Media's television station KBSI-TV
in Paducah,  Kentucky and Cape  Girardeau,  Missouri has an overlapping  service
area with the  Company's  television  station  KDNL-TV in St.  Louis,  Missouri.
Furthermore,  the Company owns a television  station and three radio stations in
the  Norfolk,  Virginia  market,  where four of Max Media's  radio  stations are
located. Consequently, the Company has requested various waivers from the FCC to
allow  the  Company  to  complete  the Max  Media  Acquisition.  There can be no
assurance  that  such  waivers  will be  granted.  As a result  of the Max Media
Acquisition and the Heritage Acquisition,  the Company intends to dispose of two
of the FM radio  stations  in the  Norfolk,  Virginia  radio  market that it has
agreed to acquire from Heritage and Max Media in order to be in compliance  with
the FCC regulations that limit the number of radio stations that can be owned in
a market.  The  Company has sought FCC  approval to assign the  licenses of such
radio stations and an additional radio station it presently owns in the Norfolk,
Virginia market to an independent  trustee. The Max Media Acquisition is subject
to approval by the FCC and  termination of the  applicable  waiting period under
the HSR Act,  and is  expected  to  close in the  second  quarter  of 1998.  The
transaction is expected to be financed  through  borrowings  under the Company's
Bank Credit Agreement.

     Lakeland  Acquisition.  On November  14, 1997,  the Company  entered into a
definitive  agreement to acquire 100% of the stock of Lakeland Group Television,
Inc. In the Lakeland  Acquisition,  the Company will acquire  television station
KLGT in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. The purchase price is approximately $50
million in cash plus the assumption of certain  indebtedness  of Lakeland not to
exceed $2.5 million.  KLGT-TV,  Channel 23, is the WB affiliate in  Minneapolis,
the nation's 14th largest  market.  The Company  intends to finance the purchase
price from borrowings under the Bank Credit Agreement.  The Lakeland Acquisition
is subject to, among other things,  approval by the FCC and  termination  of the
applicable  waiting  period  under the HSR Act,  and is expected to close in the
first or second quarter of 1998.

     Heritage  Acquisition.  On July 16,  1997,  the  Company  entered  into the
Heritage  Acquisition  Agreements  with certain  subsidiaries  of Heritage.  The
aggregate  purchase  price of the Heritage  Acquisition  is  approximately  $630
million,  less  deposits  paid of $65.5 million and amounts paid in January 1998
relating to the closing of certain  television assets of $215 million.  Pursuant
to the  Heritage  Acquisition  Agreements,  the  Company  obtained  the right to
acquire the assets of five television  stations (the interests in three of which
the Company has agreed to dispose or described herein), programming rights under
LMAs  with  respect  to two  additional  television  stations  (one of which the
Company has agreed to dispose as described  herein),  and the assets of 24 radio
stations (11 of which the Company has agreed to dispose as described herein).

     On January 29, 1998, the Company closed on the acquisitions of the Heritage
television  stations  serving  the  Charleston/Huntington   market,  Mobile  and
Pensacola market and the Oklahoma City market for an aggregate purchase price of
$215  million.   Simultaneously  with  the  closing,  the  Company  disposed  of
television  station KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City to Sullivan  Broadcasting  Company,
Inc. for an aggregate sale price of $60 million.  Also  simultaneously  with the
closing,  the Company entered into purchase option agreements  pursuant to which
the Company has the option to acquire  KOKH-TV  from  Sullivan  for an aggregate
purchase  price of $60 million and  Sullivan  has the option to acquire from the
Company television station WCHS-TV in the  Charleston/Huntington,  West Virginia
market for an aggregate purchase price of $30 million.  In consideration for the
execution of the purchase  option  agreements,  the Company made an option grant
payment to Sullivan of $45 million and Sullivan  made an option grant payment to
the Company of $15 million.  In connection  with the Sullivan  Acquisition,  the
Company will reacquire  KOKH-TV.  On February 27, 1998 the Company closed on its
acquisition of all of the Heritage  radio stations  except the three stations in
the New Orleans market.  On March 6, 1998, the Company closed on the acquisition
of  the  Heritage  television  stations  serving  the  Burlington,  Vermont  and
Plattsburgh, New York market for an aggregate purchase price of $75 million.

     In January  1998,  the Company  entered  into an  agreement  with  Entercom
pursuant to which the Company  will sell to Entercom  the  Portland,  Oregon and
Rochester, New York radio stations which the

                                       13

<PAGE>



Company  acquired  from Heritage for an aggregate  sales price of  approximately
$126.5 million. Subject to approval by the FCC and termination of the applicable
waiting  period under the HSR Act, the Company  anticipates it will close on the
sale of the Portland and Rochester  radio stations to Entercom during the second
quarter of 1998. Entercom is operating these stations pursuant to an LMA pending
closing of the sale.

     In February 1998,  the Company  entered into an agreement with STC pursuant
to which  STC has  agreed to  acquire  the  License  and  Non-License  Assets of
Burlington,  Vermont and  Plattsburgh,  New York  television  stations  WPTZ-TV,
WNNE-TV,  and the  Non-License  Assets of WFFF-TV for $75  million.  The Company
expects to close the sale to STC during the second  quarter of 1998  subject to,
among other  conditions,  approval by the FCC and  termination of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act.

     Acquisition  of the Heritage  radio  stations in the New Orleans  market is
conditioned  on, among other  things,  FCC approval  and the  expiration  of the
applicable  waiting  period  under the HSR Act.  The Company has entered into an
agreement to divest  certain radio  stations it owns or has the right to acquire
in the New  Orleans  market and expects to receive FCC  approval  and  clearance
under the HSR Act in connection with such disposition.  In addition, the Company
intends to  dispose of two of the FM radio  stations  in the  Norfolk,  Virginia
radio market that it has agreed to acquire from  Heritage and Max Media in order
to be in compliance with FCC regulations that limit the number of radio stations
that can be owned in a market. See "-- Max Media Acquisition." A third party has
also  exercised  its option to acquire  from the Company  radio  station KCAZ in
Kansas City, Missouri.

     Las Vegas  Acquisition.  On January 30, 1997,  the Company  entered into an
agreement  to acquire the assets of  KUPN-TV,  the UPN  affiliate  in Las Vegas,
Nevada, for approximately $87.0 million.  The Company completed this acquisition
on May 30, 1997.

ONGOING DISCUSSIONS

     In furtherance of its acquisition  strategy,  the Company routinely reviews
and conducts  investigations of potential television,  radio station and related
businesses  acquisitions.  When the  Company  believes a  favorable  opportunity
exists,  the  Company  seeks to enter into  discussions  with the owners of such
businesses  regarding the possibility of an acquisition,  disposition or station
swap. At any given time, the Company may be in discussions with one or more such
business  owners.  The Company is in serious  negotiations  with various parties
relating to the  disposition  and  acquisition of television,  radio and related
properties  which would be disposed of and acquired for aggregate  consideration
of  approximately  $75 million and $60  million,  respectively.  There can be no
assurance  that  any of  these or other  negotiations  will  lead to  definitive
agreement  or,  if  agreements  are  reached,  that  any  transactions  would be
consummated.

LOCAL MARKETING AGREEMENTS

     The Company currently has LMA arrangements with television stations in nine
markets in which it owns a television station: Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania (WCWB),
Baltimore,  Maryland (WNUV), Raleigh/ Durham, North Carolina (WRDC),  Milwaukee,
Wisconsin  (WVTV),  Birmingham,  Alabama  (WABM),  San  Antonio,  Texas  (KRRT),
Asheville,  North Carolina and  Greenville/Spartanburg/Anderson,  South Carolina
(WFBC), Mobile, Alabama and Pensacola,  Florida (WFGX), and Burlington,  Vermont
and Plattsburgh,  New York (WFFF). The Company will provide programming under an
LMA to a station in a tenth market where it owns a television station (KFBT, Las
Vegas) upon  expiration of the applicable HSR Act waiting  period.  In addition,
the Company has an LMA  arrangement  with a station in the  Tuscaloosa,  Alabama
market (WDBB),  which is adjacent to Birmingham.  In each of these markets other
than Pittsburgh,  Tuscaloosa, Mobile and Pensacola, Las Vegas and Burlington and
Plattsburgh,  the LMA  arrangement  is with  Glencairn  and the Company owns the
Non-License  Assets of the stations.  The Company also has LMA arrangements with
radio   stations   in  two   markets   in   which   it  owns   radio   stations,
Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Pennsylvania and New Orleans, Louisiana. In addition, the
Company  entered  into two LMAs with  respect to WTTV and WTTK in  Indianapolis,
Indiana. At the Company's request, the FCC has withheld action on an application
for the Company's acquisition of WTTV and

                                       14

<PAGE>



WTTK in Indianapolis (and a pending application for the Controlling Stockholders
to divest  their  attributable  interests in WIIB) until the FCC  completes  its
pending  rulemaking  proceeding   considering  the  cross-interest   policy.  In
addition,  in connection with the pending  acquisitions,  the Company will enter
into certain LMAs. See "-- 1998 Acquisitions and "-- 1997 Acquisitions."

     The Company  believes  that it is able to increase its revenues and improve
its margins by providing  programming  services to stations in selected DMAs and
MSAs where the Company  already  owns a station.  In certain  instances,  single
station  operators and stations operated by smaller ownership groups do not have
the management expertise or the operating  efficiencies available to the Company
as a multi-station  broadcaster.  The Company seeks to identify such stations in
selected markets and to provide such stations with programming services pursuant
to  LMAs.  In  addition  to  providing  the  Company  with  additional   revenue
opportunities,  the Company believes that these LMA  arrangements  have assisted
certain  stations  whose  operations  may have  been  marginally  profitable  to
continue to air popular  programming  and contribute to diversity of programming
in their respective DMAs and MSAs.

     In many cases where the Company enters into LMA  arrangements in connection
with a station whose  acquisition  by the Company is pending FCC  approval,  the
Company  (i)  obtains an option to acquire  the  station  assets  essential  for
broadcasting  a  television  or  radio  signal  in  compliance  with  regulatory
guidelines,  generally consisting of the FCC license, transmitter,  transmission
lines, technical equipment, call letters and trademarks,  and certain furniture,
fixtures and equipment  (the  "License  Assets") and (ii) acquires the remaining
assets  (the  "Non-License  Assets")  at the time it  enters  into  the  option.
Following  acquisition of the Non-License Assets, the License Assets continue to
be owned by the owner-operator and holder of the FCC license,  which enters into
an LMA with the Company.  After FCC approval for transfer of the License  Assets
is obtained,  the Company exercises its option to acquire the License Assets and
become the owner-operator of the station, and the LMA arrangement is terminated.

USE OF DIGITAL TELEVISION TECHNOLOGY

     The  Company   believes  that  television   broadcasting  may  be  enhanced
significantly   by  the  development  and  increased   availability  of  digital
broadcasting service technology. This technology has the potential to permit the
Company to provide viewers multiple channels of digital  television over each of
its  existing  standard  channels,  to  provide  certain  programming  in a high
definition  television  format and to deliver  various forms of data,  including
data  on  the  Internet,  to  home  and  business  computers.  These  additional
capabilities  may  provide  the  Company  with  additional  sources of  revenue,
although the Company may be required to incur  significant  additional  costs in
connection therewith. The Company is currently considering plans to provide high
definition  television  ("HDTV"),  to provide  multiple  channels of  television
including the provision of additional broadcast programming and transmitted data
on a subscription  basis, and to continue its current TV program channels on its
allocated digital television ("DTV") channels. The FCC has granted authority for
the Company to conduct  experimental DTV  multicasting  operations in Baltimore,
Maryland.  The 1996 Act allows the FCC to charge a spectrum fee to  broadcasters
who use the digital spectrum to offer  subscription-based  services, and the FCC
has  opened  a  rulemaking  to  consider  the  spectrum  fees to be  charged  to
broadcasters  for  such  use.  In  addition,   Congress  has  held  hearings  on
broadcasters'  plans for the use of their digital  spectrum.  The Company cannot
predict what future  actions the FCC or Congress might take with respect to DTV,
nor can it predict the effect of the FCC's  present DTV  implementation  plan or
such future actions on the Company's  business.  DTV technology is not currently
available  to the viewing  public and a successful  transition  from the current
analog broadcast format to a digital format may take many years. There can be no
assurance  that the Company's  efforts to take  advantage of the new  technology
will be commercially successful.

FEDERAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING

     The  ownership,  operation  and sale of television  and radio  stations are
subject to the  jurisdiction of the FCC, which acts under  authority  granted by
the Communications  Act. Among other things, the FCC assigns frequency bands for
broadcasting;  determines  the particular  frequencies,  locations and operating
power of  stations;  issues,  renews,  revokes and  modifies  station  licenses;
regulates  equipment  used by stations;  adopts and implements  regulations  and
policies that directly or indirectly affect the ownership,

                                       15

<PAGE>



operation  and  employment  practices of  stations;  and has the power to impose
penalties for violations of its rules or the Communications Act.

     The   following  is  a  brief   summary  of  certain   provisions   of  the
Communications  Act,  the 1996 Act and specific FCC  regulations  and  policies.
Reference should be made to the Communications  Act, the 1996 Act, FCC rules and
the public notices and rulings of the FCC for further information concerning the
nature and extent of federal regulation of broadcast stations.

     License Grant and Renewal.  Television and radio stations  operate pursuant
to broadcasting  licenses that are granted by the FCC for maximum terms of eight
years.

     Television  and  radio  station   licenses  are  subject  to  renewal  upon
application to the FCC.  During certain  periods when renewal  applications  are
pending,  competing  applicants  may file for the radio or television  frequency
being used by the renewal applicant.  During the same periods, petitions to deny
license  renewal  applications  may be filed by  interested  parties,  including
members  of the  public.  The  FCC is  required  to  hold  hearings  on  renewal
applications  if it is unable to determine that renewal of a license would serve
the public interest,  convenience and necessity, or if a petition to deny raises
a  "substantial  and  material  question of fact" as to whether the grant of the
renewal  application would be prima facie inconsistent with the public interest,
convenience  and  necessity.  However,  the FCC is prohibited  from  considering
competing applications for a renewal applicant's  frequency,  and is required to
grant the renewal application, if the FCC finds: (i) that the station has served
the public  interest,  convenience  and necessity;  (ii) that there have been no
serious  violations by the licensee of the  Communications  Act or the rules and
regulations  of the FCC; and (iii) that there have been no other  violations  by
the licensee of the  Communications  Act or the rules and regulations of the FCC
that, when taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse.

     All of the  stations  that  the  Company  currently  owns and  operates  or
provides  programming  services to  pursuant  to LMAs,  or intends to acquire or
provide  programming  services  pursuant  to LMAs  in  connection  with  pending
acquisitions, are presently operating under regular licenses, which expire as to
each station on the dates set forth under "-- Television  Broadcasting"  and "--
Radio Broadcasting,"  above.  Although renewal of license is granted in the vast
majority  of cases  even  when  petitions  to deny are  filed,  there  can be no
assurance that the licenses of such stations will be renewed.

Ownership Matters

General
- -------

     The  Communications  Act prohibits the assignment of a broadcast license or
the transfer of control of a broadcast  licensee  without the prior  approval of
the FCC. In determining  whether to permit the assignment or transfer of control
of, or the grant or renewal of, a broadcast license,  the FCC considers a number
of factors pertaining to the licensee,  including  compliance with various rules
limiting common ownership of media  properties,  the "character" of the licensee
and those persons holding "attributable"  interests therein, and compliance with
the Communications Act's limitations on alien ownership.

     To obtain the FCC's prior consent to assign a broadcast license or transfer
control of a broadcast licensee,  an appropriate  application must be filed with
the FCC. If the  application  involves a  "substantial  change" in  ownership or
control,  the  application  must be  placed  on  public  notice  for a period of
approximately  30 days during  which  petitions to deny the  application  may be
filed by interested parties, including members of the public. If the application
does not involve a  "substantial  change" in ownership or control,  it is a "pro
forma"  application.  The "pro forma" application is not subject to petitions to
deny or a  mandatory  waiting  period,  but is  nevertheless  subject  to having
informal  objections  filed  against  it.  If the FCC  grants an  assignment  or
transfer application,  interested parties have approximately 30 days from public
notice of the grant to seek reconsideration or review of that grant.  Generally,
parties  that do not  file  initial  petitions  to deny or  informal  objections
against the application face difficulty in seeking  reconsideration or review of
the grant. The FCC normally has approximately an additional 10 days to set aside
such  grant  on its own  motion.  When  passing  on an  assignment  or  transfer
application,  the FCC is prohibited from considering whether the public interest
might be  served by an  assignment  or  transfer  to any  party  other  than the
assignee or transferee specified in the application.

                                       16

     The FCC generally applies its ownership limits to "attributable"  interests
held by an individual,  corporation,  partnership or other  association.  In the
case of corporations  holding, or through  subsidiaries  controlling,  broadcast
licenses,  the  interests  of  officers,  directors  and those who,  directly or
indirectly, have the right to vote 5% or more of the corporation's stock (or 10%
or more of such stock in the case of insurance  companies,  investment companies
and  bank  trust   departments   that  are  passive   investors)  are  generally
attributable, except that, in general, no minority voting stock interest will be
attributable  if there is a single  holder of more  than 50% of the  outstanding
voting power of the  corporation.  The FCC has pending a  rulemaking  proceeding
that,  among other  things,  seeks  comment on whether the FCC should modify its
attribution rules by (i) raising the attribution stock benchmark from 5% to 10%;
(ii) raising the attribution  stock benchmark for passive  investors from 10% to
20%; (iii)  restricting  the  availability  of the single  majority  shareholder
exemption; and (iv) attributing certain interests such as non-voting stock, debt
and certain holdings by limited liability corporations in certain circumstances.
More  recently,  the FCC has solicited  comment on proposed rules that would (i)
treat an otherwise  nonattributable  equity or debt interest in a licensee as an
attributable  interest  where the interest  holder is a program  supplier or the
owner of a  broadcast  station in the same  market and the  equity  and/or  debt
holding is  greater  than a  specified  benchmark;  (ii)  treat a licensee  of a
television  station  which,  under an LMA,  brokers more than 15% of the time on
another  television  station serving the same market,  as having an attributable
interest in the brokered station; and (iii) in certain circumstances,  treat the
licensee of a broadcast  station that sells  advertising time on another station
in the same market pursuant to a JSA as having an  attributable  interest in the
station whose advertising is being sold.

     The Controlling  Stockholders hold  attributable  interests in two entities
owning media properties,  namely:  Channel 63, Inc.,  licensee of WIIB-TV, a UHF
television station in Bloomington,  Indiana, and Bay Television,  Inc., licensee
of WTTA-TV,  a UHF television  station in St.  Petersburg,  Florida.  All of the
issued and  outstanding  shares of Channel 63, Inc. are owned by the Controlling
Stockholders.  All of the issued and outstanding shares of Bay Television,  Inc.
are owned by the Controlling  Stockholders  (75%) and Robert L. Simmons (25%), a
former stockholder of the Company.  The Controlling  Stockholders have agreed to
divest their attributable interests in Channel 63, Inc. and the Company believes
that, after doing so, such holdings will not materially  restrict its ability to
acquire or program additional broadcast stations.

     Under its  "cross-interest"  policy, the FCC considers certain "meaningful"
relationships  among  competing  media  outlets in the same market,  even if the
ownership  rules do not  specifically  prohibit  the  relationship.  Under  this
policy,  the  FCC  may  consider  significant  nonattributable  equity  or  debt
interests in a media outlet  combined with an  attributable  interest in another
media outlet in the same market, joint ventures,  and common key employees among
competitors.  The  cross-interest  policy does not  necessarily  prohibit all of
these  interests,  but requires that the FCC consider  whether,  in a particular
market,  the  "meaningful"   relationships  between  competitors  could  have  a
significant  adverse  effect upon economic  competition  and program  diversity.
Heretofore,  the FCC has not applied its cross-interest  policy to LMAs and JSAs
between broadcast stations.  In its ongoing rulemaking proceeding concerning the
attribution  rules,  the FCC has sought  comment  on,  among other  things,  (i)
whether the cross-interest policy should be applied only in smaller markets, and
(ii) whether non-equity financial relationships such as debt, when combined with
multiple business interrelationships such as LMAs and JSAs, raise concerns under
the cross-interest policy. Moreover, in its most recent proposals in its ongoing
attribution  rulemaking  proceeding,  the FCC has proposed  treating  television
LMAs,  television and radio JSAs, and presently  nonattributable  debt or equity
interests as attributable  interests in certain  circumstances without regard to
the cross-interest policy.

     The  Communications Act prohibits the issuance of broadcast licenses to, or
the holding of a broadcast license by, any corporation of which more than 20% of
the  capital  stock is owned of record or voted by  non-U.S.  citizens  or their
representatives  or by a foreign government or a representative  thereof,  or by
any corporation  organized  under the laws of a foreign  country  (collectively,
"Aliens"). The Communications Act also authorizes the FCC, if the FCC determines
that it would be in the public interest, to prohibit the issuance of a broadcast
license to, or the holding of a broadcast  license by, any corporation  directly
or indirectly  controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the
capital  stock is owned of  record  or voted by  Aliens.  The  Company  has been
advised that the FCC staff has  interpreted  this provision to require a finding
that such grant or holding  would be in the public  interest  before a broadcast
license may be granted to or held by any such corporation and that the FCC staff
has made such a finding only in limited

                                       17

<PAGE>



circumstances.  The FCC has issued  interpretations  of existing law under which
these   restrictions   in  modified  form  apply  to  other  forms  of  business
organizations,  including  partnerships.  As a result of these  provisions,  the
licenses  granted to Subsidiaries of the Company by the FCC could be revoked if,
among  other  restrictions  imposed by the FCC,  more than 25% of the  Company's
stock were directly or indirectly owned or voted by Aliens.  The Company and the
Subsidiaries are domestic corporations, and the Controlling Stockholders are all
United States  citizens.  The Amended and Restated  Articles of Incorporation of
the Company (the "Amended  Certificate")  contain limitations on Alien ownership
and  control  that  are   substantially   similar  to  those  contained  in  the
Communications  Act.  Pursuant to the Amended  Certificate,  the Company has the
right to repurchase  Alien-owned shares at their fair market value to the extent
necessary,  in the judgment of the Board of Directors,  to comply with the Alien
ownership restrictions.

Television
- ----------

     National  Ownership  Rule.  Prior  to the 1996  Act,  FCC  rules  generally
prohibited an individual or entity from having an attributable  interest in more
than 12 television stations nationwide,  or in television stations reaching more
than 25% of the national television viewing audience.  Pursuant to the 1996 Act,
the FCC has  modified  its rules to eliminate  any  limitation  on the number of
television  stations an individual or entity may own nationwide,  subject to the
restriction  that no individual or entity may have an  attributable  interest in
television  stations reaching more than 35% of the national  television  viewing
audience.  Historically, VHF stations have shared a larger portion of the market
than UHF stations.  Therefore, only half of the households in the market area of
any UHF station are included  when  calculating  whether an entity or individual
owns  television  stations  reaching  more than 35% of the  national  television
viewing audience. All but six of the stations owned and operated by the Company,
or to which the Company provides programming services,  are UHF. Upon completion
of  all  pending   acquisitions  and   dispositions,   the  Company  will  reach
approximately  14% of U.S.  television  households  using  the  FCC's  method of
calculation.

     Duopoly Rule. On a local level,  the  television  "duopoly"  rule generally
prohibits a single individual or entity from having an attributable  interest in
two or more television  stations with overlapping  Grade B service areas.  While
the 1996 Act did not  eliminate the  television  duopoly rule, it did direct the
FCC to initiate a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether to retain,  modify,
or eliminate the rule.  The FCC has pending a rulemaking  proceeding in which it
has proposed,  among other  options,  to modify the  television  duopoly rule to
permit the common ownership of television stations in different DMAs, so long as
the Grade A signal contours of the stations do not overlap.  Pending  resolution
of its rulemaking proceeding,  the FCC has adopted an interim waiver policy that
permits the common  ownership of television  stations in different  DMAs with no
overlapping  Grade A signal  contours,  conditioned  on the final outcome of the
rulemaking  proceeding.  The FCC has  also  sought  comment  on  whether  common
ownership of two  television  stations in a market should be permitted (i) where
one or  more of the  commonly  owned  stations  is UHF,  (ii)  where  one of the
stations is in bankruptcy  or has been off the air for a  substantial  period of
time and (iii) where the commonly  owned  stations  have very small  audience or
advertising  shares,  are  located in a very large  market,  and/or a  specified
number of independently owned media voices would remain after the acquisition.

     Local  Marketing  Agreements.  A number of television  stations,  including
certain of the  Company's  stations,  have entered into what have  commonly been
referred to as local marketing  agreements,  or LMAs. While these agreements may
take varying  forms,  pursuant to a typical LMA,  separately  owned and licensed
television  stations  agree to enter into  cooperative  arrangements  of varying
sorts,  subject to compliance  with the  requirements of antitrust laws and with
the FCC's rules and  policies.  Under these  types of  arrangements,  separately
owned stations could agree to function  cooperatively  in terms of  programming,
advertising  sales,  etc.,  subject to the requirement that the licensee of each
station maintain  independent control over the programming and operations of its
own station.  One typical  type of LMA is a  programming  agreement  between two
separately owned television  stations serving a common service area, whereby the
licensee of one station  programs  substantial  portions of the broadcast day on
the other licensee's  station,  subject to ultimate editorial and other controls
being exercised by the latter licensee,  and sells  advertising time during such
program  segments.  Such  arrangements  are an extension of the concept of "time
brokerage" agreements,  under which a licensee of a station sells blocks of time
on its  station to an entity or  entities  which  program the blocks of time and
which sell their own com-

                                       18

<PAGE>



mercial advertising announcements during the time periods in question. The staff
of the FCC's  Mass  Media  Bureau  has held that  LMAs are not  contrary  to the
Communications  Act,  provided  that the licensee of the station  which is being
substantially programmed by another entity maintains complete responsibility for
and control over the  programming  and  operations of its broadcast  station and
assures compliance with applicable FCC rules and policies.

     At present, FCC rules permit television station LMAs, and the licensee of a
television   station  brokering  time  on  another  television  station  is  not
considered to have an attributable interest in the brokered station. However, in
connection  with its ongoing  rulemaking  proceeding  regarding  the  television
duopoly rule, the FCC has proposed to adopt rules providing that the licensee of
a  television  station  which  brokers  more  than  15% of the  time on  another
television  station  serving  the  same  market  would  be  deemed  to  have  an
attributable  interest in the brokered  station for purposes of the national and
local multiple ownership rules. In connection with this proceeding,  the FCC has
solicited  detailed  information from parties to television LMAs as to the terms
and characteristics of such LMAs.

     The 1996 Act provides that nothing  therein "shall be construed to prohibit
the  origination,  continuation,  or renewal of any television  local  marketing
agreement  that  is in  compliance  with  the  regulations  of the  [FCC]."  The
legislative history of the 1996 Act reflects that this provision was intended to
grandfather  television  LMAs that were in existence  upon enactment of the 1996
Act, and to allow  television LMAs consistent with the FCC's rules subsequent to
enactment of the 1996 Act. In its pending  rulemaking  proceeding  regarding the
television  duopoly rule, the FCC has proposed to adopt a grandfathering  policy
providing that, in the event that television LMAs become attributable interests,
LMAs that are in  compliance  with  existing  FCC rules  and  policies  and were
entered  into before  November 5, 1996,  would be permitted to continue in force
until the original term of the LMA expires. Under the FCC's proposal, television
LMAs that are entered into,  renewed,  or assigned  after November 5, 1996 would
have to be  terminated  if LMAs are made  attributable  interests and the LMA in
question resulted in a violation of the television multiple ownership rules. The
Company's LMAs with television stations WPTT in Pittsburgh,  Pennsylvania,  WNUV
in Baltimore,  Maryland, WVTV in Milwaukee,  Wisconsin,  WRDC in Raleigh/Durham,
North Carolina,  WABM in Birmingham,  Alabama, and WDBB in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama,
were in  existence on both the date of enactment of the 1996 Act and November 5,
1996. The Company's LMAs with television stations WTTV and WTTK in Indianapolis,
Indiana were entered  into  subsequent  to the date of enactment of the 1996 Act
but prior to November 5, 1996. The Company's LMA with television station KRRT in
San  Antonio,  Texas was in  existence on the date of enactment of the 1996 Act,
but was assumed by the Company  subsequent to that date but prior to November 5,
1996. The licensee's rights under the Company's LMA with KRRT-TV were assumed by
Glencairn  subsequent to November 5, 1996.  The Company's  LMAs with  television
stations  WFGX-TV in Mobile,  Alabama  and  Pensacola,  Florida  and  WFFF-TV in
Burlington, Vermont and Plattsburgh, New York were in existence on both the date
of  enactment  of the 1996 Act and  November  5, 1996,  but were  assumed by the
Company  subsequent  to  November 5, 1996.  The  Company's  LMA with  WFBC-TV in
Asheville, North Carolina and  Greenville/Spartanburg/Anderson,  South Carolina,
was entered into by the Company  subsequent to the date of enactment of the 1996
Act but prior to November 5, 1996, and the licensee's rights under that LMA were
assumed by Glencairn subsequent to November 5, 1996. The Company's LMA with KFBT
in Las Vegas, Nevada (which will be effective upon expiration of the HSR waiting
period) was entered  into  subsequent  to November 5, 1996.  The Company  cannot
predict if any or all of its LMAs will be grandfathered.

     The Conference Agreement adopted as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997
(the "Balanced Budget Act") clarifies  Congress' intent with respect to LMAs and
duopolies.  The Conference  Agreement  states as follows:  "The conferees do not
intend that the duopoly and television-newspaper cross-ownership relief provided
herein  should have any  bearing  upon the [FCC's]  current  proceedings,  which
concerns more immediate relief. The conferees expect that the [FCC] will proceed
with  its own  independent  examination  in  these  matters.  Specifically,  the
conferees expect that the [FCC] will provide  additional  relief (e.g.,  VHF/UHF
combinations) that it finds to be in the public interest, and will implement the
permanent grandfather  requirement for local marketing agreements as provided in
the Telecommunications Act of 1996."

                                       19

<PAGE>



     The TV duopoly  rule  currently  prevents the Company  from  acquiring  the
licenses of  television  stations  with which it has LMAs in those markets where
the Company owns a television  station.  As a result,  if the FCC were to decide
that the  provider of  programming  services  under a  television  LMA should be
treated as having an attributable  interest in the brokered  station,  and if it
did not relax its  television  duopoly  rule,  the Company  could be required to
modify or terminate  those of its LMAs that were not in existence on the date of
enactment of the 1996 Act or on November 5, 1996. Furthermore, if the FCC adopts
its present proposal with respect to the  grandfathering of television LMAs, the
Company could be required to terminate even those LMAs that were in effect prior
to the date of enactment of the 1996 Act or prior to November 5, 1996, after the
initial  term of the LMA or upon  assignment  of the LMA. In such an event,  the
Company  could be required to pay  termination  penalties  under certain of such
LMAs.  Further, if the FCC were to find, in connection with any of the Company's
LMAs, that the  owners/licensees of the stations with which the Company has LMAs
failed to maintain  control over their  operations  as required by FCC rules and
policies,  the licensee of the LMA station  and/or the Company could be fined or
set for hearing,  the outcome of which could be a monetary  forfeiture or, under
certain circumstances, loss of the applicable FCC license. The Company is unable
to predict the ultimate  outcome of possible  changes to these FCC rules and the
impact such changes may have on its broadcasting operations.

     On June 1, 1995, the Chief of the FCC's Mass Media Bureau released a Public
Notice  concerning  the  processing  of  television  assignment  and transfer of
control  applications  proposing  LMAs.  Due to  the  pendency  of  the  ongoing
rulemaking proceeding concerning attribution of ownership, the Mass Media Bureau
has  placed  certain  restrictions  on the types of  television  assignment  and
transfer of control applications  involving LMAs that it will approve during the
pendency of the rulemaking.  Specifically, the Mass Media Bureau has stated that
it will not approve  arrangements where a time broker seeks to finance a station
acquisition  and hold an option to  purchase  the  station  in the  future.  The
Company  believes that none of the Company's  LMAs fall within the ambit of this
Public Notice.

Radio
- -----

     National  Ownership Rule. Prior to the 1996 Act, the FCC's rules limited an
individual or entity from holding attributable  interests in more than 20 AM and
20 FM radio stations nationwide.  Pursuant to the 1996 Act, the FCC has modified
its rules to eliminate any  limitation on the number of radio  stations a single
individual or entity may own nationwide.

     Local  Ownership  Rule.  Prior to the 1996 Act,  the FCC's rules  generally
permitted an individual or entity to hold attributable interests in no more than
four radio stations in a local market (no more than two of which could be in the
same service (AM or FM)),  and then only if the aggregate  audience share of the
commonly  owned  stations  did not exceed  25%.  In  markets  with fewer than 15
commercial  radio  stations,  an individual or entity could hold an attributable
interest in no more than three radio stations in the market (no more than two of
which could be in the same service), and then only if the number of the commonly
owned  stations  did not  exceed  50% of the total  number of  commercial  radio
stations in the market.

     Pursuant to the 1996 Act,  the limits on the number of radio  stations  one
entity may own locally have been  increased as follows:  (i) in a market with 45
or more  commercial  radio  stations,  an entity may own up to eight  commercial
radio stations,  not more than five of which are in the same service (AM or FM);
(ii) in a market with between 30 and 44 (inclusive)  commercial  radio stations,
an entity may own up to seven commercial  radio stations,  not more than four of
which  are in the  same  service;  (iii)  in a  market  with  between  15 and 29
(inclusive)  commercial  radio stations,  an entity may own up to six commercial
radio stations, not more than four of which are in the same service; and (iv) in
a market with 14 or fewer  commercial  radio  stations,  an entity may own up to
five  commercial  radio  stations,  not more than three of which are in the same
service, except that an entity may not own more than 50% of the stations in such
market.  These numerical limits apply regardless of the aggregate audience share
of the stations  sought to be commonly  owned.  FCC ownership  rules continue to
permit an entity to own one FM and one AM station in a local  market  regardless
of market size.  Irrespective of FCC rules governing radio  ownership,  however,
the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission have the authority to determine, and in
certain  radio  transactions  have  determined,  that a  particular  transaction
presents antitrust con-

                                       20

<PAGE>



cerns.  Moreover,  in certain recent cases the FCC has signaled a willingness to
independently   examine  issues  of  market   concentration   notwithstanding  a
transaction's  compliance with the numerical  station  limits.  The FCC has also
indicated that it may propose further revisions to its radio multiple  ownership
rules.

     Local Marketing  Agreements.  As in television,  a number of radio stations
have entered into LMAs. The FCC's multiple ownership rules  specifically  permit
radio station LMAs to be entered into and  implemented,  so long as the licensee
of the  station  which is being  programmed  under  the LMA  maintains  complete
responsibility  for and control over programming and operations of its broadcast
station and assures  compliance with applicable FCC rules and policies.  For the
purposes of the multiple  ownership  rules,  in general,  a radio  station being
programmed  pursuant to an LMA by an entity is not  considered  an  attributable
ownership  interest of that  entity  unless  that  entity  already  owns a radio
station in the same market.  However,  a licensee that owns a radio station in a
market,  and brokers  more than 15% of the time on another  station  serving the
same market (i.e., a station whose principal  community contour overlaps that of
the owned station), is considered to have an attributable  ownership interest in
the brokered  station for purposes of the FCC's multiple  ownership  rules. As a
result, in a market in which the Company owns a radio station, the Company would
not be permitted to enter into an LMA with another  local radio station which it
could not own under the local ownership rules, unless the Company's  programming
constituted  15% or less of the  other  local  station's  programming  time on a
weekly  basis.  The  FCC's  rules  also  prohibit  a  broadcast   licensee  from
simulcasting  more than 25% of its  programming  on another  station in the same
broadcast  service  (i.e.,  AM-AM or  FM-FM)  through  a time  brokerage  or LMA
arrangement  where the brokered and brokering  stations serve  substantially the
same area.

     Joint Sales  Agreements.  A number of radio (and television)  stations have
entered into cooperative  arrangements commonly known as joint sales agreements,
or JSAs. While these agreements may take varying forms, under the typical JSA, a
station licensee obtains,  for a fee, the right to sell substantially all of the
commercial  advertising on a  separately-owned  and licensed station in the same
market.  The typical JSA also customarily  involves the provision by the selling
licensee of certain sales, accounting, and "back office" services to the station
whose advertising is being sold. The typical JSA is distinct from an LMA in that
a JSA (unlike an LMA) normally does not involve programming.

     The FCC has  determined  that issues of joint  advertising  sales should be
left to enforcement by antitrust  authorities,  and therefore does not generally
regulate joint sales practices between stations. Currently, stations for which a
licensee  sells time  under a JSA are not  deemed by the FCC to be  attributable
interests of that licensee.  However,  in connection with its ongoing rulemaking
proceeding concerning the attribution rules, the FCC is considering whether JSAs
should be  considered  attributable  interests  or within the scope of the FCC's
cross-interest policy,  particularly when JSAs contain provisions for the supply
of programming services and/or other elements typically associated with LMAs. If
JSAs become attributable  interests as a result of changes in the FCC rules, the
Company may be required to terminate  any JSA it might have with a radio station
which the Company could not own under the FCC's multiple ownership rules.

Other Ownership Matters
- -----------------------

     There  remain  in  place  after  the  1996  Act  a  number  of   additional
cross-ownership rules and prohibitions pertaining to licensees of television and
radio stations. FCC rules, the Communications Act, or both generally prohibit an
individual or entity from having an  attributable  interest in both a television
station and a radio station,  a daily newspaper,  or a cable  television  system
that is located in or serves the same market area.

     Antitrust  Regulation.  The DOJ  and  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  have
increased their scrutiny of the television and radio industry since the adoption
of the 1996 Act, and have indicated their intention to review matters related to
the  concentration  of ownership  within markets  (including LMAs and JSAs) even
when  the  ownership  or LMA or JSA in  question  is  permitted  under  the laws
administered by the FCC or by FCC rules and regulations.  For instance,  the DOJ
has for some time taken the position that an LMA entered into in anticipation of
a station's  acquisition  with the proposed  buyer of the station  constitutes a
change in beneficial  ownership of the station which, if subject to filing under
the HSR Act,  cannot be implemented  until the waiting  period  required by that
statute has ended or been terminated.

                                       21

<PAGE>



     Radio/Television   Cross-Ownership   Rule.   The   FCC's   radio/television
cross-ownership  rule (the "one to a market" rule) generally  prohibits a single
individual  or entity  from  having an  attributable  interest  in a  television
station and a radio station serving the same market.  However, in each of the 25
largest local markets in the United States,  provided that there remain at least
30 separately owned television and radio stations in the particular market after
the acquisition in question,  the FCC has  traditionally  employed a policy that
presumptively  allows  waivers of the one to a market  rule to permit the common
ownership  of one AM,  one FM and one TV  station  in the  market.  The 1996 Act
directs the FCC to extend  this policy to each of the top 50 markets.  Moreover,
the FCC has pending a rulemaking proceeding in which it has solicited comment on
whether the one to a market rule should be  eliminated  altogether.  The Company
has  pending  several  requests  for  waivers  of the  one to a  market  rule in
connection  with its  applications  to acquire  radio  stations in the Max Media
Acquisition and from Keymarket of South Carolina, Inc. and Spartan Radiocasting,
Inc., in markets where the Company owns or proposes to own a television station.

     However,  the FCC does not apply  its  presumptive  waiver  policy in cases
involving the common ownership of one television station,  and two or more radio
stations in the same service (AM or FM), in the same market. Pending its ongoing
rulemaking  proceeding to reexamine the one to a market rule, the FCC has stated
that it will consider  waivers of the rule in such  instances on a  case-by-case
basis,  considering  (i) the public  service  benefits  that will arise from the
joint operation of the facilities  such as economies of scale,  cost savings and
programming and service benefits;  (ii) the types of facilities involved;  (iii)
the number of media outlets owned by the applicant in the relevant market;  (iv)
the financial  difficulties of the stations involved;  and (v) the nature of the
relevant  market in light of the level of competition  and diversity after joint
operation is  implemented.  Generally,  any such  waivers that are granted,  and
which  allow  common  ownership  of a  television  station  and  more  than  two
same-service radio stations in the same market, are temporary and conditioned on
the outcome of the rulemaking  proceeding.  The Company obtained such temporary,
conditional  waivers  of  the  one to a  market  rule  in  connection  with  its
acquisition  of the  Heritage  radio  stations in the Kansas City and St.  Louis
markets.

     In its ongoing rulemaking proceeding to reexamine the one to a market rule,
the FCC has proposed the  following  options for modifying the rule in the event
it is not  eliminated:  (i)  extending  the  presumptive  waiver  policy  to any
television  market in which a  specified  number of  independently  owned  media
"voices" would remain after common ownership of a television  station and one or
more radio stations is effectuated; (ii) extending the presumptive waiver policy
to entities that seek to own more than one FM and/or one AM radio station; (iii)
reducing the minimum number of independently owned voices that must remain after
a transaction is effectuated;  and (iv) modifying the  five-factor  case-by-case
test for waivers.

     Local Television/Cable  Cross-Ownership Rule. While the 1996 Act eliminates
a previous  statutory  prohibition  against the common ownership of a television
broadcast station and a cable system that serve the same local market,  the 1996
Act leaves the current  FCC rule in place.  The  legislative  history of the Act
indicates  that the repeal of the  statutory ban should not prejudge the outcome
of any FCC review of the rule.

     Broadcast Network/Cable  Cross-Ownership Rule. The 1996 Act directs the FCC
to  eliminate  its rules which  formerly  prohibited  the common  ownership of a
broadcast  network and a cable  system,  subject to the  provision  that the FCC
revise its rules as  necessary  to ensure  carriage,  channel  positioning,  and
non-discriminatory  treatment  of  non-affiliated  broadcast  stations  by cable
systems  affiliated with a broadcast  network.  In March 1996, the FCC issued an
order implementing this legislative change.

     Broadcast/Daily  Newspaper  Cross-Ownership  Rule. The FCC's rules prohibit
the common  ownership  of a radio or  television  broadcast  station and a daily
newspaper  in the same  market.  The 1996 Act does not  eliminate or modify this
prohibition. In October 1996, however, the FCC initiated a rulemaking proceeding
to  determine  whether it should  liberalize  its waiver  policy with respect to
cross-ownership  of a daily newspaper and one or more radio stations in the same
market.

     Dual  Network  Rule.  The 1996 Act directs the FCC to repeal its rule which
formerly  prohibited an entity from operating more than one television  network.
In March 1996, the FCC issued an order  implementing  this  legislative  change.
Under the modified rule, a network entity is permitted to operate

                                       22

<PAGE>



more than one television network, provided,  however, that ABC, CBS, NBC, and/or
Fox are  prohibited  from  merging  with  each  other  or with  another  network
television entity such as WB or UPN.

     The 1996 Act requires the FCC to review its broadcast ownership rules every
two years to  "determine  whether any of such rules are  necessary in the public
interest as the result of  competition,"  and to repeal or modify any rules that
are  determined to be no longer in the public  interest.  In March 1998, the FCC
initiated a rulemaking  proceeding to review certain of its broadcast  ownership
rules  pursuant  to the  statutory  mandate,  including:  (i) the rule  limiting
ownership of  television  stations  nationally  to stations  reaching 35% of the
national television  audience;  (ii) the rule attributing only 50% of television
households  in a market to the audience  reach of a UHF  television  station for
purposes of the 35% national  audience reach limit;  (iii) the rule  prohibiting
common  ownership  of a  broadcast  station  and a daily  newspaper  in the same
market;  (iv) the rule prohibiting  common  ownership of a broadcast  television
station and a cable  system in the same  market;  (v) the local  radio  multiple
ownership  rules; and (vi) the dual network rule.  Additionally,  the FCC stated
that its  already-pending  proceedings to review the television duopoly and "one
to a market" rules satisfy the 1996 Act's biennial review requirements.

     Expansion  of the  Company's  broadcast  operations  on  both a  local  and
national level will continue to be subject to the FCC's  ownership rules and any
changes the FCC or Congress may adopt. Concomitantly,  any further relaxation of
the FCC's  ownership  rules may increase the level of competition in one or more
of the markets in which the Company's stations are located, more specifically to
the extent that any of the Company's  competitors may have greater resources and
thereby be in a superior position to take advantage of such changes.

Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent

     Pursuant to the Cable Act of 1992, television  broadcasters are required to
make   triennial   elections  to  exercise   either  certain   "must-carry"   or
"retransmission  consent"  rights in  connection  with their  carriage  by cable
systems in each broadcaster's local market. By electing the must-carry rights, a
broadcaster  demands carriage on a specified channel on cable systems within its
Area of  Dominant  Influence,  in general as  defined  by the  Arbitron  1991-92
Television  Market Guide.  These must-carry  rights are not absolute,  and their
exercise is dependent on variables such as (i) the number of activated  channels
on a cable system;  (ii) the location and size of a cable system;  and (iii) the
amount of programming on a broadcast  station that duplicates the programming of
another broadcast station carried by the cable system. Therefore,  under certain
circumstances,   a  cable   system  may  decline  to  carry  a  given   station.
Alternatively,  if a  broadcaster  chooses to  exercise  retransmission  consent
rights,  it can prohibit  cable  systems  from  carrying its signal or grant the
appropriate  cable system the authority to retransmit the broadcast signal for a
fee or other  consideration.  In October 1996, the Company elected must-carry or
retransmission  consent  with  respect  to  each  of its  markets  based  on its
evaluation of the respective  markets and the position of the Company's owned or
programmed  station(s) within the market.  The Company's stations continue to be
carried on all pertinent  cable  systems,  and the Company does not believe that
its elections  have  resulted in the shifting of its stations to less  desirable
cable channel locations.  Certain of the Company's stations  affiliated with Fox
are  required  to elect  retransmission  consent  because  Fox's  retransmission
consent  negotiations  on behalf of the  Company  resulted in  agreements  which
extend into 1998. Therefore,  the Company will need to negotiate  retransmission
consent agreements for these  Fox-affiliated  stations to attain carriage on the
relevant cable systems for the balance of this triennial  period (i.e.,  through
December 31, 1999). For subsequent  elections  beginning with the election to be
made by October 1, 1999,  the  must-carry  market will be the station's  DMA, in
general as defined by the Nielsen DMA Market and Demographic  Rank Report of the
prior year.

Syndicated Exclusivity/Territorial Exclusivity

     The FCC has imposed  syndicated  exclusivity  rules and  expanded  existing
network  nonduplication  rules.  The  syndicated  exclusivity  rules allow local
broadcast   television  stations  to  demand  that  cable  operators  black  out
syndicated  non-network  programming carried on "distant signals" (i.e., signals
of broadcast stations,  including so-called  "superstations,"  which serve areas
substantially  removed from the cable  system's  local  community).  The network
non-duplication  rules allow local broadcast  network  television  affiliates to
require that cable operators black out duplicative  network  programming carried
on

                                       23

<PAGE>



distant  signals.  However,  in a number of markets in which the Company owns or
programs stations  affiliated with a network,  a station that is affiliated with
the same network in a nearby market is carried on cable systems in the Company's
market.  This is not in violation  of the FCC's  network  nonduplication  rules.
However,  the  carriage of two network  stations on the same cable  system could
result in a decline  of  viewership  adversely  affecting  the  revenues  of the
Company owned or programmed station.

Restrictions on Broadcast Advertising

     Advertising of cigarettes  and certain other tobacco  products on broadcast
stations has been banned for many years. Various states restrict the advertising
of alcoholic  beverages.  Congressional  committees  have  examined  legislation
proposals which would eliminate or severely restrict the advertising of beer and
wine.  Although  no  prediction  can be  made as to  whether  any or all of such
proposals  will be  enacted  into  law,  the  elimination  of all  beer and wine
advertising  would have an adverse  effect upon the  revenues  of the  Company's
stations,  as well as the revenues of other  stations  which carry beer and wine
advertising.

     The FCC has imposed  commercial time  limitations in children's  television
programming pursuant to legislation. In television programs designed for viewing
by  children  of 12 years of age and under,  commercial  matter is limited to 12
minutes per hour on weekdays and 10.5 minutes per hour on weekends.  In granting
renewal of the  license  for  WBFF-TV,  the FCC imposed a fine of $10,000 on the
Company  alleging that the station had exceeded these  limitations.  The Company
has  appealed  this fine and the appeal is pending.  In granting  renewal of the
license for WTTV-TV and WTTK-TV,  stations that the Company programs pursuant to
an LMA,  the FCC  imposed a fine of $15,000 on WTTV-TV  and  WTTK-TV's  licensee
alleging that the stations had exceeded these  limitations.  In granting renewal
of the  license  for  WTTE-TV,  the FCC imposed a fine of $10,000 on the Company
alleging  that the  station  had  exceeded  these  limitations.  The Company has
appealed this fine and the appeal is pending.

     The Communications Act and FCC rules also impose regulations  regarding the
broadcasting  of  advertisements  by legally  qualified  candidates for elective
office.  Among other things, (i) stations must provide  "reasonable  access" for
the purchase of time by legally  qualified  candidates for federal office;  (ii)
stations  must provide  "equal  opportunities"  for the  purchase of  equivalent
amounts  of  comparable  broadcast  time by  opposing  candidates  for the  same
elective  office;  and (iii)  during the 45 days  preceding a primary or primary
run-off election and during the 60 days preceding a general or special election,
legally qualified candidates for elective office may be charged no more than the
station's  "lowest unit charge" for the same class of  advertisement,  length of
advertisement,  and daypart.  Recently,  both the President of the United States
and the Chairman of the FCC have called for rules that would  require  broadcast
stations to provide  free airtime to political  candidates.  The Company  cannot
predict the effect of such a requirement on its advertising revenues.

Programming and Operation

     General. The Communications Act requires  broadcasters to serve the "public
interest."  The FCC has  relaxed  or  eliminated  many  of the  more  formalized
procedures  it had  developed  in the past to promote the  broadcast  of certain
types of  programming  responsive  to the  needs  of a  station's  community  of
license. FCC licensees continue to be required,  however, to present programming
that is responsive to their communities' issues, and to maintain certain records
demonstrating  such   responsiveness.   Complaints  from  viewers  concerning  a
station's  programming  may be considered  by the FCC when it evaluates  renewal
applications  of a licensee,  although such  complaints may be filed at any time
and generally  may be considered by the FCC at any time.  Stations also must pay
regulatory and application  fees, and follow various rules promulgated under the
Communications  Act that regulate,  among other things,  political  advertising,
sponsorship  identifications,  the  advertisement  of  contests  and  lotteries,
obscene and indecent broadcasts,  and technical operations,  including limits on
radio  frequency  radiation.  In addition,  licensees must develop and implement
affirmative action programs designed to promote equal employment  opportunities,
and must submit  reports to the FCC with  respect to these  matters on an annual
basis and in connection with a renewal application.  Failure to observe these or
other rules and  policies  can result in the  imposition  of various  sanctions,
including monetary forfeitures, the grant of a renewal for a "short" (i.e., less
than the full) license term,  or, for  particularly  egregious  violations,  the
denial of a license renewal application or the revocation of a license.

     Children's  Television  Programming.  Pursuant  to rules  adopted  in 1996,
television  stations are required to broadcast a minimum of three hours per week
of  "core"  children's  educational  programming,   which  the  FCC  defines  as
programming  that (i) has serving the  educational  and  informational  needs of
children 16 years of age and under as a significant  purpose;  (ii) is regularly
scheduled,  weekly  and at least 30  minutes  in  duration;  and  (iii) is aired
between the hours of 7:00 a.m.  and 10:00 p.m.  Furthermore,  "core"  children's
educational programs, in order to qualify as such, are required to be identified
as  educational  and  informational  programs  over the air at the time they are
broadcast,  and are  required to be  identified  in the  children's  programming
reports   required  to  be  placed  in  stations'   public   inspection   files.
Additionally,   television   stations  are  required  to  identify  and  provide
information  concerning "core"  children's  programming to publishers of program
guides and listings.

     Television Violence.  The 1996 Act contains a number of provisions relating
to television violence. First, pursuant to the 1996 Act, the television industry
has  developed a ratings  system which the FCC has approved.  Furthermore,  also
pursuant to the 1996 Act the FCC has adopted rules requiring certain  television
sets to include the so-called  "V-chip," a computer chip that allows blocking of
rated  programming.  Under these rules, half of television  receiver models with
picture  screens 13 inches or greater  will be required to have the  "V-chip" by
July 1, 1999,  and all such  models  will be  required  to have the  "V-chip" by
January 1, 2000. In addition,  the 1996 Act requires that all television license
renewal  applications  filed  after May 1, 1995  contain  summaries  of  written
comments  and  suggestions  received  by the station  from the public  regarding
violent programming.

     Closed  Captioning.  The 1996 Act directs the FCC to adopt rules  requiring
closed  captioning  of  all  broadcast  television  programming,   except  where
captioning would be "economically burdensome." The FCC has recently adopted such
rules.  The rules require  generally that (i) 95% of all new  programming  first
published  or  exhibited  on or after  January 1, 1998 must be closed  captioned
within eight years, and (ii) 75% of "old" programming which first aired prior to
January  1, 1998 must be closed  captioned  within 10 years,  subject to certain
exemptions.

Digital Television

     The FCC has taken a number of steps to implement digital television ("DTV")
broadcasting  service in the United States.  In December 1996, the FCC adopted a
DTV broadcast  standard and, in April 1997, adopted decisions in several pending
rulemaking  proceedings that establish service rules and a plan for implementing
DTV. The FCC adopted a DTV table of  allotments  that  provides  all  authorized
television stations with a second channel on which to broadcast a DTV signal. In
February  1998,  the FCC made  slight  revisions  to the DTV  rules and table of
allotments in acting upon a number of appeals in the DTV proceeding. The FCC has
attempted  to provide  DTV  coverage  areas  that are  comparable  to  stations'
existing  service areas. The FCC has ruled that television  broadcast  licensees
may  use  their  digital  channels  for a  wide  variety  of  services  such  as
high-definition television, multiple standard definition television programming,
audio, data, and other types of communications,  subject to the requirement that
each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the
current technical standard.

     DTV  channels  will  generally  be  located in the range of  channels  from
channel 2 through  channel 51. The FCC is requiring that affiliates of ABC, CBS,
Fox and NBC in the top 10 television  markets begin digital  broadcasting by May
1, 1999 (many stations affiliated with these networks in the top 10 markets have
voluntarily  committed to begin digital broadcasting by November 1998), and that
affiliates of these networks in markets 11 through 30 begin digital broadcasting
by November 1999.  The FCC's plan calls for the DTV transition  period to end in
the year 2006, at which time the FCC expects that television  broadcasters  will
cease  non-digital  broadcasting  and  return one of their two  channels  to the
government,  allowing that  spectrum to be recovered  for other uses.  Under the
Balanced Budget Act,  however,  the FCC is authorized to extend the December 31,
2006 deadline for reclamation of a television station's  non-digital channel if,
in any given case: (i) one or more television stations affiliated with ABC, CBS,
NBC or Fox in a market is not  broadcasting  digitally,  and the FCC  determines
that such stations have  "exercised  due  diligence" in attempting to convert to
digital broadcasting;  or (ii) less than 85% of the television households in the
station's  market  subscribe to a multichannel  video service  (cable,  wireless
cable or DBS) that  carries at least one digital  channel from each of the local
stations in that market,  and less than 85% of the television  households in the
market can receive digital signals off the air using

                                       25

either  a  set-top  converter  box  for an  analog  television  set or a new DTV
television  set.  The  Balanced  Budget Act also  directs the FCC to auction the
non-digital  channels  by  September  30,  2002 even  though  they are not to be
reclaimed by the  government  until at least  December  31,  2006.  The Balanced
Budget Act also  permits  broadcasters  to bid on the  non-digital  channels  in
cities with populations greater than 400,000, provided the channels are used for
DTV. Thus, it is possible a broadcaster could own two channels in a market.  The
FCC has  concluded  a separate  proceeding  in which it  reallocated  television
channels 60 through 69 to other services while  protecting  existing  television
stations on those channels from interference  during the DTV transition  period.
Additionally, the FCC will open a separate proceeding to consider to what extent
the cable must-carry requirements will apply to DTV signals.

     Implementation of digital  television will improve the technical quality of
television signals received by viewers.  Under certain  circumstances,  however,
conversion to digital operation may reduce a station's  geographic coverage area
or result in some  increased  interference.  The FCC's DTV allotment plan allows
present UHF stations  that move to DTV channels  considerably  less signal power
than present VHF stations that move to UHF DTV channels.  Additionally,  the DTV
transmission  standard  adopted  by the FCC may not allow  certain  stations  to
provide a DTV signal of adequate  strength  to be  reliably  received by certain
viewers  using  inside  television  set  antennas.   Implementation  of  digital
television will also impose substantial  additional costs on television stations
because of the need to replace  equipment and because some stations will need to
operate at higher utility costs and there can be no assurance that the Company's
television  stations will be able to increase  revenue to offset such costs. The
FCC is also considering imposing new public interest  requirements on television
licensees  in  exchange  for their  receipt  of DTV  channels.  The  Company  is
currently  considering  plans to provide HDTV, to provide  multiple  channels of
television,  including  the provision of additional  broadcast  programming  and
transmitted data on a subscription basis, and to continue its current TV program
channels on its allocated DTV channels.  The 1996 Act allows the FCC to charge a
spectrum   fee  to   broadcasters   who  use  the  digital   spectrum  to  offer
subscription-based  services.  The FCC has opened a  rulemaking  to consider the
spectrum fees to be charged to broadcasters for such use. In addition,  Congress
has held hearings on broadcasters'  plans for the use of their digital spectrum.
The Company  cannot  predict what future actions the FCC might take with respect
to DTV,  nor can it predict the effect of the FCC's  present DTV  implementation
plan or such future actions on the Company's business.

Proposed Changes

     The  Congress and the FCC have under  consideration,  and in the future may
consider and adopt, new laws,  regulations and policies regarding a wide variety
of matters that could affect, directly or indirectly,  the operation,  ownership
and  profitability of the Company's  broadcast  stations,  result in the loss of
audience share and advertising  revenues for the Company's  broadcast  stations,
and affect the ability of the Company to acquire  additional  broadcast stations
or finance such  acquisitions.  In addition to the changes and proposed  changes
noted above, such matters may include, for example, the license renewal process,
spectrum use fees, political  advertising rates,  potential  restrictions on the
advertising of certain products (beer, wine and hard liquor,  for example),  and
the rules and  policies to be applied in  enforcing  the FCC's equal  employment
opportunity regulations. Other matters that could affect the Company's broadcast
properties  include   technological   innovations  and  developments   generally
affecting competition in the mass communications  industry, such as direct radio
and television  broadcast  satellite  service,  the continued  establishment  of
wireless cable systems and low power television stations, digital television and
radio  technologies,  and the advent of telephone  company  participation in the
provision of video programming service.

Other Considerations

     The foregoing  summary does not purport to be a complete  discussion of all
provisions  of the  Communications  Act or  other  congressional  acts or of the
regulations and policies of the FCC. For further  information,  reference should
be made to the Communications Act, other congressional acts, and regulations and
public  notices  promulgated  from time to time by the FCC. There are additional
regulations  and  policies  of the FCC and other  federal  agencies  that govern
political broadcasts, public affairs programming,  equal employment opportunity,
and other matters affecting the Company's business and operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

     Prior to the Company's ownership or operation of its facilities, substances
or  waste  that  are  or  might  be  considered   hazardous   under   applicable
environmental  laws may have been  generated,  used,  stored or  disposed  of at
certain of those facilities.  In addition,  environmental conditions relating to
the soil and groundwater at or under the Company's facilities may be affected by
the proximity of nearby properties that have generated, used, stored or disposed
of hazardous  substances.  As a result,  it is possible  that the Company  could
become subject to  environmental  liabilities  in the future in connection  with
these facilities under applicable  environmental laws and regulations.  Although
the  Company   believes  that  it  is  in  substantial   compliance   with  such
environmental  requirements,  and has not in the  past  been  required  to incur
significant  costs in connection  therewith,  there can be no assurance that the
Company's  costs to  comply  with such  requirements  will not  increase  in the
future.  The Company  presently  believes that none of its  properties  have any
condition  that is likely to have a  material  adverse  effect on the  Company's
financial condition or results of operations.

COMPETITION

     The Company's  television and radio stations compete for audience share and
advertising revenue with other television and radio stations in their respective
DMAs or MSA's,  as well as with other  advertising  media,  such as  newspapers,
magazines,  outdoor advertising,  transit advertising,  yellow page directories,
direct mail and local cable and wireless cable  systems.  Some  competitors  are
part of larger organizations with substantially greater financial, technical and
other resources than the Company.

     Television Competition. Competition in the television broadcasting industry
occurs  primarily in  individual  DMAs.  Generally,  a  television  broadcasting
station in one DMA does not compete with  stations in other DMAs.  The Company's
television stations are located in highly competitive DMAs. In addition, certain
of the Company's DMAs are overlapped by both  over-the-air and cable carriage of
stations in adjacent  DMAs,  which tends to spread  viewership  and  advertising
expenditures over a larger number of television stations.

     Broadcast  television  stations compete for advertising  revenues primarily
with other  broadcast  television  stations,  radio  stations  and cable  system
operators  serving  the same  market.  ABC,  CBS and NBC  programming  generally
achieves higher  household  audience levels than Fox, WB and UPN programming and
syndicated programming aired by independent stations.  This can be attributed to
a combination  of factors,  including the efforts of ABC, CBS and NBC to reach a
broader audience,  generally better signal carriage  available when broadcasting
over VHF channels 2 through 13 versus  broadcasting over UHF channels 14 through
69 and the  higher  number  of  hours  of ABC,  CBS  and NBC  programming  being
broadcast weekly. However, greater amounts of advertising time are available for
sale during Fox, UPN and WB programming and non-network syndicated  programming,
and as a result the Company  believes that the Company's  programming  typically
achieves a share of  television  market  advertising  revenues  greater than its
share of a market's audience.

     Television  stations  compete for audience share  primarily on the basis of
program  popularity,  which has a direct effect on  advertising  rates.  A large
amount of the Company's prime time programming is supplied by Fox and WB, and to
a  lesser  extent  UPN,  ABC,  CBS and  NBC.  In those  periods,  the  Company's
affiliated  stations are totally dependent upon the performance of the networks'
programs in attracting  viewers.  Non-network time periods are programmed by the
station primarily with syndicated  programs purchased for cash, cash and barter,
or barter-only,  and also through  self-produced  news, public affairs and other
entertainment programming.

     Television  advertising rates are based upon factors which include the size
of the DMA in which the  station  operates,  a  program's  popularity  among the
viewers  that an  advertiser  wishes  to  attract,  the  number  of  advertisers
competing for the available  time, the  demographic  makeup of the DMA served by
the  station,  the  availability  of  alternative  advertising  media in the DMA
(including radio and cable), the aggressiveness and knowledge of sales forces in
the DMA and  development of projects,  features and programs that tie advertiser
messages to  programming.  The Company  believes that its sales and  programming
strategies allow it to compete effectively for advertising within its DMAs.

     Other  factors  that are  material to a  television  station's  competitive
position include signal coverage, local program acceptance, network affiliation,
audience  characteristics and assigned broadcast  frequency.  Historically,  the
Company's UHF broadcast  stations  have suffered a competitive  disadvantage  in
comparison   to  stations  with  VHF   broadcast   frequencies.   This  historic
disadvantage has gradually declined through (i) carriage on cable systems,  (ii)
improvement   in  television   receivers,   (iii)   improvement   in  television
transmitters, (iv) wider use of all channel antennae, (v) increased availability
of  programming,  and (vi) the  development  of new networks such as Fox, WB and
UPN.

     The broadcasting  industry is continuously faced with technical changes and
innovations, the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media,
changes in labor conditions, and governmental restrictions or actions of federal
regulatory  bodies,  including  the FCC,  any of  which  could  possibly  have a
material  effect on a television  station's  operations  and profits.  There are
sources of video service other than conventional  television stations,  the most
common being cable  television,  which can increase  competition for a broadcast
television station by bringing into its market distant  broadcasting signals not
otherwise available to the station's audience,  serving as a distribution system
for national satellite-delivered programming and other non-broadcast programming
originated on a cable system and selling  advertising time to local advertisers.
Other  principal   sources  of  competition   include  home  video   exhibition,
direct-to-home broadcast satellite television ("DBS") entertainment services and
multichannel  multipoint  distribution services ("MMDS").  Moreover,  technology
advances and regulatory  changes  affecting  programming  delivery through fiber
optic telephone lines and video  compression  could lower entry barriers for new
video channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized "niche"
programming.   The  1996  Act  permits  telephone  companies  to  provide  video
distribution  services via radio  communication,  on a common carrier basis,  as
"cable  systems"  or  as  "open  video  systems,"  each  pursuant  to  different
regulatory   schemes.   The  Company  is  unable  to  predict  the  effect  that
technological  and  regulatory  changes  will have on the  broadcast  television
industry and on the future  profitability  and value of a  particular  broadcast
television station.

     The FCC  authorizes DBS services  throughout the United States.  Currently,
two FCC permitees,  DirecTV and United States  Satellite  Broadcasting,  provide
subscription  DBS services via  high-power  communications  satellites and small
dish receivers,  and other companies provide  direct-to-home video service using
lower powered satellites and larger receivers. Additional companies are expected
to commence direct-to-home  operations in the near future. DBS and MMDS, as well
as other new technologies,  will further increase competition in the delivery of
video programming.

     The  Company  cannot  predict  what  other  video   technologies  might  be
considered  or  implemented  in the  future,  nor can it judge in  advance  what
impact,  if any, the  implementation  of any of these proposals or changes might
have on its business.

     The  Company   believes  that  television   broadcasting  may  be  enhanced
significantly  by the development and increased  availability of DTV technology.
This  technology  has the  potential  to permit the  Company to provide  viewers
multiple  channels  of digital  television  over each of its  existing  standard
channels,  to provide certain programming in a high definition television format
and to deliver  various forms of data,  including data on the Internet,  to home
and business  computers.  These additional  capabilities may provide the Company
with additional sources of revenue.  The Company is currently  considering plans
to provide  HDTV,  to provide  multiple  channels of  television  including  the
provision  of  additional  broadcast  programming  and  transmitted  data  on  a
subscription  basis,  and to  continue  its  current TV program  channels on its
allocated  DTV  channels.  The Company has  obtained  FCC  authority  to conduct
experimental DTV multicasting  operations in Baltimore,  Maryland.  The 1996 Act
allows  the FCC to charge a spectrum  fee to  broadcasters  who use the  digital
spectrum to offer  subscription-based  services. The FCC has opened a rulemaking
to consider the  spectrum  fees to be charged to  broadcasters  for such use. In
addition, Congress has held hearings on broadcasters' plans for the use of their
digital  spectrum.  The Company  cannot  predict what future  actions the FCC or
Congress  might take with  respect to DTV,  nor can it predict the effect of the
FCC's present DTV  implementation  plan or such future  actions on the Company's
business.  DTV technology is not currently available to the viewing public and a
successful  transition  from the current analog  television  format to a digital
format may take many years. There can be no assurance that the Company's efforts
to take advantage of the new technology will be commercially successful.

                                       28

<PAGE>



     The Company also competes for programming,  which involves negotiating with
national  program  distributors  or  syndicators  that sell  first-run and rerun
packages of programming.  The Company's stations compete for exclusive access to
those programs against in-market  broadcast  station  competitors for syndicated
products.  Cable  systems  generally  do not  compete  with local  stations  for
programming,  although  various  national  cable networks from time to time have
acquired  programs that would have  otherwise  been offered to local  television
stations.   Public  broadcasting  stations  generally  compete  with  commercial
broadcasters for viewers but not for advertising dollars.

     Historically,  the cost of programming has increased because of an increase
in the number of new independent stations and a shortage of quality programming.
However,  the  Company  believes  that over the past five years  program  prices
generally have stabilized.

     The  Company  believes  it  competes  favorably  against  other  television
stations  because of its  management  skill and  experience,  the ability of the
Company  historically to generate revenue share greater than its audience share,
its network  affiliations  and its local program  acceptance.  In addition,  the
Company  believes  that it benefits  from the  operation  of multiple  broadcast
properties,   affording  it  certain  nonquantifiable  economies  of  scale  and
competitive advantages in the purchase of programming.

     Radio Competition. Radio broadcasting is a highly competitive business, and
each of the radio stations  operated by the Company  competes for audience share
and  advertising  revenue  directly with other radio  stations in its geographic
market,  as well as with other media,  including  television,  cable television,
newspapers,  magazines,  direct mail and  billboard  advertising.  The  audience
ratings and advertising  revenue of each of such stations are subject to change,
and any adverse  change in a  particular  market  could have a material  adverse
effect on the revenue of such radio stations  located in that market.  There can
be no assurance  that any one of the  Company's  radio  stations will be able to
maintain or increase its current audience ratings and radio advertising  revenue
market share.

     The Company attempts to improve each radio station's  competitive  position
with promotional campaigns designed to enhance and reinforce its identities with
the  listening  public.  Extensive  market  research  is  conducted  in order to
identify specific  demographic  groups and design a programming format for those
groups.  The Company seeks to build a strong  listener base composed of specific
demographic  groups in each market, and thereby attract  advertisers  seeking to
reach  these  listeners.  Aside  from  building  its  stations'  identities  and
targeting its programming to specific  demographic  groups,  management believes
that the Company also obtains a competitive  advantage by operating duopolies or
multiple stations in the nation's larger mid-size markets.

     The radio  broadcasting  industry is also subject to  competition  from new
media technologies that are being developed or introduced,  such as the delivery
of  audio  programming  by  cable  television   systems  and  by  digital  audio
broadcasting  ("DAB"). DAB may provide a medium for the delivery by satellite or
terrestrial  means of  multiple  new  audio  programming  formats  to local  and
national  audiences.  The FCC has issued licenses for two satellite DAB systems.
Historically,  the  radio  broadcasting  industry  has  grown  in terms of total
revenues  despite  the  introduction  of new  technologies  for the  delivery of
entertainment   and  information,   such  as  television   broadcasting,   cable
television,  audio tapes and compact disks. There can be no assurance,  however,
that the development or  introduction in the future of any new media  technology
will not have an adverse effect on the radio broadcast industry.

EMPLOYEES

     As of December 31, 1997,  the Company had  approximately  2,262  employees.
With the exception of certain of the employees of KOVR-TV,  KDNL-TV, WBEN-AM and
WWL-AM,  none  of the  employees  is  represented  by  labor  unions  under  any
collective  bargaining  agreement.  No  significant  labor  problems  have  been
experienced  by the  Company,  and  the  Company  considers  its  overall  labor
relations to be good.

(a)  Lease  expiration  dates  assume  exercise  of all  renewal  options of the
     lessee.

     The Company believes that all of its properties, both owned and leased, are
generally in good operating condition,  subject to normal wear and tear, and are
suitable and adequate for the Company's current business operations.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

     On July 14,  1997,  Sinclair  publicly  announced  that it had  reached  an
agreement for certain of its owned and/or programmed  television  stations which
were  affiliated  with UPN to become  affiliated  with WB beginning  January 16,
1998. On August 1, 1997, UPN informed  Sinclair that it did not believe Sinclair
or its affiliates had provided  proper notice of its intention not to extend the
UPN affiliation agreements beyond January 15, 1998, and, accordingly, that these
agreements had been automatically renewed through January 15, 2001.

     In August  1997,  UPN  filed an action  (the  "California  Action")  in Los
Angeles  Superior  Court  against the Company,  seeking  declaratory  relief and
specific  performance or, in the alternative,  unspecified  damages and alleging
that  neither the Company nor its  affiliates  provided  proper  notice of their
intention not to extend the current UPN  affiliations  beyond  January 15, 1998.
Certain  subsidiaries of the Company filed an action (the "Baltimore Action") in
the Circuit  Court for  Baltimore  City  seeking  declaratory  relief that their
notice was  effective  to terminate  the  affiliations  on January 15, 1998.  On
December 9, 1997,  the court in the  Baltimore  Action ruled that  Sinclair gave
timely and proper notice to effectively terminate the affiliations as of January
15,  1998 and  granted  Sinclair's  motion for  summary  judgment.  Based on the
decision in the Baltimore  Action,  the court in the Los Angeles  Superior Court
has stayed all proceedings in the California Action. Following an appeal by UPN,
the court of Special  Appeals  of  Maryland  upheld the ruling in the  Baltimore
Action and UPN is seeking  further  appellate  review by the  Maryland  Court of
Appeals.  Although the Company  believes  that proper notice of intention not to
extend was provided to UPN,  there can be no assurance  that the Company and its
subsidiaries  will  prevail in these  proceedings  or that the  outcome of these
proceedings,  if adverse to the  Company and its  subsidiaries,  will not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

     The  Company  currently  and from time to time is  involved  in  litigation
incidental  to the  conduct of its  business.  Except as  described  above,  the
Company is not a party to any lawsuit or  proceeding  that in the opinion of the
Company will have a material adverse effect.

ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS

     No matters were  submitted to a vote of the Company's  stockholders  during
the fourth quarter of 1997.

     As of March 16, 1998, there were approximately 77 stockholders of record of
the common stock of the Company.  This number does not include beneficial owners
holding shares through nominee names. Based on information  available to it, the
Company believes it has more than 1,500 beneficial  owners of its Class A Common
Stock.

     The Company  generally has not paid a dividend on its common stock and does
not expect to pay dividends on its common stock in the foreseeable  future.  The
1997  Bank  Credit  Agreement  and  certain  subordinated  debt  of the  Company
generally  prohibit the Company from paying dividends on its common stock. Under
the indentures  governing the Company's 10% Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2003,
10% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2005, 9% Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2007
and 8 3/4% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2007, the Company is not permitted to
pay  dividends on its common  stock  unless  certain  specified  conditions  are
satisfied,  including  that  (i) no event  of  default  then  exists  under  the
Indenture or certain other specified  agreements relating to indebtedness of the
Company  and (ii) the  Company,  after  taking  account of the  dividend,  is in
compliance with certain net cash flow  requirements  contained in the Indenture.
In addition,  under certain senior unsecured debt of the Company, the payment of
dividends is not permissible during a default thereunder.

(a)  The Company made  acquisitions in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 as described in
     the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements  incorporated herein
     by reference. The statement of operations data and other data presented for
     periods  preceding  the dates of  acquisitions  do not include  amounts for
     these acquisitions and therefore are not comparable to subsequent  periods.
     Additionally, the years in which the specific acquisitions occurred may not
     be comparable to subsequent  periods  depending on when during the year the
     acquisition occurred.

(b)  Net  broadcast  revenues  are defined as  broadcast  revenues net of agency
     commissions.

(c)  Depreciation  and  amortization  includes  amortization of program contract
     costs and net realizable value  adjustments,  depreciation and amortization
     of  property  and  equipment,   and  amortization  of  acquired  intangible
     broadcasting  assets and other assets  including  amortization  of deferred
     financing costs and costs related to excess syndicated programming.

(d)  Subsidiary trust minority interest expense  represents the distributions on
     the HYTOPS.

(e)  "Broadcast  cash  flow" is  defined  as  broadcast  operating  income  plus
     corporate  overhead  expense,  special bonuses paid to executive  officers,
     depreciation and amortization (including film amortization and amortization
     of deferred  compensation,  and excess syndicated  programming),  less cash
     payments for program contract rights.  Cash program payments represent cash
     payments  made  for  current  program   payables  and  do  not  necessarily
     correspond to program usage. Special bonuses paid to executive officers are
     considered unusual and non-recurring.  The Company has presented  broadcast
     cash flow data,  which the  Company  believes  are  comparable  to the data
     provided by other companies in the industry, because such data are commonly
     used  as  a  measure  of  performance  for  broadcast  companies.  However,
     broadcast  cash  flow  does not  purport  to  represent  cash  provided  by
     operating activities as reflected in the Company's consolidated  statements
     of cash flows,  is not a measure of financial  performance  under generally
     accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or
     as a substitute  for measures of  performance  prepared in accordance  with
     generally accepted accounting principles.

(f)  "Broadcast  cash flow margin" is defined as broadcast  cash flow divided by
     net broadcast  revenues.  "Adjusted  EBITDA  margin" is defined as Adjusted
     EBITDA divided by net broadcast  revenues.  "After tax cash flow margin" is
     defined as after tax cash flow divided by net broadcast revenues.

(g)  "Adjusted EBITDA" is defined as broadcast cash flow less corporate overhead
     expense  and is a  commonly  used  measure  of  performance  for  broadcast
     companies.  Adjusted  EBITDA does not purport to represent cash provided by
     operating activities as reflected in the Company's consolidated  statements
     of cash flows,  is not a measure of financial  performance  under generally
     accepted accounting principles and should not be considered in isolation or
     as a substitute  for measures of  performance  prepared in accordance  with
     generally accepted accounting principles.

(h)  "After tax cash flow" is defined as net income  (loss)  available to common
     shareholders plus extraordinary  losses,  minus extraordinary gains (before
     the effects of related tax benefits) plus  depreciation and amortization of
     intangibles,  (excluding  film  amortization),   amortization  of  deferred
     compensation,   amortization  of  excess  syndicated  programming,  special
     bonuses paid to executive  officers,  and the  deferred tax  provision  (or
     minus the deferred tax benefit).  After tax cash flow is presented here not
     as a measure of operating  results and does not purport to  represent  cash
     provided  by  operating  activities.  After  tax cash  flow  should  not be
     considered  in  isolation or as a  substitute  for measures of  performance
     prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

(i)  "Total debt" is defined as long-term debt, net of unamortized discount, and
     capital lease obligations, including current portion thereof. In 1992 total
     debt  included  warrants  outstanding  which were  redeemable  outside  the
     control of the  Company.  The  warrants  were  purchased by the Company for
     $10,400 in 1993.  Total debt as of December 31, 1993  included  $100,000 in
     principal  amount of the 1993 Notes (as defined  herein),  the  proceeds of
     which were held in escrow to provide a source of financing for acquisitions
     that were subsequently  consummated in 1994 utilizing  borrowings under the
     Bank Credit  Agreement.  $100,000 of the 1993 Notes was  redeemed  from the
     escrow in the first quarter of 1994. Total debt does not include the HYTOPS
     or the Company's preferred stock.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S  DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
        OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

     The Company is a diversified  broadcasting  company that  currently owns or
programs pursuant to Local Marketing  Agreements ("LMAs") 35 television stations
and, upon consummation of all pending acquisitions and dispositions, will own or
program  pursuant to LMAs 56 television  stations.  The Company owns or programs
pursuant  to LMAs  52  radio  stations  and  upon  consummation  of all  pending
acquisitions and dispositions,  the Company will own or program pursuant to LMAs
51 radio stations.  The Company also has options to acquire two additional radio
stations

     The  operating  revenues of the Company are derived from local and national
advertisers and, to a much lesser extent, from television network  compensation.
The  Company's  primary  operating  expenses  involved in owning,  operating  or
programming  the television  and radio  stations are  syndicated  program rights
fees, commissions on revenues, employee salaries,  news-gathering and promotion.
Amortization  and  depreciation of costs  associated with the acquisition of the
stations and interest  carrying  charges are significant  factors in determining
the Company's overall profitability.

     Set forth below are the principal  types of broadcast  revenue  received by
the Company's stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution
of each type to the Company's total gross broadcast revenue:

prised $49.0 million related to the Acquisitions,  $5.4 million from an increase
in corporate overhead  expenses,  and $1.3 million from an increase in operating
costs  on a  same  station  basis.  On a same  station  basis,  operating  costs
increased 1.8%.

     Broadcast  operating  income increased to $126.3 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997,  from $88.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996, or
42.1%.  The increase in broadcast  operating  income for the year ended December
31,  1997 as  compared  to the  year  ended  December  31,  1996  was  primarily
attributable to the Acquisitions.

     Interest expense increased to $98.4 million for the year ended December 31,
1997 from $84.3  million for the year ended  December  31, 1996,  or 16.7%.  The
increase in  interest  expense for the year ended  December  31, 1997  primarily
related to  indebtedness  incurred by the  Company to finance the  Acquisitions.
Subsidiary  trust minority  interest expense of $18.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 1997 is related to the  issuance of the HYTOPS which was  completed
March 12, 1997.  Subsidiary trust minority interest expense was partially offset
by reductions in interest  expense because a portion of the proceeds of the sale
of the HYTOPS was used to reduce  indebtedness  under the Company's  Bank Credit
Agreement.

     Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $2.2  million for the year ended
December 31, 1997 from $3.5 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.  This
decrease was primarily due to lower average cash balances during these periods.

     For the reasons  described  above, net loss for the year ended December 31,
1997 was $10.6 million or $.37 per share  compared to net income of $1.1 million
or $.03 per share for the year ended December 31, 1996.

     Broadcast Cash Flow increased  $54.2 million to $243.4 million for the year
ended  December  31, 1997 from $189.2  million for the year ended  December  31,
1996,  or 28.6%.  The  increase in  Broadcast  Cash Flow was  comprised of $45.0
million  relating  to the  Acquisitions  and $9.2  million  that  resulted  from
Broadcast  Cash Flow growth on a same station  basis,  which had Broadcast  Cash
Flow growth of 8.2%. The Company's Broadcast Cash Flow Margin decreased to 51.7%
for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from 54.6% for the year ended December 31,
1996. The decrease in Broadcast Cash Flow Margin for the year ended December 31,
1997 as compared to the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily resulted from the
lower margins related to the 1996 Acquisitions. In addition, 1996 Broadcast Cash
Flow Margin  benefited from a  non-recurring  $4.7 million timing lag of program
contract  payments  relating to the River City  Acquisition  and  certain  other
acquisitions.  On a same station basis, Broadcast Cash Flow Margin improved from
57.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 to 58.9% for the year ended December
31, 1997.

     Adjusted  EBITDA  represents  broadcast cash flow less corporate  expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA increased to $229.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1997
from $180.3  million  for the year ended  December  31,  1996,  or 27.0%.  These
increases in Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 1996 resulted from the  Acquisitions and to a lesser
extent,  increases  in net  broadcast  revenues  on a same  station  basis.  The
Company's  Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased to 48.6% for the year ended December
31,  1997 from 52.0% for the year ended  December  31,  1996.  This  decrease in
Adjusted  EBITDA margin  resulted  primarily  from the  circumstances  affecting
broadcast  cash  flow  margins  as noted  above  combined  with an  increase  in
corporate  expenses.  Corporate overhead expenses increased to $14.4 million for
the year ended  December 31, 1997 from $8.9 million for the year ended  December
31, 1996, or 61.8%.  These increases in corporate  expenses  primarily  resulted
from costs  associated  with managing a larger base of operations.  During 1996,
the  Company  increased  the size of its  corporate  staff  as a  result  of the
addition of a radio business segment and a significant increase in the number of
television  stations owned,  operated or programmed.  The costs  associated with
this  increase in staff were only incurred  during a partial  period of the year
ended December 31, 1996.

     After Tax Cash Flow increased to $104.9 million for the year ended December
31, 1997 from $77.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, or 35.4%.  The
increase in After Tax Cash Flow for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily resulted

                                       40

from the Acquisitions, an increase in revenue on a same station basis, a Federal
income tax  receivable of $10.6  million  resulting  from 1997 NOL  carry-backs,
offset by interest  expense on the debt incurred to consummate the  Acquisitions
and subsidiary trust minority  interest expense related to the private placement
of the HYTOPS issued during March 1997.

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1995 AND 1996

     Total revenue  increased to $378.5  million,  or 83.6%,  for the year ended
December  31, 1996 from $206.1  million for the year ended  December  31,  1995.
Excluding the effects of non-cash barter transactions, net broadcast revenue for
the year ended December 31, 1996 increased by 84.4% over the year ended December
31,  1995.  The  increase  in  broadcast  revenue  was  primarily  the result of
acquisitions and LMA transactions  consummated by the Company in 1995 (the "1995
Acquisitions") and 1996. For stations owned,  operated or programmed  throughout
1995 and  1996,  television  broadcast  revenue  grew  2.1%  for the year  ended
December  31,  1996 when  compared  to the year ended  December  31,  1995.  For
stations  owned,  operated or programmed  throughout  1994 and 1995,  television
broadcast  revenue grew 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 1995 when compared
to the year ended  December  31, 1994.  The  decrease in 1996 revenue  growth as
compared to 1995 revenue growth primarily  resulted from the loss in 1996 of the
Fox  affiliation  at  WTTO  in the  Birmingham  market,  the  loss  of  the  NBC
affiliation  at WRDC in the  Raleigh/Durham  market and  decreases in ratings at
WCGV and WNUV in the Milwaukee and Baltimore markets, respectively.

     Operating  expenses  excluding  depreciation,  amortization  of  intangible
assets  and  amortization  of  deferred   compensation  and  excess   syndicated
programming  costs  increased to $167.8 million,  or 108.7%,  for the year ended
December 31, 1996 from $80.4 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995.  The
increase in  expenses  for the year ended  December  31, 1996 as compared to the
year ended  December  31,  1995 was  largely  attributable  to  operating  costs
associated  with  the  1995  and  1996  Acquisitions,  an  increase  in LMA fees
resulting from LMA transactions and an increase in corporate overhead expenses.

     Broadcast  operating  income  increased to $88.9 million for the year ended
December 31, 1996,  from $45.3 million for the year ended  December 31, 1995, or
96.2%.  The increase in broadcast  operating  income for the year ended December
31,  1996 as  compared  to the  year  ended  December  31,  1995  was  primarily
attributable to the 1995 and 1996 Acquisitions.

     Interest expense increased to $84.3 million for the year ended December 31,
1996 from $39.3  million for the year ended  December 31, 1995,  or 114.5%.  The
increase in interest  expense for the year ended December 31, 1996 was primarily
related to senior bank indebtedness incurred by the Company to finance the River
City Acquisition and other acquisitions.

     Interest  and other  income  decreased  to $3.5  million for the year ended
December  31, 1996 from $4.2 million for the year ended  December  31, 1995,  or
16.7%.  The decrease for the year ended  December 31, 1996 was  primarily due to
lower cash balances and related  interest  income  resulting  from cash payments
made in February 1996 when the Company made a $34.4 million payment  relating to
the WSMH  acquisition  and April 1996 when the Company  made a $60 million  down
payment relating to the River City Acquisition.  The decrease in interest income
was  offset by an  increase  in other  income  resulting  from the 1995 and 1996
Acquisitions.

     For the reasons described above, net income for the year ended December 31,
1996 was $1.1 million or $0.03 per share  compared to net income of $5.0 million
or $0.15 per share for the year ended December 31, 1995 before the extraordinary
loss on early extinguishment of debt.

     Broadcast cash flow increased to $189.2 million for the year ended December
31, 1996 from $111.1 million for the year ended December 31, 1995, or 70.3%. The
increase in broadcast cash flow for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared
to the year ended  December 31, 1995  primarily  resulted from the 1995 and 1996
Acquisitions.  For stations  owned,  operated or programmed  throughout 1995 and
1996,  broadcast  cash flow grew 1.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 when
compared to the year ended  December 31, 1995. For stations  owned,  operated or
programmed throughout 1994 and 1995, broadcast cash flow grew 23.7% for the year
ended  December 31, 1995 when compared to the year ended  December 31, 1994. The
decrease in 1996 broadcast cash flow growth as compared to 1995

                                       41

broadcast cash flow growth  primarily  resulted from the loss in 1996 of the Fox
affiliation at WTTO in the Birmingham market, the loss of the NBC affiliation at
WRDC in the  Raleigh/Durham  market and decreases in ratings at WCGV and WNUV in
the Milwaukee and Baltimore markets,  respectively. The Company's broadcast cash
flow margin  decreased to 54.6% for the year ended  December 31, 1996 from 59.1%
for the year ended  December 31,  1995.  Excluding  the effect of radio  station
broadcast cash flow,  television station broadcast cash flow margin decreased to
56.7% for the year ended  December  31,  1996 as  compared to 59.1% for the year
ended  December  31, 1995.  The decrease in broadcast  cash flow margins for the
year ended  December  31, 1996 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1995
primarily  resulted  from the lower margins of the acquired  radio  broadcasting
assets and lower  margins of certain of the acquired  television  stations.  For
stations owned,  operated or programmed throughout 1996 and 1995, broadcast cash
flow margins were unchanged when comparing the years ended December 31, 1996 and
1995. The Company believes that margins of certain of the acquired stations will
improve as operating and programming synergies are implemented.

     Adjusted EBITDA increased to $180.3 million for the year ended December 31,
1996 from $105.8  million for the year ended  December 31, 1995,  or 70.4%.  The
increase in Adjusted  EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to
the year ended  December 31, 1995 resulted from the 1995 and 1996  Acquisitions.
The  Company's  Adjusted  EBITDA  margin  decreased  to 52.0% for the year ended
December 31, 1996 from 56.3% for the year ended  December 31, 1995. The decrease
in Adjusted  EBITDA  margins for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 1995 primarily  resulted from higher operating costs
at certain of the acquired stations.

     After-tax  cash flow increased to $77.5 million for the year ended December
31, 1996 from $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1995, or 41.9%.  The
increase in after-tax cash flow for the year ended December 31, 1996 as compared
to the year ended  December 31, 1995  primarily  resulted from the 1995 and 1996
Acquisitions offset by interest expense on the debt incurred to consummate these
acquisitions.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     As of December 31, 1997,  the Company had $139.3  million in cash  balances
and net working capital of approximately  $176.0 million.  The Company's primary
sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and availability  under the
1997 Bank Credit  Agreement.  As of March 10, 1998,  the Company's cash balances
decreased to  approximately  $10.1  million as a result of closing on certain of
the  Heritage  television  stations.  Also as of March 10,  1998,  approximately
$239.8 million was available for borrowing under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement.
An  additional  $89.6  million is available to the Company  under its  Revolving
Credit Commitment to the extent future acquisitions  provide incremental EBITDA.
In addition,  the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement  provides for a Tranche C term loan
in the amount of up to $400 million  which can be utilized  upon approval by the
agent bank and upon raising sufficient commitments to fund the additional loans.

     Net cash flows from operating activities increased to $96.6 million for the
year ended  December 31, 1997 from $69.3 million for the year ended December 31,
1996.  The Company  made income tax  payments of $6.5 million for the year ended
December  31, 1997 as compared to $6.8  million for the year ended  December 31,
1996. The Company made interest  payments on outstanding  indebtedness  of $98.5
million during the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to $82.8 million for
the year ended  December 31,  1996.  Additional  interest  payments for the year
ended  December  31,  1997 as  compared  to the year  ended  December  31,  1996
primarily  related to  additional  interest  costs on  indebtedness  incurred to
finance  the 1996  Acquisitions.  The Company  made  subsidiary  trust  minority
interest  expense payments of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997
related to the  issuance  of HYTOPS  completed  in March  1997.  Program  rights
payments  increased to $51.1  million for the year ended  December 31, 1997 from
$30.5 million for the year ended December 31, 1996, primarily as a result of the
1996 Acquisitions.

     Net cash flows used in investing activities decreased to $219.0 million for
the year ended  December 31, 1997 from $1.0 billion for the year ended  December
31,  1996.  During the year ended  December  31,  1997,  the  Company  made cash
payments of $87.5 million to acquire the license and non-license assets of

                                       42

KUPN-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada,  utilizing indebtedness under the 1997 Bank Credit
Agreement and existing cash  balances.  During the year ended December 31, 1997,
the Company incurred option extension  payments and other costs of $16.0 million
relating to WSYX-TV in Columbus, Ohio. The Company made purchase option exercise
payments of $11.1  million  during the year ended  December 31, 1997  exercising
options to acquire certain FCC licenses  related to the River City  Acquisition.
The Company made  payments for property and  equipment of $19.4  million for the
year ended  December 31,  1997.  During the year ended  December  31, 1997,  the
Company  made  deposits  and  incurred  other  costs  relating  to the  Heritage
Acquisition,  the Max Media Acquisition and other acquisitions of $66.1 million,
$12.8  million and $3.4  million,  respectively.  The Company  anticipates  that
future requirements for capital  expenditures will include capital  expenditures
incurred  during the  ordinary  course of  business  (which will  include  costs
associated with the  implementation  of digital  television  technology) and the
cost of additional  acquisitions  of television  and radio  stations if suitable
acquisitions can be identified on acceptable terms.

     Net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased to $259.4 million
for the year ended  December  31,  1997 from  $832.8  million for the year ended
December 31, 1996. In March 1997, the Company completed  issuance of the HYTOPS.
The  Company  utilized  $135  million of the  approximately  $192.8  million net
proceeds of the  issuance of the HYTOPS to repay  outstanding  debt and retained
the remainder for general corporate purposes,  which included the acquisition of
KUPN-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Company made payments totaling $4.6 million to
repurchase 186,000 shares of Class A Common Stock during the year ended December
31, 1997. In May 1997, the Company made payments of $4.7 million  related to the
amendment of its 1996 Bank Credit Agreement.  In the fourth quarter of 1996, the
Company negotiated the prepayment of syndicated program contract liabilities for
excess syndicated  programming assets. In the first quarter of 1997, the Company
made final cash payments of $1.4 million related to these negotiations.  In July
1997, the Company issued $200.0 million aggregate  principal amount of 9% Senior
Subordinated  Notes due 2007 and utilized  $162.5  million of the  approximately
$195.6  million net proceeds to repay  outstanding  indebtedness,  retaining the
remainder to pay a portion of the $63 million cash down payment  relating to the
Heritage  Acquisition.  In December 1997,  the Company  completed an issuance of
$250 million aggregate  principal amount of 8 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due
2007.  The Company  received net proceeds from the issuance of $244.0 million of
which $106.2 million was used to repurchase  $98.1 million  aggregate  principal
amount of the 10% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2003. The Company retained the
remainder of the net  proceeds for general  corporate  purposes  which  included
closing  the  acquisition  of  the  Heritage  television  stations  serving  the
Mobile/Pensacola and Charleston/Huntington markets in January 1998.

     The Company  received net proceeds from the 1997  Preferred  Stock Issuance
and the 1997 Common Stock  Issuance of  approximately  $166.9 million and $151.0
million,  respectively.  The Company  used the  majority of these funds to repay
existing borrowings under the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement. Contemporaneously with
the 1997  Preferred  Stock  Issuance  and the 1997 Common  Stock  Issuance,  the
Company and the lenders  under the 1997 Bank Credit  Agreement  entered  into an
amendment  to the 1997  Bank  Credit  Agreement,  the  effect  of  which  was to
recharacterize  $275 million of indebtedness  from the Tranche A term loan under
the 1997 Bank  Credit  Agreement  to amounts  owing under the  revolving  credit
facility under the 1997 Bank Credit  Agreement.  The Company used $285.7 million
of the net proceeds from the 1997 Common Stock  Issuance and the 1997  Preferred
Stock  Issuance  to repay  outstanding  borrowings  under the  revolving  credit
facility,  $8.9 million to repay  outstanding  amounts  under the Tranche A term
loan and the remaining net proceeds of  approximately  $23.3 million for general
corporate purposes.

     The Company has entered into  agreements to acquire  additional  television
stations  and  radio  stations  in  the  Heritage   Acquisition,   the  Lakeland
Acquisition, the Max Media Acquisition and the Sullivan Acquisition. The Company
also has an  option to  acquire  the  assets of  WSYX-TV,  Columbus,  Ohio.  The
aggregate  cash  consideration  needed to complete the purchase of the remaining
stations   under  the  Heritage   Acquisition   and  to  complete  the  Lakeland
Acquisition,  the Max Media  Acquisition  and the  Sullivan  Acquisition  and to
exercise the WSYX-TV option is expected to be approximately $1.6 billion (net of
anticipated proceeds from sales of stations involved in these acquisitions).

     The Company anticipates that funds from operations,  existing cash balances
and  availability  of the revolving  credit  facility under the 1997 Bank Credit
Agreement will be sufficient to meet its working  capital,  capital  expenditure
commitments  (other than commitments for pending  acquisitions  described above)
and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future. The Company intends to
finance  pending  acquisitions  through a combination of available cash, the net
proceeds of the Offering,  and available  borrowings  under the 1997 Bank Credit
Agreement.  The current terms of the 1997 Bank Credit Agreement do not allow the
Company  to  borrow  an  amount   sufficient  to  finance  all  of  the  pending
acquisitions.  The  Company  intends  to begin  discussions  with  its  banks to
refinance  the  Bank  Credit  Agreement  promptly  upon  the  completion  of the
Offering.  The Company  believes that such a refinancing  can be accomplished on
terms reasonably satisfactory to the Company, but there can be no assurance that
the Company will be able to obtain such an amendment on satisfactory  terms. The
1997 Bank Credit  Agreement and the indentures  relating to the Company's 8 3/4%
Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2007, 9% Senior  Subordinated Notes due 2007 and
10% Senior  Subordinated  Notes due 2005  restrict the  incurrence of additional
indebtedness  and  the  use  of  proceeds  of  an  equity  issuance,  but  these
restrictions  are not expected to restrict the incurrence of indebtedness or use
of proceeds of an equity issuance to finance the pending acquisitions.

INCOME TAXES

     Income tax provision increased to $16.0 million for the year ended December
31, 1997 from a provision of $6.9 million for the year ended  December 31, 1996.
The Company's effective tax rate increased to 139.1% for the year ended December
31, 1997 from 86.0% for the year ended  December 31,  1996.  The increase in the
Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 1997 as compared to
the year ended December 31, 1996 primarily resulted from non-deductible goodwill
amortization  resulting  from  certain 1995 and 1996 stock  acquisitions,  a tax
liability  related to the  dividends  paid on the  Company's  Series C Preferred
Stock  (see  Note  9,  sub-note  (a) to  the  Company's  Consolidated  Financial
Statements),  and state franchise taxes which are not based upon pre-tax income.
Management believes that pre-tax income and "earnings and profits" will increase
in future years which result in a lower  effective tax rate and  utilization  of
certain tax  deductions  related to  dividends  paid on the  Company's  Series C
Preferred Stock.

     As of December  31, 1997,  the Company has a net deferred tax  liability of
$21.5 million as compared to a net deferred tax asset of $782,000 as of December
31,  1996.  This  change in deferred  taxes  primarily  relates to deferred  tax
liabilities   associated  with  book  and  tax   differences   relating  to  the
depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and intangible  assets, a deferred
tax  liability  generated  as a result  of a  reduction  in  basis  of  Series C
Preferred  Stock  (see  Note  9,  sub-note  (a)  to the  Company's  Consolidated
Financial Statements),  offset by deferred tax assets resulting from Federal and
state net operating tax losses  (NOL's)  incurred  during 1997.  During the year
ended  December 31, 1997, the Company  carried back certain  Federal NOL's to be
applied  against prior years Federal taxes paid.  These Federal NOL  carry-backs
resulted in an income tax receivable of $10.6 million as of December 31, 1997.

     The Company's  income tax provision  increased to $6.9 million for the year
ended  December 31, 1996 from $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 1995.
The Company's  effective tax rate  increased to 86% for the year ended  December
31, 1996 from 51% for the year ended  December  31,  1995.  The increase for the
year ended  December  31, 1996 as compared to the year ended  December  31, 1995
primarily  related to certain  financial  reporting  and income tax  differences
attributable  to certain 1995 and 1996  Acquisitions  (primarily  non-deductible
goodwill resulting from stock acquisition),  and state franchise taxes which are
independent of pre-tax income.

     The net  deferred  tax asset  decreased to $782,000 as of December 31, 1996
from $21.0  million at December 31,  1995.  The  decrease in the  Company's  net
deferred  tax asset as of December  31, 1996 as compared to December 31, 1995 is
primarily due to the Company recording deferred tax liabilities of $18.1 million
relating to the acquisition of all of the  outstanding  stock of Superior in May
1996,   adjustments   related  to  certain  1995  acquisitions,   and  resulting
differences between the book and tax basis of the underlying assets.

SEASONALITY

     The Company's results usually are subject to seasonal  fluctuations,  which
result in fourth quarter broadcast operating income typically being greater than
first,  second and third quarter broadcast operating income. This seasonality is
primarily  attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation
of holiday season  consumer  spending and an increase in viewership  during this
period.

YEAR 2000

     Certain  computer  programs  have been written using two digits rather than
four  to  define  the  applicable  year,  which  could  result  in the  computer
recognizing a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than the year 2000.  This,
in turn,  could result in major system failures and in  miscalculations,  and is
generally  referred  to as the "Year 2000"  problem.  The Company and all of its

duties as an officer of the Company (each, a "Termination Event").

     In June  1995,  the  Company  entered  into an  employment  agreement  with
Frederick G. Smith, Vice President of the Company.  Frederick Smith's employment

than 60 days  prior  to the  expiration  of the then  current  term.  Under  the

     In June 1995,  the Company  entered into an  employment  agreement  with J.

     In connection with the River City Acquisition,  the Company entered into an
employment  agreement  (the  "Baker  Employment  Agreement")  with  Barry  Baker
pursuant to which Mr. Baker will become President and Chief Executive Officer of
SCI and  Executive  Vice  President  of the Company at such time as Mr. Baker is
able to hold those positions  consistent with applicable FCC regulations.  Until
such time as Mr. Baker is able to become an officer of the Company, he serves as
a  consultant  to the Company  pursuant to a consulting  agreement  and receives
compensation  that he  would  be  entitled  to as an  officer  under  the  Baker
Employment Agreement.  While Mr. Baker acts as consultant to the Company he will
not direct employees of Sinclair in the operation of its television stations and
will not  perform  services  relating  to any  shareholder,  bank  financing  or
regulatory  compliance  matters with respect to the  Company.  In addition,  Mr.
Baker will  remain the Chief  Executive  Officer of River City and will devote a
substantial  amount of his  business  time and energies to those  services.  Mr.
Baker receives a base salary of  approximately  $1,135,200 per year,  subject to
annual increases of 7 1/2% on January 1 each year. Mr. Baker is also entitled to
receive a bonus equal to 2% of the amount by which the  Broadcast  Cash Flow (as
defined  in the  Baker  Employment  Agreement)  of SCI  for a year  exceeds  the
Broadcast Cash Flow for the  immediately  preceding year. Mr. Baker has received
options to acquire 1,382,435 shares of the Class A Common Stock (or 3.33% of the
common equity of Sinclair  determined on a fully diluted basis as of the date of
the River City  Acquisition).  The option became exercisable with respect to 50%
of the shares upon closing of the River City Acquisition, and became exercisable
with respect to an additional 25% of the shares on the first  anniversary of the
closing of the River City Acquisition,  and will become exercisable with respect
to the remaining 25% on the second  anniversary of the closing of the River City
Acquisition. The exercise price of the option is approximately $30.11 per share.
The term of the Baker  Employment  Agreement  extends until May 31, 2001, and is
automatically  extended  to the third  anniversary  of any Change of Control (as
defined in the Baker Employment Agreement). If the Baker Employment Agreement is
terminated as a result of a Series B Trigger Event (as defined below),  then Mr.
Baker shall be entitled to a termination  payment equal to the amount that would
have been paid in base  salary for the  remainder  of the term of the  agreement
plus bonuses that would be paid for such period based on the average  bonus paid
to Mr.  Baker  for  the  previous  three  years,  and  all  options  shall  vest
immediately upon such  termination.  In addition,  upon such a termination,  Mr.
Baker  shall have the option to  purchase  from the  Company for the fair market
value thereof either (i) all broadcast  operations of Sinclair in the St. Louis,
Missouri  DMA or (at the option of Mr.  Baker) the  Asheville,  North  Carolina/
Greenville/Spartanburg,  South  Carolina DMA or (ii) all of the Company's  radio
broadcast  operations.  Mr.  Baker  shall also have the right  following  such a
termination to receive quarterly  payments (which may be paid either in cash or,
at the Company's option, in additional shares of Class A Common Stock) equal to

                                       52

<PAGE>



5.00% of the  fair  market  value  (on the date of each  payment)  of all  stock
options and common stock issued  pursuant to the exercise of such stock  options
or pursuant to payments of this obligation in shares of Class A Common Stock and
held by him at the time of such  payment  (except  that the first  such  payment
shall be 3.75% of such value). The fair market value of unexercised  options for
such purpose  shall be equal to the market price of  underlying  shares less the
exercise price of the options.  Following  termination of Mr. Baker's employment
agreement,  the Company shall have the option to purchase the options and shares
from Mr.  Baker at their  market  value.  A "Series B Trigger  Event"  means the
termination of Barry Baker's employment with the Company prior to the expiration
of the  initial  five-year  term of the Baker  Employment  Agreement  (i) by the
Company  for any  reason  other  than  "for  cause"  (as  defined  in the  Baker
Employment  Agreement)  or (ii) by  Barry  Baker  under  certain  circumstances,
including (a) on 60 days' prior written notice given at any time within 180 days
following a Change of Control;  (b) if Mr. Baker is not elected (and  continued)
as a director of Sinclair or SCI, as President  and Chief  Executive  Officer of
SCI or as Executive  Vice  President of Sinclair,  or Mr. Baker shall be removed
from any such board or office;  (c) upon a material breach by Sinclair or SCI of
the Baker  Employment  Agreement  which is not  cured;  (d) if there  shall be a
material  diminution in Mr. Baker's authority or  responsibility,  or certain of
his economic benefits are materially  reduced, or Mr. Baker shall be required to
work  outside  Baltimore;  or  (e)  the  effective  date  of his  employment  as
contemplated by clause (b) shall not have occurred by August 31, 1997. Mr. Baker
cannot be appointed to such  positions with the Company or SCI until the Company
or SCI takes certain actions with respect to WTTV and WTTK in  Indianapolis  and
WTTE or WSYX in Columbus. The Company has not taken these actions as of the date
of this Form 10-K and,  accordingly,  Mr. Baker is able to  terminate  the Baker
Employment Agreement at any time.

     In  connection  with the sale of WPTT in Pittsburgh by the Company to WPTT,
Inc.,  WPTT,  Inc.,  issued to the Company a 15-year senior secured term note of
$6.0 million (the "WPTT Note").  The Company  subsequently sold the WPTT Note to

agreed on May 17, 1990 to loan the  Controlling  Stockholders up to $3.0 million
(the "Bay Credit Facility").  Each of the loans to the Controlling  Stockholders
pursuant to the Bay Credit  Facility  is  evidenced  by an amended and  restated
secured note totaling $2.6 million due December 31, 1999 accruing  interest at a
fixed rate equal to 6.88%.  Principal  and  interest  are payable over six years
commencing  on March 31,  1994,  and are  required  to be repaid  quarterly  and
$530,000  was paid in 1997.  $660,000 is payable in 1998 and $718,000 is payable

AFFILIATED LEASES

     From 1987 to 1992, the Company  entered into five lease  transactions  with
CCI,  a  corporation  wholly  owned by the  Controlling  Stockholders,  to lease
certain  facilities from CCI. Four of these leases are 10-year leases for rental
space on broadcast  towers,  two of which are capital  leases  having  renewable
terms of 10 years.  The other lease is a  month-to-month  lease for a portion of
studio and office space at

                                       55

<PAGE>



which certain  satellite  dishes are located.  Aggregate  annual rental payments
related to these  leases were  $641,000 in 1997.  The  aggregate  annual  rental
payments  related  to these  leases are  scheduled  to be  $679,000  in 1998 and
$700,000 in 1999.

     In January  1991,  CTI  entered  into a 10-year  capital  lease with KIG, a
corporation wholly owned by the Controlling Stockholders,  pursuant to which CTI
leases both an  administrative  facility  and  studios for station  WBFF and the
Company's present  corporate  offices.  Additionally,  in June 1991, CTI entered
into a one-year  renewable  lease with KIG pursuant to which CTI leases  parking
facilities at the administrative facility.  Payments under these leases with KIG
were $481,000 in 1997.  The  aggregate  annual  rental  payments  related to the
administrative  facility  are  scheduled  to be $519,000 in 1998 and $540,000 in
1999.  During 1997, the Company  chartered  airplanes owned by certain companies
controlled   by  the   Controlling   Stockholders   and  incurred   expenses  of
approximately $736,000 related to these charters.

TRANSACTIONS WITH GERSTELL

     Gerstell LP, an entity wholly owned by the  Controlling  Stockholders,  was
formed in April 1993 to acquire certain personal and real property  interests of
the Company in  Pennsylvania.  In a transaction  that was completed in September
1993,  Gerstell LP acquired the WPGH  office/studio,  transmitter and tower site
for an aggregate purchase price of $2.2 million. The purchase price was financed
in part by a $2.1 million note from  Gerstell LP bearing  interest at 6.18% with
principal  payments  beginning on November 1, 1994 and a final  maturity date of
October 1, 2013.  Principal  and interest paid in 1997 on the note was $183,000.
At December 31, 1997,  $1.9  million in  principal  amount of the note  remained
outstanding.  Following the acquisition,  Gerstell LP leased the  office/studio,
transmitter  and tower site to WPGH,  Inc. (a  subsidiary  of the  Company)  for
$14,875 per month and $25,000 per month, respectively.  The leases have terms of
seven years,  with four  seven-year  renewal  periods.  Aggregate  annual rental
payment related to these leases was $561,000 in 1997. The Company  believes that
the leases with  Gerstell LP are on terms and  conditions  customary  in similar
leases with independent third parties.

STOCK REDEMPTIONS

     On September 30, 1990,  the Company  issued  certain notes (the  "Founders'
Notes")  maturing  on May 31,  2005,  payable  to the late  Julian S.  Smith and
Carolyn C. Smith,  former  majority owners of the Company and the parents of the
Controlling   Stockholders.   The   Founders'   Notes,   which  were  issued  in
consideration  for stock  redemptions  equal to  72.65% of the then  outstanding
stock of the Company,  have principal  amounts of $7.5 million and $6.7 million,
respectively.  The Founders' Notes include stated interest rates of 8.75%, which
were payable annually from October 1990 until October 1992, then payable monthly
commencing April 1993 to December 1996, and then  semiannually  thereafter until
maturity. The effective interest rate approximates 9.4%. The Founders' Notes are
secured by security  interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company
and  its  Subsidiaries,   and  are  personally  guaranteed  by  the  Controlling
Stockholders.

     Principal and interest  payments on the Founders' Note issued to the estate
of Julian S. Smith are  payable,  in various  amounts,  each April and  October,
beginning  October  1991  until  October  2004,  with a balloon  payment  due at
maturity in the amount of $5.0 million. Additionally,  monthly interest payments
commenced  on April  1993 and  continued  until  December  1996.  Principal  and

$5.8 million in principal amount of this Founders' Note remained outstanding.

     Principal  payments  on the  Founders'  Note issued to Carolyn C. Smith are
payable,  in various  amounts,  each April and October,  beginning  October 1991
until October 2002.  Principal and interest paid in 1997 on this  Founders' Note
was $1.1 million. At December 31, 1997, $3.7 million in principal amount of this
Founders' Note remained outstanding.

RELATIONSHIP WITH GLENCAIRN

     Glencairn is a corporation  owned by (i) Edwin L. Edwards,  Sr. (3%),  (ii)
Carolyn C. Smith,  the mother of the  Controlling  Stockholders  (7%), and (iii)
certain  trusts  established  by  Carolyn  C.  Smith  for  the  benefit  of  her
grandchildren  (the  "Glencairn  Trusts")  (90%).  The 90%  equity  interest  in
Glencairn

                                       56

<PAGE>



owned by the Glencairn Trusts is held through the ownership of non-voting common
stock.  The 7% equity  interest in  Glencairn  owned by Carolyn C. Smith is held
through the ownership of common stock that is generally non-voting,  except with
respect to certain specified extraordinary corporate matters as to which this 7%
equity interest has the controlling vote. Edwin L. Edwards, Sr. owns a 3% equity
interest in Glencairn  through  ownership  of all of the issued and  outstanding
voting  stock of  Glencairn  and is Chairman of the Board,  President  and Chief
Executive Officer of Glencairn.

     There have been, and the Company  expects that in the future there will be,
transactions between the Company and Glencairn.  Glencairn is the owner-operator
and  FCC  licensee  of  WNUV  in   Baltimore,   WVTV  in   Milwaukee,   WRDC  in
Raleigh/Durham,   WABM  in   Birmingham,   KRRT  in  San  Antonio  and  WFBC  in
Asheville/Greenville/Spartanburg.   The  Company  has  entered  into  LMAs  with
Glencairn  pursuant to which the Company  provides  programming to Glencairn for
broadcast on WNUV, WVTV, WRDC, WABM, KRRT and WFBC during the hours of 6:00 a.m.
to 2:00 a.m. each day and has the right to sell advertising  during this period,
all in exchange  for the payment by the  Company to  Glencairn  of a monthly fee
totaling $789,000.

     In June 1995, the Company  acquired  options from certain  stockholders  of
Glencairn  (the  "Glencairn  Options")  which  grant to the Company the right to
acquire, subject to applicable FCC rules and regulations, stock comprising up to
a 97% equity  interest  in  Glencairn.  Of the stock  subject  to the  Glencairn
Options,  a 90%  equity  interest  is  non-voting  and the  remaining  7% equity
interest is non-voting,  except with respect to certain extraordinary matters as
to which this 7% equity interest has the controlling vote. Each Glencairn Option
was  purchased  by the  Company  for  $1,000  ($5,000 in the  aggregate)  and is
exercisable  only  upon  the  Company's  payment  of an  option  exercise  price
generally  equal  to  the  optionor's   proportionate  share  of  the  aggregate
acquisition  cost of all  stations  owned by  Glencairn  on the date of exercise
(plus  interest  at a rate of 10% from the  respective  acquisition  date).  The
Company  estimates  that the aggregate  option  exercise price for the Glencairn
Options, if currently exercised, would be approximately $14.8 million.

     In addition, the Company has agreed to sell to Glencairn for $2,000,000 the
License Assets of WTTE in Columbus,  Ohio, which the Company  currently owns. In
addition,  the  Company  has an option to acquire  from River City the assets of
WSYX,  which  is  in  the  same  market  as  WTTE.  See  "Business--Broadcasting
Acquisition  Strategy."  Upon the Company's  assignment of the License Assets of
WTTE to Glencairn (which the Company does not expect to occur unless the Company
acquires WSYX), the Company intends to enter into an LMA with Glencairn relating
to WTTE  pursuant to which the Company  will supply  programming  to  Glencairn,
obtain the right to sell advertising  during the periods covered by the supplied
programming and make payments to Glencairn in amounts to be negotiated.

     In connection with the Sullivan  Acquisition,  Glencairn has entered into a
plan  of  merger  with  Sullivan  III  which,  if  completed,  would  result  in
Glencairn's  ownership  of all the  issued  and  outstanding  capital  stock  of
Sullivan III.  After the merger,  the Company  intends to enter into an LMA with
Glencairn and continue to provide programming  services to the five stations the
License. Assets of  which are acquired by Glencairn in the merger.


RIVER CITY TRANSACTIONS

     Roy  F.  Coppedge,   who  will  become  a  director  of  the  Company  upon
satisfaction of certain conditions,  and Barry Baker, who will become a director
and executive  officer of the Company as soon as permissible  under the rules of
the FCC and applicable  laws,  each have a direct or indirect equity interest in
River City Partners, L.P. Therefore, Messrs. Coppedge and Baker have an interest
in   the   River   City    Acquisition,    which   is    described    above   in
"Business--Broadcasting Acquisition Strategy." During 1997, the Company made LMA
payments of $896,000 to River City. In September  1996, the Company entered into
a five-year  agreement with River City pursuant to which River City will provide
to the Company certain production  services.  Pursuant to this agreement,  River
City will provide certain services to the Company in return for an annual fee of
$416,000, subject to certain adjustments on each anniversary date.

KEYMARKET OF SOUTH CAROLINA

     Kerby Confer, who is expected to become an executive officer of the Company
as soon as permissible  under the rules of the FCC and  applicable  laws, is the
owner of 100% of the common stock of Keymarket of South Carolina,  Inc. ("KSC").
The  Company  has  exercised  its option to acquire all of the assets of KSC for
forgiveness  of debt in an  aggregate  principal  amount of  approximately  $7.4
million,  plus payment of approximately $1.0 million,  less certain adjustments.
The Company  also  purchased  two  properties  from Mr.  Confer for an aggregate
purchase price of approximately $1.75 million.

BEAVER DAM LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY

     In May 1996, the Company, along with the Controlling  Stockholders,  formed
Beaver Dam Limited Liability Company ("BDLLC"),  of which the Company owns a 45%
interest. BDLLC was formed for the purpose of constructing and owning a building
which may be the site for the Company's corporate headquarters. The Company made
capital contributions to BDLLC in 1996 of approximately  $380,000.  During 1997,
the Partnership made a liquidating  distribution to the Company of approximately
$380,000 and the Company no longer owns an interest in BDLP.

HERITAGE AUTOMOTIVE GROUP

     In  January  1997,  David D.  Smith,  the  Company's  President  and  Chief
Executive  Officer and one of the Controlling  Shareholders,  made a substantial
investment in, and became a member of the board of directors of, Summa Holdings,
Ltd.  which,  through wholly owned  subsidiaries,  owns the Heritage  Automotive
Group  ("Heritage")  and  Allstate  Leasing  ("Allstate").  Mr.  Smith is not an
officer, nor does he actively participate in the management,  of Summa Holdings,
Ltd.,  Heritage,  or  Allstate.  Heritage  owns  and  operates  new and used car
dealerships in the Baltimore  metropolitan  area.  Allstate owns and operates an
automobile  and  equipment  leasing  business  with  offices  in the  Baltimore,
Richmond,  Houston,  and Atlanta  metropolitan areas. The Company sells Heritage
and Allstate advertising time on WBFF and WNUV, the television stations operated
by the Company serving the Baltimore DMA. The Company believes that the terms of
the  transactions  between the Company and Heritage and the Company and Allstate
are and will be comparable to those prevailing in similar  transactions  with or
involving unaffiliated parties.

                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders of
Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.:

     We have audited the  accompanying  consolidated  balance sheets of Sinclair
Broadcast Group,  Inc. (a Maryland  corporation) and Subsidiaries as of December
31,  1996 and 1997,  and the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,
stockholders'  equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996
and 1997.  These financial  statements are the  responsibility  of the Company's
management.  Our  responsibility  is to express  an  opinion on these  financial
statements based on our audits.

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

     In our opinion,  the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material  respects,  the financial  position of Sinclair Broadcast Group,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1996 and 1997, and the results of their

                SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                       DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1996 AND 1997


1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:


Basis of Presentation

The  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  include the  accounts of
Sinclair  Broadcast Group,  Inc.,  Sinclair  Communications,  Inc. and all other
consolidated subsidiaries,  which are collectively referred to hereafter as "the
Company,  Companies or SBG." The Company owns and operates  television and radio
stations   throughout   the  United  States.   Additionally,   included  in  the
accompanying  consolidated financial statements are the results of operations of
certain  television  stations pursuant to local marketing  agreements (LMAs) and
radio stations pursuant to joint sales agreements (JSAs).


Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated  financial  statements  include the accounts of the Company and
all  its  wholly-owned  and  majority-owned   subsidiaries.   Minority  interest
represents a minority  owner's  proportionate  share of the equity in two of the
Company's  subsidiaries.  In  addition,  the Company  uses the equity  method of
accounting for 20% to 50% ownership  investments.  All significant  intercompany
transactions and account balances have been eliminated.


Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial  statements in accordance  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the
financial   statements  and  in  the   disclosures  of  contingent   assets  and
liabilities. While actual results could differ from those estimates,  management
believes  that actual  results  will not be  materially  different  from amounts
provided in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.


Cash Equivalents

Cash equivalents are stated at cost plus accrued  interest,  which  approximates
fair value. Cash equivalents are highly liquid investment grade debt instruments
with an original  maturity of three months or less and consist of time  deposits
with a number of consumer banks with high credit ratings.


Programming

The Companies have  agreements  with  distributors  for the rights to television
programming  over contract  periods which generally run from one to seven years.
Contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally shorter
than the contract period.  Each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability
when the  license  period  begins  and the  program is  available  for its first
showing.  The  portion  of the  program  contracts  payable  within  one year is
reflected  as a  current  liability  in the  accompanying  consolidated  balance
sheets.

The rights to program  materials are reflected in the accompanying  consolidated
balance  sheets at the lower of  unamortized  cost or estimated  net  realizable
value.  Estimated net realizable values are based upon management's  expectation
of future  advertising  revenues net of sales commissions to be generated by the
program material.  Amortization of program contract costs is generally  computed
under either a four year accelerated method or based on usage,  whichever yields
the greater amortization for each program.  Program contract costs, estimated by
management to be amortized in the  succeeding  year,  are  classified as current
assets.  Payments  of  program  contract  liabilities  are  typically  paid on a
scheduled  basis  and  are not  affected  by  adjustments  for  amortization  or
estimated net realizable value.

                DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1996 AND 1997 - (CONTINUED)

Barter Arrangements

Certain  program  contracts  provide for the exchange of advertising air time in
lieu of cash payments for the rights to such  programming.  These  contracts are
recorded  as  the  programs  are  aired  at  the  estimated  fair  value  of the
advertising  air  time  given  in  exchange  for  the  program  rights.  Network
programming is excluded from these calculations.

The Company broadcasts certain customers' advertising in exchange for equipment,
merchandise and services. The estimated fair value of the equipment, merchandise
or services  received is recorded as deferred barter costs and the corresponding
obligation to broadcast advertising is recorded as deferred barter revenues. The
deferred barter costs are expensed or capitalized as they are used,  consumed or
received.  Deferred barter revenues are recognized as the related advertising is
aired.


Other Assets

Other  assets as of December  31,  1996 and 1997  consist of the  following  (in

</TABLE>

Non-Compete and Consulting Agreements

The Company has entered into non-compete and consulting  agreements with various
parties.  These  agreements  range from two to three  years.  Amounts paid under
these agreements are amortized over the life of the agreement.


Acquired Intangible Broadcasting Assets

Acquired intangible broadcasting assets are being amortized over periods of 1 to
40 years.  These amounts result from the  acquisition of certain  television and
radio station license and non-license assets (see Note 12). The Company monitors
the individual  financial  performance  of each of the stations and  continually
evaluates the  realizability of intangible and tangible assets and the existence
of any impairment to its recoverability based on the projected undiscounted cash
flows of the respective stations.

enter into Interest Rate  Protection  Agreements at rates not to exceed 9.5% per
annum as to a notional  principal  amount at least equal to 60% of the Tranche A
term loans  scheduled  to be  outstanding  from time to time and at rates not to
exceed 9.75% per annum as to a notional principal amount of 60% of the aggregate
amount of Tranche B scheduled to be outstanding from time to time.

As of December 31, 1997, the Company had several  interest rate swap  agreements
relating to the Company's  indebtedness  which expire from June 10, 1998 to July
15,  2007.  The swap  agreements  set rates in the  range of 5.64% to 9.0%.  The

31, 1997, and decrease to $200 million through the expiration dates. The Company
has no intentions of terminating  these  instruments  prior to their  expiration
dates unless it were to prepay a portion of its bank debt.

The  floating  interest  rates are based upon the three month  London  Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR)  rate,  and the  measurement  and  settlement  is performed
quarterly.  Settlements  of these  agreements  are  recorded as  adjustments  to
interest expense in the relevant  periods.  Premiums paid under these agreements
were approximately  $1.1 million in 1994,  $851,000 in 1996 and $474,000 in 1997
and are  amortized  over the life of the  agreements  as a component of interest
expense.  The counter parties to these  agreements are major national  financial
institutions.   The  Company  estimates  the  aggregate  cost  to  retire  these
instruments at December 31, 1997 to be $726,000.

amortization.  The applicable  interest rate for Tranche B was either LIBOR plus
2.75% or the base rate plus  1.75%.  The  weighted  average  interest  rates for

Included in the current  portion  amounts are  payments  due in arrears of $14.3
million. In addition, the Companies have entered into noncancelable  commitments
for future program rights aggregating $56.9 million as of December 31, 1997.

The Company has  estimated the fair value of its program  contract  payables and
noncancelable  commitments  at  approximately  $102.7 million and $43.1 million,
respectively,  as of December 31, 1996,  and $118.9  million and $46.7  million,
respectively, at December 31, 1997, based on future cash flows discounted at the
Company's current borrowing rate.


7. PREPAYMENT OF SYNDICATED PROGRAM CONTRACT LIABILITIES:

In  connection  with the 1996  acquisitions  (see Note 12), the Company  assumed
certain  syndicated  program contracts payable for which the underlying value of
the associated syndicated program assets was determined, by management, to be of
little or no value. The Company  negotiated the prepayment of syndicated program
contracts payable for certain of the 1996 acquisitions, as well as certain other
of the  Company's  subsidiaries.  During the years ended  December  31, 1996 and
1997,  the Company made cash payments  totaling  $15.1 million and $1.4 million,
respectively,  relating to these  negotiations.  For subsidiaries owned prior to
1996,  the  Company  recognized   related   amortization  of  excess  syndicated
programming of $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 1996.

8. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:

In  connection  with the start-up of an  affiliate in 1990,  certain SBG Class B
Stockholders  issued a note  allowing them to borrow up to $3.0 million from the
Company. This note was amended and restated June 1, 1994, to a term loan bearing
interest of 6.88% with quarterly  principal  payments  beginning  March 31, 1996
through  December  31,  1999.  As of  December  31,  1996 and 1997,  the balance
outstanding was approximately $1.8 and $1.3 million, respectively.

During the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company loaned Gerstell Development
Limited  Partnership (a partnership owned by Class B Stockholders) $2.1 million.
The note bears interest at 6.18%, with principal  payments beginning on November
1, 1994,  and a final  maturity date of October 1, 2013. As of December 31, 1996
and 1997, the balance outstanding was approximately $1.9 million.

Concurrently  with the  initial  public  offering  (see  Note 13),  the  Company
acquired  options from  certain  stockholders  of Glencairn  that will grant the
Company the right to acquire,  subject to applicable FCC rules and  regulations,
up to 97% of  the  capital  stock  of  Glencairn.  The  Glencairn  options  were
purchased by the Company for nominal  consideration and will be exercisable only
upon payment of an aggregate price equal to Glencairn's  cost for the underlying
stations,  plus a 10% annual  return.  Glencairn is the  owner-operator  and FCC
licensee of WNUV in Baltimore, WVTV in Milwaukee,  WRDC in Raleigh/Durham,  WABM
in Birmingham,  KRRT in Kerrville and WFBC in  Asheville/Greenville/Spartanburg.
The Company has entered into five-year LMA agreements  (with  five-year  renewal
options) with Glencairn  pursuant to which the Company  provides  programming to
Glencairn for airing on WNUV,  WVTV,  WRDC, WABM, KRRT and WFBC during the hours
of 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. each day and has the right to sell advertising  during
this  period.  During the years ended  December  31,  1995,  1996 and 1997,  the
Company  made  payments  of  $5.6   million,   $7.3  million  and  $8.4  million
respectively, to Glencairn under these LMA agreements.

During the years ended  December 31, 1995,  1996 and 1997, the Company from time
to time entered into charter  arrangements  to lease  airplanes owned by certain
Class B  Stockholders.  During the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997,
the Company incurred expenses of approximately  $489,000,  $336,000 and $736,000
related to these arrangements, respectively.

In May 1996,  the Company  acquired  certain  assets  from River City,  obtained
options to acquire  other  assets  from  River City and  entered  into an LMA to
provide programming services to certain television and radio stations,  of which
River City is the owner of the  License  Assets.  Certain  individuals  who have
direct or  indirect  beneficial  owners of equity  interests  in River  City are
affiliates  of the Company.  During the years ended  December 31, 1996 and 1997,
the Company  incurred  LMA  expenses  relating to River City of $1.4 million and
$896,000, respectively.

In September  1996,  the Company  entered into a five-year  agreement with River
City pursuant to which River City will provide to the Company certain production
services.  Pursuant to this agreement,  River City will provide certain services
to the  Company  in return  for an annual  fee of  $416,000,  subject to certain
adjustments on each anniversary  date.  During the years ended December 31, 1996
and 1997, the Company incurred  expenses  relating to this agreement of $166,000
and $397,000, respectively.

An  individual  who is an  affiliate  of the Company is the owner of 100% of the
common stock of  Keymarket  of South  Carolina,  Inc.  ("KSC").  The Company has
exercised  its option to acquire all of the assets of KSC for  consideration  of
forgiveness of KSC debt in an aggregate  principal amount of approximately  $7.4
million, plus a payment of approximately $1.0 million, less certain adjustments.
The Company will close this  transaction  upon FCC approval which is anticipated
to occur  during 1998.  The Company  also  purchased  two  properties  from this
affiliate  for an aggregate  purchase  price of  approximately  $1.75 million as
required by certain leases  assigned to the Company in connection with the River
City acquisition.

During May 1996, the Company, along with the Class B Stockholders, formed Beaver
Dam Limited Partnership (BDLP), of which the Company owned a 45% interest.  BDLP
was formed for the purpose of construct-

headquarters.  The Company made capital contributions of approximately $380,000.
During 1997, the Partnership  made a liquidating  distribution to the Company of
approximately $380,000 and the Company no longer owns an interest in BDLP.

Certain  assets used by the  Company's  operating  subsidiaries  are leased from
Cunningham, KIG and Gerstell (entities owned by the Class B Stockholders). Lease
payments  made to these  entities  were $1.3  million,  $1.3  million,  and $1.4
million for the years ended December 31, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively.

(a) In March 1997,  the Company issued the HYTOPS  securities  (see Note 17). In
    connection  with this  transaction,  Sinclair  Broadcast  Group,  Inc.  (the
    "Parent")  issued  $206.2  million of Series C Preferred  Stock (the "Parent
    Preferred Stock") to KDSM, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. Parent Preferred
    Stock dividends paid to KDSM, Inc. are considered taxable income for Federal
    tax purposes and not considered  income for book purposes.  Also for Federal
    tax purposes,  KDSM, Inc. is allowed a tax deduction for dividends  received
    on the Parent  Preferred Stock in an amount equal to Parent  Preferred Stock
    dividends  received  in each  taxable  year  limited to the extent  that the
    Parent's  consolidated group has "earnings and profits".  To the extent that
    dividends received by KDSM, Inc. are in excess of the Parent's  consolidated
    group  earnings  and  profits,  the Parent  will reduce its tax basis in the
    Parent  Preferred  Stock which gives rise to a deferred tax liability (to be
    recognized upon redemption) and KDSM, Inc.'s dividend income is treated as a
    permanent difference between taxable income and book income. During the year
    ended  December 31, 1997,  the Parent did not generate  earnings and profits
    which  resulted in a reduction in basis of the  Parent's  Series C Preferred
    Stock of $20.8 million which  generated a related  deferred tax liability of
    $8.4 million.

                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1996 AND 1997 - (CONTINUED)

Temporary  differences  between the financial reporting carrying amounts and the
tax basis of assets and liabilities give rise to deferred taxes. The Company had
a net  deferred  tax asset and  deferred  tax  liability  of $782,000  and $21.5
million as of  December  31, 1996 and 1997,  respectively.  The  realization  of
deferred  tax  assets is  contingent  upon the  Company's  ability  to  generate
sufficient  future taxable income to realize the future tax benefits  associated
with the net deferred tax asset.  Management  believes that deferred assets will
be realized through future operating results.

The Company has total available Federal NOL's of approximately  $57.3 million as
of December 31, 1997, which expire during various years from 2004 to 2012. These
NOL's are recorded  within  refundable  income  taxes and deferred  taxes in the
accompanying  Consolidated  Balance  Sheet as of December 31,  1997.  Certain of
these NOL's are limited to use within a specific  entity,  and certain NOL's are
subject to annual  limitations  under  Internal  Revenue  Code  Section  382 and
similar state provisions.

Total  deferred tax assets and deferred tax  liabilities as of December 31, 1996
and 1997, including the effects of businesses  acquired,  and the sources of the
difference  between  financial  accounting and tax bases of the Company's assets
and  liabilities  which give rise to the  deferred  tax assets and  deferred tax
liabilities and the tax effects of each are as follows (in thousands):

In January  and May 1995,  the  Company  acquired  the  non-license  and license
assets, respectively, of WTVZ in Norfolk, Virginia for a purchase price of $49.0
million.  The  acquisition  was  accounted  for  under  the  purchase  method of
accounting  whereby the purchase price was allocated to property and programming
assets,  acquired intangible broadcasting assets and other intangible assets for
$1.4  million,  $12.6  million and $35.0  million,  respectively,  based upon an
independent appraisal. Intangible assets are being amortized over 1 to 40 years.

In January 1995, the Company acquired the license and non-license  assets of the
Paramount Station Group of Raleigh/Durham, Inc. which owned and operated WLFL in

common stock.  Certain  assets and  liabilities  of KCI (other than  programming
items, an LMA agreement and consulting agreements),  were distributed to the KCI
shareholders immediately prior to the merger. The merger of KCI is being treated
as a  reorganization  and has  been  accounted  for as a  pooling  of  interests
transaction.  Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements for all periods
presented have been restated to include the accounts of KCI.

In July 1995, the Company acquired the non-license assets of WABM in Birmingham,
Alabama for a purchase price of $2.5 million.  The acquisition was accounted for
under the  purchase  method of  accounting  whereby $1.1 million of the purchase

into a five-year LMA agreement (with a five-year renewal option) with Glencairn.

In  November  1995,  the  Company  acquired  the  non-license  assets of WDBB in

paid and grant  installments  accrued of $14.0  million was  allocated  to other
intangible assets and is being amortized over 15 years.


1996 ACQUISITIONS
- -----------------

RIVER CITY ACQUISITION

In April 1996,  the  Company  entered  into an  agreement  to  purchase  certain
non-license  assets  of  River  City.  In  May  1996,  the  Company  closed  the
transaction for a purchase price of $967.1 million,  providing as  consideration
1,150,000  shares of Series A  Convertible  Preferred  Stock with a fair  market
value of $125.1  million,  1,382,435  stock  options with a fair market value of
$23.9 million and cash payments  totaling $818.1 million.  The Company  utilized
indebtedness  under its Bank Credit  Agreement to finance the  transaction.  The
acquisition  was accounted for under the purchase  method of accounting  whereby
the purchase price was allocated to property and  programming  assets,  acquired
intangible  broadcasting  assets and other intangible  assets for $82.8 million,
$375.6  million  and $508.7  million,  respectively,  based upon an  independent
appraisal. Intangible assets are being amortized over 1 to 40 years.

Simultaneously,  the Company entered into option  agreements to purchase certain
license  assets  for an  aggregate  option  exercise  price of $20  million.  In
September 1996, after receiving FCC approval for license  transfer,  the Company
made a cash  payment of $6.9  million  to  acquire  certain  radio  station  FCC
licenses.  During 1997,  the Company  exercised  its options to acquire  certain
other FCC licenses  and now owns all of the License  Assets (or has entered into
an LMA with respect to) all of the television and radio stations with respect to
which it acquired  non-license  assets from River City,  other than  WTTV-TV and
WTTK-TV in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Also,  simultaneously  with the acquisition,  the Company entered into an option
agreement to purchase the license and non-license assets of WSYX-TV in Columbus,
Ohio. The option purchase price for this television station is $100 million plus
the amount of River City indebtedness secured by the WSYX assets on the exercise

the WSYX option  agreement,  the Company is  required  to make  certain  "Option
Extension  Fees",  as  defined.  These  fees are  required  to  begin  quarterly
beginning with December 31, 1996, through the earlier of the "Option Grant Date"
or the  expiration  date of  June  30,  1999.  The  Option  Extension  Fees  are
calculated  as 8% per  annum of the  option  purchase  price  through  the first
anniversary of the Option Grant Date, 15% per annum of the option purchase price
through the second anniversary of the Option Grant Date and 25% per annum of the
option purchase price through the expiration of the WSYX option agreement. As of
December 31, 1997, the Company  incurred  Option  Extension Fees and other costs
relating to WSYX-TV totaling $22.9 million.

In  conjunction  with the River City  acquisition,  the Company  entered into an
agreement to purchase the non-license assets of KRRT, Inc., a television station
in San Antonio,  Texas,  for a purchase price of $29.5 million.  The acquisition
was accounted for under the purchase  method of accounting  whereby the purchase
price was  allocated to property and  programming  assets,  acquired  intangible
broadcasting  assets and other intangible assets for $3.8 million,  $0.4 million
and $25.3 million, respectively, based upon an independent appraisal. Intangible
assets are being amortized over 1 to 15 years.

In  connection  with the River City  acquisition,  the Company  consummated  the
following transactions concurrent with or subsequent to the closing:

1.  In June 1996, the Board of Directors of the Company  adopted,  upon approval
    of the  stockholders  by proxy,  an amendment to the  Company's  amended and
    restated  charter.  This  amendment  increased  the number of Class A Common
    Stock shares  authorized to be issued by the Company from 35,000,000  shares
    to 100,000,000  shares. The amendment also increased the number of shares of
    Preferred Stock authorized from 5,000,000 shares to 10,000,000 shares.

2.  Series A Preferred Stock -- As partial  consideration for the acquisition of
    the non-license assets of River City, the Company issued 1,150,000 shares of
    Series A  Preferred  Stock.  In June  1996,  the Board of  Directors  of the
    Company adopted, upon approval of the stockholders by proxy, an amendment to
    the Company's  amended and restated charter at which time Series A Preferred
    Stock was  exchanged for and converted  into Series B Preferred  Stock.  The
    Company  recorded the issuance of Series A Preferred Stock based on the fair
    market  value at the date the River City  acquisition  was  announced at the
    exchange  rate of 3.64  shares  of Class A Common  Stock  for each  share of
    Series A Preferred Stock.

3.  Series  B  Preferred  Stock  --  Shares  of  Series B  Preferred  Stock  are
    convertible at any time into shares of Class A Common Stock, with each share
    of Series B Preferred Stock  convertible into  approximately  3.64 shares of
    Series A Common  Stock.  The Company may redeem shares of Series B Preferred
    Stock only after the occurrence of certain  events.  If the Company seeks to
    redeem  shares of Series B  Preferred  Stock and the  stockholder  elects to
    retain the shares,  the shares will  automatically  be converted into common
    stock on the  proposed  redemption  date.  All shares of Series B  Preferred
    Stock remaining  outstanding as of May 31, 2001, will automatically  convert
    into Class A Common  Stock.  Series B  Preferred  Stock is  entitled to 3.64
    votes on all matters with respect to which Class A Common Stock has a vote.

4. Stock Options and Awards:

     Long-Term Incentive Plan-

   In  June  1996,  the  Board  of  Directors  adopted,  upon  approval  of  the
   stockholders by proxy, the 1996 Long-Term  Incentive Plan of the Company (the
   "LTIP").  The  purpose  of the LTIP is to reward key  individuals  for making
   major contributions to the success of the Company and its subsidiaries and to
   attract and retain the services of qualified and capable  employees.  A total
   of 2,073,673  shares of Class A Common Stock is reserved  and  available  for
   awards under the plan. In connection with the River City acquisition, 244,500
   options were granted to certain employees and 1,382,454 were granted to Barry
   Baker (see  Executive  Employment  Agreement  below)  under this plan with an
   exercise price of $30.11 per share.

   The Company  recorded  deferred  compensation  of $1.9 million as  additional
   paid-in  capital at the stock  option  grant  date.  During  the years  ended
   December 31, 1996 and 1997, compensation expense of $739,000 and $605,000 was
   recorded  relating to the options  issued under the LTIP,  respectively.  The
   remaining deferred compensation of approximately  $954,000 will be recognized
   as expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

     Incentive Stock Option Plan-

   In  June  1996,  the  Board  of  Directors  adopted,  upon  approval  of  the
   stockholders  by proxy,  certain  amendment to the Company's  Incentive Stock
   Option Plan.  The purpose of the amendments was (i) to increase the number of
   shares of Class A Common  Stock  approved  for  issuance  under the plan from
   400,000 to 500,000,  (ii) to delegate to Barry Baker the  authority  to grant
   certain options,  (iii) to lengthen the period after the date of grant before
   options  become  exercisable,  from two  years to three  (iv) and to  provide
   immediate  termination  and three-year  ratable vesting of options in certain
   circumstances.  In connection  with the River City  acquisition,  the Company
   granted 287,000  options to key management  employees at an exercise price of
   $37.75, the fair market value at the date of grant.

5. Executive Employment Agreement

   In connection  with the acquisition of River City, the Company entered into a
   five-year employment agreement (the "Baker Employment  Agreement") with Barry
   Baker,  pursuant to which Mr. Baker will become President and Chief Executive
   Officer of SCI and Executive Vice  President of the Company,  at such time as
   Mr. Baker is able to hold those  positions  consistent  with  applicable  FCC

license and  non-license  assets of  KUPN-TV,  the UPN  affiliate  in Las Vegas,
Nevada,  for a  purchase  price  of  $87.5  million.  Under  the  terms  of this

million  for the  remaining  balance  of the  purchase  price and other  related

EXERCISE OF OPTIONS TO ACQUIRE RIVER CITY LICENSE ASSETS

Since March 31, 1997, the FCC has granted  approval for transfer of FCC licenses
with  respect  to  the  following  television  stations:   KDNL-TV  (St.  Louis,
Missouri),   KOVR-TV  (Sacramento,   California),   WLOS-TV  (Asheville,   North
Carolina),  KABB-TV (San  Antonio,  Texas) and KDSM-TV (Des Moines,  Iowa).  The
Company  exercised  options to acquire the License  Assets (the  television  and
radio  assets  essential  for  broadcasting  a  television  or radio  signal  in
compliance with regulatory guidelines) of each of these stations from River City
Broadcasting, L.P. ("River City") for aggregate option exercise payments of $9.3
million.  In July  1997,  the  Company  made an option  exercise  payment of $.5
million to River  City  related to the  license  assets of WFBC-TV  (Greenville,
South  Carolina) and  simultaneously  assigned its option to acquire the License
Assets of WFBC-TV to Glencairn,  Ltd. ("Glencairn") for an option assignment fee
of $2.0 million.  The Company entered into a local marketing  agreement  ("LMA")
with Glencairn whereby the Company,  in exchange for an hourly fee, obtained the
right to program and sell  advertising  on  substantially  all of the  station's
inventory of  broadcast  time.  The Company  also  received FCC approval for the
transfer of the FCC licenses of KPNT-FM and WVRV-FM in St. Louis,  Missouri, and
exercised its option to acquire the License  Assets of these radio  stations for
an option exercise price of $1.2 million. As a result of these license approvals
and option exercises, the Company now owns the License Assets of (or has entered
into an LMA with  Glencairn  with  respect to) all of the  television  and radio
stations with respect to which it acquired  Non-License  Assets (assets involved
in the operation of radio and  television  stations  other than License  Assets)
from River City, other than WTTV-TV and WTTK-TV in Indianapolis, Indiana.


AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE HERITAGE

On July 16, 1997, the Company entered into agreements (the "Heritage Acquisition
Agreements") with The News Corporation  Limited,  Heritage Media Group, Inc. and
certain subsidiaries of Heritage Media Corporation  (collectively,  "Heritage"),
pursuant to which the Company  agreed to acquire  certain  television  and radio
station  assets.  Under the Heritage  Acquisition  Agreements,  the Company will
acquire the assets of, or the right to program  pursuant to LMAs, six television
stations in three  markets and the assets of 24 radio  stations in seven markets
(the  "Heritage  Acquisition").  The aggregate  purchase price for the assets is
$630 million payable in cash at closing, less deposits paid of $65.5 million and
amounts  paid in January  1998  relating  to the  closing of certain  television
assets of $215 million (see Note 24). In January and February  1998, the Company
completed the  acquisition of the Heritage radio and television  stations except
for the television  stations in the  Burlington,  Vermont-Plattsburgh,  New York
market and the radio stations in the New Orleans,  Louisiana market.  Because of
FCC ownership  limitations,  the Company will be required to agree to divest one
or more of the radio  stations it owns or proposes to acquire in the New Orleans
market  before  closing the  Heritage  Acquisition  with respect to that market.
Closing of the New Orleans radio stations is conditioned on, among other things,
FCC approval.


AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LAKELAND GROUP

In November 1997,  the Company  entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the
stock of Lakeland Group Television Inc. for a purchase price of $50 million (the
"Lakeland  Acquisition")  and  made a cash  deposit  of $1.5  million.  Upon the
closing of the Lakeland Acquisition, the Company will acquire television station
KLGT in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Lakeland Acquisition is expected to close in
the second quarter of 1998.


AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE MAX MEDIA

On December 2, 1997, the Company entered into agreements to acquire, directly
or indirectly, all of the equity interests of Max Media Properties, L.L.C.
("Max Media"). As a result of this transaction, the Company will acquire, or
acquire the right to program pursuant to LMAs, nine television stations and

<PAGE>

                SINCLAIR BROADCAST GROUP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
                  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                DECEMBER 31, 1995, 1996 AND 1997 - (CONTINUED)

eight  radio  stations  in eight  markets  (the "Max  Media  Acquisition").  The
aggregate  purchase  price is $255  million  payable in cash at closing  (less a
deposit of $12.8 million paid at the time of signing the acquisition agreement),
a portion of which will be used to retire existing debt of Max Media at closing.
Max  Media's  television  station  WKEF-TV  in Dayton,  Ohio has an  overlapping
service area with the Company's  television stations WTTE-TV in Columbus,  Ohio,
WSTR-TV  in  Cincinnati,   Ohio,  and  with  Company  LMA  station   WTTV-TV  in
Indianapolis,  Indiana.  In addition,  Max Media's television station WEMT-TV in
Tri-Cities,   Tennessee/Virginia  has  an  overlapping  service  area  with  the
Company's  television  station  WLOS-TV in  Asheville,  North  Carolina  and Max
Media's television station KBSI-TV in Paducah, Kentucky/Cape Girardeau, Missouri
has an overlapping service area with the Company's television station KDNL-TV in
St. Louis,  Missouri.  Furthermore,  the Company owns a television  station (and
proposes  to acquire  radio  stations  from  Heritage)  in the  Norfolk-Virginia
Beach-Newport  News,  Virginia market,  where four of Max Media's radio stations
are located.  Consequently,  the Company has  requested  waivers from the FCC to
allow  the  Company  to  complete  the Max  Media  Acquisition.  There can be no
assurance  that  such  waivers  will be  granted.  As a result  of the Max Media
Acquisition and the Heritage Acquisition,  the Company intends to dispose of two
of the FM radio stations in the  Norfolk-Virginia  Beach-Newport  News, Virginia
radio market that it has agreed to acquire from  Heritage and Max Media in order
to be in  compliance  with the FCC  regulations  that  limit the number of radio
stations that can be owned in a market.  The Max Media Acquisition is subject to
FCC and Department of Justice (DOJ) approval and certain other  conditions,  and
is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of 1998. The transaction is
expected to be  financed  through  borrowings  under the  Company's  Bank Credit
Agreement.

    will grant the Company the right to acquire, subject to applicable FCC rules

Rule 144A under the  Securities Act of 1933, as amended) and a limited number of
institutional   "accredited   investors"   and  the  offering  was  exempt  from
registration  under the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as amended  ("the  Securities
Act"),  pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 144A thereunder.
The  Company  utilized  $135  million of the  approximately  $192.8  million net
proceeds of the private  placement  to repay  outstanding  debt and retained the
remainder for general  corporate  purposes,  which  included the  acquisition of
KUPN-TV in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Pursuant to a Registration  Rights Agreement entered into in connection with the
private  placement of the HYTOPS,  the Company offered holders of the HYTOPS the
right to  exchange  the  HYTOPS  for new  HYTOPS  having  the same  terms as the
existing securities, except that the exchange of the new HYTOPS for the existing
HYTOPS has been registered under the Securities Act. On May 2, 1997, the Company
filed a  registration  statement on Form S-4 with the Commission for the purpose
of registering  the new HYTOPS to be offered in exchange for the  aforementioned
existing HYTOPS issued by the Company in March 1997 (the "Exchange Offer").  The
Company's  Exchange  Offer was closed and became  effective  August 11, 1997, at
which time all of the existing HYTOPS were exchanged for new HYTOPS.

minority  interest  expense" in the accompanying  financial  statements and were
$18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 1997.


18. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS:

forma  disclosures  of  net  income  and  earnings  per  share  as if  the  fair
value-based  method  prescribed  by  SFAS  123 had  been  applied  in  measuring
compensation expense.

The Company has  computed  for pro forma  disclosure  purposes  the value of all

19. EQUITY PUT AND CALL OPTIONS:

During December 1996, the Company  entered into  physically  settled in cash put
and call option contracts  related to the Company's  common stock.  These option
contracts  were  entered  into for the  purpose of hedging  the  dilution of the
Company's common stock upon the exercise of stock options  granted.  The Company
entered  into  250,000 call options for common stock and 320,600 put options for
common  stock,  with a strike  price of $37.75  and  $27.88  per  common  share,
respectively.  To the extent that the Company entered into put option contracts,
the additional  paid-in capital amounts were adjusted  accordingly and reflected
as Equity Put Options in the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 1996.
In March 1997,  the Company  amended its put option  contracts  from  physically
settled in cash to  physically  or net  physically  settled  in  shares,  at the
election  of the  Company,  and  reclassified  amounts  reflected  as Equity Put
Options to  "Additional  paid-in  capital -- equity put options" as reflected in
the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 1997.

In April 1997, the Company entered into put and call option contracts related to
its common  stock for the  purpose of hedging the  dilution of the common  stock
upon the exercise of stock  options  granted.  The Company  entered into 550,000

options for common stock with a strike  price of $25.78 per share which  provide
for settlement in cash or in shares, at the election of the Company. The Company
entered into 550,000 American style (that is,  exercisable any time on or before
the expiration date) call options for common stock with a strike price of $25.78
per share which provide for settlement in cash or in shares,  at the election of
the Company.  The option  premium  amount of $3.4  million for these  contracts,
which was recorded as a reduction of additional  paid in capital,  is payable in
quarterly  installments  at 8.1% interest per annum  through the maturity  date,
July 13, 2000.

21. FINANCIAL INFORMATION BY SEGMENT:

In June 1997, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released Statement
of Financial  Accounting  Standards (SFAS) 131 "Disclosures about Segments of an
Enterprise  and  Related   Information."  SFAS  131  establishes  standards  for
reporting  information about operating  segments in annual financial  statements
and requires selected  information about operating segments in interim financial
statements.  SFAS 131 supercedes SFAS 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a
Business  Enterprise"  and is effective  for  financial  statements  for periods
beginning after December 15, 1997.

As of  December  31,  1997,  the Company  consisted  of two  principal  business
segments  -  television  broadcasting  and  radio  broadcasting.  Prior  to  the
acquisition  of River City  Broadcasting,  L.P. in May 1996, the Company did not
own, operate or program radio stations. As of December 31, 1997 the Company owns
or provides  programming  services  pursuant to LMAs to 29  television  stations
located in 21 geographically  diverse markets in the continental  United States.
The Company  owns 30 radio  stations in seven  geographically  diverse  markets.
Substantially all revenues represent income from unaffiliated companies.

23. GUARANTOR AND NON-GUARANTOR SUBSIDIARIES:

Prior to the HYTOPS  issuance  in March  1997,  the 1993 Notes and the 10% Notes
were  guaranteed  by  all  of  the  Company's  subsidiaries  other  than  Cresap
Enterprises,  Inc.  (the  Company  believes  that  Cresap  Enterprises,  Inc. is
inconsequential  to its  operations).  In conjunction  with the HYTOPS issuance,
KDSM,  Inc.,  KDSM  Licensee,  Inc.  and Sinclair  Capital  (the  "Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries")  are no longer guarantors of indebtedness under the 1993 Notes or
the 10% Notes.  Furthermore,  the Non-Guarantor  Subsidiaries are not guarantors
under the Company's 1997 Bank Credit Agreement or the indentures relating to the
9%  Notes  or  the  8  3/4%  Notes  issued  in  July  1997  and  December  1997,
respectively.  The following  supplemental financial information sets forth on a
condensed  basis the balance sheet and statement of operations as of and for the
year ended December 31, 1997 for Sinclair  Broadcast  Group,  Inc.  (without its
subsidiaries,   the  "Parent"),   the   Non-Guarantor   Subsidiaries,   and  the
subsidiaries   (the  "Guarantor   Subsidiaries")   that  continue  to  guarantee
indebtedness  under the 1997 Bank  Credit  Agreement,  the 1993  Notes,  the 10%
Notes, the 9% Notes and the 8 3/4% Notes.  Certain  reclassifications  have been
made to provide for uniform  disclosure  of all periods  presented.  The Company
believes that these reclassifications are not material.

waiting  period under the HSR Act, the Company  anticipates it will close on the
sale of the Portland and Rochester  radio stations to Entercom during the second
quarter of 1998. Entercom is operating these stations pursuant to an LMA pending
closing of the sale.

Montecito  Acquisition.  In February 1998, the Company entered into an agreement
to  acquire  all of the  capital  stock of  Montecito  Broadcasting  Corporation
("Montecito")  for  approximately  $33 million  (the  "Montecito  Acquisition").
Montecito owns all of the issued and outstanding stock of Channel 33, Inc. which
owns and  operates  KFBT-TV in Las Vegas,  Nevada.  Currently,  the Company is a
Guarantor of Montecito  Indebtedness of approximately  $33 million.  The Company
cannot acquire  Montecito  unless and until FCC rules permit Sinclair to own the
broadcast  license for more than one station in the Las Vegas market,  or unless
Sinclair no longer  owns the  broadcast  license  for KUPN-TV in Las Vegas.  The
Company will operate  KFBT-TV  through an LMA upon  expiration of the applicable
HSR Act waiting period.  The Company expects to be able to enter into the LMA in
the second quarter of 1998.

Sullivan Acquisition. In February 1998, the Company entered into an agreement to
acquire all of the capital stock of Sullivan Broadcast Holdings, Inc. ("Sullivan
Holdings")  and  Sullivan  Broadcasting  Company  II, Inc.  ("Sullivan  II" and,
together with Sullivan Holdings, "Sullivan") for a purchase price expected to be
approximately $950 million to $1 billion, less the amount of certain outstanding
indebtedness  of  Sullivan  Holdings  assumed  by  the  Company  (the  "Sullivan
Acquisition").  Upon the closing of all aspects of the Sullivan Acquisition, the
Company will own or provide  programming  services to 13  additional  television
stations in 11 separate  markets.  The final  purchase  price will be based on a
multiple  of  Sullivan's  projected  1998 cash flow  calculated  at the  initial
closing of the Sullivan  Acquisition.  As part of the total  consideration,  the
Company,  at its option,  may issue to the sellers up to $100 million of Class A
Common  Stock  based on an average  closing  price of the Class A Common  Stock.
Among other conditions,  the Sullivan  Acquisition is subject to approval by the
Federal  Communications  Commission  ("FCC") and  termination  of the applicable
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust  Improvements Act of 1976,
as amended  (the "HSR  Act").  An initial  closing,  at which the  Company  will
acquire  control of  operating  assets  (excluding  the License  Assets) of, and
acquire the right to program, the 13 television  stations,  is expected to occur
in the second  quarter of 1998.  A second  closing,  at which the  Company  will
acquire  control of the License  Assets of six of the  stations,  is expected to
occur in the third quarter of 1998.

Appraisal.  Entercom  shall prepare IRS Form 8594  reflecting the Aggregate Fair
Market Value as found by BIA and such other information as required by the form,
and shall forward it within 30 days after Closing to Sellers for their approval,
which  approval shall not be withheld  unreasonably.  Entercom and Sellers shall
each file with their  respective  federal  income tax return for the tax year in
which the Closing occurs,  IRS Form 8594 containing the information  agreed upon
by the parties  pursuant to the this Section 2.6.  Entercom agrees to report the
purchase  of the Assets  and each of  Sellers  agrees to report the sale of such
assets for income  tax  purposes  in a manner  consistent  with the  information
agreed upon by the parties pursuant to this Section 2.6 and contained in its IRS
Form 8594.  In the event either or both of the parties  elects to treat all or a
portion of the Assets transferred as part of a deferred like-kind exchange under
Section 1031 of the Code,  each party shall,  in  completing  any IRS Forms 8824
that the party might be  required  to file with the IRS,  reflect the values for
the Assets as  determined  pursuant to this Section  2.6. The parties  expressly
agree that Seventy Six Million Dollars ($76,000,000) of the Purchase Price shall
be allocated to the Portland  Stations,  and Fifty Million Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars  ($50,500,000) of the Purchase Price shall be allocated to the Rochester
Stations.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the provisions
of this Section 2.6 shall survive the Closing without limitation.

                  3.1.1.  The Liabilities  arising out of events occurring on or

                  3.1.3.  All  Liabilities  arising on or after the Closing Date
under  the  Station  Contracts   (including,   without   limitation,   Trade-out
Agreements)  pursuant to their terms  (except for  Liabilities  for any breaches
thereunder by Sellers or Heritage occurring prior to the Closing Date); and

                  3.1.4.  All  those  Liabilities  for  which,  and  only to the
extent,  that  Entercom  receives the benefit of a Proration  Item in accordance
with Section 8.2 hereof.

             3.2. OTHER  LIABILITIES.  Except for the Assumed  Liabilities or as
otherwise  expressly provided in the TBA, Entercom does not and shall not assume
any other Liabilities of any kind or description.

             3.3.  NON-ASSIGNABLE  STATION  CONTRACTS.

                  3.3.1. Sellers shall,  beginning immediately upon execution of
this  Agreement,  take all  reasonable  action  required to obtain all consents,
approvals and agreements of any third parties necessary to authorize, approve or
permit the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement,
including,  without  limitation,  any  consent  of the  parties  to the  Station
Contracts  designated as necessary in Schedule  2.1.8 in order to consummate the
transactions  contemplated hereby  (collectively,  the "Restricted  Contracts").
Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  or
otherwise,  to the extent  that the  consent or  approval  of any third party is
required  under any Restricted  Contract,  Sellers shall only be required to use
reasonable  efforts  (not  involving  the payment by Sellers of any money to any
party to any such Restricted Contract,  except to the extent required by Section
3.3.2) to obtain such consents and approvals, and in the event that Sellers fail
to  obtain  any  such  consent  or  approval,  Entercom  shall  have no right to
terminate this Agreement.

                  3.3.2.  Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary in Section
3.3.1, Sellers shall retain, until such time as any required consents shall have
been  obtained  by  Sellers,  all rights to and  obligations  under any  Station
Contract which requires the consent of any other party thereto for assignment to
Entercom  if such  consent  has not  been  obtained  on the  Closing  Date  (the
"Deferred Contract"). Until the assignment of the Deferred Contract, (i) Sellers
shall  continue to use all  commercially  reasonable  efforts and Entercom shall
cooperate  with  Sellers  to obtain  the  consent  and/or  to  remove  any other
impediments to such assignment, and (ii) Sellers and Entercom agree to cooperate
in any lawful  arrangement to provide (to the extent permitted without breach of
the Deferred Contract) that Entercom shall receive the benefits of such interest
after  the  Closing  Date to the same  extent as if it were  Sellers;  provided,
however,  (y) if Entercom  shall fail to receive such benefits after the Closing
Date for any leased property that is a main

Properties"),  Sellers agree to make such payments as are necessary for Entercom
to  receive  such  benefits  and/or  necessary  to  receive  such  consents  for
assignment as long as the aggregate  amount of all such payments does not exceed
Seventy Five Thousand Dollars ($75,000) for all such Designated Properties under
this Agreement and (z) Entercom shall, at its sole discretion,  not be obligated
to  perform  the  obligations  under  any  Deferred  Contract  if it is not also
receiving all of the benefits thereunder. If, subsequent to the Closing, Sellers
shall obtain any consent required to assign any Deferred Contract,  the Deferred
Contract  for which  consent to assign has been  obtained  shall at that time be
deemed to be conveyed, granted, bargained, sold, transferred, setover, assigned,
released, delivered and confirmed to Entercom, without need of further action by
Sellers or of future documentation.

                                   -----------

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
                         ------------------------------

             4.1. SELLERS' REPRESENTATIONS. Sellers hereby represent and warrant
to Entercom that:

                  4.1.1.  CORPORATE  STANDING.  Tuscaloosa,  SRPLI and SRRLI are
corporations,  duly organized,  validly  existing and in good standing under the
laws of the states of their respective organizations,  and are duly qualified to
do  business  and are in good  standing  in any  jurisdiction  where  it owns or
operates a radio station and in each other jurisdiction where such qualification
is  necessary,  except  for  those  jurisdictions  where  the  failure  to be so
qualified could not,  individually or in the aggregate,  have a material adverse
effect.

                  4.1.2.  AUTHORIZATION  OF  AGREEMENT;  NO BREACH.  Tuscaloosa,
SRPLI and SRRLI have the corporate  power and authority to execute,  deliver and
perform this Agreement and such other  agreements as are necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to the receipt of the consents and
approvals  required elsewhere herein,  this Agreement  constitutes the valid and
binding obligation of each of Tuscaloosa,  SRPLI and SRRLI,  enforceable against
each in accordance with its terms,  except as such enforceability may be limited
by bankruptcy and laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'  rights generally
or equitable principles.  Assuming the said consents and approvals are obtained,
neither such  execution,  delivery and performance nor compliance by each Seller
with the terms and provisions hereof will conflict with or result in a breach of
any of the terms,  conditions or provisions of the  organizational  documents of
such entities or any judgment,  order, injunction,  decree, regulation or ruling
of any court or any other governmental authority to which each is subject or any
material  agreement  or  contract  to which  each is a party or to which each is
subject, or constitute a material default thereunder.

                  4.1.3.  QUALIFICATIONS  AS ASSIGNOR.  Sellers know of no facts
which, under the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended,  or the existing rules
and regulations of the Commission,  would  disqualify  Heritage or Sellers as an
assignor of the FCC Licenses to be assigned by each under the Heritage Agreement
or hereunder, as applicable.

                                       13
<PAGE>

                  4.1.4.  ABSENCE  OF  CONFLICTING  ORDERS.  Neither  Seller  is
subject to any judgment, award, order, writ, injunction, arbitration decision or
decree  which  prohibits or prevents the  performance  of this  Agreement or the
consummation of any transaction  contemplated under this Agreement, and there is
no litigation,  administrative action, arbitration,  proceeding or investigation
pending, or to Sellers' Knowledge,  threatened,  against any Seller or affecting
any Seller in any  federal,  state or local  court or before any  administrative
agency or arbitrator  that would adversely  affect  Sellers'  ability to perform
their  obligations  under this Agreement or would hinder the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

                  4.1.5. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES.

                         4.1.5.1. Sellers have provided to Entercom an unaudited
balance sheet of the Stations as of November 30, 1997 (the "Balance  Sheet") and
an  unaudited  statement  of income and  operating  cash flows for the ten month

To Sellers'  Knowledge,  the  financial  statements  referred to in this Section
4.1.5.1 (a) present fairly in all material  respects the financial  condition of
its Stations as of the date and the results of  operations  and  operating  cash
flows for the period  indicated and (b) have been  prepared in  accordance  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles applied on a consistent basis (except
that the financial statements referred to in this Section 4.1.5.1 do not contain
all footnotes and cash flow information from investing and financing  activities
required  under  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  and are subject to
customary year-end adjustments).

                         4.1.5.2.   To  Sellers'   Knowledge,   there  exist  no
Liabilities  of the  Stations  relating  to, or arising out of, the  business or
operations of such Stations, contingent or absolute, matured or unmatured, known
or unknown, except (a) as reflected on the Balance Sheet and (b) for Liabilities
that (i) were  incurred  after  November 30, 1997 (the  "Current  Balance  Sheet
Date") in the  Ordinary  Course of  Business,  or (ii) were not  required  to be
reflected on the Balance Sheet in accordance with generally accepted  accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis.

                  4.1.6.  ABSENCE  OF CERTAIN  CHANGES OR EVENTS.  Except as set
forth and  described in Schedule  4.1.6,  (i) to Sellers'  Knowledge,  after the
Current  Balance  Sheet Date  through the date hereof there has been no, (ii) to
Sellers'  Knowledge,  from the date hereof through the Heritage  Agreement there

(b) incurred,  or become subject to, any Liability,  except current  Liabilities
incurred in the Ordinary  Course of Business;  (c)  discharged  or satisfied any

Liabilities incurred since the Current Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course
of Business and Liabilities (including, without limitation, partial and complete
prepayments) arising under any credit or loan agreement between such parties and
their lenders; (d) mortgaged, pledged or subjected to any Encumbrance any of the
Assets (except for Permitted Encumbrances);  (e) made any material change in any
method of accounting  or  accounting  practice;  (f) sold,  leased,  assigned or
otherwise  transferred  any of the material  Assets other than  obsolete  Assets
which  have  been  replaced  by  suitable  replacements;  (g) made any  material
increase in compensation  or benefits  payable to any employee other than in the
Ordinary  Course  of  Business;  or  (h)  made  any  agreement  to do any of the
foregoing.

                  4.1.7. ABSENCE OF LITIGATION.  Except as set forth on Schedule
4.1.7,  as of the date hereof,  there is no material or, to Sellers'  Knowledge,
immaterial,  action,  suit,  investigation,  claim,  arbitration,  litigation or
similar  proceeding,  nor any order,  decree or judgment pending or, to Sellers'
Knowledge,  threatened,  against Sinclair,  Sellers,  the Assets or the Stations
before any governmental authority.

                  4.1.8.  ASSETS.  Except for the  Excluded  Assets,  the Assets
include all of the assets or property  used or useful in the  businesses  of the
Stations as presently  operated.  Except for leased or licensed  Assets,  at and
after the Heritage  Agreement  Closing Date,  Sellers or one of them will be the
owners  of,  and will  have  good  title to,  the  Assets  free and clear of any
Encumbrances,  except for Permitted Encumbrances (including, without limitation,
those items set forth on Schedule 4.1.8). At the Closing, Entercom shall acquire
good title to, and all right, title and interest in and to the Assets,  free and
clear of all Encumbrances, except for the Permitted Encumbrances.

                  4.1.9.  FCC  MATTERS.  At and  after  the  Heritage  Agreement
Closing Date,  Sellers or one of them will hold the FCC Licenses  listed as held
on Schedule 2.1.1. Such FCC Licenses constitute all of the licenses, permits and
authorizations  from the Commission  which have been issued to Heritage that are
required for the business and operations of the Stations. Except as set forth on
Schedule 4.1.9, such FCC Licenses are valid and in full force and effect through
the dates set forth on Schedule 2.1.1,  unimpaired by any condition,  other than
as set forth in the FCC  Licenses.  Except as set forth on  Schedule  4.1.9,  no
application,  action or proceeding is pending for the renewal or modification of
any of the FCC Licenses and,  except for actions or proceedings  affecting radio
broadcast stations or the radio industry generally,  no application,  complaint,
action or proceeding is pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge,  threatened, that may
result in (a) the revocation, modification,  non-renewal or suspension of any of
such FCC Licenses, or (b) the issuance of a cease-and-desist  order. To Sellers'
Knowledge, except as set forth in Schedule 4.1.9, no facts, conditions or events
exist relating to Heritage,  Sellers,  or the Stations that would  reasonably be
expected to cause the  Commission  to revoke any FCC License or not to grant any
pending  applications  for renewal of the FCC Licenses or to deny the assignment
of the FCC Licenses to Entercom as provided for in this Agreement.

subleases  pursuant to which any of the Leased Property is leased.  At and after
the Heritage  Agreement  Closing Date,  Sellers or one of them will be the owner
and holder of all the Leased Property purported to be granted by such leases and
subleases. At and after the Heritage Agreement Closing Date, each such lease and

Property  or any  building,  structure,  fixture or  improvement  thereon is the
subject  of, or  affected  by,  any  condemnation,  eminent  domain  or  inverse

<PAGE>

any written notice to the effect that any service  rendered or to be rendered by
Heritage  or  any of  Sellers  relating  to the  business  of the  Stations  may
infringe,  or that such parties are otherwise  infringing,  on any  Intellectual
Property  right or other  legally  protectable  right of another.  No  director,
officer or employee of Heritage or Sellers has any interest in any  Intellectual
Property.

                  4.1.12. STATION CONTRACTS.  Complete and correct copies of the
Station Contracts set forth in Schedules 2.1.5, 2.1.6 and 2.1.8 (which schedules

result of the consummation of the transactions  contemplated  hereby,  except to
the extent that failure to obtain the prior consent to assignment thereof of any
party thereto  shall or could be  interpreted  to  constitute a  termination  or
modification  of or a  default  under  any  such  Station  Contract;  and (d) to
Sellers' Knowledge,  no other party to any such Station Contract is in breach or
default in any material respect of the terms thereunder.

                  4.1.13.  TAXES.  Each  Seller has (or,  in the case of returns

prior to the Closing  Date) duly filed all material  tax returns  required to be
filed  on or  before  the  Closing  Date  with  respect  to all  material  taxes
applicable to the ownership or operation of the Stations by Sellers. In the case
of any tax returns which receive an extension for their date of filing, such tax
returns  will be  considered  due on, and not  considered  required  to be filed
before, the extended due date. To Sellers'  Knowledge,  all tax returns are (or,
in the case of returns  becoming  due after the date hereof and on or before the
Closing Date, will be) true and complete in all material respects.  Sellers: (a)
have paid all taxes due to any  governmental  authority  as indicated on the tax
returns applicable to the ownership or operation of the Stations by Sellers;  or

                         4.1.14.2.  Schedule  4.1.14  sets  forth  a list of all
Qualified  Plans  maintained  or  contributed  to by  Sellers,  and to  Sellers'
Knowledge, all Qualified Plans maintained or contributed to by Heritage, in each
case, for the benefit of the employees of the Stations. All such Qualified Plans
and any related  trust  agreements or annuity  agreements  (or any other funding
document) have been  maintained in material  compliance  with ERISA and the Code
(including, without limitation, the requirements for tax qualification described
in  Section  401  thereof),  other  than any  Multiemployer  Plan.  To  Sellers'
Knowledge,  any trusts  established  under such  Plans are exempt  from  federal
income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code.

                         4.1.14.3.  Schedule  4.1.14  sets  forth  a list of all
funded Welfare Plans  maintained or  contributed to by Sellers,  and to Sellers'
Knowledge, all funded Welfare Plans maintained or contributed to by Heritage, in
each case, that provide  benefits to current or former employees of the Stations
or their  beneficiaries.  To Sellers' Knowledge,  the funding under each Welfare
Plan does not exceed and has not exceeded the limitations under Sections 419A(b)
and  419A(c) of the Code.  At and after the  Heritage  Agreement  Closing  Date,
Sellers  will not be, and to Sellers'  Knowledge,  Heritage  is not,  subject to
taxation on the income of any Welfare Plan's welfare  benefit fund (as such term
is defined in Section  419(e) of the Code)  under  Section  419A(g) of the Code,
which Welfare Plan has been maintained or contributed to by any such party.

                         4.1.14.4.  Sellers have no, and to Sellers'  Knowledge,
Heritage  has no,  post-retirement  medical  life  insurance  or other  benefits
promised,  provided or otherwise due now or in the future to current,  former or
retired employees of the Stations.

                         4.1.14.5.  Except as set forth in Schedule  4.1.14,  at
and after the  Heritage  Agreement  Closing  Date,  Sellers  will  have,  and to
Sellers' Knowledge, Heritage has (a) filed or caused to be filed all returns and
reports on the Plans that each such  party is  required  to file and (b) paid or
made  adequate  provision  for all fees,  interest,  penalties,  assessments  or
deficiencies  that have  become  due  pursuant  to those  returns  or reports or
pursuant to any  assessment or  adjustment  that has been made relating to those
returns or reports. All other fees, interest, penalties and assessments that are
payable by or for  Heritage  and Sellers  have been or will be timely  reported,
fully paid and discharged. There will be no unpaid fees, penalties,  interest or
assessments  due from Sellers,  and to Sellers'  Knowledge,  there are no unpaid
fees,  penalties,  interest or  assessments  due from Heritage or from any other
person,  in each case,  that are or could  become an  Encumbrance  on any of its
Assets or could otherwise  adversely  affect the businesses or operations of the
Stations  or the  Assets.  At and after the  Heritage  Agreement  Closing  Date,
Sellers or one of them will  have,  and to  Sellers'  Knowledge,  Heritage  has,
collected  or withheld all amounts that are required to be collected or withheld
by each such party to discharge its  obligations,  and all of those amounts have
been paid to the appropriate  governmental authority or set aside in appropriate
accounts for future  payment when due.  Sellers have  furnished to Entercom true
and complete copies of all documents setting forth the terms and funding of each
Plan.

                         4.1.14.6.  Except as set forth in Schedule  4.1.14,  at
and after the  Heritage  Agreement  Closing  Date,  none of Sellers or any ERISA
Affiliate of such parties will 


                                       18

have,  and none of  Heritage  or any  ERISA  Affiliate  of  Heritage  has  ever,
sponsored or maintained,  had any obligation to sponsor or maintain,  or had any
liability  (whether  actual or contingent,  with respect to any of its assets or
otherwise)  with  respect to any Plan subject to Section 302 of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA (including any Multiemployer  Plan). At and
after  the  Heritage  Agreement  Closing  Date,  none of  Sellers  or any  ERISA
Affiliate of such parties will have, and none of Heritage or any ERISA Affiliate
of Heritage (since January 1, 1989) has,  terminated or withdrawn from or sought
a funding  waiver with respect to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA,  and no
facts  exist that could  reasonably  be  expected  to cause such  actions in the
future;  no  accumulated  funding  deficiency  (as defined in Code Section 412),
whether or not waived, exists with respect to any such plan; no reportable event
(as defined in ERISA  Section  4043) has occurred  with respect to any such plan
(other than events for which  reporting is waived);  all costs of any such plans
have been  provided for on the basis of consistent  methods in  accordance  with
sound actuarial assumptions and practices,  and the assets of each such plan, as
of its last valuation date,  exceeded its "Benefits  Liabilities" (as defined in
ERISA Section  4001(a)(16));  and,  since the last  valuation date for each such
plan,  no such plan has been  amended  or  changed to  increase  the  amounts of
benefits  thereunder  and, to Sellers'  Knowledge,  there has been no event that
would  reduce the excess of assets over benefit  liabilities;  and except as set
forth in Schedule 4.1.14, at and after the Heritage Agreement Closing Date, none
of  Sellers  or any ERISA  Affiliate  of such  parties  will  have,  and none of
Heritage or any ERISA  Affiliate of Heritage has ever, made or been obligated to
make,  or  reimbursed  or been  obligated to  reimburse  another  employer  for,
contributions to any Multiemployer Plan.

                         4.1.14.7.  No claims or  lawsuits  are  pending  or, to
Sellers' Knowledge, threatened, by, against, or relating to any Benefit Plan. To
Sellers'  Knowledge,  the  Benefit  Plans  are  not  presently  under  audit  or
examination  (nor has notice been received of a potential  audit or examination)
by the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  the  Department  of  Labor,  or  any  other
governmental  agency or entity and no matters  are pending  with  respect to any
Qualified  Plan  under  the  Internal  Revenue  Service's  Voluntary  Compliance
Resolution program, its Closing Agreement Program, or other similar programs.

                         4.1.14.8.  To Sellers' Knowledge,  with respect to each
Plan,  there has occurred no  non-exempt  "prohibited  transaction"  (within the
meaning of Section 4975 of the Code) or transaction prohibited by Section 406 of
ERISA or breach of any  fiduciary  duty  described  in Section 404 of ERISA that
would, if successful,  result in any liability for Sellers. Sellers will take no
action  that would  result in such a  liability  between the date hereof and the
Closing Date.

                         4.1.14.9.  At and after the Heritage  Agreement Closing
Date, Sellers will have no liability, and to Sellers' Knowledge, Heritage has no
liability  (whether  actual,  contingent,  with  respect to any of the Assets or
otherwise) with respect to any employee  benefit plan that is not a Benefit Plan
(exclusive of severance  arrangements and retention  agreements) or with respect
to any employee  benefit  plan  sponsored  or  maintained  (or which has been or
should  have  been  sponsored  or  maintained)  by any ERISA  Affiliate  of such
parties.

been, and all group health plans of Heritage and its ERISA Affiliates have been,

understandings  pursuant to which  Heritage  has,  or at and after the  Heritage
Agreement  Closing  Date,  pursuant  to  which  Sellers  will  have,   severance
obligations  related  to  employees  at the  Stations.  Except  as set  forth on
Schedule 4.1.15,  no labor union or other collective  bargaining unit represents
or, to Sellers'  Knowledge,  claims to  represent,  any of the  employees of the
Station.  Except as set forth in Schedule  4.1.15,  there are no  strikes,  work
stoppages,   grievance   proceedings,   union  organization  efforts,  or  other
controversies  pending between Heritage or Sellers,  and any union or collective
bargaining unit representing (or, to Sellers' Knowledge,  claiming to represent)
the employees at the Stations. At and after the Heritage Agreement Closing Date,
Sellers will be, and Heritage is, in  compliance  with all laws  relating to the
employment or the workplace, including, without limitation,  provisions relating
to wages, hours,  collective bargaining,  safety and health, work authorization,
equal employment  opportunity,  immigration and the withholding of income taxes,
unemployment compensation,  worker's compensation, employee privacy and right to
know and social security contributions, except for any noncompliance which would

                  4.1.16. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

                         4.1.16.1.  Except as set forth in Schedule  4.1.16,  to

Sellers  will be, in material  compliance  with,  and the Real  Property and all

                         4.1.16.2. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.1.16, there
are no pending or, to Sellers' Knowledge, threatened, actions, suits, claims, or
other legal  proceedings based on (and none of Sellers have received any written
notice of any complaint,  order, directive,  citation, notice of responsibility,
notice of potential responsibility, or information request from any governmental
authority  arising out of or attributable  to): (a) the current or past presence
at any part of the Real Property of Hazardous Materials; (b) the current or past
release  or  threatened


                                       20

release  into  the  environment  from  the  Real  Property  (including,  without
limitation,  into any  storm  drain,  sewer,  septic  system or  publicly  owned
treatment  works) of any  Hazardous  Materials;  (c) the  off-site  disposal  of
Hazardous  Materials  originating on or from the Real Property or the businesses
or Assets of the  Stations;  (d) any facility  operations  or  procedures of the
Stations since Heritage's ownership thereof which do not conform to requirements
of the  Environmental  Laws; or (e) any violation of  Environmental  Laws at any
part  of the  Real  Property  arising  from  activities  of the  Stations  since
Heritage's  ownership thereof involving  Hazardous  Materials.  At and after the
Heritage  Agreement  Closing  Date,  Sellers  will have  been,  and to  Sellers'
Knowledge,  Heritage  has been,  duly  issued all  material  permits,  licenses,
certificates and approvals required under any Environmental Law.

                  4.1.17.  INSURANCE.   Schedule  4.1.17  contains  a  true  and
complete  list and brief  summary  of all  policies  of title,  property,  fire,
casualty, liability, life, workmen's compensation,  libel and slander, and other
forms of  insurance  of any kind  relating  to the  Assets or the  business  and
operations of the Stations. To Sellers' Knowledge, all such policies: (a) are in
full  force and  effect;  (b) are  sufficient  for  compliance  in all  material
respects by Heritage with all requirements of law and of all material agreements
to which Heritage is a party;  and (c) are valid,  outstanding,  and enforceable
policies  and  Heritage is not in default in any  material  respect  thereunder.
Between  the  Heritage  Agreement  Closing  Date  and the  Closing  Date of this
Agreement,  Sellers will carry insurance  relating to the Assets or the business
and operations of the Stations such that this Section 4.1.17 would be true after
substituting  "Sellers" for "Heritage" in each  instance.  All such insurance of
Sellers  shall  provide  for full  replacement  cost  coverage  of any  tangible
property that is lost or damaged due to an insured event or cause.

                  4.1.18. REPORTS. All material returns,  reports and statements
that  the  Station  will  be  required  to  file  with  the  Commission  or  any

all  material  returns,  reports  and  statements  that the  Stations  have been
required to file with the Commission or any governmental agency through the date
of  this  Agreement,  have  been  or will be  timely  filed,  and all  reporting
requirements  of  the  Commission  and  other  governmental  authorities  having
jurisdiction  thereof  have been or will be  complied  with by Sellers  and,  to
Sellers'  Knowledge,  by Heritage,  in each case, in all material respects.  All
such reports,  returns and  statements to be filed after the date hereof will be
complete  and  correct  in all  material  respects  as filed  and,  to  Sellers'
Knowledge, all such reports, returns and statements that have been filed through
the date of this Agreement,  are complete and correct in all material reports as
filed. At and after the Heritage  Agreement Closing Date all documents  required
by the Commission to be deposited by Sellers.  and, to Sellers'  Knowledge,  all
documents  required by the  Commission  to be  deposited  by Heritage  since the
period of operation of the  Stations by  Heritage,  in each case,  in the public
file of the Stations (as defined in the rules and regulations of the Commission)
have been or will be deposited therein.

                  4.1.19.  HERITAGE  AGREEMENT.  Except as set forth on Schedule
4.1.19,  Sinclair and its  affiliates  have not waived any of their rights under
the  Heritage  Agreement  related to the  Stations.  Sinclair  is unaware of any
material  breach  or  misrepresentation  by  Heritage  or News  Corp.  under the
Heritage Agreement. Sinclair is not in material breach of, and has not defaulted
under, any of the terms of the Heritage Agreement


                                       21
<PAGE>

(unless  waived or consented to in writing by Heritage and described on Schedule
4.1.19). The Heritage Agreement  constitutes the valid and binding obligation of
Sinclair, enforceable against Sinclair and, by assignments,  against Sellers, in
accordance  with its  terms,  except as such  enforceability  may be  limited by
bankruptcy and laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'  rights generally or
equitable principles.  Sinclair is not, and, to Seller's Knowledge, Heritage and
News Corp. are not, subject to any judgment,  award,  order,  writ,  injunction,
arbitration  decision or decree which  prohibits the performance of the Heritage
Agreement or the consummation of any transaction contemplated under the Heritage
Agreement,  and, except as disclosed on Schedule 4.1.19, there is no litigation,
administrative action,  arbitration,  proceeding or investigation pending or, to
Sellers'  Knowledge,  threatened,  against  Heritage,  News  Corp.,  Sinclair or
Sellers or  affecting  such parties in any  federal,  state or local  court,  or
before any  administrative  agency or arbitrator that would adversely affect the
ability of Sinclair,  Sellers,  Heritage or News Corp.  to  consummate,  or that
would  prohibit,  the  transactions  contemplated  under the Heritage  Agreement
related to the Stations.

                  4.1.20. INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. Sellers have not
relied and are not  relying  on the  specification  of any dollar  amount in any
representation  or warranty  made in this  Agreement or any  Schedule  hereto to
indicate that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material,
and agree not to assert in any dispute or controversy between the parties hereto
that specification of such amounts indicates or is evidence as to whether or not
any  obligation,  item or  matter is or is not  material  for  purposes  of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

             4.2. ENTERCOM'S  REPRESENTATIONS.  Entercom represents and warrants
to Sellers that:

                  4.2.1.  CORPORATE  STANDING.  Entercom is a  corporation  duly
organized,  validly  existing  and  in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the
Commonwealth  of  Pennsylvania,  and at the Closing Date will have the corporate
power and authority to conduct its business as proposed to be conducted and upon
the  acquisition  of the Assets  will be duly  qualified  to do  business in any
jurisdiction  where it owns  and  operates  a radio  station  and in each  other
jurisdiction   where  such   qualification   is  necessary,   except  for  those
jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified could not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a material adverse effect.

                  4.2.2. AUTHORIZATION OF AGREEMENT: NO BREACH. Entercom has the
corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform this Agreement and
such  other   agreements  as  are  necessary  to  consummate  the   transactions
contemplated  hereby.  Subject to the  receipt  of the  consents  and  approvals
required  elsewhere  herein,  this Agreement  constitutes  the valid and binding
obligation of Entercom,  enforceable  against  Entercom in  accordance  with its
terms,  except as such  enforceability  may be  limited by  bankruptcy  and laws
affecting  the   enforcement  of  creditors'   rights   generally  or  equitable
principles.  Assuming the said consents and approvals are obtained, neither such
execution,  delivery and  performance  nor compliance by Entercom with the terms
and  provisions  hereof will  conflict  with or result in a breach of any of the
terms,  conditions or provisions of the organizational  documents of Entercom

                                       22
<PAGE>

or any judgment, order, injunction, decree, regulation or ruling of any court or
any other  governmental  authority to which  Entercom is subject or any material
agreement or contract to which Entercom is a party or to which it is subject, or
constitute a material default thereunder.

                  4.2.3.  QUALIFICATION  AS  ASSIGNEE.  Except as  disclosed  in
Schedule  4.2.3,  Entercom  is,  and  pending  Closing  will  remain,   legally,
financially  and otherwise  qualified under the  Communications  Act of 1934, as
amended (the  "Communications  Act") and all rules,  regulations and policies of
the  Commission  to acquire and operate the  Stations.  Except as  disclosed  in
Schedule  4.2.3,  there are no facts or  proceedings  which would  reasonably be
expected to disqualify  Entercom under the  Communications Act or otherwise from
acquiring or operating any of the Stations or would cause the  Commission not to
approve the  assignment of the FCC Licenses to Entercom.  Except as disclosed in
Schedule 4.2.3,  Entercom has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance  relating
to Entercom or any of Entercom's Affiliates that would reasonably be expected to
(a) cause the filing of any  objection to the  assignment of the FCC Licenses to
Entercom,  (b)  lead to a  delay  in the  processing  by the  Commission  of the
applications  for  such  assignment  or (c)  lead  to a  material  delay  in the
processing  by the  Commission  of the  renewals  of the  FCC  Licenses  for the
Portland  Stations or the  Rochester  Stations.  Except as disclosed in Schedule
4.2.3,  no waiver of any  Commission  rule or policy is necessary to be obtained
for the grant of the  applications  for the  assignment  of the FCC  Licenses to
Entercom,  nor will  processing  pursuant  to any  exception  or rule of general
applicability  be requested or required in connection  with the  consummation of
the transactions herein.

                  4.2.4. ABSENCE OF CONFLICTING ORDERS.  Entercom is not subject
to any judgment, award, order, writ, injunction,  arbitration decision or decree
which  prohibits the  performance of this Agreement or the  consummation  of any
transaction  contemplated  under  this  Agreement,  and there is no  litigation,
administrative action,  arbitration,  proceeding or investigating pending, or to
the knowledge of Entercom, threatened, against Entercom or affecting Entercom in
any  federal,  state or local  court,  or before  any  administrative  agency or
arbitrator  that would  adversely  affect  Entercom's  ability  to  perform  its
obligations  under  this  Agreement  or would  hinder  the  consummation  of the
transactions contemplated hereunder.

                  4.2.5.  AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS. Entercom will have available on
the Closing Date  sufficient  funds to enable it to consummate the  transactions
contemplated hereby.

                  4.2.6.  WARN ACT.  Entercom is not planning or  contemplating,
and has not made or taken, any decisions or actions  concerning the employees of
the  Stations  after the Closing  Date that would  require the service of notice
under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988, as amended.

                  4.2.7. NO OUTSIDE RELIANCE. Entercom has not relied and is not
relying on any statement, representation or warranty not made in this Agreement,
any  Schedule  hereto or any  certificate  to be  delivered  to  Entercom at the
Closing  pursuant to this Agreement.  Entercom is not relying on any projections
or other  predictions  contained  or  referred to in


                                       23
<PAGE>


materials (other than the Schedules) that have been or may hereafter be provided
to Entercom or any of its  Affiliates,  agents or  representatives,  and Sellers
make no  representations  or warranties with respect to any such  projections or
other predictions.

                  4.2.8. INTERPRETATION OF CONCERN PROVISIONS.  Entercom has not
relied and is not  relying  on the  specifications  of any dollar  amount in any
representation  or warranty  made in this  Agreement or any  Schedule  hereto to
indicate that such amounts, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material,
and  agrees not to assert in any  dispute or  controversy  between  the  parties
hereto that specification of such amounts indicates or is evidence as to whether
or not any obligation, item or matter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

objection  or petition to deny has been filed  against the  Applications  and if

becoming a Final Order,  then the condition set forth in this Section 5.1.2 will
be deemed to be satisfied upon the consent and approval of the Commission; and

to the transfer of the Assets under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements

terminated.

                  5.1.4. No statute,  rule or regulation,  or order of any court

and as of such date except to the extent that they speak as of a particular date

warranties  shall be true and correct as of such date or time);  provided,  that
the failure of such representations and warranties to be true and correct at and

hereunder if such failures involve costs,  damages and/or expenditures in excess
of $1,265,000 (as determined by a qualified independent third party),  provided,
further,  that if such amount is less than  $1,265,000  but more than  $150,000,

                            COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS.
                            -------------------------

             6.1. AFFIRMATIVE  COVENANTS OF SELLERS.  During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, Sellers shall:

                  6.1.1.  Should  Sellers  acquire  any  Station or operate  any
Station  prior  to the  sale  of  such  Station  to  Entercom  pursuant  to this
Agreement,  Sellers shall conduct the business and operations of such Station at
least in accordance  with the provisions of Sections 6.1.1 through and including

Agreement.

                  6.1.2.  Subject to the  provisions of the TBA,  cooperate with
Entercom in connection  with its review,  analysis and  monitoring of the Assets
and the operations of the Stations to the end that an efficient  transfer of the
Assets may be made at Closing and the  business of the  Stations may continue on
an uninterrupted  basis. Sellers or one of them shall obtain Entercom's consent,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,  prior to the exercise of Sellers'
or any of their rights under the  Heritage  Agreement as such rights  pertain to
the Stations (other than the right to consummate the acquisition of the Stations
upon  satisfaction  of  all  conditions  thereto).   In  addition  to  providing
information  required  hereunder or  reasonably  requested by the other  parties
hereto,  Sellers agree promptly to notify  Entercom of any material  problems or
developments of which any Seller becomes aware with respect to any of the Assets
or the business of any of the Stations.

                  6.1.3.  Use their reasonable best efforts to cause Heritage to
prosecute, or to prosecute with the Commission,  the applications for renewal of
the FCC Licenses for the Portland Stations and the Rochester Stations, such that
the applications are granted without any material adverse  condition and, to the
extent reasonably  possible,  on or prior to the date for expiration of such FCC
Licenses.

                  6.1.4.  Use  reasonable  best  efforts to  enforce  all of its

Stations in the Ordinary  Course of Business in accordance with the terms of the
Heritage  Agreement,  except where such would not have a material adverse effect
on the business and  operations  of any Station,  and, to the extent  consistent
with the foregoing,  in the same manner in which the same have  heretofore  been
conducted with the intent of preserving  the ongoing  operations and business of
the Stations.

                  6.1.5.   Use  their  reasonable  best  efforts  to  close  the
transactions  contemplated  by the  Heritage  Agreement  as they  pertain to the

                  6.1.6.   To  the  extent  that  Sinclair  or  Sellers  receive
notifications  from  Heritage  with respect to the  Stations  under the Heritage
Agreement  or  otherwise  becomes  aware of any  breach  of any  representation,
warranty,  covenant or  agreement  in the  Heritage  Agreement or the failure to
satisfy  any  condition  in such  agreement,  in each case with  respect  to the
Stations,  Sellers shall promptly notify Entercom, and thereafter use reasonable
best  efforts  to  enforce,  perform  or waive  any  provision  of the  Heritage
Agreement pertaining to the Stations as may be reasonably requested by Entercom,
provided,  that Sellers  shall not be obligated to take any action at Entercom's
request  inconsistent  with their  rights  and  obligations  under the  Heritage
Agreement.

                  6.1.7. To the extent  permitted under the Heritage  Agreement,
at Closing  Sellers  will assign any and all rights with respect to the Stations
that it may have against Heritage, News Corp., and their respective subsidiaries
to Entercom. Entercom acknowledges that the assignment of such rights by Sellers
requires the prior  written  consent of  Heritage,  which  consent  Heritage may
withhold  in its  sole  discretion.  In this  regard,  Sellers  will  use  their
reasonable  efforts (without  obligation to spend any amount of money) to obtain
any consent of Heritage or News Corp. required to assign such rights to Entercom
prior to the Closing  Date.  The failure of Sellers to obtain such consent shall
not limit Entercom's  obligation to close if all other  conditions  precedent to
Entercom's  obligations  have been satisfied or waived;  however,  in such case,
Sellers shall fully  enforce  their rights which relate to the Stations  against
Heritage and News Corp. under the Heritage Agreement at Entercom's request,  and
this  covenant  shall  survive the Closing for the period that  Sinclair has any
rights under the Heritage  Agreement.  Any proceeds received by Sellers from the
exercise of their rights which relate to the Stations  against Heritage and News
Corp. and their  respective  subsidiaries  shall be paid over to Entercom within
five (5)  business  days of receipt by Sellers,  less any  reasonable  costs and
expenses of enforcement incurred by Sellers in such exercise.

                  6.1.8.  At all times,  maintain  strict  confidentiality  with
respect to all documents and information furnished to Sellers by or on behalf of
Entercom.  Nothing shall be deemed to be confidential  information  that: (a) is
known to Sellers at the time of its disclosure to Sellers;  (b) becomes publicly
known or available other than through disclosure by Sellers;  (c) is received by
Sellers  from a third  party  not  actually  known by  Sellers  to be bound by a
confidentiality   agreement   with  or  obligation   to  Entercom;   or  (d)  is
independently developed by Sellers.  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 6.1.8,  Sellers may disclose such  confidential  information (a) to
the extent required or deemed  advisable to comply with applicable  laws; (b) to
its  officers,  directors,  employees,   representatives,   financial  advisors,
attorneys, accountants, and agents with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby (so long as such parties  agree to maintain the  confidentiality  of such
information);  and (c) to any  governmental  authority  in  connection  with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby.  In the event this  Agreement is terminated,
Sellers will return to Entercom all  documents  and other  material  prepared or
furnished  by Entercom  relating  to the  transactions  contemplated  hereunder,
whether obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement.

In the event this Agreement is  terminated,  Entercom will return to Sellers all

limitation,  all  shareholder  action),  under  the  laws  of any  state  having

responsible  for  coordinating  all  such  requests  and  all  access  permitted

during the  period  during  which the  Stations  were  owned by Sellers  without
consulting  with  Sellers  prior to disposal  thereof and taking any  reasonable
action  requested by Sellers  with respect to retention  and transfer to Sellers
thereof.

only be  satisfied  at the  Closing);  and (b) the  expiration  of any period of
extension for Closing provided  elsewhere in this Agreement.  If such date falls

to the terms and  conditions of Section  8.2.2,  at least five (5) days prior to
the Closing Date,  Sellers shall make a good faith estimate of the adjustment to
the  Purchase  Price  customary  in radio  broadcast  station  transactions  for
Proration Items (the "Proration  Amount") to reflect that all Proration Items of
all Stations  shall be  apportioned  between  Entercom and Sellers in accordance
with the  principle  that  Sellers  shall  receive the benefit of all  revenues,
refunds,  deposits  (other than  deposits for Program  Contracts  which shall be
prorated  based on the percentage of the term that the program was aired on such
Stations before the Closing Date and the percentage available to be aired on and
after the Closing Date) and prepaid  expenses,  and shall be responsible for all
expenses,  costs and  liabilities  allocable to the conduct of the businesses or
operations  of such  Stations  for the period  prior to the  Closing  Date,  and

prepaid  expenses,  and  shall  be  responsible  for  all  expenses,  costs  and
liabilities  allocable to the conduct of the  businesses  or  operations of such
Stations from and after the Closing Date; provided, however, that there shall be
no adjustment or proration for any negative or positive net trade balance except
to the extent  that the  negative  net trade  balance for the  Stations  exceeds
$50,000.  Determinations  pursuant  to  this  Section  8.2.1,  shall  be made in
accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles  consistently  applied
for the period prior to the Closing Date.

                  8.2.2.  Within  ninety  (90)  days  after  the  Closing  Date,
Entercom  shall  deliver to Sellers in writing and in  reasonable  detail a good
faith final  determination of the Proration Amount  determined as of the Closing
Date under Section 8.2.1 (the "Final  Proration  Amount").  Sellers shall assist
Entercom in making such  determination,  and Entercom shall provide Sellers with
reasonable access to the properties,  books and records relating to the Stations
for the purpose of determining  the Final Proration  Amount.  Sellers shall have
the right to review the  computations  and  workpapers  used in connection  with
Entercom's  preparation of the Final Proration  Amount. If Sellers disagree with
the amount of the Final Proration Amount  determined by Entercom,  Sellers shall
so notify  Entercom in writing within thirty (30) days after the date of receipt
of  Entercom's  Final  Proration  Amount,  specifying  in  detail  any  point of
disagreement;  provided  however,  that if Sellers  fail to notify  Entercom  in
writing of Sellers' disagreement within such thirty (30) day period,  Entercom's
determination  of the Final  Proration  Amount  shall be final,  conclusive  and
binding  on  Sellers  and   Entercom.   After  the  receipt  of  any  notice  of
disagreement,  Entercom and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreements  regarding the Final Proration  Amount.  If any such  disagreement
cannot be  resolved  by  Sellers  and  Entercom  within  thirty  (30) days after
Entercom has received notice from Sellers of the existence of such disagreement,
Entercom and Sellers shall jointly  select a nationally  recognized  independent
public  accounting firm (which has not performed any service for either Entercom
or Sellers or any of their respective subsidiaries at anytime during the two (2)
year period prior to the date such firm is selected (the "Accounting Firm")), to
review Entercom's  determination of the Final Proration Amount and to resolve as
soon  as  possible   all  points  of   disagreement   raised  by  Sellers.   All
determinations  made by the Accounting  Firm with respect to the Final Proration
Amount shall be final,  conclusive and binding on Entercom and Sellers. The fees
and  expenses  of the  Accounting  Firm  incurred  in  connection  with any such
determination shall be shared one-half by Entercom and one-half by Sellers.

                         Upon  determination of the Final Proration Amount,  the
appropriate  party owing any prorations  shall pay such amounts in cash,  within
two (2) business days following the final  determination  of the Final Proration
Amount.  Any  amounts  paid  pursuant  to this  Section  8.2.2  shall be by wire
transfer of  immediately  available  funds for credit to the recipient at a bank
account identified by such recipient in writing.

                         Entercom  and  Sellers  agree that prior to the date of
the final  determination  of the Final Proration Amount pursuant to this Section
8.2.2 (by the  Accounting  Firm or  otherwise),  neither  party will destroy any
records  pertaining to, or necessary for, the final  determination  of the Final
Proration Amount.

deliver to Sellers  the  Purchase  Price as set forth in Section  2.5  allocated
between  Sellers as Sellers  shall  direct and deliver the  following  items and
documents  in form  satisfactory  to counsel for Sellers and  properly  executed
unless each Seller  waives in whole or part in writing a delivery  and then only
to the extent of such waiver:

                  8.4.1.  One or more Agreements  whereby  Entercom  assumes and
agrees to pay when due any Liabilities of each Seller  specifically  required to
be assumed by Entercom  hereunder,  substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit E.

                  8.4.2.  Certified  copies of the  resolutions  of the Board of
Directors  of  Entercom   approving  and  ratifying   this   Agreement  and  all
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

                  8.4.3.  A  certificate  signed  by the  President  or any Vice
President  of Entercom to the effect that with respect to any matter which would
prevent Entercom from  consummating the Closing,  no act or omission of Entercom
or state of facts  contrary to the  agreements,  representations  and warranties
made  herein  by  Entercom  has  been  taken  or  has  occurred  and  that  said
representations  and  warranties  are true and  correct at and as of the Closing
Date in all material  respects as if made on and as of Closing  Date,  except to
the extent that said  representations  and  warranties  speak as of a particular
date or time other than the Closing Date (in which case such representations and
warranties shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such date or
time).

                  8.4.4.  An opinion  of John C.  Donlevie,  General  Counsel to
Entercom, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit H.

             8.5.  COVENANTS  OF  FURTHER  ASSURANCE.  At and  after the time of
Closing,  upon  request of Entercom or Sellers,  as the case may be, the parties
shall take such  reasonable  action and deliver to the party so requesting  such
further instruments of assignment,


                                       34
<PAGE>

conveyance or transfer or other documents of further assurance as in the opinion
of counsel  for either  Sellers  or  Entercom  may be  reasonably  necessary  to
evidence the full and  effective  transfer,  conveyance  and  assignment  of the
Assets and possession thereof to Entercom.

             8.6.  DAMAGE TO  PROPERTY.  If, at the time of Closing,  any of the
real or tangible  personal  property  included in the Assets shall have suffered
loss or damage for which Entercom is not responsible  under the term of the TBA,
Sellers  shall use their  reasonable  efforts to repair,  replace or restore the
same prior to Closing. In the event that such repair, replacement or restoration
cannot be completed  prior to the date  scheduled for Closing,  then,  except as
provided  immediately  below,  Closing  shall occur and Sellers  shall assign to
Entercom their rights to all insurance proceeds relating to such loss or damage.
In the event such loss or damage is  uninsured  or so material as to prevent one
of the  Stations  (other  than  WBBF(AM))  from using its  studios or any of its
transmitter  facilities in the normal course,  consistent  with past  practices,
Closing shall be deferred  until the  completion of such repair,  replacement or
restoration by Sellers to the extent that the Station's or Stations' studios and
transmitter  facilities are again useable in the normal course,  consistent with
past practices,  and such delay shall not give rise to a right to terminate this
Agreement as provided in Section 9.1.4 hereof.

             8.7. TAXES ON TRANSACTION.  All sales,  purchase,  transfer, use or
documentary  taxes,  if any,  payable by reason of this  Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the sale, transfer or delivery of any of the
Assets to Entercom, whether or not imposed on Entercom or Sellers, shall be paid
one-half by Entercom and one-half by Sellers promptly when due. 

                                  ARTICLE IX.

                    TERMINATION, DEFAULT AND INDEMNIFICATION

             9.1.  TERMINATION BY REASON OTHER THAN DEFAULT.  This Agreement may
be terminated  by any party hereto not then in default  hereunder at the time of
such termination upon written notice to the other party if:

                  9.1.1. The Commission  denies or designates for hearing any of
the Applications or any portion thereof by Final Order; or

                  9.1.2.  Events  occur  which  give  rise to a  specific  right
hereunder to terminate this Agreement by the party seeking to terminate; or

                  9.1.3.  Other  than as a  result  of a  default  by the  party
seeking to terminate,  any material condition set forth herein to the obligation
of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to complete the transaction has
not been  satisfied or complied with by the Closing Date and has not been waived
by the party seeking to terminate; or

                  9.1.4. By either party,  subject to Section 8.6 hereof, if the
Commission does not grant its consent and approval to the  Applications  and the
waiting period  required under


                                       35
<PAGE>

the HSR Act has not  expired or been  terminated  by the date that is six months
after the date of this Agreement and the TBA has not commenced by such six-month
anniversary,  provided,  that if an issue has been raised before the Commission,
the DOJ or the FTC concerning either Sellers, or any of their  predecessors,  on
the one hand,  or  Entercom,  on the other hand,  and such issue has delayed the
consent and approval of the  Commission or the  expiration or termination of the
waiting period  contemplated  by the foregoing  clause,  then the party to which
such issue relates shall not be permitted to terminate the Agreement pursuant to
this  provision on such  six-month  anniversary  date.  If the TBA has commenced
within the  six-month  period set forth  above,  the period for  termination  by
either  party  pursuant to this Section  9.1.4 shall be one (1) year,  provided,
that on such one-year anniversary date, either party may, subject to Section 8.6
hereof,  terminate  this  Agreement  even if an issue has been raised before the
Commission  concerning  such party and such issue has  delayed  the  consent and
approval of the Commission.

             9.2.  EFFECT OF TERMINATION  BY REASON OTHER THAN DEFAULT.  If this
Agreement is duly  terminated  by either party as provided in Section 9.1,  then
the Letter of Credit shall be returned to Entercom and all obligations of either
party to the other  shall  cease  and both  parties  shall be fully and  finally
released herefrom.

             9.3. DEFAULT. The following shall constitute a default hereunder:

                  9.3.1. If any of the  representations or warranties of a party
contained herein is inaccurate or breached in any material respect; or

                  9.3.2. If any of the obligations to be performed  hereunder by
a party  hereto is not  performed  during  the  period or at or before  the time
specified herein for such performance.

             9.4.  REMEDIES OF SELLERS.

             In the  event of a  default  by  Entercom,  which is not  waived by
Sellers, Sellers shall have the following remedies:

                  9.4.1. Prior to Closing, Sellers may, as their sole remedy, by
written notice to Entercom  terminate this Agreement in which event Seller shall
be  entitled  to receive  the  proceeds  of the  Letter of Credit as  liquidated
damages in full and final  settlement  of all claims under this  Agreement,  and
there shall be no other or further  obligations,  liabilities or remedies of the
parties hereunder.

                  9.4.2. In the event Closing occurs hereunder,  Sellers' remedy
for any default by  Entercom  shall be  indemnification  pursuant to Section 9.7
hereof.

             9.5.  ENTERCOM'S  REMEDIES.  In the  event of a  default  by either
Seller  hereunder,  which is not  waived by  Entercom,  Entercom  shall have the
following remedies:


                                       36
<PAGE>

                  9.5.1. Prior to Closing,  subject to the provisions  regarding
failures of  representations  and warranties  contained in Section 5.2.2 hereof,
Entercom  may by written  notice to Sellers  terminate  this  Agreement in which
event Entercom shall be entitled to recover from Sellers, jointly and severally,
any damages  Entercom  sustained  as a result of the  default by such  breaching
Seller hereunder.

                  9.5.2.   Prior  to  Closing,   Entercom   may  seek   specific
performance  by  Sellers of  Sellers'  obligations  hereunder  and shall also be
entitled to any other remedy  available at law or in equity,  including  without
limitation  the  recovery of any damages  (including  attorneys  fees and costs)
incurred  by  Entercom  as a result of the  default by Sellers  hereunder.  Each
Seller covenants that under such circumstances it shall not assert in defense of
an action  seeking  specific  performance of this Agreement in favor of Entercom
that Entercom has available adequate remedies at Law.

                  9.5.3.  In the  event  Closing  occurs  hereunder,  Entercom's
remedy for any default by Sellers shall be  indemnification  pursuant to Section
9.7 hereof.

             9.6.  LIQUIDATED  DAMAGES  NOT  A  PENALTY.  With  respect  to  the
liquidated  damages as  described  and  provided  for in Section  9.4.1  hereof,
Sellers and Entercom  hereby  acknowledge  and agree that the damage that may be
suffered  by  Sellers  in the event of a default by  Entercom  hereunder  is not
readily ascertainable and that such liquidated damages as of the date hereof are
a reasonable estimate of such damages and are intended to compensate Sellers for
any such damage and are not to be construed as a penalty.

             9.7. INDEMNIFICATION.

                  9.7.1.  BY SELLERS.  Subject to Sections 9.7.4 and 10.3,  from
and after the Closing Date,  Sellers shall,  jointly and  severally,  indemnify,
defend and hold Entercom and its officers,  directors,  employees and affiliates
harmless  from,  against and with  respect to any and all loss,  damage,  claim,
obligation,  assessment,  cost,  liability,  and reasonable expense  (including,
without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in  investigating,  preparing,  defending  against or  prosecuting  any
litigation  or  claim,  action,  suit,  proceeding  or  demand)  of any  kind or
character (a "Loss") incurred, suffered, sustained or required to be paid by any
of them and resulting from, related to or arising out of:

                         (a) any breach of any of the covenants, representations
        or warranties  made by Sellers in or pursuant to this  Agreement,  or in
        any agreement,  document or instrument  executed and delivered  pursuant
        hereto or in connection with the Closing hereunder;

                         (b) any failure by Sellers to perform or observe, or to
        have  performed  or  observed,  in  full,  any  covenant,  agreement  or
        condition to be performed or observed by them pursuant to this Agreement
        or in any agreement, document or instrument executed and delivered by or
        on behalf of them in connection with the Closing hereunder;


                                       37
<PAGE>

                         (c) any and all  Liabilities  of  Sellers,  except  for
        Liabilities  to be assumed or retained  by  Entercom  under the terms of
        this Agreement; or

                         (d) Sellers' operation or ownership of the Assets prior
        to  the  Adjustment   Time,   including  any  and  all  obligations  and
        liabilities  arising  under the FCC  Licenses or the  Station  Contracts
        which accrue or relate to a period of time prior to the Adjustment Time;
        or

                  9.7.2. BY ENTERCOM. If Closing does not occur due to a default
by Entercom in its  obligation  to complete  such  Closing  hereunder,  Sellers'
remedy  shall be  liquidated  damages  pursuant to Section 9.4 hereof.  Provided
Closing occurs  hereunder,  subject to Section 10.3,  Entercom shall  indemnify,
defend and hold Sellers and their respective officers, directors,  employees and
affiliates  harmless  from,  against and with respect to any Loss (as defined in
Section 9.7.1)  incurred,  suffered,  sustained or required to be paid by any of
them and resulting from, related to or arising out of:

                         (e) any breach of any of the covenants, representations
        or  warranties  made by Entercom in or pursuant to this  Agreement or in
        any agreement,  document or instrument  executed and delivered  pursuant
        hereto or in connection with the Closing hereunder;

                         (f) any failure by  Entercom to perform or observe,  or
        to have  performed  or observed,  in full,  any  covenant,  agreement or
        condition to be  performed or observed by it pursuant to this  Agreement
        or in any agreement, document or instrument executed and delivered by or
        on behalf of it in connection with the Closing hereunder; or

                         (g) any and all  Liabilities  of  Entercom  except  for
        Liabilities to be assumed or retained by Sellers under the terms of this
        Agreement; or

                         (h)  Entercom's  operation  or  ownership of the Assets
        after the Adjustment  Time,  including any and all  Liabilities  arising
        under the FCC  Licenses  or the  Station  Contracts  assumed by Entercom
        which accrue after the  Adjustment  Time or which relate to or arise out
        of events occurring after the Adjustment Time.

                  9.7.3.  PROCEDURES.  Any party seeking  indemnification  under
this Agreement (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly give the party from whom
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") written notice of any claim
or the commencement of any action or proceeding for which the Indemnified  Party
may  seek   indemnification,   and  the  Indemnified   Party  shall  permit  the
Indemnifying  Party to assume the  defense  of any such claim or any  litigation
resulting  from such  claim,  unless  injunctive  relief is sought  against  the
Indemnified  Party in which case the  Indemnified  Party shall have the right to
join in any defense.  The Indemnified  Party's failure to give the  Indemnifying
Party notice under this clause  shall not  preclude the  Indemnified  Party from
seeking  indemnification  from the Indemnifying  Party except to the extent that
the  Indemnified  Party's  failure has materially  prejudiced  the  Indemnifying
Party's ability to defend the claim or litigation.  The Indemnifying Party shall
not settle any claim


                                       38
<PAGE>

for which the Indemnified Party seeks indemnification or consent to entry of any
judgment in  litigation  arising from such a claim  without  obtaining a written
release of the Indemnified  Party from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation.  If the Indemnifying  Party shall not assume the defense of any such
claim or  litigation  resulting  therefrom,  or if  injunctive  relief is sought
against the  Indemnified  Party,  the  Indemnified  Party may defend  against or
settle such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem  appropriate,  and
in such cases,  upon a written demand  therefore,  the Indemnifying  Party shall
promptly  reimburse  the  Indemnified  Party for the  amount  of all  reasonable
expenses,  legal or otherwise,  incurred by the Indemnified  Party in connection
with the defense against or settlement of such claim or litigation. In addition,
if the  Indemnifying  Party  shall not assume  the  defense of any such claim or
litigation  resulting  therefrom,  or if injunctive relief is sought against the
Indemnified Party, and if no settlement of the claim or litigation is made, upon
written demand  therefor,  the Indemnifying  Party shall promptly  reimburse the
Indemnified  Party for the amount of any judgment  rendered with respect to such
claim or in such litigation and for all reasonable expenses, legal or otherwise,
incurred  by the  Indemnified  Party  in  the  defense  against  such  claim  or
litigation.

                  9.7.4.  LIMITS ON  INDEMNIFICATION.  Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, Entercom shall not be entitled to make a claim against Sellers
for  indemnification  under this  Agreement  until the aggregate  amount of such
claims by Entercom  exceeds One Hundred Fifty Thousand  Dollars  ($150,000) (the
"Threshold"),  provided,  that once the  Threshold has been  exceeded,  Entercom
shall be entitled to seek from Sellers,  jointly and severally,  the full amount
of such  claims.  The  amount of the  Threshold  shall  have no  bearing  on any
determination as to what constitutes  "material" for purposes of this Agreement.
In  addition,  notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this  Agreement  to the
contrary,  in no event shall a Loss include a party's incidental,  consequential
or punitive damages, regardless of the theory of recovery.

                                   ARTICLE X.
                                   ----------

other  party  hereto  that it has not  incurred  any  Liability,  contingent  or
otherwise,  for brokerage or finders' fees or agents  commissions  or other like
payment in  connection  with this  Agreement  or the  transactions  contemplated
hereby for which the other party will have any Liability,  and each party hereto
agrees to  indemnify  and hold the other party  hereto  harmless  against and in
respect to any such Liability based in any way on any agreement,  arrangement or
understanding claimed to have been made by such party with any third party.

             10.3. SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS,  REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES.  The
provisions  hereof which by their terms are to be performed  and observed  after
the Closing Date and the several  representations,  warranties,  indemnities and
agreements of Entercom and Sellers  herein  contained  shall survive the Closing
Date  hereunder  for one (1) year  following  the  Closing  Date.  No claim  for
indemnification may be made pursuant to Article IX after the survival period set
forth in this Section  10.3 (except that all claims which are properly  asserted
prior to the  expiration  of the survival  period set forth in this Section 10.3
shall survive with respect to such claims until the final resolution thereof).

             10.4.  AMENDMENT AND WAIVER.  This  Agreement  cannot be changed or
terminated  orally.  Any  amendment  of  modification  hereof must be in writing
signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought.  No waiver of compliance

shall be effective unless evidenced by an instrument in writing duly executed by
the party sought to be charged with such waiver or consent.

             10.5.  ASSIGNMENT.  Entercom  shall have the right to assign all or
any  portion  of its rights  under this  Agreement  to any entity  under  common
control  with  Entercom or a Qualified  Intermediary  under  Section 1031 of the
Code,  provided,   that  no  such  assignment  shall  relieve  Entercom  of  its
obligations  hereunder.  Other than as expressly  set forth above,  no party may
assign all or any portion of its rights  under the  Agreement  without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto.

             10.6. EFFECT OF THIS AGREEMENT.  This Agreement,  together with the
exhibits and schedules  hereto and a letter  agreement,  among Entercom and SCI,
dated of even date herewith,  sets forth the entire understanding of the parties
and supersedes  any and all prior written or oral  agreements,  arrangements  or
understandings  relating  to  the  subject  matter  hereof.  No  representation,
promise,  inducement  or statement  of  intention  has been made by either party
which is not  embodied in this  Agreement  or the letter  agreement  referred to
above,  and  neither  party  shall be bound by, or be liable  for,  any  alleged
representation,  promise,  inducement  or statement  of  intention  not embodied
herein unless same shall have been made subsequent  hereto,  shall be in writing
and shall be signed by the party to be charged  therewith.  This Agreement shall
be binding  upon and inure to the benefit of the  parties  and their  respective

The date of any such notice and service  thereof  shall be deemed to be: (i) the
day of delivery if hand  delivered or delivered by overnight  courier;  (ii) the
day of delivery as indicated on the return  receipt if  dispatched  by mail,  or
(iii)  the  date  of  telecopy  transmission  as  indicated  on  the  telecopier
transmission  report  provided  that  any  telecopy  transmission  shall  not be
effective  unless a paper copy is sent by  overnight  courier on the date of the
telecopy  transmission.  Either  party may change its address for the purpose of
notice by giving notice of such change in accordance with the provisions of this
section.

             10.11. STATION EMPLOYEES.  Subject to the terms of the TBA, Sellers
agree  that for a period  of one year  after the  Commencement  Date of the TBA,
neither they nor any of their affiliates, successors or assignees will employ or
solicit for employment, or counsel others to solicit for employment, any current
employee of the Stations that Entercom employs after the Closing; provided, that
if Entercom terminates any employee of the Stations, such restrictions shall not
apply to any such terminated employees.

             10.12.  SECTION 1031 ASSET  EXCHANGE.  Entercom may elect to effect
the  acquisition  of all or part of the Assets as part of a  deferred  like-kind
exchange  under  Section  1031  of the  Code,  in  lieu of  buying  such  assets
hereunder;  provided,  that the consummation of this Agreement is not predicated
or conditioned on such exchange.  If Entercom so elects, it shall provide notice
to Sellers of its election,  and  thereafter  (i) may at any time at or prior to
Closing assign its rights under this Agreement to a "qualified  intermediary" as
defined in Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4),  subject to all of Sellers' rights
and obligations hereunder and (ii) shall promptly provide written notice of such
assignment  to all  parties  hereto;  provided,  that no such  assignment  shall
relieve Entercom of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding the assignment of
Entercom's  rights  hereunder,  the  parties  acknowledge  and  agree  that  the
representations,  warranties  and  covenants  of Sellers  hereunder  are for the
benefit of Entercom and shall remain  enforceable by Entercom against Sellers in
accordance  with the terms hereof.  Sellers shall  cooperate with all reasonable
requests of Entercom and the "qualified intermediary" in arranging and effecting
the exchange as one which  qualifies  under Section 1031 of the Code;  provided,
that Sellers shall incur no additional costs, expenses, delays or liabilities in
connection  with  this  transaction  as a result  of or in  connection  with the
exchange.  Without  limiting the  generality of the  foregoing,  if Entercom has
given notice of its intention to effect the acquisition of all or part


                                       42
<PAGE>

of the Assets as part of a  tax-deferred  exchange,  Sellers  shall (i) promptly
provide Entercom with written acknowledgment of such notice and (ii) at Closing,
accept  payment  for all or that  portion  of the  Assets  for  which  like-kind
exchange  treatment  is sought by  Entercom  from the  "qualified  intermediary"
rather than from  Entercom  (which  payment shall  discharge  the  obligation of
Entercom  hereunder to make payment for such  assets) and  transfer,  assign and
convey such assets to Entercom.

                            TIME BROKERAGE AGREEMENT

         This Time Brokerage Agreement (this "Agreement") is made as of the 26th
day of  January,  1998,  by and  among  Entertainment  Communications,  Inc.,  a
Pennsylvania corporation ("Time Broker"), and Tuscaloosa  Broadcasting,  Inc., a
Maryland corporation ("Tuscaloosa"),  Sinclair Radio of Portland Licensee, Inc.,
a Maryland corporation ("SRPLI") and Sinclair Radio of Rochester Licensee, Inc.,
a Maryland  corporation  ("SRRLI")  (Tuscaloosa,  SRPLI and SRRLI are  sometimes
collectively referred to herein as "Licensee").

         Upon the consummation of the transactions  contemplated by that certain
Asset Purchase  Agreement,  dated July 16, 1997, among Sinclair Broadcast Group,
Inc. ("Sinclair") and various subsidiaries of Heritage Media Corporation ("HMC")
(control of which  subsidiaries,  on August 20, 1997, was transferred to William
G.  Evans,  Trustee)  (HMC  is  sometimes  collectively  referred  to  with  its
subsidiaries  as  "Heritage"),  SRPLI will  become  the  licensee  of  broadcast
stations  KKSN(AM),  Vancouver,   Washington,   KKSN-FM,  Portland,  Oregon  and
KKRH(FM), Salem, Oregon (collectively,  the "Portland Stations"), and SRRLI will
become  the  licensee  of  broadcast  stations  WKLX(FM),  Rochester,  New York,
WBEE(FM), Rochester, New York, WBBF(AM), Rochester, New York and WQRV(FM), Avon,
New York (collectively,  the "Rochester Stations" and together with the Portland
Stations,  the  "Stations").  Time Broker and  Licensee  desire to enter into an
agreement  providing  for the  programming  and sale,  upon the  acquisition  by
Licensee of the Stations from Heritage,  of  substantially  all of the broadcast
time of the Stations to Time Broker, subject to and in compliance with the rules
and policies of the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC").

         Simultaneously  herewith, Time Broker and Licensee are entering into an
Asset  Purchase   Agreement  (the  "Purchase   Agreement")   providing  for  the
acquisition by Time Broker of the Stations.

         Accordingly,  in  consideration  of the  foregoing  and  of the  mutual
promises,  covenants,  and  conditions  set forth  below,  the parties  agree as
follows:

                                   ARTICLE I.
                                  SALE OF TIME

         Section 1.1.  Broadcast of  Programming.  Effective  upon the date (the
"Commencement  Date")  that is the later to occur of (a) the date that  Licensee
acquires the Stations  from  Heritage or (b) the date that is ten (10)  business
days after the expiration or early  termination of any waiting period applicable
to the  transfer  of the  Stations to Time  Broker  under the  Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust  Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"),  Licensee shall
broadcast on the Stations,  or cause to be broadcast on the  Stations,  programs
which are  presented  to it by Time  Broker as  described  in greater  detail on
Schedule 1.1 (the "Programming").

         Section 1.2.  Payment.  Time Broker shall pay Licensee for broadcast of
the Programming  the amounts set forth in Schedule 1.2 (the "Monthly  Payment"),
subject to adjustment  as set forth in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 below.  All payments
shall  be made by wire
                                       1
<PAGE>


transfer  of  immediately-available  funds  by the  last  business  day of  each
calendar month, in arrears, to which such payment pertains.

         Section 1.3. Term.  This Agreement  shall commence on the  Commencement
Date and shall  terminate  on the earlier of (i) 12:01 a.m. on the Closing  Date
(as defined in the Purchase  Agreement) under the Purchase  Agreement,  (ii) the
date the Purchase  Agreement is terminated,  or (iii) the date this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof.


                                  ARTICLE II.
                PROGRAMMING AND OPERATING STANDARDS AND PRACTICES

         Section 2.1.  Compliance with Standards.  All Programming  delivered by
Time  Broker  during  the term of this  Agreement  shall be in  accordance  with
applicable statutes,  FCC requirements and the programming policies set forth on
Schedule 2.1. Licensee reserves the right to refuse to broadcast any Programming
containing  matter which the Licensee  believes is unsuitable or not  consistent
with the needs and  interests  of its service  area or may be  violative  of any
right of any third party,  or which may  constitute a "personal  attack" as that
term is and has been defined by the FCC or which Licensee reasonably  determines
is, or in the reasonable  opinion of Licensee may be deemed to be, indecent (and
not broadcast during the safe harbor for indecent programming established by the
FCC) or obscene by the FCC or any court or other  regulatory body with authority
over Licensee or the Station.

         Section  2.2.  Political  Broadcasts.  Time Broker  shall  maintain and
deliver to Licensee all records and information required by the FCC to be placed
in the public  inspection  files of the Stations  pertaining to the broadcast of
political programming and controversial issue advertisements, in accordance with
the provisions of Sections 73.1212 and 73.3526 of the FCC's rules, and agrees to
broadcast  sponsored  programming  addressing  political issues or controversial
subjects of public  importance,  in  accordance  with the  provisions of Section
73.1212 of the FCC's  rules.  Time  Broker  shall  consult  and  cooperate  with
Licensee and adhere to all applicable  statutes and the rules,  regulations  and
policies  of the FCC,  as  announced  from  time to time,  with  respect  to the
carriage of political  advertisements  and programming and the charges permitted
therefor.  Time Broker shall  promptly  provide to Licensee  such  documentation
relating to such  programming  as Licensee is required to maintain in its public
inspection  files or as Licensee  shall  reasonably  request.  Licensee shall be
responsible for the maintenance of the public inspection files of the Stations.

         Section 2.3.  Handling of  Communications.  Time Broker shall cooperate
with Licensee in promptly responding to all mail, cables, telegrams or telephone
calls directed to the Stations in connection  with the  Programming  provided by
Time  Broker or any other  matter  relevant to its  responsibilities  hereunder.
Promptly   upon  receipt,   Time  Broker  shall  provide   copies  of  all  such
correspondence  to Licensee.  Time Broker shall promptly  advise Licensee of any
public  or FCC  complaint  or  inquiry  known  to Time  Broker  concerning  such
Programming,  and shall  provide  Licensee  with  copies of any  letters to Time
Broker from the public,  including complaints concerning such Programming.  Upon
Licensee's request,  Time Broker shall provide Licensee with such information as
will allow Licensee to respond to such complaints and inquiries. Notwithstanding
the  foregoing, Licensee shall  handle  all matters or inquiries relating

                                       2
<PAGE>


to FCC complaints and any other matters required to be handled by Licensee under
the rules and regulations of the FCC.

         Section  2.4.  Preemption.  Licensee  may,  from time to time,  preempt
portions of the  Programming to broadcast  emergency  information or programs it
deems would better serve the public  interest.  Time Broker shall be notified at
least one week in advance of any  preemption of any of the  Programming  for the
purpose of  broadcasting  programs  Licensee deems necessary to better serve the
public  interest  unless such advance  notice is impossible or  impractical,  in
which  case  Licensee  shall  notify  Time  Broker  promptly  upon  making  such
determination.  In the  event  of any  such  preemption,  Time  Broker  shall be
entitled to a credit against any other amounts due Licensee under this Agreement
in an amount equal to the product of (a) the Monthly  Payment and (b) the result
of dividing  the number of hours so affected  by the  aggregate  number of hours
available for Programming during such month.  Licensee  represents and covenants
that  preemption  pursuant  to this  Section  2.4 shall only occur to the extent
Licensee deems  necessary to carry out its  obligations as an FCC licensee,  and
expressly  agrees that its right of  preemption  shall not be exercised  for the
commercial advantage of Licensee or others.

         Section 2.5. Broadcasting  Obligations of Licensee.  During the term of
this  Agreement,  except as set forth in Sections  2.1 and 2.4 and this  Section
2.5,  Licensee  will  broadcast  the  Programming  in  its  entirety  (including
commercials), without interruption, deletion or addition of any kind:

            i.  Licensee  may   temporarily   refrain  from   broadcasting   the
Programming from the main transmitter of each Station between the hours of 12:30
a.m. and 5:30 a.m.  (or at such other time in the event that weather  conditions
or  contractual  arrangements  relating to  transmitter  sites  dealing with the
exposure of humans to RF  radiation  so require or as may  otherwise be required
under compelling  circumstances that cannot be rescheduled  between the hours of
12:30 a.m.  and 5:30 a.m.) in order to perform  normal,  customary  and  routine
maintenance  on the  Station's  main  transmitting  facilities;  provided,  that
Licensee  shall provide  written  notice to Time Broker of its intent to refrain
from  broadcasting  the Programming from the main transmitter of each Station at
least forty-eight (48) hours in advance,  except when an emergency requires such
suspension,  and provided  further that  Licensee  shall use its best efforts to
minimize the impact,  frequency  and duration of such  interruptions,  including
without  limitation  by way of use of  any  auxiliary  transmitter  that  may be
available for the applicable Station; and

            ii. Licensee may temporarily cease broadcasting the Programming from
the main  transmitter  of each  Station as a result of a technical  malfunction,
natural disaster, act of public enemy, act of God, or any other cause beyond the
control  of  Licensee;  provided  that  in any  such  case,  Licensee  will  act
expediently  and use its best efforts to resume the broadcast of the Programming
from  the  main  transmitter  of  each  Station  as  quickly  as the  applicable
circumstances  will  allow,  and will  use its best  efforts  to  broadcast  the
Programming  from  any  auxiliary  transmitter  that  may be  available  for the
applicable Station.

         In the event of any  interruption  pursuant to this Section (other than
(a) interruption pursuant to Section 2.5(i) occurring between the hours of 12:30
a.m. and 5:30 a.m. and (b)

                                       3

interruption  pursuant to Section 2.5(ii)), if Licensee is not able to broadcast
the Programming from an available  auxiliary  transmitter,  Time Broker shall be
entitled  to a  credit  against  the  Monthly  Payment  or any  other  sums  due
hereunder,  in an amount equal to the product of (a) the Monthly Payment and (b)
the result of dividing the number of hours so affected by the  aggregate  number
of hours available for Programming during such month.

         Section 2.6. Rights in Programs.  All right,  title and interest in and
to the Programming, and the right to authorize the use of the Programming in any
manner  and in any media  whatsoever,  shall be and  remain  vested at all times
solely in Time Broker.

         Section 2.7.  "Payola" and  "Plugola".  Time Broker agrees that it will
not accept any gift, gratuity or other consideration, including, but not limited
to, a  commission,  discount,  bonus,  material  supplies or other  merchandise,
services or labor (collectively,  the "Consideration"),  directly or indirectly,
from any person or company for the playing of records,  the  presentation of any
programming  or the broadcast of any commercial  announcement  over the Stations
unless  the payor is  identified  in the  program  for which  Consideration  was
provided as having paid for or furnished such Consideration,  in accordance with
the  Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the  "Communications  Act") and the
FCC  requirements.  It is  further  understood  and  agreed  that no  commercial
message,  plugs, or undue reference shall be made in programming  presented over
the Stations to any business venture,  profit-making  activity or other interest
(other  than  non-commercial  announcements  for  bona  fide  charities,  church
activities or other public service activities) unless the payor is identified in
the program for which Consideration was provided as having paid for or furnished
such  Consideration,  in  accordance  with  the  Communications  Act and the FCC
requirements. In addition, Time Broker agrees that it will take steps, including
the  continuation  of Licensee's  system for periodic  execution of  affidavits,
reasonably designed to assure that it, its employees and agents comply with this
Section 2.7.

         Section  2.8.   Advertising   and   Programming.   Beginning  with  the
Commencement  Date,  Time Broker  shall be solely  responsible  for any expenses
incurred in  connection  with and shall be entitled to all revenue from the sale
of advertising or program time in the Programming.  Except as otherwise provided
herein,  Time  Broker  does not  assume any  obligation  of  Licensee  under any
contract or  advertising  arrangement  entered  into by Licensee on or after the
Commencement  Date.  Licensee shall  indemnify Time Broker for the amount of any
lost revenue caused by any sale of advertising  time made by Licensee that would
lower the Station's lowest unit charge for political advertising.

         Section 2.9. Format and Transmitter Locations.  During the term of this
Agreement,  except as  otherwise  consented  to in  writing  by  Licensee  or as
otherwise  provided in the following  sentence,  Time Broker agrees that it will
not make any material changes in the Stations' existing  programming  formats or
seek to change  the  location  of any of the  Stations'  studio or  transmitting
facilities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the parties expressly agree that
Time  Broker,  in its sole  discretion,  is  permitted  during  the term of this
Agreement to exchange the programming formats on KKSN(AM) and KFXX(AM) (which is
owned and  operated  by Time  Broker)  (it being  understood  that,  should this
Agreement  terminate  other than as a result of the  Closing  (as defined in the
Purchase  Agreement) under the Purchase Agreement,

                                       4


<PAGE>
Time  Broker  shall,  promptly  upon such  termination,  change the  programming
formats on each such station back to their programming formats  substantially as
they exist on the date of this  Agreement) and (ii) Licensee agrees that it will
not  unreasonably  withhold  consent to any request by Time Broker to change the
programming format for WBBF(AM).

         Section  2.10.  Compliance  with Laws.  At all times during the term of
this Agreement,  Time Broker and Licensee shall comply in all material  respects
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.

         Section 2.11. Certifications.  Pursuant to Section 73.3555(a)(3)(ii) of
the FCC's rules,  Licensee certifies that it maintains ultimate control over the
Station's  facilities,  including  specifically  control over station  finances,
personnel  and  programming,  and Time  Broker  certifies  that  this  Agreement
complies with the provisions of Section 73.3555(a) of the FCC's rules.


                                  ARTICLE III.
                    RESPONSIBILITY FOR EMPLOYEES AND EXPENSES

         Section 3.1. Time Broker's  Employees.  Time Broker shall employ and be
responsible  for the payment of salaries,  taxes,  insurance and all other costs
related to all personnel  used in the production of the  Programming.  Except as
provided in Section 3.5 with respect to Transferred Employees,  Time Broker will
not incur any liability on account of Licensee's  employees arising and accruing
prior to the Commencement Date including, without limitation, any such liability
on account of unemployment  insurance  contributions,  termination and severance
payments, accrued sick leave or accrued vacation.

         Section  3.2.  Licensee's  Employees.  Licensee  shall  employ  and  be
responsible  for the payment of salaries,  taxes,  insurance and all other costs
related to the personnel  necessary to fulfill its  obligations  as Licensee and
under this  Agreement,  and to produce  Licensee's  programming  on the Stations
subject to  reimbursement as provided in Schedule 1.2. Time Broker shall have no
authority  and shall not supervise  persons in the employ of Licensee  after the
Commencement Date.  Licensee  acknowledges that its employees may have access to
certain  confidential  information of Time Broker.  Licensee  shall,  therefore,
inform its employees of the confidential  nature of such information and require
that each such employee keep such information confidential.

         Section  3.3.  Time  Broker's  Expenses.  Time Broker shall pay for all
costs associated with the production and delivery of the Programming,  including
but not limited to (i) all ASCAP,  BMI, SESAC and other copyright fees, (ii) any
expenses  incurred in connection  with its sale of  advertising  time  hereunder
(including   without  limitation  sales  commissions)  in  connection  with  the
Programming and (iii) the salaries,  taxes,  insurance and related costs for all
of Time Broker's  personnel used in the production of the Programming and all of
Time Broker's sales personnel  (including  salespeople,  traffic personnel,  and
programming staff).

         Section 3.4. Operating Expenses.  Licensee shall be responsible for the
payment when due of all fees and expenses  relating to operation and maintenance
of the  Stations to the extent  necessary  for Licensee to maintain the licensed
transmitting capability of the
                                       5

<PAGE>

Stations and to fulfill its obligations as an FCC licensee,  including,  without
limitation,  salaries,  benefits and similar expenses for Licensee's  employees,
Licensee's  federal,   state  and  local  taxes,  rent,   utilities   (excluding
telephone),  maintenance  and repairs at each of the Station's  transmitter  and
studio  sites,  any capital  expense at each of the  Station's  transmitter  and
studio sites,  insurance on the Stations'  equipment,  insurance  deductibles on
claims on the Stations'  equipment,  and ad valorem  property taxes,  subject to
reimbursement as provided in Schedule 1.2.

         Section 3.5.      Employee Matters.

3.5.1 On the  Commencement  Date, Time Broker shall offer  employment to each of
the  employees of the  Stations  (including  those on leave of absence,  whether
short-term,  long-term,  family, maternity,  disability, paid, unpaid or other),
other than those employees that are retained by Licensee pursuant to Section 3.2
above during the term of this Agreement,  at a comparable  salary,  position and
place of  employment  as held by each  such  employee  immediately  prior to the
Commencement  Date (such  employees who are given such offers of employment  are
referred  to herein as the  "Transferred  Employees").  Nothing in this  Section
3.5.1 is intended to guarantee  employment for any Transferred  Employee for any
length of time after the Commencement Date.

              3.5.2 Except as provided  otherwise in this Section 3.5,  Licensee
shall pay, discharge and be responsible for (a) all salary and wages arising out
of or relating to the  employment of the employees of the Stations  prior to the
Commencement  Date and (b) any employee benefits arising under the Benefit Plans
(as defined in the Purchase  Agreement) of Licensee and their Affiliates  during
the period prior to the Commencement Date. From and after the Commencement Date,
Time Broker shall pay,  discharge and be responsible  for all salary,  wages and
benefits  arising  out of or  relating  to  the  employment  of the  Transferred
Employees by Time Broker on and after the  Commencement  Date. Time Broker shall
be  responsible  for all severance  Liabilities  (as such term is defined in the
Purchase Agreement),  and all COBRA Liabilities for any Transferred Employees of
the Stations terminated on or after the Commencement Date.

              3.5.3 Time Broker shall cause all Transferred  Employees as of the
Commencement Date to be eligible to participate in the "employee welfare benefit
plans" and "employee pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) and 3(2)
of ERISA,  respectively) of Time Broker in which similarly situated employees of
Time Broker are generally eligible to participate;  provided,  however, that all
Transferred  Employees  and their spouses and  dependents  shall be eligible for
coverage immediately after the Commencement Date (and shall not be excluded from
coverage on account of any  preexisting  condition) to the extent provided under
such plans with respect to Transferred Employees.

              3.5.4 For purposes of any length of service requirements,  waiting
periods,  vesting periods or differential benefits based on length of service in
any such  plan for  which a  Transferred  Employee  may be  eligible  after  the
Commencement  Date,  Time Broker shall ensure that,  to the extent  permitted by
law,  service  by such  Transferred  Employee  with  Heritage,  Licensee  or any
Affiliate of Heritage or Licensee  shall be deemed to have been service with the
Time  Broker.  In  addition,  Time Broker  shall  ensure  that each  Transferred
Employee  receives  credit under any welfare benefit plan of Time Broker for any
deductibles  or  co-payments  paid by


                                       6



such  Transferred  Employee and his or her  dependents for the current plan year
under a plan  maintained by Heritage or Licensee or any Affiliate of Heritage or
Licensee.  Time Broker shall grant credit to each  Transferred  Employee for all
sick leave in accordance with the policies of Time Broker  applicable  generally
to its  employees  after  giving  effect to service for  Heritage or Licensee as
service  for Time  Broker.  To the  extent  taken into  account  in  determining
prorations  under Section 4.2 hereunder,  Time Broker shall assume and discharge
Licensee's  liabilities  for the payment of all unused vacation leave accrued by
Transferred  Employees as of the Commencement Date. To the extent any claim with
respect to such accrued vacation leave is lodged against Licensee,  with respect
to any  Transferred  Employee,  Time  Broker  shall  indemnify,  defend and hold
harmless  Licensee from and against any and all losses,  directly or indirectly,
as a result of, or based upon or arising from the same,  up to the amount of the
proration credit received by Time Broker under Section 4.2 for such items.

                         3.5.5 [Intentionally omitted]

                         3.5.6 As soon as practicable following the Commencement
Date,  Time Broker shall establish and maintain a defined  contribution  plan or
plans  (which may be a  preexisting  plan or plans) (the "Time  Broker's  Plan")
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986,  as amended  (the  "Code"),  for the  benefit  of the  Transferred
Employees.   Effective  as  of  the  Commencement  Date,  Licensee  shall  cause
appropriate amendments to be made to its defined contribution plan or plans (the
"Licensee's  Plan") to provide  that the  Transferred  Employees  shall be fully
vested in their accounts under the Licensee's Plan. As soon as practicable after
the  Commencement  Date, Time Broker shall take all necessary  action to qualify
Time Broker's Plan under the  applicable  provisions of the Code  (including but
not limited to Section 401), if it is not yet so qualified,  and Time Broker and
Licensee  shall make any and all  filings  and  submissions  to the  appropriate
governmental  agencies  required  to be  made by them  in  connection  with  the
transfer of assets  described  hereafter.  As soon as practicable  following the
earlier of the receipt of a  favorable  determination  letter from the  Internal
Revenue Service  regarding the qualified  status of both the Licensee's Plan and
the Time Broker's  Plan (each as amended to the date of transfer) or sooner,  if
Licensee and Time Broker so agree,  Licensee  shall cause to be  transferred  to
Time  Broker's  Plan,  in  cash,  all  of the  individual  account  balances  of
Transferred  Employees under the Licensee's Plan, including any outstanding plan
participant loan receivables allocated to such accounts.

                         3.5.7 Subject to Section 3.2, Time Broker  acknowledges
and agrees that Time  Broker's  obligations  pursuant to this Section 3.5 are in
addition to, and not in limitation  of, Time  Broker's  obligation to assume the
employment contracts set forth on Schedule 2.1.8 to the Purchase Agreement.

                         3.5.8 Except as otherwise  provided in this Section 3.5
or in any  employment,  severance or  retention  agreements  of any  Transferred
Employees, all Transferred Employees shall be at-will employees, and Time Broker
may terminate  their  employment or change their terms of employment at will. No
employee (or beneficiary of any employee) of Seller may sue to enforce the terms
of this Agreement,  including  specifically this Section 3.5, and no employee or
beneficiary  shall be treated as a third party  beneficiary  of this  Agreement.
Except to the extent provided for herein,  Time Broker may cover the Transferred
Employees


                                       7

under existing or new benefit plans, programs,  and arrangements,  and may amend
or terminate any such plans, programs, or arrangements at any time.

                         3.5.9 Upon the  Closing  (as  defined  in the  Purchase
Agreement) of the Purchase Agreement, Time Broker shall offer employment to each
of the employees of the Stations that have been retained during the term of this
Agreement by Licensee  pursuant to Section 3.2. Such offer of employment will be
at a comparable  salary,  position and place of  employment as held by each such
employee  immediately  prior to the  Closing  Date (as  defined in the  Purchase
Agreement)  (such employees who are given such offers of employment are referred
to herein as the "Closing Date Transferred Employees").  Nothing in this Section
3.5.9 is intended to guarantee  employment for any such Closing Date Transferred
Employee  for any  length of time  after the  Closing  Date (as  defined  in the
Purchase Agreement).  Upon the Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) of
the Purchase  Agreement,  the provisions of Sections 3.5.2 through and including
3.5.8 of this  Agreement  shall  also  apply to such  Closing  Date  Transferred
Employees  after  substituting  (i) "Closing  Date  Transferred  Employees"  for
"Transferred   Employees,"  in  each  instance,  and  (ii)  "Closing  Date"  for
"Commencement Date," in each instance.


                                  ARTICLE IV.
                   ASSIGNMENT OF CERTAIN AGREEMENTS AND RIGHTS

          Section 4.1.  Assignment.  On the  Commencement  Date,  Licensee shall
assign  to Time  Broker  all  Station  Contracts  (as  defined  in the  Purchase
Agreement)  other  than  those  contracts  and other  agreements  identified  on
Schedule  4.1 (the  "Excluded  Contracts").  All such  Station  Contracts  to be
assigned  hereunder are referred to  collectively  as the "Assigned  Contracts."
Time Broker shall assume, pay, perform, and discharge all liabilities arising on
or after the Commencement Date under the Assigned Contracts (including,  without
limitation,   Trade-out   Agreements)   pursuant  to  their  terms  (except  for
liabilities for any breaches  thereunder by Licensee or Heritage occurring prior
to the  Commencement  Date).  Licensee  has  provided  Time Broker with true and
complete copies,  including amendments,  of the Assigned Contracts. The Assigned
Contracts are freely  assignable,  or, if consent of the other contracting party
to the assignment is required,  Licensee shall make  reasonable  best efforts to
obtain  all such  consents  prior to the  Commencement  Date.  Subject to and in
compliance with the provisions of Section 3.3 of the Purchase Agreement,  to the
extent that any such consents are not obtained prior to the  Commencement  Date,
during the  period  between  the  Commencement  Date and the date that  Licensee
obtains  such  consent,  the  parties  shall  cooperate  to cause Time Broker to
receive the benefit of the Assigned Contract in exchange for performance by Time
Broker of all of Licensee's  obligations under such Assigned Contract (including
but not limited to the payment to Licensee of all amounts due under the Assigned
Contract on and after the Commencement Date for services provided by Licensee).

          Section 4.2.  Proration.  All expenses  and income  arising  under the
Assigned  Contracts shall be prorated between Licensee and Time Broker as of the
Commencement  Date in a manner  such  that the  costs  and  benefits  thereunder
through  the date  before  the  Commencement  Date  shall be for the  account of
Licensee and, thereafter,  during the term of this Agreement, for the account of
Time  Broker.  With  respect to any items of salary,  accrued  vacation or other

                                       8

<PAGE>


benefits relating to Transferred  Employees,  such prorations shall also include
an amount payable for applicable  payroll taxes. Such proration shall include an
adjustment for Trade-out Agreements (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) which
are included in the Assigned  Contracts only to the extent that any Net Negative
Trade Balance (as defined below) for the Stations exceeds $50,000. "Net Negative
Trade  Balance"  means the extent,  if any, to which the value (at current rates
for time on each Station as of the Commencement Date) of unfulfilled obligations
of the Station under Trade-out Agreements exceed the stated consideration yet to
be  received  by  the  Station  pursuant  to  such  Trade-out  Agreements.  Such
prorations  shall be  completed  and any  necessary  payments on account of such
prorations  paid  within  sixty  (60)  days  of the  Commencement  Date.  If any
disagreement with respect to the proration of such income and expenses cannot be
resolved by the parties, Licensee and Time Broker will select a certified public
accountant  knowledgeable in the broadcast industry to resolve the dispute.  The
parties  will  use  their  best  efforts  in good  faith  to  cause  to occur as
expeditiously  as possible the appointment of the certified  public  accountant,
and once  appointed,  the  resolution  of the dispute.  The  resolution  of such
accountant shall be binding on the parties and subject to judicial  enforcement.
Payment  of the cost of the  accountant  shall be shared  equally  between  Time
Broker and Licensee.

          Section 4.3.  Accounts  Receivable.  All cash accounts  receivable for
broadcasts  on the  Stations  which  occur prior to the  Commencement  Date (the
"Accounts  Receivable") shall belong to Licensee and all Accounts Receivable for
Programming  which occurs  thereafter  shall  belong to Time Broker.  Within ten
business (10) days following the  Commencement  Date,  Licensee shall deliver to
Time Broker a schedule of Cash  Accounts  Receivable  for the Stations as of the
Commencement  Date,  by accounts  and the amounts  then owing (the  "Schedule of
Accounts Receivable"). Time Broker agrees to use its reasonable efforts (with at
least the care and  diligence  that Time Broker uses to collect its own accounts
receivable)  to collect for  Licensee its  Accounts  Receivable  as shown on the
Schedule  of  Accounts  Receivable  delivered  by  Licensee  for a period of one
hundred fifty (150) days following the Commencement  Date;  provided,  that Time
Broker's obligation to collect the Accounts Receivable shall survive the Closing
Date (as defined in the Purchase  Agreement)  to the extent  necessary  for Time
Broker to collect the  Accounts  Receivable  for a period of one  hundred  fifty
(150) days following the Commencement Date. All payments received by Time Broker
from any  customer  whose name  appears in the  Schedule of Accounts  Receivable
shall be first applied to the oldest balance then due on the Accounts Receivable
unless the account  debtor  indicates  in writing  that payment is to be applied
otherwise  due to a dispute over an Account  Receivable.  Time Broker shall keep
accurate records of the payment  received by it on such Accounts  Receivable and
Licensee  shall have  access at  reasonable  times to Time  Broker's  records to
verify such status of the Accounts  Receivable.  On the fifth day  following the
last day of each month  during such one  hundred  fifty (150) day period (or, if
any such day is a Saturday,  Sunday or holiday, on the next day on which banking
transactions  are  resumed),  Time Broker  shall  remit to Licensee  collections
received by Time Broker with  respect to the Accounts  Receivable.  Any Accounts
Receivable that have not been collected  within such one hundred fifty (150) day
period  shall be  reassigned,  without  recourse to Time  Broker,  to  Licensee,
together with all records in connection therewith, whereupon Licensee may pursue
collection thereof in such manner as it, in its sole discretion,  may determine.
Time Broker shall not make any referral or compromise of any Accounts

                                       9

Receivable  to a  collection  agency or attorney  for  collection  and shall not
compromise  for less than full value any  Account  Receivable  without the prior
written consent of Licensee.  Except to remit collected  Accounts  Receivable in
accordance  herewith,  Time Broker  shall have no  liability  or  obligation  to
Licensee  with  respect  to the  collection  of its  accounts  and  shall not be
obligated to take any action to collect such accounts.


                                   ARTICLE V.
                              OPERATION OF STATION

              Notwithstanding  any provision of this  Agreement to the contrary,
Licensee  shall retain full  authority and power with respect to the  management
and operation of the Stations during the term of this Agreement.  Licensee shall
employ the General  Manager of the Stations and such other personnel as Licensee
determines  may be necessary to fulfill its  obligations as a licensee under the
Communications  Act and its  obligations in accordance  with Section 3.2 hereof.
Licensee shall retain full authority and control over the policies,  programming
and  operations of the Stations,  including,  without  limitation,  the decision
whether to preempt  Programming in accordance with Section 2.4 hereof.  Licensee
shall  have  ultimate   responsibility   to  effectuate   compliance   with  the
Communications  Act and with FCC rules,  regulations  and policies.  In no event
shall Time Broker or its employees represent,  depict,  describe or portray Time
Broker as the licensee of the Stations.


                                  ARTICLE VI.
                                GRANT OF LICENSES

              Section 6.1.  License to Use Station  Facilities.  Effective as of
the Commencement Date,  Licensee grants Time Broker permission to access and use
all of the  studio  and  office  space  and  other  facilities  of the  Stations
("Station  Facilities")  and all equipment  and  furnishings  contained  therein
("Station   Equipment")   as  reasonably   necessary  for  the   production  and
broadcasting of the Programming and sales and  administration  relating thereto,
in accordance with the terms set forth in this Article VI. Time Broker shall not
remove from the Station  Facilities or modify any Station  Equipment owned by or
leased or licensed to Licensee without  Licensee's  prior written consent,  such
consent not to be unreasonably  withheld.  Licensee shall not license the use of
the Station Facilities to any other party during the term of this Agreement; and
Time  Broker's  use of the  Station  Facilities  shall be  exclusive  except for
Licensee's  right to use such  facilities as it deems  appropriate in connection
with  the  satisfaction  of its  obligations  as the  Licensee  of the  Station,
including the use of such facilities and adequate office space for the employees
of Licensee that are required for Licensee to comply with its obligations  under
Sections  3.2 and 5  hereof.  Time  Broker  shall use due care in the use of any
property  of  Licensee.  Time Broker  shall  indemnify  Licensee  for any damage
(normal wear and tear excepted) to Licensee's  property caused by Time Broker or
any employee,  contractor, agent or guest of Time Broker. Time Broker shall have
the right to install any additional  equipment at the Station  Facilities deemed
by Time Broker to be necessary  to deliver the  Programming.  If this  Agreement
shall terminate other than pursuant to the Closing under the Purchase Agreement,
Time Broker shall,  promptly after such  termination,  remove all such equipment
and make all repairs necessitated by such removal.

              Section 6.2. License of Intellectual Property. Effective as of the
Commencement  Date and subject to the terms of any existing  license  agreement,
Licensee grants Time Broker the right to use all intellectual  property owned by
or  licensed  to  Licensee  and used  solely in the  operation  of the  Stations
(including,  but not limited to, logos,  jingles,  promotional  materials,  call
signs and goodwill). Time Broker shall own all trademarks,  service marks, trade
names,  characters,   formats,   jingles,   promotional  materials,   logos  and
positioning statements which Time Broker develops for the Programming during the
term of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII.
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         Section 7.1. Indemnification Rights. Each party will indemnify and hold
harmless the other party,  and the  directors,  officers,  partners,  employees,
agents  and  affiliates  of such  other  party,  from  and  against  any and all
liability,  including without limitation  reasonable attorneys' fees arising out
of or incident to (i) any breach by such party of a representation,  warranty or
covenant made herein,  (ii) the programming  produced or furnished by such party
hereunder,  or (iii) the conduct of such party,  its  employees,  contractors or
agents (including  negligence) in performing its or their obligations hereunder.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,  each party will indemnify and
hold harmless the other party, and the directors, officers, partners, employees,
agents  and  affiliates  of such  other  party,  from  and  against  any and all
liability  for libel,  slander,  infringement  of  trademarks,  trade names,  or
program titles,  violation of rights of privacy,  and infringement of copyrights
and proprietary  rights resulting from the programming  produced or furnished by
it hereunder. The parties'  indemnification  obligations hereunder shall survive
any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

         Section 7.2. Procedures.  Any party seeking  indemnification under this
Agreement  (the  "Indemnified  Party")  shall  promptly give the party from whom
indemnification is sought (the "Indemnifying Party") written notice of any claim
or the commencement of any action or proceeding for which the Indemnified  Party
may  seek   indemnification,   and  the  Indemnified   Party  shall  permit  the
Indemnifying  Party to assume the  defense  of any such claim or any  litigation
resulting  from such  claim,  unless  injunctive  relief is sought  against  the
Indemnified  Party in which case the  Indemnified  Party shall have the right to
join in any defense.  The Indemnified  Party's failure to give the  Indemnifying
Party notice under this clause  shall not  preclude the  Indemnified  Party from
seeking  indemnification  from the Indemnifying  Party except to the extent that
the  Indemnified  Party's  failure has materially  prejudiced  the  Indemnifying
Party's ability to defend the claim or litigation.  The Indemnifying Party shall
not settle any claim for which the Indemnified  Party seeks  indemnification  or
consent to entry of any judgment in litigation arising from such a claim without
obtaining  a written  release of the  Indemnified  Party from all  liability  in
respect of such claim or litigation.  If the Indemnifying Party shall not assume
the  defense  of  any  such  claim  or  litigation  resulting  therefrom,  or if
injunctive relief is sought against the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party
may defend  against or settle such claim or  litigation in such manner as it may
deem  appropriate,  and in such  cases,  upon a written  demand  therefore,  the
Indemnifying  Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Part for the amount
of all  reasonable  expenses,  legal or otherwise,  incurred by the  Indemnified
Party in  connection  with the defense  against or  settlement  of such claim or
litigation.  In addition, if the Indemnifying Party shall not assume the defense
of any such claim or litigation resulting therefrom,  or if


                                       11
<PAGE>

injunctive relief is sought against the Indemnified  Party, and if no settlement
of  the  claim  or  litigation  is  made,  upon  written  demand  therefor,  the
Indemnifying Party shall promptly reimburse the Indemnified Party for the amount
of any judgment  rendered with respect to such claim or in such  litigation  and
for all reasonable  expenses,  legal or otherwise,  incurred by the  Indemnified
Party in the defense against such claim or litigation.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.
                                     DEFAULT

              Section 8.1. Time Broker Events of Default.  The occurrence of any
of the following,  after the expiration of the applicable cure periods,  if any,
will be deemed to be an Event of Default by Time  Broker  under this  Agreement:
(a) Time  Broker's  failure to timely pay any Monthly  Payment  provided  for in
Section  1.2 or other  payments  required  hereunder;  (b)  except as  otherwise
provided  for in this  Agreement,  the  failure  of Time  Broker to  supply  the
Programming;  (c) any termination of this Agreement by Time Broker other than as
permitted in Section 9.1; or (d) the issuance by the FCC of an order designating
an evidentiary hearing which arises out of, relates to or is attributable solely
to the acts or  omissions  of Time Broker  under this  Agreement  but  excluding
issues which are based upon Licensee's  conduct  hereunder for which Time Broker
may be held responsible.

              Section 8.2.  Licensee's Events of Default.  The occurrence of any
of the following,  after the expiration of the applicable cure periods,  if any,
will be deemed to be an Event of Default by Licensee under this  Agreement:  (a)
except as otherwise  provided for in this Agreement,  the failure of Licensee to
broadcast the  Programming;  (b) any  termination  of this Agreement by Licensee
other than as  permitted  in Section  9.1; or (c) the  issuance by the FCC of an
order  designating an evidentiary  hearing which arises out of, relates to or is
attributable solely to the acts or omissions of Licensee under this Agreement or
during any period prior to the Commencement  Date during which Licensee owns the
Stations,  but  excluding  issues  which are based  upon Time  Broker's  conduct
hereunder for which Licensee may be held responsible.

              Section  8.3.  Cure  Periods.  The cure  periods  before any event
listed in Sections 8.1 or 8.2 shall become an Event of Default are as follows:


                        (a) Payment by Time Broker. The Monthly Payment or other
payments required  hereunder to be paid to Licensee must be received by Licensee
within five (5) business days after Licensee gives written notice of non-payment
to Time Broker.

                        (b) Certain  Matters.  There shall be no cure period for
(i) the  matters  relating  to the FCC set  forth in  Sections  8.1(d) or 8.2(c)
hereof,  (ii) a termination by Time Broker described in Section 8.1(c); or (iii)
a termination by Licensee described in Section 8.2(b) hereof.

                        (c) Programs and Broadcast Matters. With respect to Time
Broker's failure to provide the Programming referred to in Section 8.1(b) hereof
or Licensee's failure to broadcast the Programming referred to in Section 8.2(a)
hereof, the period allowed for cure shall be three business days from the giving
of written notice of such failure to the defaulting party by the  non-defaulting
party.

              Section  8.4.   Other   Defaults.   For  any  other  breach  of  a
representation,  warranty or covenant made herein that is not listed in Sections
8.1 or 8.2, a party's sole remedy shall be  indemnification  pursuant to Article
VII hereof.


                                   ARTICLE IX.
                                   TERMINATION

              This Agreement shall  automatically  terminate upon the expiration
of the term of this  Agreement as set forth in Section  1.3. In  addition,  this
Agreement shall terminate as provided below.

              Section 9.1. Termination.  In addition to other remedies available
at law or equity,  this  Agreement may be terminated by either  Licensee or Time
Broker  by  written  notice  to the  other,  specifying  an  effective  date  of
termination which is not less than seven (7) days nor more than ninety (90) days
from the date such notice is given,  if the party  seeking to  terminate  is not
then in material default or breach hereof, upon either:

                    (a) an uncured Event of Default, or

                    (b) as provided in Section 12.15, or

                    (c)  upon the event that the party not seeking to  terminate
          makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors,  files or has
          filed  against  it a petition  for  bankruptcy,  reorganization  or an
          arrangement for the benefit of creditors,  or for the appointment of a
          receiver,   trustee  or  similar  creditors'  representative  for  the
          property or assets of such party under any federal or state insolvency
          law, which if filed against such party has not been  dismissed  within
          sixty (60) days thereof.


In the event  that the  non-defaulting  party  does not  exercise  such right of
termination  by  giving  such  written  notice  within  sixty  (60)  days of the
occurrence of an uncured Event of Default, then the Event of Default giving rise
to such right of  termination  shall be deemed  waived and the  Agreement  shall
continue in full force and effect.

         Section 9.2.      Certain Matters Upon Termination.

                    (a) Upon any termination of this  Agreement,  Licensee shall
have no  further  obligation  to provide to Time  Broker any  broadcast  time or
broadcast  transmission  facilities  and  Time  Broker  shall  have  no  further
obligations to make any payments to Licensee under Section 1.2 hereof.  Upon any
termination,  Time Broker shall be responsible  for all debts and obligations of
Time  Broker to third  parties  based upon the  purchase  of air time and use of
Licensee's  transmission  facilities  including,  without  limitation,  accounts
payable,  barter agreements and unaired  advertisements,  but not for Licensee's
federal,  state and local income and business franchise tax liabilities or taxes
levied upon Licensee's personal property. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary,  to the  extent  that any  invoice,  bill or  statement  submitted  to
Licensee  after the  termination  of this  Agreement or any payment made by Time
Broker prior to the termination of this Agreement  relates to expenses  incurred
in operating the

                                       13
<PAGE>


Stations,  for periods both before and after the  termination of this Agreement,
such expenses shall be prorated  between  Licensee and Time Broker in accordance
with the principle that Time Broker shall be responsible for expenses  allocable
to the period prior to the  termination  of this Agreement and Licensee shall be
responsible for expenses allocable to the period on and after the termination of
this  Agreement.  Such  proration  shall include an adjustment for Time Broker's
Trade-out  Agreements  only to the extent that Time Broker's Net Negative  Trade
Balance  exceeds  $50,000.  Each party agrees to  reimburse  the other party for
expenses  paid by the other party to the extent  appropriate  to  implement  the
proration of expenses pursuant to the preceding sentence.

                    (b) If this Agreement  terminates  other than as a result of
the Closing (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), Time Broker shall (i) assign
to Licensee and Licensee shall assume all Assigned  Contracts  (including  those
employment  contracts assumed by Time Broker pursuant to this Agreement) and all
renewals,  replacements  or other  contracts  entered in the ordinary  course of
business  relating to the Stations and customary  for radio  stations of similar
type between the Commencement Date and the date of termination of this Agreement
("Supplemental  Contracts")  in  effect  on the  date  of  such  termination  or
expiration;  (ii) be responsible for only those  obligations  under the Assigned
Contracts and Supplemental  Contracts  arising on or after the Commencement Date
and  prior to the  termination  of this  Agreement  and,  (iii)  terminate,  and
Licensee shall hire, all Transferred Employees in accordance with the principles
set forth in Section 3.5, except that, for purposes of this Section 9.2(b)(iii),
"Transferred  Employees"  shall not include any  employees  hired by Time Broker
pursuant to Section 3.5 who also perform substantial services for other stations
in the applicable market operated by Time Broker.

                    (c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 7.1 to the contrary,
no expiration or termination of this Agreement shall terminate the obligation of
each party to indemnify  the other for claims under  Article VII hereof or limit
or impair any party's rights to receive  payments due and owing  hereunder on or
before the date of such termination.

                                   ARTICLE X.
                                    REMEDIES

              In addition to a party's rights of  termination  hereunder (and in
addition to any other  remedies  available to it or provided  under law), in the
event of an uncured Event of Default with respect to either party, the other may
seek specific performance of this Agreement,  in which case the defaulting party
shall  waive the  defense in any such suit that the other  party has an adequate
remedy  at law and  interpose  no  opposition,  legal  or  otherwise,  as to the
propriety of specific performance as a remedy hereunder.

                                  ARTICLE XI.

provisions  hereof will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the  organizational  documents of Time Broker or any
judgment,  order, injunction,  decree,  regulation or ruling of any court or any
other  governmental  authority  to which Time Broker is subject or any  material

                                       15
<PAGE>

              11.2.4   Maintenance   of  Current   Operations.   The   Stations'

         Section  12.2.  No Waiver;  Remedies  Cumulative.  Except as  otherwise
provided  herein,  no failure or delay on the part of Licensee or Time Broker in
exercising any right or power hereunder  shall operate as a waiver thereof,  nor
any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or
discontinuance  of steps to enforce  such a right or power,  shall  preclude any
other or further  exercise  thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.

party  will  not  be  liable  for  any  failure  to  timely  perform  any of its
obligations  under this  Agreement  if such failure is due, in whole or in part,
directly or indirectly, to accidents,  fires, floods, governmental actions, war,
civil  disturbances,  other  causes  beyond  such  party's  control or any other
occurrence which would generally be considered an event of force majeure.

         Section  12.10.  Effect  of  this  Agreement.  This  Agreement  and the
Purchase Agreement,  together with the exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto
and a letter agreement among Time Broker and Sinclair Communications, Inc. dated
of even date  herewith,  set forth the entire  understanding  of the parties and
supersede  any  and  all  prior  written  or oral  agreements,  arrangements  or
understandings  relating  to  the  subject  matter  hereof.  No  representation,
promise,  inducement  or statement  of  intention  has been made by either party
which is not embodied in this  Agreement,  the Purchase  Agreement or the letter
agreement  referenced  above and  neither  party shall be bound by, or be liable
for, any alleged representation,  promise,  inducement or statement of intention
not  embodied  herein  unless  same  shall have been made  subsequent  hereto in
writing and signed by the party to be charged therewith. This Agreement shall be
binding  upon and inure to the  benefit  of the  parties  and  their  respective
successors and assigns.

         Section 12.11.  Severability.  Except as expressly set forth in Section
12.15,  if any  provision  contained  in this  Agreement  is held to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable  in any respect by any court or other  authority,  then
such  provision  shall be deemed  limited to the extent that such court or other
authority deems it reasonable and enforceable, and as so limited shall remain in
full force and  effect.  In the event that such court or other  authority  shall
deem any such provision  wholly  unenforceable,  this shall not affect any other
provision  hereof,  and this  Agreement  shall be construed as if such  invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or provisions had not been contained herein.

         Section 12.12. No Joint Venture.  The parties agree that nothing herein
shall constitute a joint venture or agency between them. The parties acknowledge
that call letters, trademarks and other intellectual property shall at all times
remain the  property  of the  respective  parties and that  neither  party shall

virtue of this Agreement (subject to Section 6.2).

         Section  12.13.  Damage  to  Stations.   In  the  event  of  damage  or
destruction to any of the Stations  (other than damage or destruction  caused by
Time  Broker),  Licensee  shall  proceed  to  repair,  replace  or  restore  the
applicable  Station to its  former  condition  as  promptly  as is  commercially
reasonable.  If Time Broker causes damage or destruction to any of the Stations,
Time Broker shall proceed to repair,  replace or restore the applicable  Station
to its former  condition  as promptly  as is  commercially  reasonable.  If Time
Broker must undertake  repairs,  replacements  or  restorations  pursuant to the
previous  sentence,  Licensee  shall  reimburse Time Broker for the cost of such
repairs,  replacements  or  restorations  out of the proceeds from any insurance
policies  maintained  by Licensee  that are  received by Licensee as a result of
such damage or destruction.  Licensee shall use reasonable efforts to effect the
maximum  possible  recovery for such damage or destruction  under such insurance
policies.

neither  Licensee nor any of their  employees  shall take any actions that might
impair the operations of Time Broker conducted  hereunder,  except to the extent
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as otherwise required by law.

         Section 12.15.  Regulatory Changes. In the event of any order or decree
of an  administrative  agency  or court  of  competent  jurisdiction,  including
without limitation any material change or clarification in FCC rules,  policies,
or  precedent,  that would  cause this  Agreement  to be invalid or violate  any
applicable  law, and such order or decree has become  effective and has not been
stayed, the parties will use their respective best efforts and negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement to the minimum  extent  necessary so as to comply
with such order or decree without material  economic  detriment to either party,
and this  Agreement,  as so  modified,  shall  then  continue  in full force and
effect. In the event that the parties are unable to agree upon a modification of
this  Agreement  so as to cause it to comply  with such order or decree  without
material  economic  detriment  to either  party,  then this  Agreement  shall be
terminated.

                                  SCHEDULE 1.1

                                   PROGRAMMING

         The Programming  shall consist of one hundred sixty-six (166) hours per
week on each of the  Stations  in an  entertainment  format to be chosen by Time
Broker,  subject to Article II of this Agreement.  The Programming shall include
(a) news and  weather  information;  (b) public  service  announcements;  (c) an
announcement in form sufficient to meet the station identification  requirements
of the FCC at the beginning of each hour; (d) an  announcement  at the beginning
of each segment of  Programming to indicate that program time has been purchased
by  Time  Broker;  and  (e) any  other  announcement  that  may be  required  by
applicable law or regulation. Time Broker shall maintain and deliver to Licensee
copies  of  all  programming   information,   including,   without   limitation,
information concerning portions of the Programming that are responsive to issues
of public  importance  identified  to Time  Broker by  Licensee,  necessary  for
Licensee to  maintain  its FCC public  inspection  file,  and all other  records
required to be kept by FCC rule or policy.  Time Broker  shall have the sole and
exclusive right to sell  advertising to be included in the Programming and shall
be entitled to retain all the revenues derived from the sale thereof,  provided,
however, that Licensee shall be entitled to sell such time as it deems necessary
to  comply  with the  political  advertising  rules of the FCC in the  event the
Programming does not comply with such rules.

         Notwithstanding  any other  provision  of this  Agreement,  Time Broker
recognizes  that Licensee has certain  obligations  to broadcast  programming to
meet the needs and  interests of the  communities  of license for the  Stations.
Licensee  shall have the right to air  specific  programming  on issues of local
importance to the  communities.  Nothing in this  Agreement  shall  abrogate the
unrestricted  authority of Licensee to discharge its  obligations  to the public
and to comply  with the laws,  rules and  policies  of the FCC with  respect  to
meeting the ascertained needs and interests of the public. Accordingly, Licensee
may air or cause Time Broker to produce and present under Licensee's supervision
two (2) hours a week on each of the  Stations  such public  affairs  programming
that  responds to the needs and  interests of  listeners in each such  Station's
community of license. Such public affairs programming shall be presented between
6:00 a.m.  and 9:00 a.m. on Saturdays  and/or  Sundays or at such other times as
the public interest may require.

                                  COMPENSATION

         (A) Beginning on the Commencement Date, Time Broker shall pay a monthly
fee (the  "Monthly  Payment") in the amount of the Monthly  Projected  Broadcast
Cash Flow (as defined below) for the Stations.  The "Monthly Projected Broadcast
Cash Flow" for the Stations  shall be the  broadcast  cash flow for the Stations
that is projected  by the parties in good faith for the term of this  Agreement,
and is expressly agreed to equal $631,500 per month.

              In the event that the Commencement Date occurs on a day other than
the first day of a month,  the initial  Monthly Payment shall be an amount equal
to the Monthly Payment as determined  above multiplied by a ratio, the numerator
of which is the number of days between the Commencement  Date and the end of the
month in which the Commencement  Date occurs and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the month in which the Commencement  Date occurs. In the event
that the day in which the term of this  Agreement  ends is not the last day of a
month,  the  Monthly  Payment  for the month in which such day  occurs  shall be
similarly prorated.

         (B)  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in this  Agreement  (specifically
including Paragraph (C) to this Schedule 1.2 below), Time Broker shall reimburse
Licensee  for  all  of its  ordinary  and  customary  expenses  (excluding  only
Licensee's  federal,  state and local income  taxes)  incurred in operating  the
Stations  (the  "Operating  Expenses"),  including  but not  limited  to,  rent,
utilities (excluding  telephone expenses incurred by Licensee),  maintenance and
repairs at each of the Stations' studio and transmitter sites,  insurance on the
Stations' equipment,  insurance deductibles on claims on the Stations' equipment
payable in respect of damage to the Stations'  equipment  caused by Time Broker,
and ad  valorem  property  taxes.  Licensee  shall  bill  Time  Broker  for such
Operating  Expenses on a monthly  basis by delivery of a statement in reasonable
detail with back-up invoices,  payment for which shall be due within thirty (30)
days of such billing.

         (C) During the term of this Agreement,  Licensee shall make all capital
expenditures  required to maintain the Stations consistent with past practice of
the  Stations and as required to make the  Stations  operate in full  compliance
with all FCC rules and  regulations.  At the Closing of the Purchase  Agreement,
Time Broker shall reimburse Licensee for all costs of such capital expenditures.

         Time Broker agrees to cooperate  with Licensee in the  broadcasting  of

and regulations.

          I.   No Plugola or Payola. The broadcast of any material for which any
               money,  service or other  valuable  consideration  is directly or
               indirectly  paid,  or promised to or charged or accepted  by, the
               Time Broker, from any person, shall be prohibited, unless, at the
               time  the  same is  broadcast,  it is  announced  as paid  for or
               furnished by such person.

          II.  Political   Broadcasting.   Within   thirty   (30)  days  of  the
               Commencement  Date,  Time Broker shall  distribute to all parties
               making  requests  for  the  purchase  of  political  time  on the
               Stations,   and  provide  Licensee  with,  a  written   political
               advertising  disclosure  statement  which  fully  and  accurately
               discloses how the Time Broker sells  programming  and advertising
               time and which makes parties purchasing political programming and
               advertising time fully aware of the lowest unit charge provisions
               of Section 315 of the Communications  Act. In addition,  at least
               thirty  (30) days  before the start of any  primary  or  election
               campaign,  Time  Broker  will  clear with the  Stations'  general
               manager  the rate Time Broker will charge for the time to be sold
               to  candidates  to make  certain  that  the  rate  charged  is in
               conformance with the applicable law and station policy.

          III. Required   Announcements.   Time  Broker  shall   broadcast   (i)
               announcements in a form satisfactory to Licensee at the beginning
               of each  hour  to  identify  the  Stations  and  (ii)  any  other
               announcements  that  may  be  required  by  law,  regulation,  or
               Licensee's station policy.

          IV.  No  Illegal  Announcements.   No  announcements,   broadcasts  or
               promotions  prohibited  by  federal,  state or local law shall be
               made over the Stations.  This prohibition  specifically includes,
               but is not limited to, any and all unlawful  programming or other
               broadcast   material   concerning   tobacco  or  alcohol  related
               products.   The  airing  of  any  broadcast  material  concerning
               contests, lotteries or games must be conducted in accordance with
               all  applicable  law,  including FCC rules and  regulations.  Any
               obscene,  indecent, or fraudulent programming is prohibited.  All
               sponsored   programming  or  other  broadcast  material  must  be
               identified in accordance with applicable law, including FCC rules
               and regulations.


<PAGE>


          V.   Licensee Discretion Paramount.  In accordance with the Licensee's
               responsibility  under  the  Communications  Act and the rules and
               regulations of the FCC,  Licensee reserves the right to reject or
               terminate any programming (including  advertising) proposed to be
               presented  or  being  presented  over  the  Stations  which is in
               conflict  with  station  policy  or  which in  Licensee's  or its
               general manager's  reasonable judgment would not serve the public
               interest.

          In any case where questions of policy or  interpretation  arise,  Time
Broker  should  submit  the same to  Licensee  for  decision  before  making any
commitments in connection therewith.

terminated  by  MBC,  if  MBC is  not  then  in  material  breach  of any of its
obligations  hereunder,  upon ten (10) days  written  notice to Buyer,  upon the
occurrence of any one of the following:

                              (bn)  Conditions.  If,  on  the  date  that  would
otherwise  be  the  Closing  Date,  any  of  the  conditions  precedent  to  the
obligations of MBC and the MBC Sellers set forth in Section 7.2 of this Purchase
Agreement have not been satisfied or waived in writing by MBC;

                              (bo) Judgments. If there shall be in effect on the

                              (bp)  TBA.  In the event  that the TBA has  become
effective  and  thereafter  Buyer has breached  any of its material  obligations
thereunder,  and, upon notice  specifying such breach,  Buyer fails to cure such
breach within forty (40) days of such notice; or

                              (bq) Expiration.  If the transaction  contemplated
herein  has not  closed  within  three (3) years  from the date of the  Purchase
Agreement.

                        8.12.Termination  by Buyer. This Purchase  Agreement may
be  terminated  by  Buyer,  if  Buyer  is not  then in  material  breach  of its
obligations  hereunder,  upon ten (10)  days  written  notice  to MBC,  upon the
occurrence of any of the following:

                              (br)  Conditions.   If  on  the  date  that  would
otherwise be the Closing Date any of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of Buyer  set  forth in  Section  7.1 of this  Purchase  Agreement  has not been
satisfied or waived in writing by Buyer: provided,  that Buyer may not terminate
because of any breach of a representation  or warranty by MBC or the MBC Sellers
if such breach is caused by the conduct of Buyer under the TBA;

                              (bs) Judgments. If there shall be in effect on the
date that would  otherwise be the Closing Date any  judgment,  decree,  or order
that would prevent or make unlawful the Closing.

                              (bt)  TBA.  In the event  that the TBA has  become
effective and thereafter  the Company,  MBC or the MBC Sellers have breached any
of their material obligations



<PAGE>



thereunder,  and, upon notice specifying such breach,  the Company or MBC or the
MBC  Sellers,  as the case may be,  fails to cure such breach  within forty (40)
days of such notice; or


                              (bu) Time Limit. If the  transaction  contemplated
herein has not  closed  within  three (3) years  from the date of this  Purchase
Agreement.

                    73.3.Right to Cure.  Notwithstanding  anything herein to the
contrary, no material breach shall be deemed to have occurred until the party in
breach has been notified in writing by the other party and provided  twenty (20)
days to cure such breach:  provided,  that, in the event a cure would reasonably
require  more than  twenty (20) days,  the party in breach  shall be afforded an
additional twenty (20) days if such party timely initiates reasonable efforts to
effect a cure and provides the other party with  satisfactory  evidence that the
cure will be effectuated during the extended period; and provided further,  that
a party in breach can pay the other  party a sum  certain if the payment of such
sum will cure the breach prior to or at the Closing;  provided further, that the
Closing  Date  will be  extended  to allow a party in breach to effect a cure in
accordance with this Section.  This right to cure provided in this Section shall
not be applicable to any payment due from the Buyer to MBC.

                    73.4.MBC's Rights on Buyer's  Termination.  If this Purchase
Agreement  is  terminated  by  MBC  because  of  Buyer's  breach  of a  material
obligation  hereunder,  MBC shall be entitled  to payment  from the Buyer of all
sums then due and payable  hereunder (not including the Purchase Price) plus any
and all remedies available to MBC at law or equity:  provided, that any payments
made by Buyer  under  Section  2.3(a)(i)(B)  hereof  shall  constitute  a credit
against any damages awarded to MBC.

                    73.5.Buyer's  Rights on MBC's Termination.  If this Purchase
Agreement is  terminated  by Buyer  because of the  Company's,  MBC's or the MBC
Sellers' breach of a material obligation  hereunder,  Buyer shall have the right
of specific  performance as its exclusive remedy,  except as otherwise set forth
below. The parties recognize that this Purchase Agreement  contemplates the sale
of unique assets and that  monetary  damages would not be adequate to compensate
Buyer for its injury. If any action is brought by Buyer to enforce this Purchase
Agreement,  MBC,  the Company  and the MBC Sellers  shall each waive the defense
that there is an adequate remedy at law.  Notwithstanding the above, if specific
performance  is not  available,  or if a breach by MBC,  the  Company or the MBC
Sellers of any of their obligations under this Purchase Agreement causes the FCC
Licenses  to be  revoked,  forfeited  or  materially  impaired,  Buyer  shall be
reimbursed  all payments made by Buyer under Section  2.3(c) hereof and may also
pursue any and all remedies available to it in law or equity against MBC.

                    73.6.Litigation  Expenses. In the event either party files a
lawsuit or other formal legal  proceeding  for any remedy  available  under this
Purchase Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement from
the other party of all reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred thereby.

                    73.7.Return  of Deposits.  In the event (i) the  transaction
contemplated by this Purchase Agreement has not closed within three (3) years of
the date hereof and neither  party is in  material  breach,  or (ii) the parties
mutually  agree to terminate this  Agreement,  upon 


<PAGE>



sale of the FCC  Licenses and other Assets of the Station or the Stock of MBC or
the Company,  MBC shall,  after  payment of all sums due under the Loan,  pay to
Buyer  from all monies  retained  the  amount of all of  Buyer's  payments  made
pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof.

                    73.8.Condition of MBC.  Notwithstanding  any other provision
of this  Purchase  Agreement or any related  document  described in Section 11.8
hereof, and except for the representations and warranties contained in Section 3
hereof,  Buyer  acknowledges (i) that the MBC Sellers have not and do not assume
any  individual  liability  hereunder,  and (ii) Buyer is aware of the financial
condition of MBC at the time of execution of this Purchase Agreement,  including
MBC's lack of  significant  capital  other  than the Loan and that,  but for the
provisions of Section 2.3 hereof,  MBC may not have  sufficient  reserves to pay
its debts in the  ordinary  course as they come  due.  In  consideration  of the
foregoing  and of MBC's  and the MBC  Sellers'  willingness  to  enter  into the
transaction  contemplated  hereby, Buyer expressly waives against all or any one
of the MBC  Sellers,  any  demand,  claim,  action,  suit,  charge,  proceeding,
assessment or judgment, whether based in contract, tort, or any other common law
or statutory  cause of action,  except to the extent that the MBC Sellers may be
liable  pursuant  to  Section 3 hereof  for  breach of the  representations  and
warranties contained therein.

               SECTION 9.  INDEMNIFICATION.

                    79.1.Survival.  All representations and warranties of Buyer,
MBC and the MBC Sellers  herein and all  covenants  of Buyer and MBC herein with
respect to periods prior to Closing shall be deemed continuing  representations,
warranties and covenants,  and shall survive the Closing.  Any investigations by
or on behalf of any party hereto shall not constitute a waiver as to enforcement
of  any  representation,  warranty,  or  covenant  contained  in  this  Purchase
Agreement.  No notice or information  delivered by either party shall affect the
other party's right to rely on any representation, warranty, or covenant made by
such  party  or  relieve  such  party of any  obligations  under  this  Purchase
Agreement  as  the  result  of a  breach  of  any  of  its  representations  and
warranties.

                    79.2.Indemnification  by MBC Sellers. After the Closing, and
regardless of any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of Buyer or any
information  Buyer may have, the MBC Sellers jointly and severally  hereby agree
to  indemnify  and hold Buyer  harmless  against and with  respect to, and shall
reimburse Buyer for any and all losses,  liabilities,  or damages resulting from
any  material  breach  of any  warranty  or  representation  of the MBC  Sellers
contained in Section 3 of this Purchase Agreement, and any and all out-of-pocket
costs and expenses,  including  reasonable legal fees and expenses,  incident to
any action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand, assessment, or judgment incident to
the foregoing or incurred in investigating or attempting to avoid the same or to
oppose the imposition thereof, or in enforcing this indemnity.

                    79.3.Indemnification   by  Buyer.  After  the  Closing,  and
regardless of any  investigation  made at any time by or on behalf of MBC or any
information MBC may have, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold MBC harmless
against and with respect to, and shall reimburse MBC for:


<PAGE>


                              (bv) any and all losses,  liabilities,  or damages
resulting  from  any  material  breach  of any  warranty  or  representation  or
nonfulfillment  of any covenant by Buyer contained herein or in any certificate,
document, or instrument delivered to MBC hereunder; and

                              (bw) any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses,
including  reasonable  legal fees and  expenses,  incident to any action,  suit,
proceeding,  claim, demand, assessment, or judgment incident to the foregoing or
incurred  in  investigating  or  attempting  to avoid the same or to oppose  the
imposition thereof, or in enforcing this indemnity.

                    79.34.Procedure  for  Indemnification.   The  procedure  for
indemnification shall be as follows:

                              (bx) Notice.  The party  claiming  indemnification
(the   "Claimant")   shall   promptly  give  notice  to  the  party  from  which
indemnification  is claimed  (the  "Indemnifying  Party") of any claim,  whether
between the parties or brought by a third party, specifying in reasonable detail
the factual  basis for the claim.  If the claim  relates to an action,  suit, or
proceeding filed by a third party against  Claimant,  such notice shall be given
by Claimant  within five (5) business  days after  receipt of written  notice of
such action, suit, or proceeding was given to Claimant:  provided, that no delay
in providing  such notice shall excuse any party's  indemnification  obligations
hereunder,  unless such delay  prejudices  the  Indemnifying  Party and then the
Indemnifying  Party's  obligations  shall be reduced  only to the extent of such
prejudice.

                              (by)  Investigation  and Payment.  With respect to
claims solely between the parties, following receipt of notice from the Claimant
of a claim,  the  Indemnifying  Party  shall have  thirty (30) days to make such
investigation  of the  claim  as  the  Indemnifying  Party  deems  necessary  or
desirable.  For  purposes of such  investigation,  the  Claimant  agrees to make
available  to the  Indemnifying  Party and its  authorized  representatives  the
information  relied  upon by the  Claimant  to  substantiate  the claim.  If the
Claimant and the  Indemnifying  Party agree at or prior to the expiration of the
30-day period (or any mutually  agreed upon  extension  thereof) to the validity
and amount of such claim,  the Indemnifying  Party shall  immediately pay to the
Claimant  the full amount of the claim.  If the  Claimant  and the  Indemnifying
Party do not agree  within  the  30-day  period  (or any  mutually  agreed  upon
extension thereof), the Claimant may seek appropriate remedy at law or equity.

                              (bz) Third Party Claims. With respect to any claim
by a third party as to which the Claimant is entitled to  indemnification  under
this Purchase Agreement,  the Indemnifying Party shall have the right at its own
expense,  to participate in or assume control of the defense of such claim,  and
the Claimant  shall  cooperate  fully with the  Indemnifying  Party,  subject to
reimbursement for actual out-of-pocket  expenses incurred by the Claimant as the
result of any  request by the  Indemnifying  Party.  If the  Indemnifying  Party
elects to assume control of the defense of any third-party  claim,  the Claimant
shall  have the right to  participate  in the  defense  of such claim at its own
expense.  If the  Indemnifying  Party  fails  to  assume  control  or  otherwise
participate  in the defense of any  third-party  claim within ten (10)  business
days of receiving  notice  under  subsection  (a) of this  section  (unless some
action  is  required  prior to such 




<PAGE>

date),  it shall be bound by the results  obtained in good faith by the Claimant
with respect to such claim.

                              (ca)  Expeditious  Action.  If  a  claim,  whether
between the parties or by a third party,  requires immediate action, the parties
will make every  reasonable  effort to reach a decision with respect  thereto as
expeditiously as possible.

                              (cb) Coverage. The indemnification rights provided
in  Section  10.2 and  Section  10.3  shall  extend  to the  members,  partners,
shareholders,  officers, directors, employees,  representatives,  and affiliated
entities of any Claimant:  provided,  that for the purpose of the procedures set
forth in this Section 10.4, any indemnification  claims by such parties shall be
made by and through the Claimant.

                    79.345.Special   Indemnity   with   Respect   to  the  Koker
Agreement.  In the event that either party hereto learns of a material breach of
any  representation  or warranty  contained in Section 3 of the Koker  Agreement
(such breach having occurred at or before the Consummation thereof),  such party
shall notify the other party,  and MBC shall assert a claim  against the Sellers
for indemnity  pursuant to the Koker  Agreement.  On or before the Closing Date,
any proceeds  derived  therefrom shall be first allocated to remedy the material
breach giving rise to such claim, with any remaining amount held in a segregated
account for the benefit of the Lenders, or, at Closing, for Buyer.

                    79.346.Time   Limits.   Notwithstanding   anything  in  this
Purchase  Agreement to the contrary,  neither party shall indemnify or otherwise
be liable to the  other  party  with  respect  to any claim for any  breach of a
representation or warranty,  or for the breach of any covenant contained in this
Purchase  Agreement,  unless notice of the claim is received  within three years
after the Closing Date.

               SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS

                    79.10.1.Fees  and  Expenses.  Buyer  shall  pay  any and all
filing fees,  transfer taxes,  document  stamps,  or other charges levied by any
governmental  entity on the  fulfillment  of the terms  and  conditions  of this
Purchase  Agreement,  including but not limited to (i) fees  associated with the

exhibits  hereto,  all  documents,  certificates,  and other  instruments  to be

Agreement  and the TBA  collectively  represent  the  entire  understanding  and

signed by the party  granting such waiver,  but such waiver or failure to insist
upon strict compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement,  or  condition  shall not  operate as a waiver of, or  estoppel  with

Settlement Agreement dated as of January 17, 1997 (collectively the "Shareholder
Settlement  Agreements").  Except as otherwise  provided in this Section 2.2(b),
the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shall be  determined  in  accordance  with GAAP
consistently  applied with prior periods, and shall be consistent with the books
and records of the Company,  MTR and MMP. The amount of cash,  cash  equivalents
and cash items  retained  to cover the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shall not be
considered Excluded Assets.

                      (i) MMP  shall  deliver  to  Purchaser  at the  Closing  a
certificate (the "Estimate  Certificate")  setting forth its good faith estimate
of the Closing Date Liabilities,  which shall be used to determine the amount of

forth on the  Accountant's  Certificate  shall be final unless  Sellers'  Agents
notify  Purchaser within thirty (30) days from their receipt of the Accountant's
Certificate that they dispute the Accountant's  Certificate.  If Sellers' Agents
and Purchaser are unable to agree on the amount of the Closing Date  Liabilities
within  fifteen  (15) days after  Sellers'  Agents'  notice,  the parties  shall
jointly  appoint and engage an  independent  accountant  of national or regional
repute (the  "Independent  Accountant") to perform an independent  evaluation of
the Closing Date Liabilities.  The findings of the Independent  Accountant as to
the amount of the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto.

                      (iii)  Upon  the   determination   of  the  Closing   Date
Liabilities  becoming  final which is different  from the  Estimate  Certificate
either (A)  Purchaser  shall be entitled to a payment  from the  Indemnification
Escrow  equal to the amount by which the  aggregate  amount of the Closing  Date
Liabilities   exceeds  the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shown  on  the  Estimate
Certificate,  taking  into  account any  amounts  paid from the  Indemnification
Escrow under  provisions  similar to this  provision in the MTC  Agreement,  the
Management  Agreement  and the MRI  Agreement,  or (B)  Purchaser  shall  pay to
Disbursing  Agent an amount  by which  the  aggregate  amount  of  Closing  Date
Liabilities  shown  on  the  Estimate   Certificate  exceeds  the  Closing  Date
Liabilities as finally determined.

                      (iv) For  purposes  of  determining  the amount of the Tax
liabilities of the Company to be included in the Closing Date  Liabilities  (the
"Closing  Date Tax  Liabilities"),  such Tax  liabilities  shall include all Tax
liabilities of the Company that are attributable to items of income, gain, loss,
deduction and credit of MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities  accruing through and
including the Closing Date,  notwithstanding  that such items may be reported by
the Company,  Purchaser,  or  Purchaser's  Affiliates in Taxable


                                       5
<PAGE>

Periods  ending  after the  Closing  Date.  The  amount  of the Tax  liabilities
attributable  to the Tax  items of MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities  shall be
determined  by  assuming  that the  taxable  years  of MMP and the FCC  Licensee
Entities,  as well as the taxable  years of the Company,  end as of the close of
business on the Closing Date and by assuming Purchaser's compliance with Section
8.8. The Closing Date Tax  Liabilities  shall not include,  and Purchaser  shall
have no rights of  Indemnification  rights under Section 10 with respect to, any
Tax Liabilities arising from the MMP II Distribution

                      (v) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in
this  Section  2.2,  the final  determination  of the Closing  Date  Liabilities
hereunder  shall not  affect  Purchaser's  indemnification  rights  pursuant  to
Section 10 to the extent the actual  Closing Date  Liabilities  exceed the final
determination thereunder.

                                       15
<PAGE>



                  a.  MMP  ORGANIZATION  AND  GOOD  STANDING.  MMP is a  limited
liability company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of Virginia
and has full corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now
being  conducted  and to own and use the  assets  owned  and used by it.  To the
extent required by law, MMP is qualified as a foreign limited  liability company
and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct
of its business or the ownership of its properties  requires such qualification.
MMP  owns  98% of the  outstanding  partnership  interests  in the FCC  Licensee
Entities.

                  b.  CAPITALIZATION  OF MMP. The  designations of each class of
the  membership  units  of MMP and the  number  of  authorized  and  issued  and
outstanding membership units thereof is as described on Schedule 5.3b to the MRI
Agreement.  All membership units have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable  and are held of record by the  respective  members  of MMP as set
forth on Schedule  5.3b to the MRI  Agreement.  Except as  described on Schedule
5.3b,  (i) there are no other issued or  outstanding  equity  securities of MMP;
(ii) there are no membership or value  appreciation  rights,  phantom membership
rights,  profit  participation  rights,  or other similar rights with respect to
membership units outstanding; and (iii) there are no other issued or outstanding
membership  interests or other  securities of MMP convertible or exchangeable at
any time into equity  securities  of MMP.  Except as set forth in the  Operating
Agreement of MMP as amended,  MMP is not subject to any commitment or obligation
that would  require the issuance or sale of additional  membership  interests or
membership  units of MMP at any time  under  options,  subscriptions,  warrants,
rights or any other  obligations.  Schedule 5.3b to the MRI Agreement sets forth
the equity interests in any corporation, partnership, limited liability company,
joint venture or other entity owned by MMP.

                  c.   ORGANIZATION  AND   CAPITALIZATION  OF  THE  FCC  LICENSE
ENTITIES.  Each FCC License Entity is a limited  partnership  duly organized and
validly  existing  under the laws of the  Commonwealth  of Virginia and has full
partnership  power and  authority  to carry on its  business  as it is now being
conducted  and to own and use the assets  owned and used by it. Each FCC License
Entity is qualified as a foreign  corporation  and is in good standing under the
laws of each  jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership
of its properties requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material  Adverse Effect.  No FCC License Entity owns
any direct or indirect  subsidiaries.  MMP is the sole general  partner and owns
ninety-eight  percent  (98%)  of the  partnership  interests  of each of the FCC
License  Entities.  MTC is the sole limited partner and owns two percent (2%) of
the partnership  interests of each of the FCC License  Entities other than RLLP.
MRI is the sole  limited  partner and owns two percent  (2%) of the  partnership
interests of RLLP. All such  partnership  interests have been validly issued and
are  fully  paid and  nonassessable  and are held of  record  by the  respective
partners as set forth above. There are no (i) other issued or outstanding equity
securities of any FCC License  Entity,  (ii)  partnership or value  appreciation
rights,  phantom  partnership


                                       16
<PAGE>

rights,  profit  participation  rights,  or other similar rights with respect to
partnership   interests  outstanding  and  (iii)  other  issued  or  outstanding
partnership  interests or other securities of any FCC License Entity convertible
or exchangeable  at any time into equity  securities of such FCC License Entity.
No FCC License  Entity is subject to any  commitment  or  obligation  that would
require the  issuance or sale of  additional  partnership  interests  of any FCC
License Entity at any time under options, subscriptions, warrants, rights or any
other  obligations.  No FCC  License  Entity  holds any equity  interest  in any
corporation,  partnership,  limited  liability  company,  joint venture or other
entity.

                  d. NO  CONFLICTS.  Except as described on Schedule 5.3d to the
MRI  Agreement,  neither the  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement nor the
consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  will (i)  violate  any
provision of the articles of organization  or operating  agreement of MMP or the
limited  partnership  agreements of the FCC Licensee Entities,  (ii) violate any
provision of applicable  material law, rule and  regulation,  or (iii)  conflict
with or result in a breach  of,  or give rise to a right of  termination  of, or
accelerate the performance required by the terms of any judgment, court order or
consent decree, or any material agreement,  indenture, mortgage or instrument to
which either MMP or any FCC Licensee  Entity is a party or to which any of their
property is subject,  or constitute a default  thereunder,  where such conflict,
breach, right of termination,  acceleration or default would have a MMP Material
Adverse Effect.

                  e.  REAL  PROPERTY.  The  MMP  Real  Property  owned  and  all
leaseholds  and  other  interests  in MMP Real  Property  used or  useful in the
Business and all buildings, structures, towers, and improvements thereon used or
useful in the  business  and  operations  of the Stations are listed on Schedule
5.3e  to the  MRI  Agreement  and,  except  for  Permitted  Encumbrances  and as

simple title (insurable at standard rates by a reputable national title insurer)
to all fee estates  included in the Real  Property,  and good title to all other
MMP Real Property,  in each case clear of all liens.  The FCC Licensee  Entities
own no real property, leaseholds or other interests in real property. No portion
of the MMP Real  Property or any  building,  structure,  fixture or  improvement
thereon is the subject of, or affected by, any  condemnation,  eminent domain or
inverse  condemnation  proceeding  currently  instituted or pending or, to MMP's
Knowledge, threatened.

         MMP has a valid leasehold interest in all leased property and subleases
to  which it is a party,  and MMP is the  owner  and  holder  of all the  leased
property  purported  to be granted by such  leases and  subleases.  The MMP Real
Property  and the  leases  and  subleases  listed  on  Schedule  5.3e to the MRI
Agreement  constitute all of the real property  owned,  leased or used by MMP in
the business and  operations of the Stations,  which is material to the business
and  operations  of the  Stations.  The Sellers  have  delivered or caused to be
delivered to the Purchaser correct and complete copies of the deeds,  leases and
subleases  listed in Schedule  5.3e to the MRI  Agreement.  With respect to each
lease

and sublease listed in Schedule 5.3e to the MRI Agreement:

                      (a) the  lease  or  sublease  is  legal,  valid,  binding,
enforceable,  and in full force and effect in all material  respects  subject to
applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium and other laws
affecting  the rights of  creditors  generally  and to the  exercise of judicial
discretion in accordance with several principles of equity (whether applied by a
court of law or equity);

                      (b) MMP and,  to MMP's  knowledge,  no other  party to the
lease or sublease is in material  breach or default,  and no event has  occurred
which,  with  notice or lapse of time,  would  constitute  a material  breach or
default or permit termination, modification, or acceleration thereunder;

                      (c) MMP and,  to MMP's  knowledge,  no other  party to the

are no material disputes, oral agreements,  or forbearance programs in effect as
to the lease or sublease;

                      (e)  except  as set  forth  on  Schedule  5.3e  to the MRI
Agreement, MMP has not assigned,  transferred,  conveyed,  mortgaged,  deeded in
trust, or encumbered any interest in the leasehold or subleasehold; and

                      (f) all facilities leased or subleased thereunder material
to the operation of the Stations  have  received all  approvals of  governmental
authorities  (including  material  licenses and permits)  required in connection
with the operation thereof,  and have been operated and maintained in accordance
with applicable laws, rules, and regulations in all material respects.

                  f.  PERSONAL  PROPERTY.  Schedule  5.3f  lists  as of the date
hereof all items of Personal  Property  having a fair market  value in excess of
$5,000.00.  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3f to the MRI  Agreement,  MMP has
good and  marketable  title to all of its  material  items of tangible  personal
property  and assets used or useful by MMP  located on its  premises or shown on
the MMP Financial Statements are free and clear of all liens, security interests
and encumbrances  other than those that would not materially affect  Purchaser's
use or  ownership of such  personal  property  after the  Closing.  The tangible
personal  property of MMP has been maintained in accordance with normal industry
practice  and is in good  condition  and  repair  given  the age and use of such
property  (subject to normal wear and tear) and is adequate  for its present use
by MMP.

                  g. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MMP has provided or made available to

                  h.  FCC.  MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities  have  been  and
currently


                                       20
<PAGE>

are  operated in material  compliance  with the terms of the FCC  Licenses,  the
Communications  Act of 1934, as amended,  and applicable rules,  regulations and
policies of the FCC ("FCC Rules and Regulations").  All FCC Licenses, a true and
complete list of which is set forth on Schedule 5.3h to the MRI  Agreement,  and
true and complete copies of each of which have been delivered to Purchaser,  are
valid and in full force and effect.  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3h to the
MRI Agreement,  no application,  action or proceeding is pending for the renewal
or modification of any of the FCC Licenses and, to Sellers' and MMP's Knowledge,
there is not now before the FCC any  investigation  or complaint  against MMP or
the FCC Licensee Entities relating to the Stations,  the unfavorable  resolution
of which would impair the  qualifications  of the FCC Licensee  Entities to hold
any FCC  Licenses.  Except as set forth on Schedule  5.3h to the MRI  Agreement,
there is no  proceeding  pending  before  the FCC,  and there is no  outstanding
notice of  violation  from the FCC with respect to the  Stations.  Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.3h to the MRI Agreement, no order or notice of violation has
been  issued by any  governmental  entity  which  permits,  revocation,  adverse
modification or termination of any FCC License.  Except as set forth on Schedule
5.3h to the MRI  Agreement  and  except  for those  conditions  or  restrictions
appearing on the face of the FCC Licenses,  or other  licenses,  none of the FCC
Licenses or other  licenses is subject to any  restriction  or  condition  which
would  limit the  operation  of the  Stations  as  currently  operated.  The FCC
Licenses  listed in Schedule  5.3h to the MRI  Agreement are currently in effect
and are not  subject to any liens,  or other  encumbrances.  No license  renewal
applications are pending with respect to any of the FCC Licenses. As of the date
hereof,  Sellers, the Company,  MMP, and the FCC License Entities have no reason
to believe that the FCC would not renew the FCC Licenses in the ordinary  course
for a full license term without any adverse  conditions,  upon the timely filing
of appropriate  applications  and payment of the required  filing fee. As of the
date hereof,  Sellers,  the Company,  MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities have no
reason to  believe  that the FCC would  not  grant  the FCC  Application  in the
ordinary  course without any adverse  conditions.  All documents  required by 47
C.F.R.  Section 73.3526 to be kept in each Station's public inspection files are
in such file,  and such file will be  maintained in proper order and complete up
to and through the Closing Date.

                  i.  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY.  Set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the
MRI  Agreement  is a  complete  list of all  Intellectual  Property  owned by or
licensed to MMP on the date hereof  material to the  operations of the Stations.
To MMP's  Knowledge,  except as otherwise  set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the MRI
Agreement,  MMP owns such  Intellectual  Property free and clear of any royalty,
lien,  encumbrance  or charge and does not interfere  with the rights of others.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the MRI Agreement,  MMP has not received
any written notice or written claim that any such  Intellectual  Property is not
valid or enforceable,  or of any infringement  upon or conflict with any patent,
trademark,  service  mark,  copyright  or trade name of any third  party by MMP.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the MRI Agreement, MMP has not given any
notice  of  infringement  to  any  third  party  with  respect  to  any  of  the
Intellectual  Property and to MMP's Knowledge no


                                       21

<PAGE>

such infringement exists. There is no Intellectual Property owned by or licensed
to the FCC Licensee Entities.

                  j. EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLANS.  With respect,  as applicable,  to
Benefit Plans and Benefit Arrangements:

                      (a)  Schedule  5.3j to the MRI  Agreement  completely  and
accurately  lists  all MMP  Plans  and MMP  Benefit  Arrangements  currently  in
existence  and  specifically  identifies  any that are  Qualified  Plans.  Since
January  1,  1996  (the  date  of  formation  of  MMP),  MMP has  maintained  or
contributed  solely to the  Qualified  Plans listed on Schedule  5.3j to the MRI
Agreement. The Qualified Plans listed on Schedule 5.3j to the MRI Agreement have
always  qualified in form and  operation  under Code  Section  401(a) and have a
currently applicable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and
its trust has always  been  exempt  under Code  Section  501,  and  nothing  has
occurred  with  respect to such plan and trust that could cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption or the imposition of any liability, lien, penalty, or
tax under ERISA or the Code.

                      (b) Each MMP Plan  and each MMP  Benefit  Arrangement  has
been  maintained  in  accordance  with its  constituent  documents  and with all
applicable  provisions of the Code,  ERISA and other  domestic and foreign laws,
including  federal,  state, and foreign  securities laws and all laws respecting
reporting and disclosure. No MMP Plan holds employer securities.

                      (c) Neither  MMP nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has  sponsored,
maintained, or had any liability (direct or indirect, actual or contingent) with
respect to any Benefit  Plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA.  Neither MMP nor any
ERISA  Affiliate has never made or been obligated to make, or reimbursed or been
obligated to reimburse another employer for,  contributions to any multiemployer
plan (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)).  MMP has no liability (whether actual,
contingent,   or  otherwise)  with  respect  to  any  Benefit  Plan  or  Benefit
Arrangement that is not a MMP Benefit Arrangement or with respect to any Benefit
Plan  sponsored or maintained (or that has been or should have been sponsored or
maintained) by any ERISA Affiliate;  and no facts exist that could reasonably be
expected to result in such liability, as a result of termination,  withdrawal or
funding waiver with respect to any such plan, program, or arrangements.

                      (d) There are no pending  claims or lawsuits by,  against,
or relating to any non-MMP  Benefit Plans or non-MMP Benefit  Arrangements  that
would,  if  successful,  result in liability  for MMP, and no claims or lawsuits
(other than routine  benefit  claims) have been asserted,  instituted or, to the
knowledge of Sellers and the Company  after due inquiry of MMP,  threatened  by,
against,  or relating to any MMP Plan or MMP  Benefit  Arrangement,  and MMP has
advised  Sellers and the Company  that MMP does not have  knowledge  of any fact
that  could  form the basis  for any such  claim or  lawsuit.  MMP Plans


                                       22
<PAGE>

and MMP Benefit  Arrangements  are not presently under audit or examination (and
have  not  received   notice  of  a  potential  audit  or  examination)  by  any
governmental authority, and no matters are pending with respect to the Qualified
Plan under any governmental compliance programs.

                      (e) No MMP Plan or MMP Benefit  Arrangement  contains  any
provision  or is  subject  to any law that  would  give rise to any  vesting  of
benefits,  severance,  termination, or other payments or liabilities as a result
of the  transactions  this Agreement  contemplates,  and MMP has not declared or
paid any bonus or other  incentive  compensation  or  established  any severance
plan, program, or arrangement in contemplation of the transactions  contemplated
by this  Agreement,  the MRI  Agreement,  the  Management  Agreement  or the MTC
Agreement.

                      (f) With  respect  to each MMP  Plan,  there  have been no
violations  of  Code  Section  4975 or  ERISA  Sections  404 or 406 as to  which
successful  claims would result in any liability for MMP or any Person  required
to be indemnified by it.

                      (g) MMP has made all  required  contributions  to each MMP
Plan as of the last day of each plan's most recent  fiscal  year,  all  benefits
accrued  under any unfunded MMP Plan or MMP Benefit  Arrangement  will have been
paid,  accrued,  or otherwise  adequately  reserved in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles;  and all monies withheld from employee paychecks
with respect to MMP Plans have been  transferred to the appropriate  plan within
the timing required by governmental regulations.

                      (h) MMP and its ERISA  Affiliates  have  complied with the
health  continuation rules of Code Sections 4980B (and its predecessor) and with
Code Section 5000. No employee or former  employee of MMP nor beneficiary of any
such  employee or former  employee  is, by reason of such  employee's  or former
employee's  employment,  entitled to receive any  benefits  subject to reporting
under  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  106,  other than as
required by Code Section 4980B or other applicable law.

                      (i)  There  are  no   contracts,   agreements,   plans  or
arrangements,  including but not limited to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,
covering  any  employee  or  former  employee  of  MMP  that,   individually  or
collectively,  could give rise to the payment of any amount (or portion thereof)
that would not be deductible pursuant to Code Sections 280G, 404 or 162.

                      (j) The FCC Licensee  Entities  employ no employees and do
not and have not in the past  maintained or  contributed to any Benefit Plans or
Benefit Arrangements.


                                       23

                  k.  LABOR.  Except  as set forth on  Schedule  5.3k to the MRI
Agreement, with respect to employees of and service providers to MMP and the FCC
Licensee Entities:

                      (a) MMP has been in  compliance  in all material  respects
with all applicable laws respecting employment and employment  practices,  terms
and conditions of employment and wages and hours,  including without  limitation
any such  laws  respecting  employment  discrimination,  workers'  compensation,
family  and  medical  leave,  the  Immigration   Reform  and  Control  Act,  and
occupational safety and health requirements, and have not and are not engaged in
any unfair labor practice.

                      (b) The  employees  of MMP are not  and  have  never  been
represented  by any labor  union,  and no  collective  bargaining  agreement  is
binding and in force against, or currently being negotiated by, MMP or, to MMP's
Knowledge, no labor representation organization effort exists nor has there been
any such activity within the past three years.

                      (c) All  Persons  classified  by MMP and the FCC  Licensee
Entities  as   independent   contractors  do  satisfy  and  have  satisfied  the
requirements  of law to be so  classified,  and MMP  has  fully  and  accurately
reported their compensation on IRS Forms 1099 when required to do so.

                      (d)  Since  December  31,  1996,  except as  described  on
Schedule 5.3k(d) to the MRI Agreement, no employee of or group of employees, the
loss of whom would have significant adverse effect on the business of MMP or the
FCC Licensee Entities,  has notified MMP of his or their intent to (A) terminate
his or their relationship with MMP or the FCC Licensee Entities, or (B) make any
demand for material payments or modifications of his or their  arrangements with
MMP.

                      (e) There is no charge or compliance  proceeding  actually
pending or, to the knowledge of MMP,  threatened against MMP or the FCC Licensee
Entities before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any state, local,
or  foreign  agency  responsible  for  the  prevention  of  unlawful  employment
practices.

<PAGE>



                      (f) The FCC Licensee Entities do not employ,  and have not
in the past, employed employees.

                  l.  INSURANCE.  Schedule 5.3l to the MRI Agreement  contains a
list of all insurance  policies  concerning the Business and describes  coverage
(including  whether  occurrence  or claims  made),  other than  employee-benefit
related  insurance  policies.  All such  policies  are  legal,  valid,  binding,
enforceable  and in full force and  effect  subject  to  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and other laws affecting the rights of
creditors  generally  and to the exercise of judicial  discretion  in accordance
with general  principles of equity (whether  applied by court of law or equity).
There are no existing breaches or defaults with respect to such policies, and no
notice of cancellation or termination has been received.

                  m.  MATERIAL  CONTRACTS.  Schedule  5.3m to the MRI  Agreement
contains  a list  of all the  Material  Contracts  of MMP  and the FCC  Licensee
Entities  (other  than  cash  agreements  for the sale of  advertising  time and
retransmission  consent agreements) and true copies of such agreements have been
furnished to Purchaser or have been made  available to  Purchaser.  All Material
Contracts are legal,  valid and binding  obligations  of MMP or the FCC Licensee
Entities,  as the case may be, enforceable in accordance with their terms and in
full force and effect.  There exists no default or event  which,  with notice or
lapse of time,  or both,  would  constitute  a default  by any party to any such
Material   Contract  or  which  would  permit   termination,   modification   or
acceleration.  Neither MMP nor the FCC Licensee  Entities have received  notice,
nor to MMP's Knowledge, does any party to any Material Contract intend to cancel
or terminate any such  agreement or to exercise or not to exercise any option to
renew thereunder.

operation of the Stations, or the transactions  contemplated hereby. There is no
outstanding citation, order, judgment, writ, injunction, or decree of any court,
government,  or governmental or  administrative  agency against or affecting the
Business, MMP or the FCC Licensee Entities, except as disclosed on Schedule 5.3o
to the MRI Agreement.

MRI Agreement:

                      (a) All of the  operations  of MMP at or from any MMP Real
Property comply in all material respects with applicable Environmental Laws. MMP
has not engaged in or permitted any operations or activities upon any of the MMP

                      (c) To MMP's  Knowledge,  after due inquiry,  there are no
conditions  existing at the MMP Real Property  that  require,  or which with the

may be held  responsible,  nor to MMP's Knowledge after due inquiry or any other
Person, has permitted or conducted,  or was aware of, any Hazardous  Substances,
or any illegal  activity  conducted with respect to the MMP Real Property or any
other properties or assets (whether real,  personal,  or mixed) in which MMP has
or had an interest.

complete and accurate  descriptions  of (i) MMP's basis in its assets,  and (ii)
material Tax elections made by or with respect to MMP.

                  s. ACCOUNTS  RECEIVABLE.  All accounts  receivable of MMP that
are reflected on the MMP Financial  Statements or on the  accounting  records of
MMP as of  the  Closing  Date  (collectively,  the  "MMP  Accounts  Receivable")
represent or will represent valid  obligations  arising from sales actually made
or services actually  performed in the ordinary course of business.  Unless paid
prior to the Closing Date, the MMP Accounts  Receivable are or will be as of the
Closing Date current and collectable net of the respective  reserve shown on the
MMP Financial  Statements or on the accounting  records of MMP as of the Closing
Date (which  reserves are adequate and calculated  consistent with past practice
and,  in the case of the reserve as of the Closing  Date,  will not  represent a
greater  percentage  of the MMP Accounts  Receivable as of the Closing Date than
the reserve  reflected in the MMP Financial  Statements  represented  of the MMP
Accounts  Receivable  reflected  therein and will not  represent a MMP  Material
Adverse Effect in the  composition  of such MMP Accounts  Receivable in terms of
aging). Subject to such reserves, each of the MMP Accounts Receivable either has
been or will be collected in full,  without any setoff,  within ninety (90) days
after the day on which it first  becomes due and  payable.  There is no contest,
claim,  or right of  setoff,  other  than  returns  in the  ordinary  course  of
business,  under any  contract  with any obligor of an MMP  Accounts  Receivable
relating to the amount or validity of such MMP  Accounts  Receivable.  MMP shall
deliver on the Closing  Date a complete  and  accurate  list of all MMP Accounts
Receivable as of the Closing Date.

and the beneficial  owner of a 98% general  partnership  interest in each of the
Television  Licensees;  (ii) MMP holds of  record  and owns  beneficially  these
interests free and clear of any lien,  security interest,  pledge or encumbrance
other than those set forth on Schedule 5.3t to the MRI  Agreement,  all of which
will be  released  at or  before  the  Closing;  (iii)  MMP has full  power  and
authority to enter into this Agreement, and the consummation of the


                                       29
<PAGE>

transactions  contemplated  hereby  has been duly  authorized  by all  necessary
action  on the part of MMP;  (iv) this  Agreement  has been  duly  executed  and
delivered by MMP and constitutes a legal,  valid and binding  obligation of MMP,
enforceable  against MMP in  accordance  with its terms,  subject to  applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium and other laws affecting the
rights of  creditors  generally  and to the exercise of judicial  discretion  in
accordance with general  principles of equity (whether applied by a court of law
or equity);  and (v) except as described on Schedule 5.3t to the MRI  Agreement,
MMP's  interests in the  Television  Licensees  are not subject to any option(s)
warrant(s),    voting   trusts,   outstanding   proxies,   registration   rights
agreement(s), or other agreements regarding voting rights.

              (a)  Sellers  shall  prepare or cause to be  prepared  and file or
cause to be filed, within the time (including extensions) and manner provided by
law, all Tax Returns of the Company, MMP, and the FCC Licensee Entities that are
required to be filed on or before the Closing Date.  In addition,  Sellers shall
prepare  or cause  to be  prepared  and  file or cause to be filed  prior to the
Closing Date all Tax Returns for Taxable  Periods of the  Company,  MMP, and the
FCC Licensee Entities for Taxable Periods ending on or before December 31, 1997,
even if such Tax Returns are not yet due.  Each of the Company,  MMP and the FCC
Licensee  Entities  shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes  shown as due on its
Tax Returns.  Purchaser  shall have an  opportunity to review and consent to the
filing of all such Tax Returns, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld

              (b)  Purchaser  shall  prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed,  within the time and manner  provided by law, all Tax Returns

<PAGE>

such Tax  Returns;  provided  that this  sentence  shall not in any way limit or
affect  Purchaser's  rights to  indemnification  under other  provisions of this

and  consent  to the  filing of such Tax  Returns,  which  consent  shall not be
unreasonably  withheld or delayed.  Purchaser shall not file amended Tax Returns
with respect to Taxable Periods ending on or before the Closing Date or Straddle
Periods without Sellers'  consent;  provided,  however,  that Purchaser may file
amended Tax Returns for such Taxable  Periods  without  Sellers'  consent if (i)
such amended Tax Returns are filed to correct  errors or omissions in previously
filed Tax  Returns  that  either  constitute  or are  related to a breach of any

without  regard to the  limitation on the survival of such  representations  and
warranties  set forth in Section  7.1),  or (ii) the filing of such  amended Tax

indemnification responsibility hereunder by more than $25,000.

would  otherwise  be a Straddle  Period on the basis that the  relevant  Taxable
Period  consists of two  periods,  one ending as of the close of business on the
Closing  Date and one  beginning  the day after the  Closing  Date,  unless  the
relevant Tax  Authority  will not accept a Tax Return  filed on that basis.  For
purposes of apportioning any Tax to the portion of any Straddle Period that ends
on the Closing Date, the  determination  shall be made assuming that there was a
closing of the books as of the close of business  on the  Closing  Date and that
the taxable  years of the Company,  MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities  ended on
that date,  except that real,  personal and  intangible  property Taxes shall be
apportioned ratably on a daily basis between the portions of the Straddle Period
in question.

         8.4.  COOPERATION  IN TAX  MATTERS.  Sellers  and  Purchaser  shall (a)
cooperate fully, as reasonably requested, in connection with the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns  prepared and filed  pursuant to Section 8.2; (b) make
available to the other, as reasonably  requested,  all  information,  records or
documents with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company,  MMP and the FCC
Licensee  Entities for all Taxable  Periods ending on or before the Closing Date

sales,



                                       33

use,  stamp,  registration  and other  similar  Taxes and fees  arising  from or
relating to the sale and transfer of the Stock,  and Sellers  shall at their own
expense file all necessary Tax Returns and other  documentation  with respect to
all such  transfer,  documentary,  sales,  use,  stamp,  registration  and other
similar Taxes and fees. If required by applicable  law,  Purchaser  will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

         8.6.  FIRPTA.  Sellers  shall  deliver to  Purchaser  at the  Closing a
certificate or  certificates  in form and substance  satisfactory  to Purchaser,
duly executed and  acknowledged,  certifying  all facts  necessary to exempt the
transactions  contemplated  hereunder from withholding under Section 1445 of the
Code.

         8.7. SECTION 754 ELECTION.  Purchaser may at any time after the Closing
Date, in its sole and absolute discretion, cause MMP and any of the FCC Licensee
Entities to make a Code Section 754 Election with respect to the Taxable  Period
in which the Closing occurs or later Taxable Periods.

repayment  of MMP's  Funded  Debt,  and (ii) such  actions as would not increase
Taxes for which Sellers have indemnification responsibility hereunder.

                      ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND UNDERTAKINGS

         9.1.  FURTHER  ASSURANCES  AND  ASSISTANCE.  Purchasers,  Sellers,  the

or provide  information  in  connection  with such  filing,  including,  but not
limited to, any  response to any request by the FTC or DOJ.  All filing fees and
other similar  payments in connection  with the H-S-R Act shall be split equally
by Purchaser and the Sellers.

         9.5. FCC APPLICATION.

              (a)  Each  of  Purchaser,  MMP and  Sellers  shall,  within  seven
Business Days following the date hereof,  file with the FCC the FCC Application;
provided that the parties shall  cooperate with each other in the preparation of
the FCC  Application  and shall in good  faith and with due  diligence  take all
reasonable steps necessary to expedite the processing of the FCC Application and
to secure such  consents or  approvals  as  expeditiously  as  practicable;  and
provided further that MMP shall cause the FCC Licensee  Entities,  to the extent
deemed  reasonably  necessary  by counsel to  Purchaser  to join in and  provide
information  in  connection  with  the  FCC  Application  and  comply  with  the
immediately preceding provisions and 9.5(b) below. If the Closing shall not have
occurred for any reason within the initial  effective periods of the granting of
FCC approval of the FCC  Application,  and no party shall have  terminated  this
Agreement  under  Section 14, the parties  shall  jointly  request and use their
respective  best  efforts  to obtain  one or more  extensions  of the  effective
periods of such grants.  No party shall  knowingly  take,  or fail to take,  any
action the intent or  reasonably  anticipated  consequence  of which would be to
cause the FCC not to grant approval of the FCC Application.

                                       38
<PAGE>

              (b)  Sellers,  the  Company  and MMP,  as the  case may be,  shall
publish (and cause the FCC Licensee Entities to publish) the notices required by
the FCC Rules and  Regulations  relative  to the filing of the FCC  Application.
Copies of all applications, documents and papers filed after the date hereof and
prior to the Closing, or filed after the Closing with respect to the transaction
under this Agreement,  by Purchaser , Sellers, MMP, or the FCC Licensee Entities
with the FCC shall be mailed to the other  simultaneously with the filing of the
same with the FCC.  Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses  (including
the fees and disbursements of its counsel) in connection with the preparation of
the portion of the  application to be prepared by it and in connection  with the
processing of that  application.  All filing and grant fees, if any, paid to the
FCC,  shall  be  split  equally  by  Purchaser  and  the  Sellers.  None  of the
information  contained  in any filing made by  Purchaser or Sellers with the FCC
with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall contain any
untrue statement of a material fact.

              (c) FCC  APPLICATIONS TO TRANSFER  CERTAIN FCC LICENSES.  Sellers,
the  Company  and MMP shall  cause the FCC  Licensee  Entities  holding  the FCC
Licenses  for  Television   Stations  WKEF-TV  in  Dayton,   Ohio,   WEMT-TV  in
Greeneville,  Tennessee within five (5) Business Days following the date hereof,
to file with the FCC the MMP II FCC  Applications  and take all reasonable steps
necessary to expedite the  processing of the MMP II FCC  Applications  to secure
the Consent of the FCC to the transfer of control of the FCC  Licenses  from MMP
to MTC.

         9.6. BOOKS AND RECORDS.  Following the Closing,  Purchaser shall permit
each Seller (a) to have reasonable  access to the books and records of Purchaser
and those retained or maintained by the Company relating to the operation of the
Business  prior to the  Closing or after the  Closing  to the extent  related to
transactions  or  events  occurring  prior  to the  Closing,  and  (b)  to  have
reasonable   access  to  employees  of  the  Company  and  Purchaser  to  obtain
information  relating to such matters.  Purchaser  shall maintain such books and
records for a period of four (4) years following the Closing.

         9.7.  EMPLOYEES  AND  EMPLOYEE  BENEFITS.  Purchaser is not planning or
contemplating,  and has not made or taken,  any decisions or actions  concerning
the  employees  of the Stations  after the Closing  Date that would  require the
service of notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988, as amended, (the so-called WARN Act) or any other similar law.

         9.8. INTERRUPTION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION.

              (a) In the event of any loss,  damage or impairment,  confiscation
or  condemnation of any of the assets of the Stations prior to the completion of
the Closing that interferes with the normal operation of the Stations, MMP shall
notify Purchaser of


                                       39
<PAGE>

same in writing  immediately,  specifying with particularity the loss, damage or
impairment,  confiscation or condemnation  incurred, the cause thereof, if known
or reasonably  ascertainable,  and the insurance  coverage.  MMP shall apply the
proceeds of any  insurance  policy,  judgment or award with respect  thereto and
take such other  commercially  reasonable  actions,  as  determined  in its sole
discretion,  as are  necessary to repair,  replace or restore such assets of any
Station so damaged to their prior condition as soon as possible after such loss,
damages or impairment, confiscation or condemnation.

              (b) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction  of
the assets of any Station (other than WMMP-TV in the Charleston,  South Carolina
market),  the  regular  broadcast  transmission  of one (1) or  more  Television
Stations  or two (2) or more Radio  Stations  in the normal and usual  manner is
interrupted for a period of twelve (12) continuous hours or more, MMP shall give
prompt  written  notice  thereof to Purchaser.  If on the Closing  Date,  due to
damages  or  destruction  of the assets of one (1) or more  Television  Stations
(other than WMMP-TV in the Charleston, South Carolina market) or two (2) or more
Radio Stations the regular broadcast  transmission of one (1) or more Television
Stations  (other than WMMP-TV in the Charleston,  South Carolina  market) or two
(2) or more Radio  Stations in the normal and usual manner is  interrupted  such
that the regular  broadcast signal of any such Station  (including its effective
radiated  power)  is  diminished  in any  material  respect,  then (i) MMP shall
immediately  give written notice thereof to Purchaser;  and (ii) Purchaser shall
have the right,  by giving prompt written  notice to the other,  to postpone the
Closing Date for a period of up to sixty (60) days provided,  however,  that the
Closing shall occur no later than ten (10) Business Days after regular broadcast
transmission has been restored.

              (c) In the event any one (1) or more  Television  Stations  (other
than  WMMP-TV in  Charleston,  South  Carolina  market) or two (2) or more Radio
Stations normal and usual  transmission has not been resumed by the Closing Date
as postponed  pursuant to section (b) above,  Purchaser may, pursuant to Section
14.1(e),  terminate  this  Agreement by written  notice to the  Sellers'  Agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Purchaser may, at its option, proceed to
close this Agreement and complete the restoration and replacement of any damaged
assets of the Station in question  after the Closing Date,  MMP shall deliver or
assign to Purchaser  all  insurance  or other  proceeds  received in  connection
therewith to the extent such  proceeds are received by or payable to the Company
or MMP and have not therefore  been used in or committed to the  restoration  or
replacement of the assets.

              (d) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction  of
the assets the regular broadcast transmission of any Station (other than WMMP-TV
in the  Charleston,  South  Carolina  market) in the normal and usual  manner is
interrupted  for a period of seven (7)  continuous  days or more, MMP shall give
prompt  written notice thereof (the  "Interruption  Notice") to Purchaser.  Upon
receipt of the Interruption Notice,


                                       40
<PAGE>

Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole and absolute  discretion,  by giving
prompt written notice thereof to Sellers and MMP within two (2) Business Days of
the date of the Interruption Notice, to terminate this Agreement with the effect
specified in Section 14.2(b) hereof.

                  (e) Until the Closing Date,  the Company and MMP will maintain
and cause MMP to maintain the existing  insurance  coverages  listed on Schedule
5.3l to the MRI Agreement on the Stations and each Station's assets.

         9.9. INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. Purchaser has not relied and
is not relying on the  specification of any dollar amount in any  representation
or warranty made in this Agreement or any Schedule  hereto to indicate that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material,  and agrees not to
assert  in  any  dispute  or   controversy   between  the  parties  hereto  that
specification of such amounts  indicates or is evidence as to whether or not any
obligation,  item or matter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

         9.10.    COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

                  (a) At the Closing,  Sellers' Agents shall designate Purchaser
as its agent solely for the purposes of collecting the MMP Accounts  Receivable.
Purchaser will collect the MMP Accounts  Receivable  during the period beginning
on the  Closing  Date and  ending on the 180th day after the  Closing  Date (the
"Collection  Period")  with the same  care and  diligence  Purchaser  uses  with
respect to its own accounts receivable and hold all such MMP Accounts Receivable
in trust for Sellers until remitted by Purchaser to the  Indemnification  Escrow
Agent or the Collections  Account pursuant hereto.  Purchaser shall not make any
referral or  compromise  of any of the MMP Accounts  Receivable  to a collection
agency or attorney for  collection  and shall not settle or adjust the amount of
any of the MMP  Accounts  Receivable  without the  written  approval of Sellers'
Agent.  If, during the  Collection  Period,  Purchaser  receives  monies from an
account  debtor of Purchaser  that is also an account debtor of MMP with respect
to any MMP Accounts Receivable,  Purchaser shall credit the sums received to the
oldest account due, except where an account is disputed by the account debtor as
properly due, and the account  debtor has so notified  Purchaser in writing,  in
which case,  payments  received shall be applied in accordance  with the account
debtor's  instructions;  provided  that upon  resolution  of such dispute if any
amounts in dispute are received by Purchaser, Purchaser shall remit such amounts
to the  Indemnification  Escrow  Agent in  accordance  with the  Indemnification
Escrow  Agreement  up to the  amount of the  Additional  Indemnification  Amount
Deposit and, thereafter, to the Collections Account.

                  (b) On the ninetieth  (90th) day after the Closing Date and on
or before the fifth  Business  Day after the end of each full  fifteen  (15) day
period  thereafter  during


                                       41
<PAGE>

the Collection Period,  Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers' Agents a list of the
amounts collected by Purchaser before the end of such period with respect to the
Accounts  Receivable.  On or before the fifth  Business Day after the end of the
Collection  Period,  Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers' Agents a list of all of
the Accounts Receivable that remain uncollected.

              (c)  Sellers'  Agents  shall  establish  and  maintain  during the
Collection  Period (and for as long after the Collection  Period as Sellers deem
appropriate) a bank account (the "Collections  Account") at a commercial bank in
Norfolk,  Virginia,  as notified in writing by Sellers'  Agents to Purchaser for
the deposit of  collections  of the MMP Accounts  Receivable in accordance  with
this Section 9.10.  Sellers' Agents shall have sole disbursement  authority over
the Collections  Account. On the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date (or
if such  day is not a  Business  Day,  on the  next  succeeding  Business  Day),
Purchaser  shall (i) deposit with the  Indemnification  Escrow Agent pursuant to
the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement all amounts collected with respect to any
MMP  Accounts  Receivable,  not to exceed  the  excess of  $12,750,000  over the
Initial Deposit (the  "Additional  Indemnification  Amount  Deposit"),  and (ii)
deposit in the Collections Account any other MMP Accounts  Receivable  collected
by Purchaser as of such date.  On and after the  ninetieth  (90th) day after the
Closing Date until the  expiration of the  Collections  Period,  within five (5)
Business Days of the end of each full fifteen (15) day period,  Purchaser  shall
deposit all amounts  collected with respect to the Accounts  Receivable with the
Indemnification  Escrow Agent pursuant to the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement
until the total of all amounts  deposited  pursuant to the previous sentence and
this  sentence  equals  the  Additional   Indemnification  Amount  Deposit  and,
thereafter,  in the  Collections  Account.  Sellers' Agents shall be entitled to
dispose of all amounts deposited in the Collections Account from time to time as
it chooses, in its sole discretion, and Purchaser and the Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall have no rights therein;  provided,  however,  that Purchasers  shall
have no  liability  whatsoever  to  Sellers  with  respect  to  Sellers'  Agents
disposition  of any amounts  disbursed  by Sellers'  Agent from the  Collections
Account.

              (d) After the expiration of the Collection Period, Purchaser shall
have no further  obligation  hereunder other than (1) so long as Sellers' Agents
continue to maintain  the  Collections  Account,  to deposit in such account any
payments  with  respect to any of the MMP  Accounts  Receivable  that  Purchaser
subsequently receives, and (2) thereafter,  to remit directly to Sellers' Agents
any payments with respect to any of the MMP Accounts  Receivable  that Purchaser
subsequently receives.

              (e) Any MMP Accounts  Receivable  remaining  uncollected  180 days
after the Closing Date shall be  transferred to Sellers'  Agents,  together with
all files  concerning  the  collection  or attempt to collect  such MMP Accounts
Receivable   hereunder,   and  Purchaser   shall   thereafter  have  no  further
responsibility with respect


                                       42
<PAGE>

thereto.

              (f) Purchaser shall have no right to setoff any amounts  collected
for MMP  Accounts  Receivable  against any amounts owed to Purchaser by Sellers;
provided  that  this  Section  9.10  shall  not be  deemed to limit the right of
Purchaser to make claims against the Indemnification  Amount in accordance with,
and  subject  to,  the  terms  and   conditions   of  this   Agreement  and  the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

         9.11. OTHER ACQUISITIONS. Without limiting any other provisions of this
Agreement,  prior to the Closing,  without the prior written consent of Sellers'
Agents,  neither  Purchaser  nor any of its  subsidiaries  or any  party  acting
directly  or  indirectly  by or on behalf of any of them shall  acquire or enter
into any  agreement  to acquire a  television  station  or radio  station in any
markets in which any Television  Station or Radio Station currently  broadcasts,
if such acquisition  would materially delay the granting of the FCC Application;
provided,  however,  that  nothing in this  Section  9.11 shall be  construed to
preclude Purchaser proceeding to closing with respect to any transaction pending
as of the date hereof.

         9.12.  PAYMENT OF CERTAIN  LIABILITIES PRIOR TO CLOSING.  Sellers,  the
Company,  and MMP shall  comply in all  respects  with their  obligations  under
Section 2.2(b) of this Agreement.

         9.13. [RESERVED]

         9.14. VALUE APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND INCENTIVE FEES. Before Closing, MMP
shall make all  payments,  discharge all  obligations  and terminate any and all
Value  Appreciation  Rights Agreements  ("VARS"),  and the Management  Incentive
Agreements ("Incentive Agreements"), including, but not limited to, the VARS and
Incentive Agreements listed on Schedules 5.3j and 5.3m to the MRI Agreement.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

              (a) Subject to Section  10.3 hereof after the Closing  Date,  each
Seller, jointly and severally,  shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from

from any breach by such Seller of any  representation or warranty of such Seller
as to itself, himself or herself, in Section 5.1 of this Agreement.

set forth in Sections 5.2 or 5.3 of this Agreement other than any representation
or warranty of any Seller set forth in Section 5.1 of this Agreement;  provided,
however,  for purposes of this Section 10.1(b)(i),  the representation set forth
in Sections 5.2c and 5.3d will be deemed not to include the requirement of a MMP
Material Adverse Effect;

                  (ii) the  material  failure by Sellers to perform any covenant
of Sellers contained herein;

                  (iii) breaches by Seller, the Company,  MMP, or any of the FCC
License  Entities  of  any  other   agreements  and  certificates   specifically
contemplated hereby;

                  (iv)  any  and  all  Taxes  of the  Company,  MMP  and the FCC
Licensee  Entities  (including  any  liability  of the  Company,  MMP or the FCC
Licensee  Entities for Taxes of any other entity or person) for any  Pre-Closing
Tax Period except to the extent that such Taxes are  specifically  identified in
the  Closing  Date Tax  Liabilities  as finally  determined  pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(ii) (excluding reserves for deferred Taxes);

                  (v) [Reserved]


                                       44
<PAGE>



                  (vi)  any  liabilities   under  the   Shareholder   Settlement
Agreements; or

                  (vii) the Closing Date Liabilities,  to the extent the Closing
Date Liabilities  exceed (A) the aggregate cash, cash equivalents and other cash
items  retained as provided by Section  2.2(b),  and (B) payments  made from the
Indemnification Escrow as provided by Section 2.2(b)(iii);

              (c) For purposes of Section 10.1(b)(iv),  Taxes of the Company for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be deemed to include Taxes payable by the Company,
Purchaser,  or Purchaser's  Affiliates that are attributable to items of income,
gain, loss, deduction,  and credit of MMP and the FCC Licensee Entities accruing
through the Closing  Date,  determined on the basis of a closing of the books of
MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities as of that date,  notwithstanding  that such
items may be reported in Taxable Periods ending after the Closing Date.

         10.2. INDEMNIFICATION OF SELLERS BY PURCHASER.  Subject to Section 10.3

Entities  (including  any  liability  of the  Company,  MMP or the FCC  Licensee
Entities for Taxes of any other persons) for any  Post-Closing Tax Period except
to the extent  that (i) such Taxes  should  have been but were not  specifically
identified in the Closing Date  Liabilities or are described in Section 10.1(c),
or (ii) such Taxes arise out of, result from or are  attributable to a breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant of Sellers set forth in this Agreement.

         10.3.  LIMITATIONS  AND  OTHER  PROVISIONS  REGARDING   INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS.

         Sellers'  obligation  to indemnify  Purchaser  pursuant to Section 10.1
shall be subject to all of the following limitations:

              (a)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in  this  Agreement  or
applicable law to the contrary,  Purchaser  agrees that the payment of any claim
(whether such claim


                                       45
<PAGE>

is framed in tort, contract, or otherwise) made by Purchaser for indemnification
hereunder  subsequent to the Closing Date, for whatever reason, shall be limited
to, and shall only be made from, the  Indemnification  Amount in accordance with
the   Indemnification   Fund  Agreement  and,  except  for  claims  against  the
Indemnification  Amount,  Purchaser  waives  and  releases,  and  shall  have no
recourse  against,  Sellers  as a result of the  breach  of any  representation,
warranty,  covenant or  agreement  of Sellers  contained  herein,  or  otherwise
arising out of or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or the
operation  of the  Stations,  and  such  indemnification  shall  be the sole and
exclusive   remedy   for   Purchaser   with   respect  to  any  such  claim  for
indemnification  after the Closing Date; provided,  however, that nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit any  rights or  remedies  that  Purchaser  may have for
Sellers' fraud. The  Indemnification  Fund shall be disbursed in accordance with
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

              (b)  Anything  in  this  Agreement  or any  applicable  law to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  it is understood and agreed by Purchaser that, other
than with respect to Sellers (but not including any partner, director,  officer,
employee,  agent or Affiliate  Sellers  (including  any  shareholder,  director,
officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of the Sellers)) as expressly provided for
in Section 10.1, no partner, director,  officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of
Sellers  (including  any  shareholder,  director,  officer,  employee,  agent or
Affiliate of Sellers)  shall have (i) any  personal  liability to Purchaser as a
result of the breach of any representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement of
Sellers  contained herein or otherwise  arising out of or in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby or the operations of the Stations,
or (ii) any personal  obligation to indemnify  Purchaser for any of  Purchaser's
claims pursuant to Section 10.1 and Purchaser waives and releases and shall have
no recourse  against any of such parties  described in this Section 10.3(c) as a
result of the breach of any representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement of
Sellers  contained herein or otherwise  arising out of or in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby or the operations of the Stations;
provided,  however,  that nothing  herein shall be deemed to limit any rights or
remedies that Purchaser may have for Sellers' fraud.

              (c)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,   Sellers  shall  not  be  liable  to  Purchaser  in  respect  of  any
indemnification  hereunder  until the  aggregate  amount of Losses of  Purchaser
under this  Agreement,  the  Management  Agreement,  the MRI  Agreement  and the
Investors  Agreement  exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000.00)
(the "Basket Amount"),  and then only to the extent of the excess of Losses over
the amount of One Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000.00);  provided,
however, that this paragraph shall not apply to (i) payments pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(iii),  (ii) indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iv),  10.1(b)(vi)
and 10.1(b)(vii) (to the extent  indemnification  pursuant to Section 10.1b(vii)
relates  to an item  either  disclosed  on a  Schedule  and/or  set forth on the
Estimate Certificate or the Accountant's Certificate),  or (iii) indemnification
pursuant  to  Sections  10.1(b)(i)  for  breaches  of  the  representations  and
warranties set forth in Sections 5.2m, 5.3r, and 5.41.


                                       46
<PAGE>

              (d) In  determining  the amount of any Tax or other Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement,  such Loss shall be (i) net of
any insurance  recovery made by the indemnified party, (ii) reduced to take into
account any net Tax benefit  realized by the indemnified  party arising from the
deductibility  of such Tax or Loss,  and (iii)  increased to take account of any
net Tax cost  incurred  by the  indemnified  party  arising  from the receipt of
indemnification  payments hereunder. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall
initially  be made  without  regard to this  paragraph  and shall be  reduced to
reflect any net Tax benefit or  increased to reflect any net Tax cost only after
the indemnified  party has actually  realized such benefit or cost. For purposes
of this  Agreement,  an  indemnified  party  shall be deemed  to have  "actually
realized" a net Tax benefit or net Tax cost to the extent that, and at such time
as, the amount of Taxes payable by such  indemnified  party is (x) reduced below
the amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay
but for the  deductibility  of such Tax or Losses,  and (y) increased  above the
amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay but
for the receipt of such  indemnification  payments.  The amount of any reduction
hereunder  shall be  adjusted to reflect any final  determination  (which  shall
include the  execution  of Form 870-AD or  successor  form) with  respect to the
indemnified  party's  liability  for Taxes.  Any indemnity  payments  under this
Agreement  shall be  treated  as an  adjustment  to the  Purchase  Price for Tax
purposes,  unless a final determination with respect to the indemnified party or
any of its affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

              (e) No claim for  indemnification  for Losses  shall be made after
expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section 7.1 hereof.

              (f) Anything to the contrary in this Section 10.3 notwithstanding,
the terms,  conditions  and  limitations  set forth in this  Section 10.3 do not
apply to or limit Purchaser's rights under Section 14.2.

         10.4. NOTICE OF CLAIM; DEFENSE OF ACTION.

              (a) An  indemnified  party shall  promptly give the Sellers' Agent
notice of any matter  which an  indemnified  party has  determined  has given or
could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement,  stating the
nature  and,  if known,  the amount of the  Losses,  and  method of  computation
thereof,  all with  reasonable  particularity  and containing a reference to the
provisions of this  Agreement in respect of which such right to  indemnification
is claimed  or arises;  provided  that the  failure of any party to give  notice
promptly  as required in this  Section  10.4 shall not relieve any  indemnifying
party of its indemnification  obligations except to the extent that such failure
materially  prejudices the rights of such  indemnifying  party.  The indemnified
party shall give  continuing  notice


                                       47

promptly  thereafter of all developments  coming to Sellers'  Agent's  attention
materially affecting any matter relating to any indemnification claims.

              (b) Except as otherwise  provided in Section 10.5, the obligations
and liabilities of an  indemnifying  party under this Section 10 with respect to
Losses  arising  from  claims  of  any  third  party  that  are  subject  to the
indemnification  provided  for in this  Section  10,  shall be  governed  by and
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

                  (i) With respect to third party claims, promptly after receipt
by an  indemnified  party of notice  of the  commencement  of any  action or the
presentation  or  other  assertion  of  any  claim  which  could  result  in any
indemnification  claim pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2 hereof, such indemnified
party shall give prompt notice  thereof to Sellers'  Agent and the  indemnifying
part(ies)  shall be  entitled to  participate  therein or, to the extent that it
desires, assume the defense thereof with its own counsel.

                  (ii)  If the  indemnifying  part(ies)  elects  to  assume  the
defense of any such action or claim,  the  indemnifying  part(ies)  shall not be
liable  to the  indemnified  party  for any fees of other  counsel  or any other
expenses, in each case incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof.

                  (iii) The indemnifying part(ies) shall be authorized,  without
consent of the  indemnified  party being  required,  to settle or compromise any
such action or claim,  provided that such  settlement or compromise  includes an
unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of
such action or claim.

                  (iv) Whether or not an indemnifying part(ies) elects to assume
the  defense of any action or claim,  the  indemnifying  part(ies)  shall not be
liable for any  compromise or  settlement  of any such action or claim  effected
without its consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                  (v) The  parties  agree to  cooperate  to the  fullest  extent
possible in  connection  with any claim for which  indemnification  is or may be
sought under this Agreement, including, without limitation, making available all
witnesses,  pertinent  records,  materials and  information in its possession or
under its  control  relating  thereto as is  reasonably  requested  by the other
party.

         10.5     TAX CONTESTS.

                  (a) If any  party  receives  written  notice  from any  Taxing
Authority  of any Tax  Proceeding  with  respect  to any Tax for which the other
party is obligated to provide  indemnification under this Agreement,  such party
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party; provided,  however,
that the  failure  to give such  notice  shall not  affect  the  indemnification
provided  hereunder  except to the extent  that the  failure to give such notice
materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

                  (b) Sellers,  acting through Sellers'  Agents,  shall have the
right,  at their own expense,  to control and make all decisions with respect to
any Tax Proceeding  relating  solely to Taxes of the Company for Taxable Periods
ending on or before the Closing Date;  provided,  that  Purchaser and counsel of
its  own  choosing  shall  have  the  right,  at  Purchaser's  own  expense,  to
participate  fully in all  aspects  of the  prosecution  or  defense of such Tax
Proceeding;  and provided  further  that  Sellers  shall not settle any such Tax
Proceeding  without the prior written  consent of Purchaser if such  settlements
could increase the past,  present or future Tax liability of Purchaser or any of
its  Affiliates,  or any Tax liability of the Company for any  Post-Closing  Tax
Period by an amount greater than $25,000.

                  (c) Sellers,  acting through Sellers'  Agents,  shall have the
right, at their own expense,  to jointly control and participate  with Purchaser
in all Tax Proceedings  relating to Taxes of the Company for a Straddle  Period.
If  Sellers  exercise  such  right,  neither  party  shall  settle  any such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the other.

                  (d)  If  Sellers,  acting  through  Sellers'  Agents,  do  not
exercise  their right to assume  control of or participate in any Tax Proceeding
as provided under this Section 10.5,  Purchaser may,  without waiving any rights
to indemnification hereunder, defend or settle the same in such manner as it may
deem appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion.

                  (e) Purchaser  shall control all Tax  Proceedings  relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns of MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities.  In the case of Tax
Proceedings  relating  solely to Taxable  Periods of MMP ending on or before the
Closing Date and Straddle  Periods of MMP,  Purchaser shall keep Sellers' Agents
fully  informed as to the status of any such Tax Proceeding and shall not settle
such a Tax  Proceeding  without the prior  written  consent of Sellers'  Agents,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that Sellers' Agents'
consent  to a  settlement  shall  only be  required  if such  settlements  could
increase  Sellers'  Taxes  or  Taxes  for  which  Sellers  have  indemnification
responsibility hereunder by an amount greater than $25,000.

not in default or breach in any material  respect of its obligations  under this
Agreement, if the Closing hereunder has not taken place on or before October 31,
1998, except where the Closing has been postponed  pursuant to the provisions of

the period referred to in Section 9.8(b) (the "Termination Date");

              (c) by  Sellers,  if  Sellers  are not in default or breach in any

written  notice  thereof  shall  forthwith  be given to the other party and this
Agreement  shall  terminate and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be
abandoned  without further action by any of the parties  hereto,  but subject to
and without  limiting  any other rights of the parties  specified  herein in the
event a party is in default or breach in any material respect of its obligations
under this Agreement.  If this Agreement is terminated as provided  herein,  all

                  (b) If  this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  Section
14.1(d),  the payment  made by  Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1)  shall be
returned to Purchaser and Purchaser  shall have the right to pursue all remedies
available  hereunder at law or in equity,  including,  without  limitation,  the
right to seek specific performance and/or actual monetary damages, but excluding
consequential and incidental  damages. In recognition of the unique character of
the property to be sold  hereunder,  and the damages which Purchaser will suffer
in the  event  of a  termination  pursuant  to the  foregoing  Sections  of this
Agreement,  Sellers  hereby  waive any defense  that  Purchaser  has an adequate
remedy at law for the breach of this Agreement by Sellers.

14.1(c)  and  Purchaser  shall  be in  breach  in any  material  respect  of its
representations,  warranties, covenants, agreements, or obligations set forth in
this Agreement,  then and in that event,  Sellers shall have the right to retain
the amount  delivered  by  Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1) as  liquidated
damages,  and as the sole and exclusive  remedy of Sellers as a  consequence  of
Purchaser's  default (which  aggregate  amount the parties agree is a reasonable
estimate  of the  damages  that will be  suffered  by Sellers as a result of the
default by  Purchaser  and does not  constitute a penalty),  the parties  hereby
acknowledging  the  inconvenience  and  nonfeasability  of  otherwise  obtaining
inadequate remedy.

                  (d) If this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  Sections
14.1(a),  14.1(b) and 14.1(e), the payment made by Purchaser pursuant to Section
3.1(1) shall be returned to Purchaser.

                  (e) A notice  of  termination  made  under  any  provision  of
Section  14.1 of this  Agreement  shall be deemed to be a notice of  termination
under the termination provisions of the MRI Agreement,  the Management Agreement
and the MTC Agreement.

                  (f) In the event of a default by either  party that results in
a lawsuit or other proceeding for any remedy available under this Agreement, the
prevailing party, to the extent it is the prevailing party, shall be entitled to
reimbursement  from the other party of its  reasonable  legal fees and expenses,
whether incurred in arbitration, at trial, or on appeal.

                                 SELLERS' AGENTS
                                 ---------------

         16.1. SELLERS' AGENTS. Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably  appoints
Allen B. Rider,  III,  Anthony R. Ignaczak,  and Stephen W. Burke (herein called
the "Sellers' Agents") as his, her or its agent and attorney-in-fact to take any
action  required or permitted to be taken by such Seller under the terms of this
Agreement,  including,  without limiting,  the generality of the foregoing,  the
payment of expenses relating to the transactions  contemplated by the Agreement,
and the right to waive,  modify or amend any of the terms of this  Agreement  in
any  respect,  whether  or not  material,  and agrees to be bound by any and all
actions  taken by the  Sellers'  Agents on his or its  behalf.  Any action to be
taken by the  Sellers'  Agents  shall be  unanimous.  In the event of the death,
incapacity or liquidation of any of Sellers' Agents, such person or entity shall
not be  replaced,  and the  remaining  Sellers'  Agents  shall  continue in that
capacity.  The Sellers  agree  jointly and  severally to indemnify  the Sellers'
Agents  from and  against  and in respect of any and all  liabilities,  damages,
claims,  costs,  and expenses,  including,  but not limited to attorneys'  fees,
arising out of or due to any action by them as the  Sellers'  Agents and any and
all  actions,  proceedings,  demands,  assessments,  or  judgments,  costs,  and
expenses incidental thereto,  except to the extent that the same result from bad
faith or gross negligence on the part of the


                                       58

 Sellers' Agents. Purchaser shall be
entitled  to rely  exclusively  upon any  communications  given by the  Sellers'
Agents on behalf of any Seller,  and shall not be liable for any action taken or
not taken in reliance upon the Sellers'  Agents.  Purchaser shall be entitled to
disregard any notices or communications given or made by Sellers unless given or
made through the Sellers' Agents.

                                   SECTION 17

                                  MISCELLANEOUS
                                  -------------

         17.1.  HEADINGS.  The headings contained in this Agreement  (including,
but not limited to, the titles of the Schedules  and Exhibits  hereto) have been
inserted for the  convenience  of reference  only, and neither such headings nor
the placement of any term hereof under any  particular  heading shall in any way
restrict  or modify  any of the terms or  provisions  hereof.  Terms used in the
singular  shall be read in the  plural,  and vice  versa,  and terms used in the
masculine gender shall be read in the feminine or neuter gender when the context
so requires.

         17.2.  SCHEDULES  AND  EXHIBITS.  All Annexes,  Schedules  and Exhibits
attached to this  Agreement  constitute an integral part of this Agreement as if
fully rewritten herein.

         17.3. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one
or more  counterparts,  each of which  shall be deemed an  original,  but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same document.

         17.4.  ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.   This  Agreement,  the  MRI  Agreement,  the
Management Agreement, the MTC Agreement and the FCC Licensee Transfer Agreement,
the Annexes,  Schedules and Exhibits and the documents to be delivered hereunder
and thereunder  constitute the entire  understanding  and agreement  between the
parties  hereto  concerning  the subject matter  hereof.  All  negotiations  and
writings  between the parties  hereto are merged  into this  Agreement,  the MRI
Agreement,  the  Management  Agreement,  the MTC  Agreement,  the  FCC  Licensee
Transfer  Agreement,  and there are no representations,  warranties,  covenants,
understandings,  or agreements,  oral or otherwise,  in relation thereto between
the parties other than those incorporated herein or to be delivered hereunder.

         17.5. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is to be delivered in and should be
construed in  accordance  with and governed by the laws of the  Commonwealth  of
Virginia without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.

         17.6. MODIFICATION. This Agreement cannot be modified or amended except
in writing signed by each of the Purchaser and Sellers' Agent.

         17.7.  SUCCESSORS  AND ASSIGNS.  Neither this  Agreement nor any of the
rights  and   obligations   hereunder  shall  be  assigned,   delegated,   sold,
transferred,  sublicensed,  or  otherwise  disposed  of by  operation  of law or
otherwise,  without  the prior  written  consent  of each of the  other  parties
hereto; provided,  however, that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder  to one or more  subsidiaries  so long as Purchaser is not relieved of
its obligations  hereunder;  and provided  further that any change of control in
respect of Purchaser's  parent,  SBGI, shall not require the consent of Sellers.
In the event of such permitted assignment or other transfer,  all of the rights,
obligations, liabilities, and other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by and against, the
respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto, whether so expressed or
not.

         17.8.  WAIVER.  Any waiver of any  provision  hereof (or in any related
document or  instrument)  shall not be effective  unless made expressly and in a
writing  executed in the name of the party sought to be charged.  The failure of
any party to insist, in any one or more instances,  on performance of any of the
terms or  conditions  of this  Agreement  shall not be  construed as a waiver or
relinquishment of any rights granted  hereunder or of the future  performance of
any such term, covenant,  or condition,  but the obligations of the parties with
respect hereto shall continue in full force and effect.

         17.9.  SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Agreement  shall be deemed
severable,  and if any  part  of any  provision  is held  to be  illegal,  void,
voidable,  invalid,  nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or
as to any party, for any reason, such provision may be changed,  consistent with
the intent of the parties hereto, to the extent reasonably necessary to make the
provision,  as so  changed,  legal,  valid,  binding,  and  enforceable.  If any
provision of this  Agreement  is held to be illegal,  void,  voidable,  invalid,
nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or as to any party, for
any reason,  and if such provision cannot be changed  consistent with the intent
of the parties hereto to make it fully legal,  valid,  binding and  enforceable,
then such provisions  shall be stricken from this  Agreement,  and the remaining
provisions of this Agreement  shall not in any way be affected or impaired,  but
shall remain in full force and effect.

         17.10.  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  From the date of this  Agreement,  all  further
public announcements relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby will be made only as agreed upon  jointly by the parties  hereto,  except
that  nothing  herein  shall  prevent  any  Seller or any  Affiliate  thereof or
Purchaser  from  making  any  disclosure  in  connection  with the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement if required by applicable law or otherwise as a
result of its, or its Affiliate's,  being a public company,  provided that prior
notice of such disclosure is given to the other party hereto.

         17.11.  SPECIFIC  PERFORMANCE.  Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser will
have no adequate  remedy at law if Sellers fail to perform  their  obligation to
consummate the sale of Stock contemplated  under this Agreement.  In such event,
Purchaser  shall have the right,  in addition to any other rights or remedies it
may have, to specific performance of this Agreement.

         17.12  FEES  AND  EXPENSES.   Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this
Agreement,  each party shall pay their own expenses  incurred in connection with
the authorization, preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement and
the  exhibits,  Schedules,  and  other  documentation,  including  all  fees and
expenses of counsel,  accountants,  and each party shall be responsible  for all
fees and commissions  payable to any finder,  broker,  adviser, or other similar
Person  retained  by or on behalf of such  party;  provided,  however,  that all
transfer  taxes,   recordation  taxes,  sales  taxes,  and  document  stamps  in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
one-half  (1/2) by Purchaser and one-half  (1/2) by Sellers and all other filing
fees (including all FCC and H-S-R Act filing fees),  and other charges levied by
any governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  shall be paid  one-half  (1/2) by  Purchaser  and  one-half  (1/2) by
Sellers.   Purchaser  hereby  waives  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  any
applicable bulk transfer law.

         17.13 THIRD PARTY  BENEFICIARIES.  Nothing  expressed or referred to in
this  Agreement  shall be construed to give any Person other than the parties to
this  Agreement  any legal or equitable  right,  remedy,  or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and
all of its provisions  and conditions are for the sole and exclusive  benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

         17.14  INTERPRETATION.  The Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree
that the  preparation and drafting of this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are
the result of the efforts of all parties to this  Agreement and every  covenant,
term, and provision of this Agreement  shall be construed  according to its fair
meaning and shall not be construed  against any particular  party as the drafter
of such covenant,  term, and/or provision.  The Purchaser and Sellers agree that
this Agreement is to be construed in a manner  consistent  with the terms of the
MRI Agreement, the Management Agreement and the MTC Agreement.

                     (i)  MMP  shall  deliver  to  Purchaser  at the  Closing  a
certificate (the "Estimate  Certificate")  setting forth its good faith estimate
of the Closing Date Liabilities,  which shall be used to determine the amount of
cash,  cash  equivalents and other cash items required to be retained by MTR and
MMP pursuant to this Section 2.2(b).

                     (ii) Within one hundred  twenty  (120) days of the Closing,
Purchaser  shall  cause  its  accountant  to  prepare  and  deliver  to Seller a
certificate  setting forth its calculation of the Closing Date  Liabilities (the
"Accountant's  Certificate").  The amount of the Closing Date Liabilities as set
forth on the  Accountant's  Certificate  shall be final unless  Sellers'  Agents
notify  Purchaser within thirty (30) days from their receipt of the Accountant's
Certificate that they dispute the Accountant's  Certificate.  If Sellers' Agents
and Purchaser are unable to agree on the amount of the Closing Date  Liabilities
within  fifteen  (15) days after  Sellers'  Agents'  notice,  the parties  shall
jointly  appoint and engage an  independent  accountant  of national or regional
repute (the  "Independent  Accountant") to perform an independent  evaluation of
the Closing Date Liabilities.  The findings of the Independent  Accountant as to
the amount of the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto.

                     (iii)  Upon  the   determination   of  the   Closing   Date
Liabilities  becoming  final which is different  from the  Estimate  Certificate
either (A)  Purchaser  shall be entitled to a payment  from the  Indemnification
Escrow  equal to the amount by which the  aggregate  amount of the Closing  Date
Liabilities   exceeds  the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shown  on  the  Estimate
Certificate,  taking  into  account any  amounts  paid from the  Indemnification
Escrow under  provisions  similar to this  provision in the MRI  Agreement,  the
Management Agreement and the Investors Agreement,  or (B) Purchaser shall pay to
Disbursing  Agent an amount  by which  the  aggregate  amount  of  Closing  Date
Liabilities  shown  on  the  Estimate   Certificate  exceeds  the  Closing  Date
Liabilities as finally determined.

                     (iv) For  purposes  of  determining  the  amount of the Tax
liabilities of MTR to be included in the Closing Date  Liabilities (the "Closing
Date Tax  Liabilities"),  such Tax liabilities shall include all Tax liabilities
of MTR that are  attributable  to items of income,  gain,  loss,  deduction  and
credit of MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities  accruing through and including the
Closing Date, notwithstanding that such items may be reported by MTR, Purchaser,
or Purchaser's  Affiliates in Taxable Periods ending after the Closing Date. The
amount of the Tax  liabilities  attributable to the Tax items of MMP and the FCC
Licensee  Entities shall be determined by assuming that the taxable years of MMP
and the FCC Licensee  Entities,  as well as the taxable years of the Company and
MTR, end as of close of business on the Closing Date and by assuming Purchaser's
compliance with Section 8.8. The Closing Date Tax Liabilities shall not include,
and  Purchaser  shall have no rights

                                       5

of Indemnification under Section 10 with respect to, any Tax Liabilities arising
from the MMP II Distribution.

                     (v)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in
this  Section  2.2,  the final  determination  of the Closing  Date  Liabilities
hereunder  shall not  affect  Purchaser's  indemnification  rights  pursuant  to
Section 10 to the extent the actual  Closing Date  Liabilities  exceed the final
determination thereunder.

          5.3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AS TO THE MMP AND THE FCC LICENSEE
ENTITIES.

          Seller and MMP, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to
Purchaser as to MMP and the FCC Licensee Entities as follows:

                    a. MMP  ORGANIZATION  AND GOOD  STANDING.  MMP is a  limited
liability company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of Virginia
and has full corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now
being  conducted  and to own and use the  assets  owned  and used by it.  To the
extent required by law, MMP is qualified as a foreign limited  liability company
and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct
of its business or the ownership of its properties  requires such qualification.
MMP  owns  98% of the  outstanding  partnership  interests  in the FCC  Licensee
Entities.

                    b.  CAPITALIZATION OF MMP. The designations of each class of
the  membership  units  of MMP and the  number  of  authorized  and  issued  and
outstanding membership units thereof is as described on Schedule 5.3b to the MRI
Agreement.  All membership units have been validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable  and are held of record by the  respective  members  of MMP as set
forth on Schedule  5.3b to the MRI  Agreement.  Except as  described on Schedule
5.3b to the MRI Agreement,  (i) there are no other issued or outstanding  equity
securities of MMP; (ii) there are no  membership or value  appreciation  rights,
phantom membership rights,  profit participation rights, or other similar rights
with  respect to  membership  units  outstanding;  and (iii)  there are no other
issued  or  outstanding   membership   interests  or  other  securities  of  MMP
convertible or exchangeable at any time into equity securities of MMP. Except as
set forth in the  Operating  Agreement of MMP as amended,  MMP is not subject to
any  commitment  or  obligation  that  would  require  the  issuance  or sale of
additional  membership  interests or  membership  units of MMP at any time under
options, subscriptions, warrants, rights or any other obligations. Schedule 5.3b
to the MRI  Agreement  sets  forth  the  equity  interests  in any  corporation,


                                       13


<PAGE>
partnership,  limited liability company,  joint venture or other entity owned by
MMP.

                    c.  ORGANIZATION  AND  CAPITALIZATION  OF  THE  FCC  LICENSE
ENTITIES.  Each FCC License Entity is a limited  partnership  duly organized and
validly  existing  under the laws of the  Commonwealth  of Virginia and has full
partnership  power and  authority  to carry on its  business  as it is now being
conducted  and to own and use the assets  owned and used by it. Each FCC License
Entity is qualified as a foreign  corporation  and is in good standing under the
laws of each  jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership
of its properties requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material  Adverse Effect.  No FCC License Entity owns
any direct or indirect  subsidiaries.  MMP is the sole general  partner and owns
ninety-eight  percent  (98%)  of the  partnership  interests  of each of the FCC
License  Entities.  MTC is the sole limited partner and owns two percent (2%) of
the partnership  interests of each of the FCC License  Entities other than RLLP.
MRI is the sole  limited  partner and owns two percent  (2%) of the  partnership
interests of RLLP. All such  partnership  interests have been validly issued and
are  fully  paid and  nonassessable  and are held of  record  by the  respective
partners as set forth above. There are no (i) other issued or outstanding equity
securities of any FCC License  Entity,  (ii)  partnership or value  appreciation
rights,  phantom  partnership  rights,  profit  participation  rights,  or other
similar rights with respect to partnership interests outstanding and (iii) other
issued or  outstanding  partnership  interests  or other  securities  of any FCC
License Entity convertible or exchangeable at any time into equity securities of
such FCC License  Entity.  No FCC License Entity is subject to any commitment or
obligation  that would  require the issuance or sale of  additional  partnership
interests of any FCC License  Entity at any time under  options,  subscriptions,
warrants,  rights or any other  obligations.  No FCC  License  Entity  holds any
equity interest in any  corporation,  partnership,  limited  liability  company,
joint venture or other entity.

                    d. NO CONFLICTS. Except as described on Schedule 5.3d to the
MRI  Agreement,  neither the  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement nor the
consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  will (i)  violate  any
provision of the articles of organization  or operating  agreement of MMP or the
limited  partnership  agreements of the FCC Licensee Entities,  (ii) violate any
provision of applicable  material law, rule and  regulation,  or (iii)  conflict
with or result in a breach  of,  or give rise to a right of  termination  of, or
accelerate the performance required by the terms of any judgment, court order or
consent decree, or any material agreement,  indenture, mortgage or instrument to
which either MMP or any FCC Licensee  Entity is a party or to which any of their
property is subject,  or constitute a default  thereunder,  where such conflict,
breach, right of termination,  acceleration or default would have a MMP Material
Adverse Effect.

                    e.  REAL  PROPERTY.  The MMP  Real  Property  owned  and all
leaseholds  and  other  interests  in MMP Real  Property  used or  useful in the
Business and all buildings,


                                       14

<PAGE>



structures,  towers, and improvements thereon used or useful in the business and
operations of the Stations are listed on Schedule 5.3e to the MRI Agreement and,
except for Permitted  Encumbrances  and as disclosed in Schedule 5.3e to the MRI
Agreement,  MMP has good and marketable fee simple title  (insurable at standard
rates by a reputable  national title insurer) to all fee estates included in the
Real Property, and good title to all other MMP Real Property, in each case clear
of all liens.  The FCC Licensee  Entities own no real  property,  leaseholds  or
other  interests in real  property.  No portion of the MMP Real  Property or any
building,  structure,  fixture  or  improvement  thereon is the  subject  of, or
affected by, any condemnation, eminent domain or inverse condemnation proceeding
currently instituted or pending or, to MMP's Knowledge, threatened.

         MMP has a valid leasehold interest in all leased property and subleases
to  which it is a party,  and MMP is the  owner  and  holder  of all the  leased
property  purported  to be granted by such  leases and  subleases.  The MMP Real
Property  and the  leases  and  subleases  listed  on  Schedule  5.3e to the MRI
Agreement  constitute all of the real property  owned,  leased or used by MMP in
the business and  operations of the Stations,  which is material to the business
and  operations  of the  Stations.  The Sellers  have  delivered or caused to be
delivered to the Purchaser correct and complete copies of the deeds,  leases and
subleases  listed in Schedule  5.3e to the MRI  Agreement.  With respect to each
lease and sublease listed in Schedule 5.3e to the MRI Agreement:

                    (a)  the  lease  or  sublease  is  legal,  valid,   binding,
enforceable,  and in full force and effect in all material  respects  subject to
applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium and other laws
affecting  the rights of  creditors  generally  and to the  exercise of judicial
discretion in accordance with several principles of equity (whether applied by a
court of law or equity);

                    (b) MMP and, to MMP's knowledge, no other party to the lease
or sublease is in material  breach or default,  and no event has occurred which,
with notice or lapse of time,  would  constitute a material breach or default or
permit termination, modification, or acceleration thereunder;

                    (c) MMP and, to MMP's knowledge, no other party to the lease
or sublease has repudiated any material provision thereof;

                    (d) MMP is not a party to and, to MMP's knowledge, there are
no material disputes,  oral agreements,  or forbearance programs in effect as to
the lease or sublease;

                    (e)  except  as set  forth  on  Schedule  5.3e  to  the  MRI
Agreement, MMP has not assigned,  transferred,  conveyed,  mortgaged,  deeded in
trust, or encumbered 


                                       15
<PAGE>


any interest in the leasehold or subleasehold; and

                    (f) all facilities leased or subleased  thereunder  material
to the operation of the Stations  have  received all  approvals of  governmental
authorities  (including  material  licenses and permits)  required in connection
with the operation thereof,  and have been operated and maintained in accordance
with applicable laws, rules, and regulations in all material respects.

                 f. PERSONAL PROPERTY.  Schedule 5.3f to the MRI Agreement lists
as of the date hereof all items of Personal  Property having a fair market value
in  excess  of  $5,000.00.  Except  as set  forth  on  Schedule  5.3f to the MRI
Agreement,  MMP has good and  marketable  title to all of its material  items of
tangible  personal  property  and  assets  used or useful by MMP  located on its
premises  or shown on the MMP  Financial  Statements  are free and  clear of all
liens,  security  interests  and  encumbrances  other  than those that would not
materially  affect  Purchaser's use or ownership of such personal property after
the  Closing.  The  tangible  personal  property of MMP has been  maintained  in
accordance  with normal  industry  practice and is in good  condition and repair
given the age and use of such property  (subject to normal wear and tear) and is
adequate for its present use by MMP.

                 g. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  MMP has provided or made available to
Purchaser copies of the MMP Financial  Statements.  The MMP Financial Statements
have been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP  consistently  applied  with prior
periods  except  in the case of the  unaudited  MMP  Financial  Statements,  the
absence of year-end audit  adjustments and notes.  The MMP Financial  Statements
present fairly the financial position of MMP as at and for the periods indicated
therein,  and are  consistent  with the books and records of MMP.  Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.3g to the MRI  Agreement  hereto,  since  December 31, 1996,
there  has not been any  Material  Adverse  Effect  on the  business,  financial
condition, operations, or results of operations of MMP taken as a whole. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing,  since that date,  except as described
on Schedule 5.3g to the MRI Agreement:

                    (i) MMP has not sold, leased,  transferred,  or assigned any
material  assets,  tangible  or  intangible,  outside  the  ordinary  course  of
business;

                    (ii)  MMP has  not  entered  into  any  material  agreement,
contract, lease, or license outside the ordinary course of business;

                    (iii) MMP has not  accelerated,  terminated,  made  material
modifications  to, or canceled  any  material  agreement,  contract,  lease,  or
license to which MMP is a party or by which MMP is bound;


                                       16

operating agreement of MMP;

                    (x)  MMP   has  not   experienced   any   material   damage,
destruction, or loss (whether or not covered by insurance) to its property;

                    (xi) MMP has not made any loan to, or entered into any other
transaction  with,  any of its managers,  officers,  and  employees  outside the
ordinary course of business;

                    (xii)  MMP has not  entered  into  any  employment  contract
outside the  ordinary  course of business or  collective  bargaining  agreement,
written  or  oral,  or  modified  the  terms of any such  existing  contract  or
agreement;

                    (xiii)  MMP  has  not  granted  any  increase  in  the  base
compensation of any of its members outside the ordinary course of business;

                                       17
<PAGE>



                    (xiv) MMP has not adopted, amended,  modified, or terminated
any bonus,  profit-sharing,  incentive,  severance,  or other plan, contract, or
commitment for the benefit of any of its managers,  officers,  and employees (or
taken  any such  action  with  respect  to any  other  MMP  Plan or MMP  Benefit
Arrangement);

                    (xv)  MMP  has  not  made  any  other  material   change  in
employment terms for any of its members or employees outside the ordinary course
of business;

                    (xvi) MMP has not made or changed any  material Tax election
or taken any other action with  respect to Taxes not in the  ordinary  course of
business and consistent with past practice;

                    (xvii) MMP has not made any distributions  other than in the
ordinary course of business, and has not made any non-pro rata distributions;

                    (xviii)  MMP has not  adopted  any  material  change  in any
method of accounting or accounting practice,  except as contemplated or required
by GAAP; and

                    (xix)  except  as  contemplated   by  this  Agreement,   the
Investors Agreement,  the MRI Agreement,  the MTC Agreement,  and Assignment and
Assumption  Agreement  by and between MMP and the Max Media LLC II  Distribution
Agreement, MMP has not committed to any of the foregoing.

                  h.  FCC.  MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities  have  been  and
currently  are  operated  in  material  compliance  with  the  terms  of the FCC
Licenses,  the  Communications  Act of 1934, as amended,  and applicable  rules,
regulations  and  policies  of the FCC ("FCC  Rules and  Regulations").  All FCC
Licenses, a true and complete list of which is set forth on Schedule 5.3h to the
MRI Agreement, and true and complete copies of each of which have been delivered
to  Purchaser,  are valid and in full force and  effect.  Except as set forth on
Schedule  5.3h to the MRI  Agreement,  no  application,  action or proceeding is
pending  for the  renewal or  modification  of any of the FCC  Licenses  and, to
Sellers' and MMP's Knowledge,  there is not now before the FCC any investigation
or complaint  against MMP or the FCC Licensee Entities relating to the Stations,
the unfavorable  resolution of which would impair the  qualifications of the FCC
Licensee Entities to hold any FCC Licenses. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3h
to the MRI Agreement,  there is no proceeding  pending before the FCC, and there
is no outstanding notice of violation from the FCC with respect to the Stations.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3h to the MRI Agreement, no order or notice of
violation has been issued by any governmental entity which permits,  revocation,
adverse  modification or termination of any FCC License.  Except as set forth on
Schedule  5.3h  to  the  MRI  Agreement  and  except  for 

                                       18

<PAGE>



those conditions or restrictions  appearing on the face of the FCC Licenses,  or
other  licenses,  none of the FCC  Licenses or other  licenses is subject to any
restriction  or  condition  which would limit the  operation  of the Stations as
currently  operated.  The  FCC  Licenses  listed  in  Schedule  5.3h  to the MRI
Agreement  are  currently  in effect and are not subject to any liens,  or other
encumbrances. No license renewal applications are pending with respect to any of
the FCC Licenses. As of the date hereof,  Sellers, the Company, MMP, and the FCC
License  Entities have no reason to believe that the FCC would not renew the FCC
Licenses in the  ordinary  course for a full  license  term  without any adverse
conditions,  upon the timely filing of appropriate  applications  and payment of
the required filing fee. As of the date hereof,  Sellers,  the Company,  MMP and
the FCC Licensee Entities have no reason to believe that the FCC would not grant
the FCC Application in the ordinary course without any adverse  conditions.  All
documents  required by 47 C.F.R.  Section  73.3526 to be kept in each  Station's
public  inspection  files are in such file,  and such file will be maintained in
proper order and complete up to and through the Closing Date.

                  i.  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY.  Set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the
MRI  Agreement  is a  complete  list of all  Intellectual  Property  owned by or
licensed to MMP on the date hereof  material to the  operations of the Stations.
To MMP's  Knowledge,  except as otherwise  set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the MRI
Agreement  hereto,  MMP owns such  Intellectual  Property  free and clear of any
royalty,  lien,  encumbrance or charge and does not interfere with the rights of
others.  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the MRI Agreement,  MMP has not
received any written notice or written claim that any such Intellectual Property
is not valid or enforceable,  or of any  infringement  upon or conflict with any
patent,  trademark,  service mark, copyright or trade name of any third party by
MMP.  Except as set forth on  Schedule  5.3i to the MRI  Agreement,  MMP has not
given any notice of  infringement  to any third party with respect to any of the
Intellectual  Property and to MMP's Knowledge no such infringement exists. There
is no Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the FCC Licensee Entities.

                  j. EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLANS.  With respect,  as applicable,  to
Benefit Plans and Benefit Arrangements:

                    (a)  Schedule  5.3j  to the  MRI  Agreement  completely  and
accurately  lists  all MMP  Plans  and MMP  Benefit  Arrangements  currently  in
existence  and  specifically  identifies  any that are  Qualified  Plans.  Since
January  1,  1996  (the  date  of  formation  of  MMP),  MMP has  maintained  or
contributed  solely to the  Qualified  Plans listed on Schedule  5.3j to the MRI
Agreement. The Qualified Plans listed on Schedule 5.3j to the MRI Agreement have
always  qualified in form and  operation  under Code  Section  401(a) and have a
currently applicable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and
its trust has always  been  exempt  under Code  Section  501,  and  nothing  has
occurred  with  respect to such plan and trust that could cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption or

                                       19




<PAGE>



the imposition of any liability, lien, penalty, or tax under ERISA or the Code.

                    (b) Each MMP Plan and each MMP Benefit  Arrangement has been
maintained in accordance with its constituent  documents and with all applicable
provisions of the Code,  ERISA and other  domestic and foreign  laws,  including
federal,  state, and foreign  securities laws and all laws respecting  reporting
and disclosure. No MMP Plan holds employer securities.

                    (c)  Neither  MMP nor any  ERISA  Affiliate  has  sponsored,
maintained, or had any liability (direct or indirect, actual or contingent) with
respect to any Benefit  Plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA.  Neither MMP nor any
ERISA  Affiliate has never made or been obligated to make, or reimbursed or been
obligated to reimburse another employer for,  contributions to any multiemployer
plan (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)).  MMP has no liability (whether actual,
contingent,   or  otherwise)  with  respect  to  any  Benefit  Plan  or  Benefit
Arrangement that is not a MMP Benefit Arrangement or with respect to any Benefit
Plan  sponsored or maintained (or that has been or should have been sponsored or
maintained) by any ERISA Affiliate;  and no facts exist that could reasonably be
expected to result in such liability, as a result of termination,  withdrawal or
funding waiver with respect to any such plan, program, or arrangements.

                    (d) There are no pending claims or lawsuits by, against,  or
relating to any  non-MMP  Benefit  Plans or non-MMP  Benefit  Arrangements  that
would,  if  successful,  result in liability  for MMP, and no claims or lawsuits
(other than routine  benefit  claims) have been asserted,  instituted or, to the
knowledge of Sellers and the Company  after due inquiry of MMP,  threatened  by,
against,  or relating to any MMP Plan or MMP  Benefit  Arrangement,  and MMP has
advised  Sellers and the Company  that MMP does not have  knowledge  of any fact
that  could  form the basis  for any such  claim or  lawsuit.  MMP Plans and MMP
Benefit  Arrangements are not presently under audit or examination (and have not
received  notice  of a  potential  audit  or  examination)  by any  governmental
authority,  and no matters are pending with respect to the Qualified  Plan under
any governmental compliance programs.

                    (e) No MMP  Plan or MMP  Benefit  Arrangement  contains  any
provision  or is  subject  to any law that  would  give rise to any  vesting  of
benefits,  severance,  termination, or other payments or liabilities as a result
of the  transactions  this Agreement  contemplates,  and MMP has not declared or
paid any bonus or other  incentive  compensation  or  established  any severance
plan, program, or arrangement in contemplation of the transactions  contemplated
by  this  Agreement,  the  Investors  Agreement,  the MRI  Agreement  or the MTC
Agreement.

                    (f)  With  respect  to each MMP  Plan,  there  have  been no
violations 

                                       20

<PAGE>



of Code Section 4975 or ERISA Sections 404 or 406 as to which successful  claims
would result in any liability for MMP or any Person  required to be  indemnified
by it.

                    (g) MMP has made all required contributions to each MMP Plan
as of the last day of each plan's most recent fiscal year, all benefits  accrued
under any  unfunded  MMP Plan or MMP  Benefit  Arrangement  will have been paid,
accrued, or otherwise  adequately reserved in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles;  and all monies  withheld from employee  paychecks  with
respect to MMP Plans have been  transferred to the  appropriate  plan within the
timing required by governmental regulations.

                    (h) MMP and its  ERISA  Affiliates  have  complied  with the
health  continuation rules of Code Sections 4980B (and its predecessor) and with
Code Section 5000. No employee or former  employee of MMP nor beneficiary of any
such  employee or former  employee  is, by reason of such  employee's  or former
employee's  employment,  entitled to receive any  benefits  subject to reporting
under  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  106,  other than as
required by Code Section 4980B or other applicable law.

                    (i)   There   are  no   contracts,   agreements,   plans  or
arrangements,  including but not limited to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,
covering  any  employee  or  former  employee  of  MMP  that,   individually  or
collectively,  could give rise to the payment of any amount (or portion thereof)
that would not be deductible pursuant to Code Sections 280G, 404 or 162.

                    (j) The FCC Licensee Entities employ no employees and do not

was aware of, any Hazardous  Substances,  or any illegal activity conducted with
respect to the MMP Real  Property  or any other  properties  or assets  (whether
real, personal, or mixed) in which MMP has or had an interest.

Agreement  hereof,  neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) violate any of the

violate any provision of applicable  law, rule or  regulation,  which  violation
would prevent or interfere with  Purchaser's  ability to perform  hereunder,  or
(iii)  conflict  with or  result  in a  breach  of,  or give  rise to a right of
termination  of, or  accelerate  the  performance  required  by the terms of any
judgment, court order or consent decree, or any agreement,  indenture,  mortgage

Agreement  hereto,  (ii) for filings pursuant to the H-S-R Act, or (iii) the FCC

assignee of the FCC  Licenses or as the owner and operator of the  Stations,  or
(b) cause the FCC to fail to approve in a timely fashion the application for the

                  (a) Seller  shall  prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed, within the time (including extensions) and manner provided by
law,  all Tax Returns of Seller,  MMP, and the FCC  Licensee  Entities  that are
required to be filed on or before the Closing  Date.  In addition,  Seller shall
prepare  or cause  to be  prepared  and  file or cause to be filed  prior to the
Closing  Date all Tax Returns for Taxable  Periods of Seller,  MMP,  and the FCC
Licensee  Entities for Taxable  Periods  ending on or before  December 31, 1997,
even if such  Tax  Returns  are not yet  due.  Each of  Seller,  MMP and the FCC
Licensee  Entities  shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes  shown as due on its

filing of all such Tax Returns, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld

                  (b)  Purchaser  shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be  filed,  within  the time and  manner  provided  by law,  all Tax
Returns of MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities (i) for Taxable  Periods ending on
or before  the  Closing  Date that are due after  the  Closing  Date,  except as

provide  Seller a reasonable  opportunity to review and consent to the filing of
such Tax Returns,  which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed.
Purchaser  shall not file amended Tax Returns  with  respect to Taxable  Periods
ending on or before  the  Closing  Date or  Straddle  Periods  without  Seller's
consent; provided, however, that Purchaser may file amended Tax Returns for such
Taxable  Periods  without  Seller's  consent if (i) such amended Tax Returns are
filed to correct errors or omissions in previously filed Tax Returns that either
constitute  or are related to a breach of any  representation  or  warranty  set
forth in Sections 5.2m or 5.3r  (determined  without regard to the limitation on
the survival of such  representations  and warranties set forth in Section 7.1),
or (ii) the filing of such  amended Tax Return  would not  increase the Taxes of
Seller or Taxes for which Seller has indemnification responsibility hereunder by
more than $25,000.

the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

         8.6.  FIRPTA.  Seller  shall  deliver  to  Purchaser  at the  Closing a

contemplating,  and has not made or taken,  any decisions or actions  concerning
the  employees  of the Stations  after the Closing  Date that would  require the
service of notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988, as amended, (the so-called WARN Act) or any other similar law.

         9.8.     INTERRUPTION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION.

                  (a)  In  the  event  of  any  loss,   damage  or   impairment,
confiscation  or  condemnation of any of the assets of the Stations prior to the
completion  of the Closing  that  interferes  with the normal  operation  of the
Stations, MMP shall notify Purchaser of same in writing immediately,  specifying
with particularity the loss, damage or impairment,  confiscation or condemnation
incurred,  the cause  thereof,  if known or  reasonably  ascertainable,  and the
insurance  coverage.  MMP shall  apply the  proceeds  of any  insurance  policy,
judgment  or award  with  respect  thereto  and  take  such  other  commercially
reasonable  actions,  as determined in its sole discretion,  as are necessary to
repair,  replace or restore such assets of any Station so damaged to their prior
condition  as  soon  as  possible  after  such  loss,   damages  or  impairment,
confiscation or condemnation.

                  (b) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction
of the  assets of any  Station  (other  than  WMMP-TV in the  Charleston,  South
Carolina  market),  the  regular  broadcast  transmission  of one  (1)  or  more
Television  Stations  or two (2) or more

<PAGE>


Radio  Stations in the normal and usual  manner is  interrupted  for a period of
twelve  (12)  continuous  hours or more,  MMP shall give prompt  written  notice

Charleston, South Carolina market) or two (2) or more Radio Stations the regular
broadcast  transmission  of one  (1) or more  Television  Stations  (other  than
WMMP-TV  in the  Charleston,  South  Carolina  market)  or two (2) or more Radio
Stations  in the normal and usual  manner is  interrupted  such that the regular
broadcast signal of any such Station (including its effective radiated power) is
diminished in any material respect,  then (i) MMP shall immediately give written
notice thereof to Purchaser;  and (ii) Purchaser shall have the right, by giving
prompt written notice to the other, to postpone the Closing Date for a period of
up to sixty (60) days provided,  however,  that the Closing shall occur no later
than ten (10)  Business  Days  after  regular  broadcast  transmission  has been
restored.

                  (c) In the  event  any  one (1) or  more  Television  Stations
(other than WMMP-TV in  Charleston,  South  Carolina  market) or two (2) or more
Radio Stations normal and usual transmission has not been resumed by the Closing
Date as  postponed  pursuant to section (b) above,  Purchaser  may,  pursuant to
Section  14.1(e),  terminate  this  Agreement by written  notice to the Sellers'
Agent.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  however,  Purchaser may, at its option,
proceed to close this Agreement and complete the  restoration and replacement of
any damaged  assets of the Station in question after the Closing Date, MMP shall
deliver or assign to  Purchaser  all  insurance  or other  proceeds  received in
connection  therewith to the extent such  proceeds are received by or payable to
the  Company  or MMP and have not  therefore  been used in or  committed  to the
restoration or replacement of the assets.

                  (d) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction
of the assets the regular  broadcast  transmission  of any  Station  (other than
WMMP-TV in the Charleston, South Carolina market) in the normal and usual manner
is interrupted for a period of seven (7) continuous days or more, MMP shall give
prompt  written notice thereof (the  "Interruption  Notice") to Purchaser.  Upon
receipt of the Interruption Notice,  Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole
and absolute  discretion,  by giving prompt written notice thereof to Seller and
MMP within two (2)  Business  Days of the date of the  Interruption  Notice,  to
terminate this Agreement with the effect specified in Section 14.2(b) hereof.

                  (e) Until the Closing Date, MMP will maintain and cause MMP to
maintain the existing  insurance  coverages  listed on Schedule  5.3l to the MRI
Agreement on the Stations and each Station's assets.

         9.9. INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. Purchaser has not relied and
is not

                                       38
<PAGE>

relying on the  specification  of any  dollar  amount in any  representation  or
warranty  made in this  Agreement or any Schedule  hereto to indicate  that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material,  and agrees not to
assert  in  any  dispute  or   controversy   between  the  parties  hereto  that
specification of such amounts  indicates or is evidence as to whether or not any
obligation,  item or matter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

         9.10.    COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

                  (a) At the Closing,  Sellers' Agents shall designate Purchaser
as its agent solely for the purposes of collecting the MMP Accounts  Receivable.
Purchaser will collect the MMP Accounts  Receivable  during the period beginning
on the  Closing  Date and  ending on the 180th day after the  Closing  Date (the
"Collection  Period")  with the same  care and  diligence  Purchaser  uses  with
respect to its own accounts receivable and hold all such MMP Accounts Receivable
in trust for Sellers until remitted by Purchaser to the  Indemnification  Escrow
Agent or the Collections  Account pursuant hereto.  Purchaser shall not make any
referral or  compromise  of any of the MMP Accounts  Receivable  to a collection
agency or attorney for  collection  and shall not settle or adjust the amount of
any of the MMP  Accounts  Receivable  without the  written  approval of Sellers'
Agent.  If, during the  Collection  Period,  Purchaser  receives  monies from an
account  debtor of Purchaser  that is also an account debtor of MMP with respect
to any MMP Accounts Receivable,  Purchaser shall credit the sums received to the
oldest account due, except where an account is disputed by the account debtor as
properly due, and the account  debtor has so notified  Purchaser in writing,  in
which case,  payments  received shall be applied in accordance  with the account
debtor's  instructions;  provided  that upon  resolution  of such dispute if any
amounts in dispute are received by Purchaser, Purchaser shall remit such amounts
to the  Indemnification  Escrow  Agent in  accordance  with the  Indemnification
Escrow  Agreement  up to the  amount of the  Additional  Indemnification  Amount
Deposit and, thereafter, to the Collections Account.

                  (b) On the ninetieth  (90th) day after the Closing Date and on
or before the fifth  Business  Day after the end of each full  fifteen  (15) day
period  thereafter  during the  Collection  Period,  Purchaser  shall deliver to
Sellers' Agents a list of the amounts  collected by Purchaser  before the end of
such  period with  respect to the  Accounts  Receivable.  On or before the fifth
Business Day after the end of the Collection Period,  Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers'  Agents  a  list  of  all  of  the  Accounts   Receivable  that  remain
uncollected.

                  (c) Sellers'  Agents shall  establish and maintain  during the
Collection  Period (and for as long after the Collection  Period as Sellers deem
appropriate) a bank account (the "Collections  Account") at a commercial bank in
Norfolk,  Virginia,  as

                                       39
<PAGE>

notified  in  writing  by  Sellers'  Agents  to  Purchaser  for the  deposit  of
collections of the MMP Accounts Receivable in accordance with this Section 9.10.
Sellers'  Agents shall have sole  disbursement  authority  over the  Collections
Account.  On the ninetieth  (90th) day after the Closing Date (or if such day is
not a Business Day, on the next  succeeding  Business Day),  Purchaser shall (i)
deposit with the  Indemnification  Escrow Agent pursuant to the  Indemnification
Escrow  Agreement  all  amounts  collected  with  respect  to any  MMP  Accounts
Receivable,  not to exceed the excess of  $12,750,000  over the Initial  Deposit
(the  "Additional  Indemnification  Amount  Deposit"),  and (ii)  deposit in the
Collections Account any other MMP Accounts Receivable  collected by Purchaser as
of such date. On and after the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date until
the expiration of the Collections  Period,  within five (5) Business Days of the
end of each full fifteen (15) day period,  Purchaser  shall  deposit all amounts
collected  with  respect to the  Accounts  Receivable  with the  Indemnification
Escrow Agent pursuant to the Indemnification Escrow Agreement until the total of
all amounts deposited pursuant to the previous sentence and this sentence equals
the  Additional   Indemnification   Amount  Deposit  and,  thereafter,   in  the
Collections Account. Sellers' Agents shall be entitled to dispose of all amounts
deposited in the  Collections  Account  from time to time as it chooses,  in its
sole discretion,  and Purchaser and the Indemnification  Escrow Agent shall have
no rights therein;  provided,  however,  that Purchasers shall have no liability
whatsoever to Sellers with respect to Sellers' Agents disposition of any amounts
disbursed by Sellers' Agent from the Collections Account.

                  (d) After the expiration of the Collection  Period,  Purchaser
shall have no further  obligation  hereunder  other than (1) so long as Sellers'
Agents continue to maintain the Collections  Account, to deposit in such account
any payments with respect to any of the MMP Accounts  Receivable  that Purchaser
subsequently receives, and (2) thereafter,  to remit directly to Sellers' Agents
any payments with respect to any of the MMP Accounts  Receivable  that Purchaser
subsequently receives.

                  (e) Any MMP Accounts Receivable remaining uncollected 180 days
after the Closing Date shall be  transferred to Sellers'  Agents,  together with
all files  concerning  the  collection  or attempt to collect  such MMP Accounts
Receivable   hereunder,   and  Purchaser   shall   thereafter  have  no  further
responsibility with respect thereto.

                  (f)  Purchaser  shall  have no right  to  setoff  any  amounts
collected for MMP Accounts  Receivable  against any amounts owed to Purchaser by
Seller;  provided  that this Section 9.10 shall not be deemed to limit the right
of Purchaser to make claims  against the  Indemnification  Amount in  accordance
with,  and  subject  to,  the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement  and the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

Agreement,  prior to the Closing,  without the prior written consent of Sellers'
Agents,  neither  Purchaser  nor any of its  subsidiaries  or any  party  acting
directly  or  indirectly  by or on behalf of any of them shall  acquire or enter
into any  agreement  to acquire a  television  station  or radio  station in any
markets in which any Television  Station or Radio Station currently  broadcasts,
if such acquisition  would materially delay the granting of the FCC Application;
provided,  however,  that  nothing in this  Section  9.11 shall be  construed to
preclude Purchaser proceeding to closing with respect to any transaction pending
as of the date hereof.

         9.12. PAYMENT OF CERTAIN  LIABILITIES PRIOR TO CLOSING.  Seller and MMP
shall comply in all respects with their obligations under Section 2.2(b) of this

limited to, the VARS and Incentive  Agreements listed on Schedules 5.3j and 5.3m

                  (c)      [RESERVED]

Closing Date  Liabilities,  or (ii) such Taxes arise out of,  result from or are
attributable to a breach of any representation,  warranty or covenant of Sellers
set forth in this Agreement.

          10.3.  LIMITATIONS  AND  OTHER  PROVISIONS  REGARDING  INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS.

          Seller's  obligation to indemnify  Purchaser  pursuant to Section 10.1
shall be subject to all of the following limitations:

                  (a)       Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement
or  applicable  law to the  contrary,  Purchaser  agrees that the payment of any
claim  (whether such claim is framed in tort,  contract,  or otherwise)  made by
Purchaser for  indemnification  hereunder  subsequent  to the Closing Date,  for
whatever  reason,  shall  be  limited  to,  and  shall  only be made  from,  the
Indemnification  Amount in accordance with the Indemnification  Escrow Agreement
and, except for claims against the Indemnification Amount,  Purchaser waives and
releases,  and shall have no recourse against,  Seller as a result of the breach
of any  representation,  warranty,  covenant or  agreement  of Seller  contained
herein,  or  otherwise  arising out of or in  connection  with the  transactions
contemplated hereby or the operation of the Stations,  and such  indemnification
shall be the sole and exclusive  remedy for  Purchaser  with respect to any such
claim for  indemnification  after the  Closing  Date;

                                       43
<PAGE>

provided,  however,  that nothing  herein shall be deemed to limit any rights or
remedies that Purchaser may have for Sellers' fraud. The Indemnification  Escrow
shall be disbursed in accordance with the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

                  (b)     Anything in  this  Agreement or  any applicable law to
the contrary  notwithstanding,  it is understood  and agreed by Purchaser  that,
other than with  respect to Seller (but not  including  any  partner,  director,
officer,  employee,  agent  or  Affiliate  Seller  (including  any  shareholder,
director,  officer,  employee,  agent or  Affiliate of the Seller)) as expressly
provided for in Section 10.1, no partner, director,  officer, employee, agent or
Affiliate of Seller  (including any shareholder,  director,  officer,  employee,
agent or Affiliate of Seller) shall have (i) any personal liability to Purchaser
as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of Sellers  contained  herein or otherwise  arising out of or in connection with
the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  or  thereby  or the  operations  of the
Stations,  or (ii) any personal  obligation  to indemnify  Purchaser  for any of
Purchaser's  claims  pursuant to Section 10.1 and Purchaser  waives and releases
and shall have no recourse against any of such parties described in this Section
10.3(c) as a result of the breach of any representation,  warranty,  covenant or
agreement  of  Seller  contained  herein  or  otherwise  arising  out  of  or in
connection  with  the  transactions   contemplated  hereby  or  thereby  or  the
operations  of the Stations;  provided,  however,  that nothing  herein shall be
deemed to limit any rights or  remedies  that  Purchaser  may have for  Seller's
fraud.

                  (c)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to
the  contrary,  Seller  shall not be  liable  to  Purchaser  in  respect  of any
indemnification  hereunder  until the  aggregate  amount of Losses of  Purchaser
under  this  Agreement,  the MRI  Agreement,  the  Investors  Agreement  and the
Management  Agreement  exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars  ($250,000.00)
(the "Basket Amount"),  and then only to the extent of the excess of Losses over
the amount of One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000.00);  provided,
however, that this paragraph shall not apply to (i) payments pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(iii), (ii) indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iv),  10.1(b)(vi),
and 10.1(b)(vii) (to the extent indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(vii)
relates  to an item  disclosed  on a Schedule  and/or set forth on the  Estimate
Certificate or the Accountant's Certificate),  or (iii) indemnification pursuant
to Sections  10.1(b)(i) for breaches of the  representations  and warranties set
forth in Sections 5.2m, 5.3r, and 5.41.

                  (d) In  determining  the  amount of any Tax or other  Loss for
which  indemnification is provided under this Agreement,  such Loss shall be (i)
net of any insurance  recovery made by the  indemnified  party,  (ii) reduced to
take into account any net Tax benefit realized by the indemnified  party arising
from the  deductibility of such Tax or Loss, and (iii) increased to take account
of any net Tax cost incurred by the 

                                       44


<PAGE>

indemnified  party  arising  from  the  receipt  of   indemnification   payments
hereunder. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall initially be made without
regard to this  paragraph and shall be reduced to reflect any net Tax benefit or
increased  to  reflect  any net Tax cost only  after the  indemnified  party has
actually  realized  such  benefit or cost.  For purposes of this  Agreement,  an
indemnified party shall be deemed to have "actually  realized" a net Tax benefit
or net Tax cost to the  extent  that,  and at such time as,  the amount of Taxes
payable by such indemnified  party is (x) reduced below the amount of Taxes that
such indemnified party would have been required to pay but for the deductibility
of such Tax or  Losses,  and (y)  increased  above the amount of Taxes that such
indemnified  party  would have been  required to pay but for the receipt of such
indemnification  payments.  The  amount  of any  reduction  hereunder  shall  be
adjusted to reflect any final  determination  (which shall include the execution
of Form  870-AD or  successor  form)  with  respect to the  indemnified  party's
liability  for Taxes.  Any  indemnity  payments  under this  Agreement  shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes,  unless a final
determination  with respect to the  indemnified  party or any of its  affiliates
causes  any such  payment  not to be treated as an  adjustment  to the  Purchase
Price.

                  (e)      No claim for indemnification for Losses shall be made
after expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section 7.1 hereof.

                  (f)      Anything  to  the   contrary  in  this  Section  10.3
notwithstanding, the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Section
10.3 do not apply to or limit Purchaser's rights under Section 14.2.

         10.4.    NOTICE OF CLAIM; DEFENSE OF ACTION.

                  (a)      An indemnified party shall promptly give the Sellers'
Agent notice of any matter which an  indemnified  party has determined has given
or could give rise to a right of indemnification  under this Agreement,  stating
the nature and, if known,  the amount of the Losses,  and method of  computation
thereof,  all with  reasonable  particularity  and containing a reference to the
provisions of this  Agreement in respect of which such right to  indemnification
is claimed  or arises;  provided  that the  failure of any party to give  notice
promptly  as required in this  Section  10.4 shall not relieve any  indemnifying
party of its indemnification  obligations except to the extent that such failure
materially  prejudices the rights of such  indemnifying  party.  The indemnified
party shall give  continuing  notice  promptly  thereafter  of all  developments
coming to Sellers' Agent's attention materially affecting any matter relating to
any indemnification claims.

                                       45

<PAGE>



                  (b)      Except as  otherwise  provided in Section  10.5,  the
obligations and liabilities of an indemnifying  party under this Section 10 with
respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that are subject to the
indemnification  provided  for in this  Section  10,  shall be  governed  by and
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

                           (i)  With  respect to third  party  claims,  promptly
after  receipt  by an  indemnified  party of notice of the  commencement  of any
action or the presentation or other assertion of any claim which could result in
any  indemnification  claim  pursuant  to  Section  10.1  or 10.2  hereof,  such
indemnified  party shall give prompt  notice  thereof to Sellers'  Agent and the
indemnifying  part(ies)  shall be  entitled  to  participate  therein or, to the
extent that it desires, assume the defense thereof with its own counsel.

                           (ii) If the  indemnifying  part(ies) elects to assume
the defense of any such action or claim, the indemnifying part(ies) shall not be
liable  to the  indemnified  party  for any fees of other  counsel  or any other
expenses, in each case incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof.

                           (iii) The indemnifying part(ies) shall be authorized,
without consent of the indemnified party being required, to settle or compromise
any such action or claim,  provided that such settlement or compromise  includes
an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out
of such action or claim.

                           (iv) Whether or not an indemnifying  part(ies) elects
to assume the defense of any action or claim, the  indemnifying  part(ies) shall
not be liable  for any  compromise  or  settlement  of any such  action or claim
effected without its consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                           (v)  The parties  agree to  cooperate  to the fullest
extent possible in connection with any claim for which indemnification is or may
be sought under this Agreement,  including, without limitation, making available
all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in its possession or
under its  control  relating  thereto as is  reasonably  requested  by the other
party.

         10.5     TAX CONTESTS.
                  -------------

                  (a) If any  party  receives  written  notice  from any  Taxing
Authority  of any Tax  Proceeding  with  respect  to any Tax for which the other
party is obligated to provide  indemnification under this Agreement,  such party
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party; provided,  however,
that the  failure  to give such  notice  shall not  affect  the  indemnification
provided  hereunder  except to the extent  that the  failure to give such notice
materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

                                       46
<PAGE>


                  (b) Seller,  acting through  Sellers'  Agents,  shall have the
right, at its own expense, to control and make all decisions with respect to any
Tax Proceeding  relating solely to Taxes of Seller for Taxable Periods ending on
or before the Closing  Date;  provided,  that  Purchaser  and counsel of its own
choosing shall have the right, at Purchaser's own expense,  to participate fully
in all  aspects  of the  prosecution  or  defense  of such Tax  Proceeding;  and
provided  further that Seller shall not settle any such Tax  Proceeding  without
the prior written  consent of Purchaser if such  settlements  could increase the
past, present or future Tax liability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,  or
for any Post-Closing Tax Period by an amount greater than $25,000.

                  (c)      RESERVED

                  (d) If  Seller,  acting  through  Sellers'  Agents,  does  not
exercise its right to assume  control of or participate in any Tax Proceeding as
provided under this Section 10.5,  Purchaser may,  without waiving any rights to
indemnification  hereunder,  defend or settle the same in such  manner as it may
deem appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion.

                  (e) Purchaser  shall control all Tax  Proceedings  relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns of MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities.  In the case of Tax
Proceedings  relating  solely to Taxable  Periods of MMP ending on or before the
Closing Date and Straddle  Periods of MMP,  Purchaser shall keep Sellers' Agents
fully  informed as to the status of any such Tax Proceeding and shall not settle
such a Tax  Proceeding  without the prior  written  consent of Sellers'  Agents,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that Sellers' Agents'
consent  to a  settlement  shall  only be  required  if such  settlements  could
increase   Seller's  Taxes  or  Taxes  for  which  Seller  has   indemnification
responsibility hereunder by an amount greater than $25,000.

                  (f) In the event that the  provisions of this Section 10.5 and
the provisions of Section 10.4(b) conflict or otherwise each apply by the terms,
this Section 10.5 shall exclusively govern all matters concerning Taxes.

                                   TERMINATION

         14.1     TERMINATION.  This Agreement may be terminated:

                   (a) At any time by mutual  written  consent of Purchaser  and
Seller;

                   (b) By either Purchaser or Seller,  if the terminating  party
is not in default or breach in any  material  respect of its  obligations  under
this  Agreement,  if the  Closing  hereunder  has not  taken  place on or before
October 31, 1998,  except where the Closing has been  postponed  pursuant to the
provisions of Section 9.8, in which case the  applicable  date shall be upon the
expiration of the period referred to in Section 9.8(b) (the "Termination Date");

                   (c) by Seller,  if  Seller's  not in default or breach in any
respect of their obligations  under this Agreement,  if all of the conditions in
Section  11.2 have not been  satisfied or waived by the date  scheduled  for the
Closing (as such date may be postponed pursuant to Section 9.8);

                   (d) by Purchaser, if Purchaser is not in default or breach in
any material  respect of its  obligations  under this  Agreement,  if all of the
conditions  set forth in Section  11.1 have not been  satisfied or waived by the
date  scheduled  for the  Closing  (as such date may be  postponed  pursuant  to
Section 9.8);

                   (e) by Purchaser, pursuant to Section 9.8.

         14.2     PROCEDURE AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

written  notice  thereof  shall  forthwith  be given to the other party and this
Agreement  shall  terminate and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be
abandoned  without further action by any of the parties  hereto,  but subject to
and without  limiting  any other rights of the parties  specified  herein in the
event a party is in default or breach in any material respect of its obligations
under this Agreement.  If this Agreement is terminated as provided  herein,  all
filings,  applications  and  other  submissions  relating  to  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby as to which  termination  has occurred shall, to the extent
practicable,  be withdrawn  from the agency or other Person to which such filing

                  (b) If  this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  Section
14.1(d),  the payment  made by  Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1)  shall be
returned to Purchaser and Purchaser  shall have the right to pursue all remedies
available  hereunder at law or in equity,  including,  without  limitation,  the
right to seek specific performance and/or actual monetary damages, but excluding
consequential and incidental  damages. In recognition of the unique character of
the property to be sold  hereunder,  and the damages which Purchaser will suffer
in the  event  of a  termination  pursuant  to the  foregoing  Sections  of this
Agreement,  Seller  hereby  waives any defense  that  Purchaser  has an adequate
remedy at law for the breach of this Agreement by Seller.

                   (c) If this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  Section
14.1(c)  and  Purchaser  shall  be in  breach  in any  material  respect  of its
representations,  warranties, covenants, agreements, or obligations set forth in
this  Agreement,  then and in that event,  Seller shall have the right to retain
the amount  delivered  by  Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1) as  liquidated
damages,  and as the sole and  exclusive  remedy of Seller as a  consequence  of
Purchaser's  default (which  aggregate  amount the parties agree is a reasonable
estimate  of the  damages  that  will be  suffered  by Seller as a result of the
default by  Purchaser  and does not  constitute a penalty),  the parties  hereby
acknowledging  the  inconvenience  and  nonfeasability  of  otherwise  obtaining
inadequate remedy.

                   (d) If this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to Sections
14.1(a),  14.1(b) and 14.1(e), the payment made by Purchaser pursuant to Section
3.1(1) shall be returned to Purchaser.

                   (e) A notice  of  termination  made  under any  provision  of
Section  14.1 of this  Agreement  shall be deemed to be a notice of  termination
under the termination  provisions of the Investor  Agreement,  the MTC Agreement
and the MRI Agreement.

                   (f) In the event of a default by either party that results in
a lawsuit or other proceeding for any remedy available under this Agreement, the
prevailing party, to the extent it is the prevailing party, shall be entitled to
reimbursement  from the other party of its  reasonable  legal fees and expenses,
whether incurred in arbitration, at trial, or on appeal.

                                 SELLERS' AGENTS
                                 ---------------

         16.1.  SELLERS'  AGENTS.  Seller hereby  irrevocably  appoints Allen B.
Rider,  III,  Anthony R.  Ignaczak,  and  Stephen W.  Burke  (herein  called the
"Sellers'  Agents") as his,  her or its agent and  attorney-in-fact  to take any
action  required  or  permitted  to be taken by  Seller  under the terms of this
Agreement,  including,  without limiting,  the generality of the foregoing,  the
payment of expenses relating to the transactions  contemplated by the Agreement,
and the right to waive,  modify or amend any of the terms of this  Agreement  in
any  respect,  whether  or not  material,  and agrees to be bound by any and all
actions  taken by the  Sellers'  Agents on his or its  behalf.  Any action to be
taken by the  Sellers'  Agents  shall be  unanimous.  In the event of the death,
incapacity or liquidation of any of Sellers' Agents, such person or entity shall
not be  replaced,  and the  remaining  Sellers'  Agents  shall  continue in that
capacity. Seller agrees to indemnify the Sellers' Agents from and against and in
respect  of any and all  liabilities,  damages,  claims,  costs,  and  expenses,
including,  but not  limited to  attorneys'  fees,  arising out of or due to any
action by them as the  Sellers'  Agents  and any and all  actions,  proceedings,
demands,  assessments,  or judgments,  costs, and expenses  incidental  thereto,
except to the extent that the same result from bad faith or gross  negligence on
the part of the Sellers' Agents. Purchaser shall be entitled to rely exclusively
upon any  communications  given by the Sellers' Agents on behalf of Seller,  and
shall not be liable  for any  action  taken or not  taken in  reliance  upon the
Sellers'  Agents.  Purchaser  shall be  entitled  to  disregard  any  notices or
communications given or made by Seller unless given or made through the Sellers'
Agents.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         17.1.  HEADINGS.  The headings contained in this Agreement  (including,
but not limited to, the titles of the Schedules  and Exhibits  hereto) have been
inserted for the  convenience  of reference  only, and neither such headings nor
the placement of any term hereof under any  particular  heading shall in any way
restrict  or modify  any of the terms or  provisions  hereof.  Terms used in the
singular  shall be read in the  plural,  and vice  versa,  and terms used in the
masculine gender shall be read in the feminine or neuter gender when the context
so requires.

         17.2.  SCHEDULES  AND  EXHIBITS.  All Annexes,  Schedules  and Exhibits
attached to or referenced in this Agreement  constitute an integral part of this
Agreement as if fully rewritten herein.

         17.3. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one
or more  counterparts,  each of which  shall be deemed an  original,  but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same document.

         17.4. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement,  the Investors Agreement,  the
MTC Agreement,  the MRI Agreement and the FCC Licensee Transfer  Agreement,  the
Annexes,  Schedules and Exhibits and the documents to be delivered hereunder and
thereunder constitute the entire understanding and agreement between the parties
hereto  concerning  the subject  matter hereof.  All  negotiations  and writings
between  the  parties  hereto  are merged  into this  Agreement,  the  Investors
Agreement,  the MTC  Agreement,  the MRI  Agreement,  the FCC Licensee  Transfer
Agreement,   and   there   are  no   representations,   warranties,   covenants,
understandings,  or agreements,  oral or otherwise,  in relation thereto between
the parties other than those incorporated herein or to be delivered hereunder.

         17.5. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is to be delivered in and should be
construed in  accordance  with and governed by the laws of the  Commonwealth  of
Virginia without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.

         17.6. MODIFICATION. This Agreement cannot be modified or amended except
in writing signed by each of the Purchaser and Sellers' Agent.

         17.7. SUCCESSORS  AND ASSIGNS.  Neither this  Agreement  nor any of the
rights  and   obligations   hereunder  shall  be  assigned,   delegated,   sold,
transferred,  sublicensed,  or  otherwise  disposed  of by  operation  of law or
otherwise,  without  the prior  written  consent  of each of the  other  parties
hereto; provided,  however, that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder  to one or more  subsidiaries  so long as Purchaser is not relieved of
its 


                                       57
<PAGE>


obligations  hereunder;  and  provided  further  that any  change of  control in
respect of Purchaser's  parent,  SBGI, shall not require the consent of Sellers.
In the event of such permitted assignment or other transfer,  all of the rights,
obligations, liabilities, and other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by and against, the
respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto, whether so expressed or
not.

         17.8.  WAIVER.  Any waiver of any  provision  hereof (or in any related
document or  instrument)  shall not be effective  unless made expressly and in a
writing  executed in the name of the party sought to be charged.  The failure of
any party to insist, in any one or more instances,  on performance of any of the
terms or  conditions  of this  Agreement  shall not be  construed as a waiver or
relinquishment of any rights granted  hereunder or of the future  performance of
any such term, covenant,  or condition,  but the obligations of the parties with
respect hereto shall continue in full force and effect.

         17.9.  SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Agreement  shall be deemed
severable,  and if any  part  of any  provision  is held  to be  illegal,  void,
voidable,  invalid,  nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or
as to any party, for any reason, such provision may be changed,  consistent with
the intent of the parties hereto, to the extent reasonably necessary to make the

                         SALE OF ASSETS/EXCLUDED ASSETS

         2.1.  SALE OF  ASSETS.  Upon and  subject  to the terms and  conditions
stated in this Agreement,  on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined),  Seller

Section  2.2,  free and clear of any claims,  liabilities,  security  interests,
mortgages,  liens, pledges,  conditions,  charges, or encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever other than as described on Schedule 2.1.

         2.2  EXCLUDED ASSETS.

                      (iii) the  Option  Agreement  with Gary and Susan  Clarke,
WWBI TV, Inc. dated as of July 11, 1997, as amended and all promissory notes and

                      (v)   subject   to  the  terms  and   conditions   of  the
Indemnification  Escrow Agreement (as defined below), the accounts receivable of
MMP.

                      (vi) the names "Max Media," "Max  Television," "Max Radio"
and "Max Media Properties".

Any  distribution of Excluded Assets by MMP will be made pro rata to the holders
of Membership Units in MMP unless otherwise agreed to by Purchaser.

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.2(a)
above,  MTR and MMP shall each retain an amount of cash,  cash  equivalents  and
other cash items that are sufficient to cover and pay their  respective  Closing
Date  Liabilities.  For  purposes  of this  Agreement,  the term  "Closing  Date
Liabilities"  shall mean the  liabilities  of MTR and MMP (other than for Funded
Debt,  liabilities with respect to program contract  liabilities  accruing after
the Closing Date and  liabilities  with respect to trade and barter  obligations
arising after the Closing Date) whether or not disclosed on any Schedule  hereto
(A) as of the Closing Date;  (B) for  operations  prior to the Closing Date; and
(C) for all liabilities of any kind whatsoever under that certain Mutual Release
dated as of January 1, 1997 and that certain  Settlement  Agreement  dated as of
January 17, 1997 (collectively the "Shareholder Settlement Agreements").  Except
as otherwise provided in this Section 2.2(b), the Closing Date Liabilities shall
be determined in accordance with GAAP  consistently  applied with prior periods,
and shall be consistent with the books and records of MTR and MMP. The amount of
cash,  cash  equivalents  and cash  items  retained  to cover the  Closing  Date
Liabilities shall not be considered Excluded Assets.

                      (i) MMP  shall  deliver  to  Purchaser  at the  Closing  a
certificate (the "Estimate  Certificate")  setting forth its good faith estimate
of the Closing Date Liabilities, 

                                       4
<PAGE>



which shall be used to determine the amount of cash, cash  equivalents and other
cash items  required  to be retained  by MTR and MMP  pursuant  to this  Section
2.2(b).

                      (ii) Within one hundred  twenty (120) days of the Closing,
Purchaser  shall  cause  its  accountant  to  prepare  and  deliver  to Seller a
certificate  setting forth its calculation of the Closing Date  Liabilities (the
"Accountant's  Certificate").  The amount of the Closing Date Liabilities as set
forth on the  Accountant's  Certificate  shall be final unless  Sellers'  Agents
notify  Purchaser within thirty (30) days from their receipt of the Accountant's
Certificate that they dispute the Accountant's  Certificate.  If Sellers' Agents
and Purchaser are unable to agree on the amount of the Closing Date  Liabilities
within  fifteen  (15) days after  Sellers'  Agents'  notice,  the parties  shall
jointly  appoint and engage an  independent  accountant  of national or regional
repute (the  "Independent  Accountant") to perform an independent  evaluation of
the Closing Date Liabilities.  The findings of the Independent  Accountant as to
the amount of the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto.

                      (iii)  Upon  the   determination   of  the  Closing   Date
Liabilities  becoming  final which is different  from the  Estimate  Certificate
either (A)  Purchaser  shall be entitled to a payment  from the  Indemnification
Escrow  equal to the amount by which the  aggregate  amount of the Closing  Date
Liabilities   exceeds  the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shown  on  the  Estimate
Certificate,  taking  into  account any  amounts  paid from the  Indemnification
Escrow under  provisions  similar to this  provision in the MRI  Agreement,  the
Management Agreement and the Investors Agreement,  or (B) Purchaser shall pay to
Disbursing  Agent an amount  by which  the  aggregate  amount  of  Closing  Date
Liabilities  shown  on  the  Estimate   Certificate  exceeds  the  Closing  Date
Liabilities as finally determined.

                      (iv) For  purposes  of  determining  the amount of the Tax
liabilities of MTR to be included in the Closing Date  Liabilities (the "Closing
Date Tax  Liabilities"),  such Tax liabilities shall include all Tax liabilities
of MTR that are  attributable  to items of income,  gain,  loss,  deduction  and
credit of MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities  accruing through and including the
Closing Date, notwithstanding that such items may be reported by MTR, Purchaser,
or Purchaser's  Affiliates in Taxable Periods ending after the Closing Date. The
amount of the Tax  liabilities  attributable to the Tax items of MMP and the FCC
Licensee  Entities shall be determined by assuming that the taxable years of MMP
and the FCC Licensee  Entities,  as well as the taxable years of the Company and
MTR, end as of close of business on the Closing Date and by assuming Purchaser's
compliance with Section 8.8. The Closing Date Tax Liabilities shall not include,
and  Purchaser  shall have no rights of  Indemnification  under  Section 10 with
respect to, any Tax Liabilities arising from the MMP II Distribution.

                      (v) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in
this  Section  2.2,  the final  determination  of the Closing  Date  Liabilities
hereunder  shall not  affect  Purchaser's  indemnification  rights  pursuant  to
Section 10 to the extent the actual  Closing Date  Liabilities  exceed the final
determination thereunder.

                                    SECTION 3

                                 PURCHASE PRICE

Purchaser elects to close upon receipt of Initial Grant, in which case Purchaser
shall give Sellers  reasonable notice of the Closing,  or (ii) the parties shall
mutually agree upon a different date or location;  provided, however, that in no
event shall the Closing be held prior to March 18, 1998; and provided,  further,
that in the  event  the  Closing  is  postponed  past  July 15,  1998,  due to a
postponement  of the Closing under Section 9.8(b) or otherwise,  Seller,  in its
sole  discretion,  may postpone  the Closing to  September 1, 1998.  In no event
shall Closing occur later than the Termination Date.

         Seller hereby represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

                  a.  ORGANIZATION  AND GOOD  STANDING.  Seller is a corporation
duly  organized,  validly  existing and in good  standing  under the laws of the
Commonwealth  of Virginia  hereto and has full corporate  power and authority to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to own and use the assets
owned and used by it. The Company is qualified as a foreign  corporation  and is
in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its

subsidiary corporation.

                  b. RESERVED

                  c. NO CONFLICTS. Except as described on Schedule 5.2c, neither
the  execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement  nor the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated hereby will (i) violate any provision of the articles
of incorporation or by-laws of Seller,  (ii) violate any provision of applicable
law, rule and regulation,  which violation would prevent or materially interfere
with Seller's ability to perform hereunder or have a Material Adverse Effect, or
(iii)  conflict  with or  result  in a  breach  of,  or give  rise to a right of
termination  of, or  accelerate  the  performance  required  by the terms of any
judgment, court order or consent decree, or any agreement,  indenture,  mortgage
or instrument to which Seller is a party or to which its property is subject, or
constitute  a  default  thereunder,   where  such  conflict,  breach,  right  of
termination,  acceleration or default would prevent or materially interfere with
the Seller's ability to perform hereunder or have a Material Adverse

Effect.

                  d. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Seller has provided or made available
to Purchaser copies of the Financial  Statements.  The Financial Statements have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP  consistently  applied with prior periods.
The Financial Statements present fairly the financial position of the Company as
at and for the periods indicated therein.  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.2.d
hereto,  since December 31, 1996, there has not been any Material Adverse Effect
on the  business,  financial  condition,  operations or results of operations of
Seller taken as a whole. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since
December 31, 1996, except as set forth on Schedule 5.2d:

                      (i) Seller has not sold, leased,  transferred, or assigned
Asset;

                      (ii) Seller has not entered into any  material  agreement,
contract, lease, or license affecting the Assets;

                      (iii)  Seller  has  not  accelerated,   terminated,   made
material modifications to, or canceled any material agreement,  contract, lease,
or license to which Seller is a party or by which Seller is bound;

                      (iv) Seller has not imposed any security interest upon any
of the Assets;

                      (viii) Seller has not granted any license or sublicense of
any material rights under or with respect to any Asset;

                      (ix) there has been no change  made or  authorized  in the
charter or bylaws of Seller;

                      (x) the Assets have not experienced  any material  damage,
destruction, or loss (whether or not covered by insurance);

                      (xi)  Seller  has  not  adopted,  amended,   modified,  or
terminated  any bonus,  profit-sharing,  incentive,  severance,  or other  plan,
contract, or commitment for the benefit of any of its directors,  officers,  and
employees  (or taken any such action with  respect to any other  Company Plan or
Company Benefit Arrangement);

                      (xii)  Seller has not made or  changed  any  material  Tax
election or taken any other action with respect to Taxes  inconsistent with past

                                       8

<PAGE>



                      (xiii)  Seller has not adopted any material  change in any
method of accounting or accounting practice,  except as contemplated or required
by GAAP; and

                      (xiv)  except as set forth in this  Agreement,  Seller has
not committed to any of the foregoing.

                  e. EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLANS.  With respect,  as applicable,  to
Benefit Plans and Benefit Arrangements:

                     (a)  Schedule  5.2e  completely  and  accurately  lists all
Company Plans and Company Benefit  Arrangements and specifically  identifies any
that are  Qualified  Plans.  Neither  Seller  nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has ever
maintained  or  contributed  to any  Qualified  Plans other than those listed on
Schedule  5.2e.  The Qualified  Plan has always  qualified in form and operation
under Code Section 401(a) and has a currently  applicable  determination  letter
from the Internal  Revenue  Service,  and its trust has always been exempt under
Code Section  501, and nothing has occurred  with respect to such plan and trust
that could cause the loss of such  qualification  or exemption or the imposition
of any liability, lien, penalty, or tax under ERISA or the Code.

                     (b) Each Company Plan and each Company Benefit  Arrangement
has been maintained in accordance  with its  constituent  documents and with all
applicable  provisions of the Code,  ERISA and other  domestic and foreign laws,
including  federal,  state, and foreign  securities laws and all laws respecting
reporting and disclosure. No Company Plan holds employer securities.

                     (c) Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate (since August 1,
1992) has  sponsored,  maintained,  or had any  liability  (direct or  indirect,
actual or  contingent)  with  respect to any Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA. Neither Seller nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever made or been obligated to
make,  or  reimbursed  or been  obligated to  reimburse  another  employer  for,
contributions  to any  multiemployer  plan (as defined in ERISA Section  3(37)).
Seller has no liability (whether actual,  contingent, or otherwise) with respect
to any  Benefit  Plan  or  Benefit  Arrangement  that is not a  Company  Benefit
Arrangement  or with respect to any Benefit Plan  sponsored  or  maintained  (or
which  has been or  should  have  been  sponsored  or  maintained)  by any ERISA
Affiliate;  and no facts  exist that could  reasonably  be expected to result in
such liability,  as a result of  termination,  withdrawal or funding waiver with
respect to any such plan, program, or arrangements.

                     (d) There are no pending claims or lawsuits by, against, or
relating to any non-Company  Benefit Plans or non-Company  Benefit  Arrangements
that would,  if  successful,  result in liability  for Seller,  and no claims or
lawsuits (other than routine benefit


                                       9

<PAGE>


claims)  have  been  asserted,  instituted  or,  to  the  Knowledge  of  Seller,
threatened  by,  against,  or relating to any  Company  Plan or Company  Benefit
Arrangement,  and Seller does not have Knowledge of any fact that could form the
basis for any such claim or  lawsuit.  The  Company  Plans and  Company  Benefit
Arrangements are not presently under audit or examination (and have not received
notice of a potential audit or examination) by any governmental  authority,  and
no matters are pending with respect to the Qualified Plan under any governmental
compliance programs.

                     (e) No Company Plan or Company Benefit Arrangement contains
any  provision  or is subject to any law that would give rise to any  vesting of
benefits,  severance,  termination, or other payments or liabilities as a result
of the transactions this Agreement contemplates,  and Seller has not declared or
paid any bonus or other  incentive  compensation  or  established  any severance
plan, program, or arrangement in contemplation of the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement.

                     (f) With respect to each Company  Plan,  there have been no
violations  of  Code  Section  4975 or  ERISA  Sections  404 or 406 as to  which
successful  claims  would  result in any  liability  for  Seller  or any  Person
required to be indemnified by it.

                     (g)  Seller  has made  all  required  contributions  to the
Company  Plan as of the last day of each  plan's most recent  fiscal  year,  all
benefits accrued under any unfunded Company Plan or Company Benefit  Arrangement
will have been paid,  accrued,  or otherwise  adequately  reserved in accordance
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles;  and all monies  withheld from
employee  paychecks  with respect to Company Plans have been  transferred to the
appropriate plan within the timing required by governmental regulations.

                     (h) Seller and its ERISA  Affiliates have complied with the
health  continuation rules of Code Sections 4980B (and its predecessor) and with
Code Section 5000. No employee or former  employee of Seller nor  beneficiary of
any such employee or former  employee is, by reason of such employee's or former
employee's  employment,  entitled to receive any  benefits  subject to reporting
under  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  106,  other than as
required by Code Section 4980B or other applicable law.

                     (i)  There   are  no   contracts,   agreements,   plans  or
arrangements,  including but not limited to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,
covering  any  employee  or former  employee  of Seller  that,  individually  or
collectively,  could give rise to the payment of any amount (or portion thereof)
that would not be deductible pursuant to Code Sections 280G, 404 or 162.

to Seller, except as set forth on Schedule 5.2f:

                     (a) Seller is and has been in  compliance  in all  material
respects  with  all  applicable  laws   respecting   employment  and  employment
practices,  terms and  conditions of employment  and wages and hours,  including
without limitation any such laws respecting employment discrimination,  workers'
compensation,  family and medical leave, the Immigration Reform and Control Act,
and occupational safety and health requirements,  and has not and is not engaged
in any unfair labor practice.

                     (b) The  employees  of Seller  are not and have  never been
represented  by any labor  union,  and no  collective  bargaining  agreement  is
binding and in force against, or currently being negotiated by, the Company, and
to Seller's knowledge,  no labor  representation  organization effort exists nor
has there been any such activity within the past three years.

                     (c)  All  Persons   classified  by  Seller  as  independent
contractors  do satisfy  and have  satisfied  the  requirements  of law to be so
classified,  and Seller has fully and accurately  reported their compensation on
IRS Forms 1099 when required to do so.

                     (d) Since  December 31,  1996,  Seller has not employed any
employees.

                     (e) There is no charge or  compliance  proceeding  actually
pending or threatened  against  Seller before the Equal  Employment  Opportunity
Commission or any state, local, or foreign agency responsible for the prevention
of unlawful employment practices.

                  g.  INSURANCE.  Schedule  5.2g  hereto  contains a list of all
insurance  policies  of Seller  and  describes  coverage  thereunder  (including
whether  occurrence  or  claims  made),  other  than  employee-benefit   related
insurance policies. All such policies are legal, valid, binding, enforceable and
in  full  force  and  effect  subject  to  applicable  bankruptcy,   insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium  and other laws  affecting  the rights of  creditors
generally and to the exercise of judicial  discretion in accordance with general
principles of equity (whether  applied by court of law or equity).  There are no
existing  breaches or defaults by Seller or, to Seller's  Knowledge by any other
party  with  respect  to  such  policies,  and  no  notice  of  cancellation  or
termination has been received.

                  h. MATERIAL CONTRACTS. Schedule 5.2h hereto contains a list of
all the  Material  Contracts  and  true  copies  of such  agreements  have  been
furnished to Purchaser or have been made  available to  Purchaser.  All Material
Contracts listed on Schedule 5.2h are

legal,  valid and binding  obligations of Seller  enforceable in accordance with
their  terms and in full force and  effect  subject  to  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and other laws  affecting the right of
creditors  generally  and to the exercise of judicial  discretion  in accordance
with general principles of equity (whether applied by a court of law or equity).
There exists no default or event which,  with notice or lapse of time,  or both,
would  constitute a default by Seller or to the  Company's  Knowledge  any other
party  to  any  such  Material  Contract  or  which  would  permit  termination,
modification or  acceleration.  Seller has not received notice (or otherwise has
knowledge)  that  any  party to any  Material  Contract  intends  to  cancel  or
terminate  any such  agreement  or to exercise or not to exercise  any option to
renew thereunder.

                  i. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.2i,

actions threatened or pending alleging noncompliance therewith.

                  j.  LITIGATION.  Except as set forth on Schedule  5.2j hereto,
there is no suit,  claim,  action,  proceeding  or  arbitration  pending  or, to

governmental  or  administrative  agency  specifically  against or  specifically
affecting Seller, except as disclosed on Schedule 5.2j.

                  k. NO BROKERS.  Except as described on Schedule  5.2k,  Seller
has not  employed  any  broker or  finder  or  incurred  any  liability  for any
brokerage  fees,  commissions or finders fees in connection with the sale of the

     5.3.  REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES  AS TO THE MMP AND THE FCC  LICENSEE
ENTITIES.

     Seller and MMP,  jointly and  severally,  hereby  represent  and warrant to
Purchaser as to MMP and the FCC Licensee Entities as follows:

                  a.  MMP  ORGANIZATION  AND  GOOD  STANDING.  MMP is a  limited
liability company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of Virginia
and has full corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now
being  conducted  and to own and use the  assets  owned  and used by it.  To the
extent required by law, MMP is qualified as a foreign limited  liability company
and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct
of its business or the ownership of its properties  requires such qualification.
MMP  owns  98% of the  outstanding  partnership  interests  in the FCC  Licensee
Entities.

                  b.  CAPITALIZATION  OF MMP. The  designations of each class of
the  membership  units  of MMP and the  number  of  authorized  and  issued  and
outstanding membership units thereof is as described on Schedule 5.3b to the MRI
Agreement.  All


                                       15

<PAGE>



membership  units have been validly issued and are fully paid and  nonassessable
and are held of record by the respective members of MMP as set forth on Schedule
5.3b to the MRI  Agreement.  Except as  described  on  Schedule  5.3b to the MRI
Agreement,  (i) there are no other issued or  outstanding  equity  securities of
MMP;  (ii)  there  are no  membership  or  value  appreciation  rights,  phantom
membership  rights,  profit  participation  rights, or other similar rights with
respect to membership units outstanding;  and (iii) there are no other issued or
outstanding  membership  interests or other  securities  of MMP  convertible  or
exchangeable  at any time into equity  securities of MMP. Except as set forth in
the Operating Agreement of MMP as amended,  MMP is not subject to any commitment
or obligation  that would require the issuance or sale of additional  membership
interests or membership  units of MMP at any time under options,  subscriptions,
warrants,  rights or any other  obligations.  Schedule 5.3b to the MRI Agreement
sets  forth  the  equity  interests  in any  corporation,  partnership,  limited
liability company, joint venture or other entity owned by MMP.

                  c.   ORGANIZATION  AND   CAPITALIZATION  OF  THE  FCC  LICENSE
ENTITIES.  Each FCC License Entity is a limited  partnership  duly organized and
validly  existing  under the laws of the  Commonwealth  of Virginia and has full
partnership  power and  authority  to carry on its  business  as it is now being
conducted  and to own and use the assets  owned and used by it. Each FCC License
Entity is qualified as a foreign  corporation  and is in good standing under the
laws of each  jurisdiction in which the conduct of its business or the ownership
of its properties requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified would not have a Material  Adverse Effect.  No FCC License Entity owns
any direct or indirect  subsidiaries.  MMP is the sole general  partner and owns
ninety-eight  percent  (98%)  of the  partnership  interests  of each of the FCC
License  Entities.  Seller is the sole limited partner and owns two percent (2%)
of the  partnership  interests  of each of the FCC License  Entities  other than
RLLP.  MRI is the  sole  limited  partner  and  owns  two  percent  (2%)  of the
partnership  interests of RLLP. All such partnership interests have been validly
issued  and are  fully  paid and  nonassessable  and are held of  record  by the
respective  partners  as set  forth  above.  There  are no (i)  other  issued or
outstanding  equity  securities of any FCC License Entity,  (ii)  partnership or
value appreciation  rights,  phantom  partnership rights,  profit  participation
rights,   or  other  similar  rights  with  respect  to  partnership   interests
outstanding and (iii) other issued or outstanding partnership interests or other
securities of any FCC License  Entity  convertible or  exchangeable  at any time
into equity  securities  of such FCC License  Entity.  No FCC License  Entity is
subject to any commitment or obligation  that would require the issuance or sale
of additional  partnership interests of any FCC License Entity at any time under
options,  subscriptions,  warrants,  rights  or any  other  obligations.  No FCC
License  Entity  holds any  equity  interest  in any  corporation,  partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture or other entity.

                  d. NO  CONFLICTS.  Except as described on Schedule 5.3d to the
MRI  Agreement,  neither the  execution  and delivery of this  Agreement nor the
consummation  of

                                       16

<PAGE>



the  transactions  contemplated  hereby will (i) violate  any  provision  of the
articles  of  organization  or  operating   agreement  of  MMP  or  the  limited
partnership agreements of the FCC Licensee Entities,  (ii) violate any provision
of  applicable  material  law, rule and  regulation,  or (iii)  conflict with or
result in a breach of, or give rise to a right of termination  of, or accelerate
the  performance  required by the terms of any judgment,  court order or consent
decree, or any material  agreement,  indenture,  mortgage or instrument to which
either  MMP or any FCC  Licensee  Entity  is a party  or to  which  any of their
property is subject,  or constitute a default  thereunder,  where such conflict,
breach, right of termination,  acceleration or default would have a MMP Material
Adverse Effect.

                  e.  REAL  PROPERTY.  The  MMP  Real  Property  owned  and  all
leaseholds  and  other  interests  in MMP Real  Property  used or  useful in the
Business and all buildings, structures, towers, and improvements thereon used or
useful in the  business  and  operations  of the Stations are listed on Schedule
5.3e  to the  MRI  Agreement  and,  except  for  Permitted  Encumbrances  and as
disclosed in Schedule 5.3e to the MRI Agreement, MMP has good and marketable fee
simple title (insurable at standard rates by a reputable national title insurer)
to all fee estates  included in the Real  Property,  and good title to all other
MMP Real Property,  in each case clear of all liens.  The FCC Licensee  Entities
own no real property, leaseholds or other interests in real property. No portion
of the MMP Real  Property or any  building,  structure,  fixture or  improvement
thereon is the subject of, or affected by, any  condemnation,  eminent domain or
inverse  condemnation  proceeding  currently  instituted or pending or, to MMP's
Knowledge, threatened.

         MMP has a valid leasehold interest in all leased property and subleases
to  which it is a party,  and MMP is the  owner  and  holder  of all the  leased
property  purported  to be granted by such  leases and  subleases.  The MMP Real
Property  and the  leases  and  subleases  listed  on  Schedule  5.3e to the MRI
Agreement  constitute all of the real property  owned,  leased or used by MMP in
the business and  operations of the Stations,  which is material to the business
and  operations  of the  Stations.  The Sellers  have  delivered or caused to be
delivered to the Purchaser correct and complete copies of the deeds,  leases and
subleases  listed in Schedule  5.3e to the MRI  Agreement.  With respect to each
lease and sublease listed in Schedule 5.3e to the MRI Agreement:

                             (a) the lease or sublease is legal, valid, binding,
enforceable,  and in full force and effect in all material  respects  subject to
applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium and other laws
affecting  the rights of  creditors  generally  and to the  exercise of judicial
discretion in accordance with several principles of equity (whether applied by a
court of law or equity);

                             (b) MMP and, to MMP's knowledge,  no other party to
the  lease or  sublease  is in  material  breach  or  default,  and no event has
occurred which, with notice 

                                       17
<PAGE>

or lapse of time,  would  constitute  a  material  breach or  default  or permit
termination, modification, or acceleration thereunder;

                             (c) MMP and, to MMP's knowledge,  no other party to
the lease or sublease has repudiated any material provision thereof;

                             (d) MMP is not a party to and, to MMP's  knowledge,
there are no material  disputes,  oral  agreements,  or forbearance  programs in
effect as to the lease or sublease;

                             (e) except as set forth on Schedule 5.3e to the MRI
Agreement, MMP has not assigned,  transferred,  conveyed,  mortgaged,  deeded in
trust, or encumbered any interest in the leasehold or subleasehold; and

                             (f) all facilities  leased or subleased  thereunder
material to the  operation  of the  Stations  have  received  all  approvals  of
governmental  authorities  (including material licenses and permits) required in
connection with the operation thereof,  and have been operated and maintained in
accordance  with  applicable  laws,  rules,  and  regulations  in  all  material
respects.

                  f. PERSONAL PROPERTY. Schedule 5.3f to the MRI Agreement lists
as of the date hereof all items of Personal  Property having a fair market value
in  excess  of  $5,000.00.  Except  as set  forth  on  Schedule  5.3f to the MRI
Agreement,  MMP has good and  marketable  title to all of its material  items of
tangible  personal  property  and  assets  used or useful by MMP  located on its
premises  or shown on the MMP  Financial  Statements  are free and  clear of all
liens,  security  interests  and  encumbrances  other  than those that would not
materially  affect  Purchaser's use or ownership of such personal property after
the  Closing.  The  tangible  personal  property of MMP has been  maintained  in
accordance  with normal  industry  practice and is in good  condition and repair
given the age and use of such property  (subject to normal wear and tear) and is
adequate for its present use by MMP.

                  g. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MMP has provided or made available to
Purchaser copies of the MMP Financial  Statements.  The MMP Financial Statements
have been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP  consistently  applied  with prior
periods  except  in the case of the  unaudited  MMP  Financial  Statements,  the
absence of year-end audit  adjustments and notes.  The MMP Financial  Statements
present fairly the financial position of MMP as at and for the periods indicated
therein,  and are  consistent  with the books and records of MMP.  Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.3g to the MRI  Agreement  hereto,  since  December 31, 1996,
there  has not been any  Material  Adverse  Effect  on the  business,  financial
condition, operations, or results of operations of MMP taken as a whole. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing,  since that date,  except as described
on


                                       18

                             (xix) except as contemplated by this Agreement, the
Investors Agreement, the Management Agreement, the MRI Agreement, and Assignment
and  Assumption  Agreement  by  and  between  MMP  and  the  Max  Media  LLC  II
Distribution Agreement, MMP has not committed to any of the foregoing.

                  h.  FCC.  MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities  have  been  and
currently  are  operated  in  material  compliance  with  the  terms  of the FCC
Licenses,  the  Communications  Act of 1934, as amended,  and applicable  rules,
regulations  and  policies  of the FCC ("FCC  Rules and  Regulations").  All FCC
Licenses, a true and complete list of which is set forth on Schedule 5.3h to the
MRI Agreement, and true and complete copies of each of which have been delivered
to  Purchaser,  are valid and in full force and  effect.  Except as set forth on
Schedule  5.3h to the MRI  Agreement,  no  application,  action or proceeding is
pending  for the  renewal or  modification  of any of the FCC  Licenses  and, to
Sellers' and MMP's Knowledge,  there is not now before the FCC any investigation
or complaint  against MMP or the FCC Licensee Entities relating to the Stations,
the unfavorable  resolution of which would impair the  qualifications of the FCC
Licensee Entities to hold any FCC Licenses. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3h
to the MRI Agreement,  there is no proceeding  pending before the FCC, and there
is no outstanding notice of violation from the FCC with respect to the Stations.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3h to the MRI Agreement, no order or notice of
violation has been issued by any governmental entity which permits,  revocation,
adverse  modification or termination of any FCC License.  Except as set forth on
Schedule  5.3h  to  the  MRI  Agreement  and  except  for  those  conditions  or
restrictions appearing on the face of the FCC Licenses, or other licenses,  none
of the FCC Licenses or other licenses is subject to any restriction or condition
which would limit the operation of the Stations as currently  operated.  The FCC
Licenses  listed in Schedule  5.3h to the MRI  Agreement are currently in effect
and are not  subject to any liens,  or other  encumbrances.  No license  renewal
applications are pending with respect to any of the FCC Licenses. As of the date
hereof,  Sellers, the Company,  MMP, and the FCC License Entities have no reason
to believe that the FCC would not renew the FCC Licenses in the ordinary  course
for a full license term without any adverse  conditions,  upon the timely filing
of appropriate  applications  and payment of the required  filing fee. As of the
date hereof,  Sellers,  the Company,  MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities have no
reason to  believe  that the FCC would  not  grant  the FCC  Application  in the
ordinary  course without any adverse  conditions.  All documents  required by 47
C.F.R.  Section 73.3526 to be kept in each Station's public inspection files are
in such file,  and such file will be  maintained in proper order and complete up

                  i.  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY.  Set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the
MRI  Agreement  is a  complete  list of all  Intellectual  Property  owned by or
licensed to MMP on the date hereof  material to the  operations of the Stations.
To MMP's  Knowledge,  except as 
                                       21
<PAGE>


otherwise set forth on Schedule 5.3i to the MRI Agreement hereto,  MMP owns such
Intellectual Property free and clear of any royalty, lien, encumbrance or charge
and does not  interfere  with the  rights  of  others.  Except  as set  forth on
Schedule 5.3i to the MRI  Agreement,  MMP has not received any written notice or
written claim that any such  Intellectual  Property is not valid or enforceable,
or of any  infringement  upon or conflict  with any patent,  trademark,  service
mark,  copyright or trade name of any third party by MMP. Except as set forth on
Schedule 5.3i to the MRI Agreement, MMP has not given any notice of infringement
to any third party with respect to any of the Intellectual Property and to MMP's
Knowledge no such infringement exists.  There is no Intellectual  Property owned
by or licensed to the FCC Licensee Entities.

                  j. EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLANS.  With respect,  as applicable,  to
Benefit Plans and Benefit Arrangements:

                     (a)  Schedule  5.3j to the  MRI  Agreement  completely  and
accurately  lists  all MMP  Plans  and MMP  Benefit  Arrangements  currently  in
existence  and  specifically  identifies  any that are  Qualified  Plans.  Since
January  1,  1996  (the  date  of  formation  of  MMP),  MMP has  maintained  or
contributed  solely to the  Qualified  Plans listed on Schedule  5.3j to the MRI
Agreement. The Qualified Plans listed on Schedule 5.3j to the MRI Agreement have
always  qualified in form and  operation  under Code  Section  401(a) and have a
currently applicable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and
its trust has always  been  exempt  under Code  Section  501,  and  nothing  has
occurred  with  respect to such plan and trust that could cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption or the imposition of any liability, lien, penalty, or
tax under ERISA or the Code.

                     (b) Each MMP Plan and each MMP Benefit Arrangement has been
maintained in accordance with its constituent  documents and with all applicable
provisions of the Code,  ERISA and other  domestic and foreign  laws,  including
federal,  state, and foreign  securities laws and all laws respecting  reporting
and disclosure. No MMP Plan holds employer securities.

                     (c)  Neither  MMP nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has  sponsored,
maintained, or had any liability (direct or indirect, actual or contingent) with
respect to any Benefit  Plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA.  Neither MMP nor any
ERISA  Affiliate has never made or been obligated to make, or reimbursed or been
obligated to reimburse another employer for,  contributions to any multiemployer
plan (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)).  MMP has no liability (whether actual,
contingent,   or  otherwise)  with  respect  to  any  Benefit  Plan  or  Benefit
Arrangement that is not a MMP Benefit Arrangement or with respect to any Benefit
Plan  sponsored or maintained (or that has been or should have been sponsored or
maintained) by any ERISA Affiliate;  and no facts exist that could reasonably be
expected to result in such liability, as a result of termination,  withdrawal or

                                       22

<PAGE>



funding waiver with respect to any such plan, program, or arrangements.

                     (d) There are no pending claims or lawsuits by, against, or
relating to any  non-MMP  Benefit  Plans or non-MMP  Benefit  Arrangements  that
would,  if  successful,  result in liability for M MP, and no claims or lawsuits
(other than routine  benefit  claims) have been asserted,  instituted or, to the
knowledge of Sellers and the Company  after due inquiry of MMP,  threatened  by,
against,  or relating to any MMP Plan or MMP  Benefit  Arrangement,  and MMP has
advised  Sellers and the Company  that MMP does not have  knowledge  of any fact
that  could  form the basis  for any such  claim or  lawsuit.  MMP Plans and MMP
Benefit  Arrangements are not presently under audit or examination (and have not
received  notice  of a  potential  audit  or  examination)  by any  governmental
authority,  and no matters are pending with respect to the Qualified  Plan under
any governmental compliance programs.

                     (e) No MMP Plan or MMP  Benefit  Arrangement  contains  any
provision  or is  subject  to any law that  would  give rise to any  vesting  of
benefits,  severance,  termination, or other payments or liabilities as a result
of the  transactions  this Agreement  contemplates,  and MMP has not declared or
paid any bonus or other  incentive  compensation  or  established  any severance
plan, program, or arrangement in contemplation of the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement,  the Investors Agreement, the Management Agreement or the MRI
Agreement.

                     (f) With  respect  to each MMP  Plan,  there  have  been no
violations  of  Code  Section  4975 or  ERISA  Sections  404 or 406 as to  which
successful  claims would result in any liability for MMP or any Person  required
to be indemnified by it.

                     (g) MMP has made  all  required  contributions  to each MMP
Plan as of the last day of each plan's most recent  fiscal  year,  all  benefits
accrued  under any unfunded MMP Plan or MMP Benefit  Arrangement  will have been
paid,  accrued,  or otherwise  adequately  reserved in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles;  and all monies withheld from employee paychecks
with respect to MMP Plans have been  transferred to the appropriate  plan within
the timing required by governmental regulations.

                     (h) MMP and its ERISA  Affiliates  have  complied  with the
health  continuation rules of Code Sections 4980B (and its predecessor) and with
Code Section 5000. No employee or former  employee of MMP nor beneficiary of any
such  employee or former  employee  is, by reason of such  employee's  or former
employee's  employment,  entitled to receive any  benefits  subject to reporting
under  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  106,  other than as
required by Code Section 4980B or other applicable law.

arrangements,  including but not limited to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,
covering  any  employee  or  former  employee  of  MMP  that,   individually  or

any unfair labor practice.

                     (b)  The  employees  of MMP are not  and  have  never  been

binding and in force against, or currently being negotiated by, MMP or, to MMP's
Knowledge, no labor representation organization effort exists nor has there been
any such activity within the past three years.

                     (c) All  Persons  classified  by MMP  and the FCC  Licensee
Entities  as   independent   contractors  do  satisfy  and  have  satisfied  the
requirements  of law to be so  classified,  and MMP  has  fully  and  accurately
reported their compensation on IRS Forms 1099 when required to do so.

                     (d)  Since  December  31,  1996,  except  as  described  on
Schedule 5.3k(d) to the MRI Agreement, no employee of or group of employees, the
loss of whom would have significant adverse effect on the business of MMP or the
FCC Licensee Entities,  has notified MMP of his or their intent to (A) terminate

demand for material payments or modifications of his or their  arrangements with
MMP.

                     (e) There is no charge or  compliance  proceeding  actually
pending or, to the knowledge of MMP,  threatened against MMP or the FCC Licensee
Entities before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any state, local,

responsible for the prevention of unlawful employment practices.

                     (f) The FCC Licensee  Entities do not employ,  and have not
in the past, employed employees.

                  l.  INSURANCE.  Schedule  5.3l  to the  MRI  Agreement  hereto
contains a list of all insurance policies  concerning the Business and describes

Material   Contract  or  which  would  permit   termination,   modification   or
acceleration.  Neither MMP nor the FCC Licensee  Entities have received  notice,
nor to MMP's Knowledge, does any party to any Material Contract intend to cancel

Date (which  reserves are adequate and calculated  consistent with past practice
and,  in the case of the reserve as of the Closing  Date,  will not  represent a

the reserve  reflected in the MMP Financial  Statements  represented  of the MMP
Accounts  Receivable  reflected  therein and will not  represent a MMP  Material
Adverse Effect in the  composition  of such MMP Accounts  Receivable in terms of

right of setoff,  other than returns in the ordinary  course of business,  under
any  contract  with any obligor of an MMP  Accounts  Receivable  relating to the

Closing Date a complete and accurate  list of all MMP Accounts  Receivable as of
the Closing Date.

other than those set forth on Schedule 5.3t to the MRI Agreement hereof,  all of
which will be  released at or before the  Closing;  (iii) MMP has full power and
authority to enter into this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions

of MMP;  (iv) this  Agreement  has been duly  executed and  delivered by MMP and
constitutes a legal,  valid and binding obligation of MMP,  enforceable  against
MMP in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,  insolvency,

generally and to the exercise of judicial  discretion in accordance with general
principles  of equity  (whether  applied by a court of law or  equity);  and (v)
except as described on Schedule 5.3t to the MRI  Agreement,  MMP's  interests in
the  Television  Licensees are not subject to any option(s)  warrant(s),  voting

the parties  shall  survive  the  Closing for a period  ending on the earlier to

                                    SECTION 8

                  (a) Seller  shall  prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be


                                       38

<PAGE>



filed,  within the time  (including  extensions) and manner provided by law, all
Tax Returns of Seller, MTR, MMP, and the FCC Licensee Entities that are required
to be filed on or before the Closing Date. In addition,  Seller shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed prior to the Closing Date all
Tax  Returns for  Taxable  Periods of Seller,  MTR,  MMP,  and the FCC  Licensee
Entities for Taxable Periods ending on or before December 31, 1997, even if such
Tax  Returns  are not yet due.  Each of Seller,  MTR,  MMP and the FCC  Licensee
Entities  shall  pay or  cause  to be paid  all  Taxes  shown  as due on its Tax
Returns. Purchaser shall have an opportunity to review and consent to the filing
of all such Tax Returns,  which  consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld or
delayed.

                  (b)  Purchaser  shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be  filed,  within  the time and  manner  provided  by law,  all Tax
Returns of MTR,  MMP,  and the FCC  Licensee  Entities  (i) for Taxable  Periods
ending on or before the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date, except
as described in Section 8.2a, and (ii) for Taxable Periods  beginning before and
ending after the Closing Date ("Straddle Periods"). Purchaser shall pay or cause
to be paid all  Taxes  shown  as due on such Tax  Returns;  provided  that  this
sentence  shall  not  in  any  way  limit  or  affect   Purchaser's   rights  to
indemnification  under  other  provisions  of this  Agreement.  Purchaser  shall
provide  Seller a reasonable  opportunity to review and consent to the filing of
such Tax Returns,  which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld or delayed.
Purchaser  shall not file amended Tax Returns  with  respect to Taxable  Periods
ending on or before  the  Closing  Date or  Straddle  Periods  without  Seller's
consent; provided, however, that Purchaser may file amended Tax Returns for such
Taxable  Periods  without  Seller's  consent if (i) such amended Tax Returns are
filed to correct errors or omissions in previously filed Tax Returns that either
constitute  or are related to a breach of any  representation  or  warranty  set
forth  in  Sections  5.2m,  5.3r  or  5.4l  (determined  without  regard  to the
limitation on the survival of such  representations  and warranties set forth in
Section  7.1),  or (ii) the filing of such amended Tax Return would not increase
the  Taxes  of   Sellers  or  Taxes  for  which   Seller   has   indemnification
responsibility hereunder by more than $25,000.

                  (c)  All Tax  Returns  prepared  and  filed  pursuant  to this
Section 8.2 shall be prepared and filed in accordance with applicable law and in
a  manner  consistent  with  past  practices  of MTR,  and  MMP  (to the  extent
consistent with applicable law).

         8.3.  APPORTIONMENT.  The parties  agree to cause MTR, MMP, and the FCC
Licensee  Entities to file all Tax  Returns  for any  Taxable  Period that would
otherwise  be a Straddle  Period on the basis that the relevant  Taxable  Period
consists of two  periods,  one ending as of the close of business on the Closing
Date and one beginning  the day after the Closing Date,  unless the relevant Tax
Authority  will not accept a Tax Return  filed on that  basis.  For  purposes of
apportioning  any Tax to the  portion of any  Straddle  Period  that 


                                       39
<PAGE>

ends on the Closing Date,  the  determination  shall be made assuming that there
was a closing of the books as of the close of business  on the Closing  Date and
that the taxable years of MTR, MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities  ended on that
date,  except  that  real,  personal  and  intangible  property  Taxes  shall be
apportioned ratably on a daily basis between the portions of the Straddle Period
in question.

         8.4.  COOPERATION  IN TAX  MATTERS.  Seller  and  Purchaser  shall  (a)
cooperate fully, as reasonably requested, in connection with the preparation and
filing of all Tax Returns  prepared and filed  pursuant to Section 8.2; (b) make
available to the other, as reasonably  requested,  all  information,  records or
documents with respect to Tax matters pertinent to Seller,  MTR, MMP and the FCC
Licensee  Entities for all Taxable  Periods ending on or before the Closing Date

expense file all necessary Tax Returns and other  documentation  with respect to
all such  transfer,  documentary,  sales,  use,  stamp,  registration  and other
similar Taxes and fees. If required by applicable  law,  Purchaser  will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

         8.6.  FIRPTA.  Seller  shall  deliver  to  Purchaser  at the  Closing a

allocations based on the fair market value of the assets determined  pursuant to

Allocations").  The 754 Allocations, as set forth on the 754 Certificate,  shall
be final unless  Sellers' Agents notify  Purchaser  within thirty (30) days from
their receipt of the 754 Certificate that they dispute the 754  Allocations.  If
Sellers'  Agents  and  Purchaser  are  unable to agree on the  amount of the 754
Allocations  within fifteen (15) days after Sellers' Agents notice,  the parties
shall jointly appoint and engage an independent accountant or Media appraiser of

final and binding on the parties hereto.

         8.8. CLOSING DATE ACTIONS.  Following the Closing,  Purchaser shall not

actions as are expressly contemplated by this Agreement, including the repayment
of MMP's  Funded  Debt,  and (ii) such  actions as would not  increase  Taxes of
Seller or Taxes for which Seller has indemnification responsibility hereunder.

                      ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND UNDERTAKINGS

         9.1. FURTHER ASSURANCES AND ASSISTANCE. Purchasers, Seller and MMP (and

provided  for herein,  that may be  necessary or  appropriate  to implement  the
provisions of this  Agreement,  whether  before,  at, or after the Closing.  The

information  concerning  Seller,  MMP,  the FCC  Licensees  and the  Business as

not permit  Purchaser or any agent thereof to (i) disrupt the Business,  or (ii)
contact any employee of Seller or MMP without providing  reasonable prior notice
to Seller and  allowing a  representative  of Seller or MMP to be  present.  The
Company and Seller will use their commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of its auditors to permit inclusion of the Financial  Statements and the
MMP Financial Statements in applicable  securities filings of Sinclair Broadcast
Group, Inc. ("SBGI").  If Purchaser requests, it shall have the immediate right,

1988, as amended, (the so-called WARN Act) or any other similar law.

                  (a)  In  the  event  of  any  loss,   damage  or   impairment,

                                       46

<PAGE>



that  interferes  with the normal  operation of the  Stations,  MMP shall notify
Purchaser of same in writing  immediately,  specifying  with  particularity  the
loss,  damage or impairment,  confiscation or condemnation  incurred,  the cause
thereof, if known or reasonably  ascertainable,  and the insurance coverage. MMP

thereto and take such other commercially  reasonable  actions,  as determined in
its sole discretion,  as are necessary to repair, replace or restore such assets
of any Station so damaged to their  prior  condition  as soon as possible  after
such loss, damages or impairment, confiscation or condemnation.

                  (b) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction
of the  assets of any  Station  (other  than  WMMP-TV in the  Charleston,  South
Carolina  market),  the  regular  broadcast  transmission  of one  (1)  or  more
Television  Stations  or two (2) or more Radio  Stations in the normal and usual
manner is interrupted for a period of twelve (12) continuous  hours or more, MMP
shall give prompt written  notice thereof to Purchaser.  If on the Closing Date,
due to  damages  or  destruction  of the  assets  of one (1) or more  Television
Stations  (other than WMMP-TV in the Charleston,  South Carolina  market) or two
(2) or more Radio Stations the regular broadcast transmission of one (1) or more
Television  Stations  (other  than  WMMP-TV in the  Charleston,  South  Carolina
market) or two (2) or more  Radio  Stations  in the  normal and usual  manner is
interrupted  such  that  the  regular  broadcast  signal  of  any  such  Station
(including its effective  radiated power) is diminished in any material respect,
then (i) MMP shall  immediately  give written notice  thereof to Purchaser;  and
(ii)  Purchaser  shall have the right,  by giving prompt  written  notice to the
other,  to  postpone  the  Closing  Date for a period  of up to sixty  (60) days
provided,  however, that the Closing shall occur no later than ten (10) Business
Days after regular broadcast transmission has been restored.

                  (c) In the  event  any  one (1) or  more  Television  Stations
(other than WMMP-TV in  Charleston,  South  Carolina  market) or two (2) or more
Radio Stations normal and usual transmission has not been resumed by the Closing
Date as  postponed  pursuant to section (b) above,  Purchaser  may,  pursuant to
Section  14.1(e),  terminate  this  Agreement by written  notice to the Sellers'
Agent.  Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  however,  Purchaser may, at its option,
proceed to close this Agreement and complete the  restoration and replacement of
any damaged  assets of the Station in question after the Closing Date, MMP shall
deliver or assign to  Purchaser  all  insurance  or other  proceeds  received in
connection  therewith to the extent such  proceeds are received by or payable to
the  Company  or MMP and have not  therefore  been used in or  committed  to the
restoration or replacement of the assets.

                  (d) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction
of the assets the regular  broadcast  transmission  of any  Station  (other than
WMMP-TV in the Charleston, South Carolina market) in the normal and usual manner
is interrupted for a 

                                       47

<PAGE>



period of seven (7)  continuous  days or more,  MMP shall  give  prompt  written
notice  thereof (the  "Interruption  Notice") to Purchaser.  Upon receipt of the
Interruption  Notice,  Purchaser  shall have the right, in its sole and absolute
discretion, by giving prompt written notice thereof to Seller and MMP within two
(2) Business  Days of the date of the  Interruption  Notice,  to terminate  this
Agreement with the effect specified in Section 14.2(b) hereof.

                  (e) Until the Closing Date, MMP will maintain and cause MMP to
maintain the existing  insurance  coverages  listed on Schedule  5.3l to the MRI
Agreement on the Stations and each Station's assets.

         9.9. INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. Purchaser has not relied and
is not relying on the  specification of any dollar amount in any  representation
or warranty made in this Agreement or any Schedule  hereto to indicate that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material,  and agrees not to
assert  in  any  dispute  or   controversy   between  the  parties  hereto  that
specification of such amounts  indicates or is evidence as to whether or not any
obligation,  item or matter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

         9.10.    COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

                  (a) At the Closing,  Sellers' Agents shall designate Purchaser
as its agent solely for the purposes of collecting the MMP Accounts  Receivable.
Purchaser will collect the MMP Accounts  Receivable  during the period beginning
on the  Closing  Date and  ending on the 180th day after the  Closing  Date (the
"Collection  Period")  with the same  care and  diligence  Purchaser  uses  with
respect to its own accounts receivable and hold all such MMP Accounts Receivable
in trust for Sellers until remitted by Purchaser to the  Indemnification  Escrow
Agent or the Collections  Account pursuant hereto.  Purchaser shall not make any
referral or  compromise  of any of the MMP Accounts  Receivable  to a collection
agency or attorney for  collection  and shall not settle or adjust the amount of
any of the MMP  Accounts  Receivable  without the  written  approval of Sellers'
Agent.  If, during the  Collection  Period,  Purchaser  receives  monies from an
account  debtor of Purchaser  that is also an account debtor of MMP with respect
to any MMP Accounts Receivable,  Purchaser shall credit the sums received to the
oldest account due, except where an account is disputed by the account debtor as
properly due, and the account  debtor has so notified  Purchaser in writing,  in
which case,  payments  received shall be applied in accordance  with the account
debtor's  instructions;  provided  that upon  resolution  of such dispute if any
amounts in dispute are received by Purchaser, Purchaser shall remit such amounts
to the  Indemnification  Escrow  Agent in  accordance  with the  Indemnification
Escrow  Agreement  up to the  amount of the  Additional  Indemnification  Amount
Deposit and, thereafter, to the Collections Account.

                  (b) On the ninetieth  (90th) day after the Closing Date and on
or before the fifth  Business  Day after the end of each full  fifteen  (15) day
period  thereafter  during the  Collection  Period,  Purchaser  shall deliver to
Sellers' Agents a list of the amounts  collected by Purchaser  before the end of
such  period with  respect to the  Accounts  Receivable.  On or before the fifth
Business Day after the end of the Collection Period,  Purchaser shall deliver to
Sellers'  Agents  a  list  of  all  of  the  Accounts   Receivable  that  remain
uncollected.

                  (c) Sellers'  Agents shall  establish and maintain  during the
Collection  Period (and for as long after the Collection  Period as Sellers deem
appropriate) a bank account (the "Collections  Account") at a commercial bank in
Norfolk,  Virginia,  as notified in writing by Sellers'  Agents to Purchaser for
the deposit of  collections  of the MMP Accounts  Receivable in accordance  with
this Section 9.10.  Sellers' Agents shall have sole disbursement  authority over
the Collections  Account. On the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date (or
if such  day is not a  Business  Day,  on the  next  succeeding  Business  Day),

the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement all amounts collected with respect to any
MMP  Accounts  Receivable,  not to exceed  the  excess of  $12,750,000  over the
Initial Deposit (the  "Additional  Indemnification  Amount  Deposit"),  and (ii)
deposit in the Collections Account any other MMP Accounts  Receivable  collected
by Purchaser as of such date.  On and after the  ninetieth  (90th) day after the
Closing Date until the  expiration of the  Collections  Period,  within five (5)
Business Days of the end of each full fifteen (15) day period,  Purchaser  shall
deposit all amounts  collected with respect to the Accounts  Receivable with the
Indemnification  Escrow Agent pursuant to the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement
until the total of all amounts  deposited  pursuant to the previous sentence and
this  sentence  equals  the  Additional   Indemnification  Amount  Deposit  and,
thereafter,  in the  Collections  Account.  Sellers' Agents shall be entitled to
dispose of all amounts deposited in the Collections Account from time to time as
it chooses, in its sole discretion, and Purchaser and the Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall have no rights therein;  provided,  however,  that Purchasers  shall
have no  liability  whatsoever  to  Sellers  with  respect  to  Sellers'  Agents
disposition  of any amounts  disbursed  by Sellers'  Agent from the  Collections
Account.

                  (d) After the expiration of the Collection  Period,  Purchaser

                  (e) Any MMP Accounts Receivable remaining uncollected 180 days
after the Closing Date shall be  transferred to Sellers'  Agents,  together with
all files  concerning  the  collection  or attempt to collect  such MMP Accounts
Receivable   hereunder,   and  Purchaser   shall   thereafter  have  no  further
responsibility with respect thereto.

                  (f)  Purchaser  shall  have no right  to  setoff  any  amounts
collected for MMP Accounts  Receivable  against any amounts owed to Purchaser by
Seller;  provided  that this Section 9.10 shall not be deemed to limit the right
of Purchaser to make claims  against the  Indemnification  Amount in  accordance
with,  and  subject  to,  the terms and  conditions  of this  Agreement  and the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

         9.11. OTHER ACQUISITIONS. Without limiting any other provisions of this

directly  or  indirectly  by or on behalf of any of them shall  acquire or enter
into any  agreement  to acquire a  television  station  or radio  station in any
markets in which any Television  Station or Radio Station currently  broadcasts,
if such acquisition  would materially delay the granting of the FCC Application;
provided,  however,  that  nothing in this  Section  9.11 shall be  construed to
preclude Purchaser proceeding to closing with respect to any transaction pending
as of the date hereof.

         9.12. PAYMENT OF CERTAIN  LIABILITIES PRIOR TO CLOSING.  Seller and MMP
shall comply in all respects with their obligations under Section 2.2(b) of this
Agreement.

         9.13.    RESERVED

         9.14. VALUE APPRECIATION RIGHTS AND INCENTIVE FEES. Before Closing, MMP

Agreements ("Incentive Agreements"), including, but not limited to, the VARS and
Incentive Agreements listed on Schedules 5.3j and 5.3m to the MRI Agreement.

however,  for purposes of this Section 10.1(b)(i),  the representation set forth

Material Adverse Effect;

                           (ii)    the  material  failure  by Seller to perform
any covenant of Seller contained herein;

                           (iii)   breaches by Seller,  MMP,  MTR or any of the

                  (c) For  purposes  of  Section  10.1(b)(iv),  Taxes of MTR for

gain, loss, deduction,  and credit of MMP and the FCC Licensee Entities accruing
through the Closing  Date,  determined on the basis of a closing of the books of

Closing Date Liabilities or are described in Section 10.1(c), or (ii) such Taxes
arise out of, result from or are attributable to a breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of Sellers set forth in this Agreement.

          10.3.  LIMITATIONS  AND  OTHER  PROVISIONS  REGARDING  INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS.

          Seller's  obligation to indemnify  Purchaser  pursuant to Section 10.1
shall be subject to all of the following limitations:

                  (a)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained in this Agreement or
applicable law to the contrary,  Purchaser  agrees that the payment of any claim
(whether such claim is framed in tort, contract, or otherwise) made by Purchaser
for  indemnification  hereunder  subsequent  to the Closing  Date,  for whatever
reason,  shall be limited to, and shall only be made from,  the  Indemnification
Amount in accordance with the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement and, except for
claims against the Indemnification  Amount,  Purchaser waives and releases,  and
shall  have no  recourse  against,  Seller  as a  result  of the  breach  of any

                                       52
<PAGE>


representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement of Seller contained herein, or
otherwise  arising out of or in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated
hereby or the operation of the Stations,  and such indemnification  shall be the
sole and  exclusive  remedy  for  Purchaser  with  respect to any such claim for
indemnification  after the Closing Date; provided,  however, that nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit any  rights or  remedies  that  Purchaser  may have for
Sellers' fraud. The Indemnification Escrow shall be disbursed in accordance with
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

                  (b) Anything in this  Agreement or any  applicable  law to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  it is understood and agreed by Purchaser that, other
than with respect to Seller (but not including any partner,  director,  officer,
employee,  agent or  Affiliate  Seller  (including  any  shareholder,  director,
officer,  employee, agent or Affiliate of the Seller)) as expressly provided for
in Section 10.1, no partner, director,  officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of
Seller  (including  any  shareholder,  director,  officer,  employee,  agent  or
Affiliate  of Seller)  shall have (i) any  personal  liability to Purchaser as a
result of the breach of any representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement of
Sellers  contained herein or otherwise  arising out of or in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby or the operations of the Stations,
or (ii) any personal  obligation to indemnify  Purchaser for any of  Purchaser's
claims pursuant to Section 10.1 and Purchaser waives and releases and shall have
no recourse  against any of such parties  described in this Section 10.3(c) as a
result of the breach of any representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement of
Seller  contained  herein or otherwise  arising out of or in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby or the operations of the Stations;
provided,  however,  that nothing  herein shall be deemed to limit any rights or
remedies that Purchaser may have for Seller's fraud.

                  (c)  Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to
the  contrary,  Seller  shall not be  liable  to  Purchaser  in  respect  of any
indemnification  hereunder  until the  aggregate  amount of Losses of  Purchaser
under  this  Agreement,  the MRI  Agreement,  the  Investors  Agreement  and the
Management  Agreement  exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars  ($250,000.00)
(the "Basket Amount"),  and then only to the extent of the excess of Losses over
the amount of One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000.00);  provided,
however, that this paragraph shall not apply to (i) payments pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(iii), (ii) indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iv),  10.1(b)(vi),
and 10.1(b)(vii) (to the extent indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(vii)
relates  to an item  disclosed  on a Schedule  and/or set forth on the  Estimate
Certificate or the Accountant's Certificate),  or (iii) indemnification pursuant
to Sections  10.1(b)(i) for breaches of the  representations  and warranties set
forth in Sections 5.2m, 5.3r, and 5.41.

                  (d) In  determining  the  amount of any Tax or other  Loss for
which 

                                       53
<PAGE>

indemnification is provided under this Agreement,  such Loss shall be (i) net of
any insurance  recovery made by the indemnified party, (ii) reduced to take into
account any net Tax benefit  realized by the indemnified  party arising from the
deductibility  of such Tax or Loss,  and (iii)  increased to take account of any
net Tax cost  incurred  by the  indemnified  party  arising  from the receipt of
indemnification  payments hereunder. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall
initially  be made  without  regard to this  paragraph  and shall be  reduced to
reflect any net Tax benefit or  increased to reflect any net Tax cost only after
the indemnified  party has actually  realized such benefit or cost. For purposes
of this  Agreement,  an  indemnified  party  shall be deemed  to have  "actually
realized" a net Tax benefit or net Tax cost to the extent that, and at such time
as, the amount of Taxes payable by such  indemnified  party is (x) reduced below
the amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay
but for the  deductibility  of such Tax or Losses,  and (y) increased  above the
amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay but
for the receipt of such  indemnification  payments.  The amount of any reduction
hereunder  shall be  adjusted to reflect any final  determination  (which  shall
include the  execution  of Form 870-AD or  successor  form) with  respect to the
indemnified  party's  liability  for Taxes.  Any indemnity  payments  under this
Agreement  shall be  treated  as an  adjustment  to the  Purchase  Price for Tax
purposes,  unless a final determination with respect to the indemnified party or
any of its affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.

                  (e) No claim  for  indemnification  for  Losses  shall be made
after expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section 7.1 hereof.

                  (f)   Anything   to  the   contrary  in  this   Section   10.3
notwithstanding, the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Section
10.3 do not apply to or limit Purchaser's rights under Section 14.2.

         10.4.    NOTICE OF CLAIM; DEFENSE OF ACTION.

                  (a) An  indemnified  party shall  promptly  give the  Sellers'
Agent notice of any matter which an  indemnified  party has determined has given
or could give rise to a right of indemnification  under this Agreement,  stating
the nature and, if known,  the amount of the Losses,  and method of  computation
thereof,  all with  reasonable  particularity  and containing a reference to the
provisions of this  Agreement in respect of which such right to  indemnification
is claimed  or arises;  provided  that the  failure of any party to give  notice
promptly  as required in this  Section  10.4 shall not relieve any  indemnifying
party of its indemnification  obligations except to the extent that such failure
materially  prejudices the rights of such  indemnifying  party.  The indemnified
party shall give  continuing  notice  promptly  thereafter  of all  developments
coming to Sellers' Agent's attention materially 

                                       54
<PAGE>

affecting any matter relating to any indemnification claims.

                  (b)  Except  as  otherwise   provided  in  Section  10.5,  the
obligations and liabilities of an indemnifying  party under this Section 10 with
respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that are subject to the
indemnification  provided  for in this  Section  10,  shall be  governed  by and
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

                           (i) With  respect  to third  party  claims,  promptly
after  receipt  by an  indemnified  party of notice of the  commencement  of any
action or the presentation or other assertion of any claim which could result in
any  indemnification  claim  pursuant  to  Section  10.1  or 10.2  hereof,  such
indemnified  party shall give prompt  notice  thereof to Sellers'  Agent and the
indemnifying  part(ies)  shall be  entitled  to  participate  therein or, to the
extent that it desires, assume the defense thereof with its own counsel.

                           (ii) If the  indemnifying  part(ies) elects to assume
the defense of any such action or claim, the indemnifying part(ies) shall not be
liable  to the  indemnified  party  for any fees of other  counsel  or any other
expenses, in each case incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof.

                           (iii) The indemnifying part(ies) shall be authorized,
without consent of the indemnified party being required, to settle or compromise
any such action or claim,  provided that such settlement or compromise  includes
an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out
of such action or claim.

                           (iv) Whether or not an indemnifying  part(ies) elects
to assume the defense of any action or claim, the  indemnifying  part(ies) shall
not be liable  for any  compromise  or  settlement  of any such  action or claim
effected without its consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                           (v) The  parties  agree to  cooperate  to the fullest
extent possible in connection with any claim for which indemnification is or may
be sought under this Agreement,  including, without limitation, making available
all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information in its possession or
under its  control  relating  thereto as is  reasonably  requested  by the other
party.

         10.5     TAX CONTESTS.

                  (a) If any  party  receives  written  notice  from any  Taxing
Authority  of any Tax  Proceeding  with  respect  to any Tax for which the other
party is obligated to provide  indemnification under this Agreement,  such party
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party; provided,  however,
that the  failure  to give such  notice  shall not  affect 

                                       55
<PAGE>


the indemnification  provided hereunder except to the extent that the failure to
give such notice materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

                  (b) Seller,  acting through  Sellers'  Agents,  shall have the
right, at its own expense, to control and make all decisions with respect to any
Tax Proceeding  relating  solely to Taxes of Seller and MTR for Taxable  Periods
ending on or before the Closing Date;  provided,  that  Purchaser and counsel of
its  own  choosing  shall  have  the  right,  at  Purchaser's  own  expense,  to
participate  fully in all  aspects  of the  prosecution  or  defense of such Tax
Proceeding;  and  provided  further  that  Seller  shall not settle any such Tax
Proceeding  without the prior written  consent of Purchaser if such  settlements
could increase the past,  present or future Tax liability of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates,  or any Tax Liability of MTR for any  Post-Closing Tax Period by
an amount greater than $25,000.

                  (c) Seller,  acting through  Sellers'  Agents,  shall have the
right, at its own expense,  to jointly control and participate with Purchaser in
all Tax Proceedings  relating to Taxes of MTR for a Straddle  Period.  If Seller
exercises such right, neither party shall settle any such Tax Proceeding without
the prior written consent of the other.

                  (d) If  Seller,  acting  through  Sellers'  Agents,  does  not
exercise its right to assume  control of or participate in any Tax Proceeding as
provided under this Section 10.5,  Purchaser may,  without waiving any rights to
indemnification  hereunder,  defend or settle the same in such  manner as it may
deem appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion.

                  (e) Purchaser  shall control all Tax  Proceedings  relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns of MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities.  In the case of Tax
Proceedings  relating  solely to Taxable  Periods of MMP ending on or before the
Closing Date and Straddle  Periods of MMP,  Purchaser shall keep Seller's Agents
fully  informed as to the status of any such Tax Proceeding and shall not settle
such a Tax  Proceeding  without the prior  written  consent of Seller's  Agents,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided that Seller's Agents'
consent  to a  settlement  shall  only be  required  if such  settlements  could
increase   Sellers'  Taxes  or  Taxes  for  which  Seller  has   indemnification
responsibility hereunder by an amount greater than $25,000.

                  (f) In the event that the  provisions of this Section 10.5 and
the provisions of Section 10.4(b) conflict or otherwise each apply by the terms,
this Section 10.5 shall exclusively govern all matters concerning Taxes.

                  (a) At any time by mutual  written  consent of  Purchaser  and
Seller;

                  (b) By either Purchaser or Seller, if the terminating party is
not in default or breach in any material  respect of its obligations  under this
Agreement, if the Closing hereunder has not taken place on or before October 31,
1998, except where the Closing has been postponed  pursuant to the provisions of
Section 9.8, in which case the  applicable  date shall be upon the expiration of
the period referred to in Section 9.8(b) (the "Termination Date");

                  (c) by  Seller,  if  Seller's  not in default or breach in any
respect of their obligations  under this Agreement,  if all of the conditions in
Section  11.2 have not been  satisfied or waived by the date  scheduled  for the
Closing (as such date may be postponed pursuant to Section 9.8);

                  (d) by Purchaser,  if Purchaser is not in default or breach in
any material  respect of its  obligations  under this  Agreement,  if all of the
conditions  set forth in Section  11.1 have not been  satisfied or waived by the
date  scheduled  for the  Closing  (as such date may be  postponed  pursuant  to
Section 9.8);

                  (e) by Purchaser, pursuant to Section 9.8.

         14.2     PROCEDURE AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

                  (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either or
both  Purchaser  and/or Seller  pursuant to Sections 9.8 or 14.1 hereof,  prompt
written  notice  thereof  shall  forthwith  be given to the other party and this
Agreement  shall  terminate and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be
abandoned  without further action by any of the parties  hereto,  but subject to
and without  limiting  any other rights of the parties  specified  herein in the
event a party is in default or breach in any material respect of its obligations
under this Agreement.  If this Agreement is terminated as provided  herein,  all
filings,  applications  and  other  submissions  relating  to  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby as to which  termination  has occurred shall, to the extent
practicable,  be withdrawn  from the agency or other Person to which such filing
is made.

                  (b) If  this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  Section
14.1(d),  the payment  made by  Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1)  shall be
returned to Purchaser and Purchaser  shall have the right to pursue all remedies
available  hereunder at law or in equity,  including,  without  limitation,  the
right to seek specific performance and/or actual monetary


                                       62

<PAGE>



damages,  but excluding  consequential and incidental damages. In recognition of
the unique character of the property to be sold hereunder, and the damages which
Purchaser  will suffer in the event of a  termination  pursuant to the foregoing
Sections of this Agreement,  Seller hereby waives any defense that Purchaser has
an adequate remedy at law for the breach of this Agreement by Seller.

                  (c) If  this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  Section
14.1(c)  and  Purchaser  shall  be in  breach  in any  material  respect  of its
representations,  warranties, covenants, agreements, or obligations set forth in
this  Agreement,  then and in that event,  Seller shall have the right to retain
the amount  delivered  by  Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1) as  liquidated
damages,  and as the sole and  exclusive  remedy of Seller as a  consequence  of
Purchaser's  default (which  aggregate  amount the parties agree is a reasonable
estimate  of the  damages  that  will be  suffered  by Seller as a result of the
default by  Purchaser  and does not  constitute a penalty),  the parties  hereby
acknowledging  the  inconvenience  and  nonfeasability  of  otherwise  obtaining
inadequate remedy.

                  (d) If this  Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  Sections
14.1(a),  14.1(b) and 14.1(e), the payment made by Purchaser pursuant to Section
3.1(1) shall be returned to Purchaser.

                  (e) A notice  of  termination  made  under  any  provision  of
Section  14.1 of this  Agreement  shall be deemed to be a notice of  termination
under the  termination  provisions  of the Investor  Agreement,  the  Management
Agreement and the MRI Agreement.

                  (f) In the event of a default by either  party that results in
a lawsuit or other proceeding for any remedy available under this Agreement, the
prevailing party, to the extent it is the prevailing party, shall be entitled to
reimbursement  from the other party of its  reasonable  legal fees and expenses,
whether incurred in arbitration, at trial, or on appeal.

                                 ---------------

         16.1.  SELLERS'  AGENTS.  Seller hereby  irrevocably  appoints Allen B.

"Sellers'  Agents") as his,  her or its agent and  attorney-in-fact  to take any
action  required  or  permitted  to be taken by  Seller  under the terms of this
Agreement,  including,  without limiting,  the generality of the foregoing,  the
payment of expenses relating to the transactions  contemplated by the Agreement,
and the right to waive,  modify or amend any of the terms of this  Agreement  in
any  respect,  whether  or not  material,  and agrees to be bound by any and all
actions  taken by the  Sellers'  Agents on his or its  behalf.  Any action to be

Sellers' Agents shall continue in that capacity.  Seller agrees to indemnify the
Sellers'  Agents  from and  against  and in respect of any and all  liabilities,
damages,  claims, costs, and expenses,  including, but not limited to attorneys'
fees, arising out of or due to any action by them as the Sellers' Agents and any
and all actions,  proceedings,  demands,  assessments,  or judgments, costs, and
expenses incidental thereto,  except to the extent that the same result from bad
faith or gross negligence on the part of the Sellers' Agents. Purchaser shall be
entitled  to rely  exclusively  upon any  communications  given by the  Sellers'
Agents on behalf of Seller,  and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken in  reliance  upon the  Sellers'  Agents.  Purchaser  shall be entitled to
disregard any notices or communications  given or made by Seller unless given or
made through the Sellers' Agents.

Management Agreement, the MRI Agreement and the FCC Licensee Transfer Agreement,
the Annexes,  Schedules and Exhibits and the documents to be delivered hereunder

otherwise,  without  the prior  written  consent  of each of the  other  parties
hereto; provided,  however, that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder  to one or more  subsidiaries  so long as Purchaser is not relieved of
its obligations  hereunder;  and provided  further that any change of control in
respect of Purchaser's parent, SBGI, shall not require the consent of Seller. In
the event of such  permitted  assignment or other  transfer,  all of the rights,

be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by and against, the

                  a. MMP II ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING.  MMP II is a limited
liability company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of Virginia
and has  full  power  and  authority  to carry on its  business.  To the  extent
required by law, MMP II shall be, as of the Closing Date, qualified as a foreign
limited  liability  company and shall be in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction  in which the  conduct  of its  business  or the  ownership  of its
properties  requires  such  qualification.  Seller owns 100% of the  outstanding
membership interests in MMP II.

                  b.  CAPITALIZATION  OF MMP II. MMP owns 100% of the membership
units of MMP II. All  membership  units have been  validly  issued and are fully
paid and  non-assessable  and held of record  by MMP.  Except  as  described  on
Schedule 5.2b, (i) there are no other issued or outstanding equity securities of
MMP II;  (ii) there are no  membership  or value  appreciation  rights,  phantom
membership  rights,  profit  participation  rights or other similar  rights with
respect to membership units outstanding;  and (iii) there are no other issued or
outstanding   membership   units  or  securities  of  MMP  II,   convertible  or
exchangeable,  at any time into equity  securities of MMP II. MMP is not subject
to any  commitment  or  obligation  that would  require the  issuance or sale of
additional  membership interests or membership units of MMP II at any time under
options,  subscriptions,  warrants, rights or other obligations.  Other than the
MMP II Licensee  Entities,  MMP II has no other  equity  interests  in any other
corporation,  partnership,  limited  liability  company,  joint venture or other
entity.

                  c.   ORGANIZATION  AND   CAPITALIZATION  OF  THE  FCC  LICENSE
ENTITIES.  Each MMP II Licensee Entity is a limited  partnership  duly organized
and validly existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and has full
partnership  power and  authority  to carry on its  business  as it is now being
conducted  and to own and use the  assets  owned  and  used by it.  Each  MMP II
Licensee Entity is qualified as a foreign limited  partnership under the laws of
each  jurisdiction  in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its
properties  requires  such  qualification,  except  where the  failure  to be so
qualified  would  not have a  material  adverse  effect.  Neither  of the MMP II
License Entities own any direct or indirect subsidiaries. MMP II, as of the date
hereof, is the sole general partner and owns  ninety-eight  percent (98%) of the
partnership  interests of each of the MMP Licensee  Entities.  Seller, as of the
date  hereof,  is the sole  limited  partner  and owns two  percent  (2%) of the
partnership  interests  of  each  of the  MMP II  Licensee  Entities.  All  such
partnership   interests  have  been  validly  issued  and  are  fully  paid  and
nonassessable  and are held of record by the  respective  partners  as set forth
above. There are no (i) other issued or outstanding equity securities of the MMP
II Licensee  Entities,  (ii) partnership or value appreciation  rights,  phantom
partnership rights,  profit  participation  rights, or other similar rights with
respect  to  partnership   interests  outstanding  and  (iii)  other  issued  or
outstanding  partnership  interests or other  securities of


                                       5
<PAGE>

either of the MMP II Licensee  Entities  convertible or exchangeable at any time
into equity  securities of such MMP II Licensee Entity.  Neither MMP II Licensee
Entity is  subject to any  commitment  or  obligation  that  would  require  the
issuance or sale of additional  partnership  interests of either MMP II Licensee
Entity at any time under options,  subscriptions,  warrants, rights or any other
obligations.  No MMP  II  Licensee  Entity  holds  any  equity  interest  in any
corporation,  partnership,  limited  liability  company,  joint venture or other
entity.

                  d. NO  CONFLICTS.  Neither the  execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby will (i)
violate any provision of the articles of organization or operating  agreement of
MMP II or the limited  partnership  agreements of the MMP II Licensee  Entities,
(ii) other than with respect to the matters for which  waivers are sought in the
FCC Application from the FCC, violate any provision of applicable  material law,
rule and  regulation,  which  violation would prevent or interfere with Seller's
ability to perform  hereunder,  or (iii) conflict with or result in a breach of,
or give  rise to a right  of  termination  of,  or  accelerate  the  performance
required by the terms of any  judgment,  court order or consent  decree,  or any
material agreement,  indenture, mortgage or instrument to which either MMP II or
either MMP II  Licensee  Entity is a party or to which any of their  property is
subject, or constitute a default thereunder.

                  e. REAL PROPERTY.  Other than the License Assets,  neither MMP
II nor the MMP II Licensee Entities own or lease any real property.

                  f. PERSONAL PROPERTY.  Other than the License Assets,  neither
MMP II nor either of the MMP Licensee Entities own nor lease personal property.

                  g.  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS.  Neither  MMP  II  nor  the  MMP II
Licensee Entities prepare or maintain Financial Statements.

                  h. FCC. MMP II and the MMP II Licensee  Entities have been and
currently  are  operated  in  material  compliance  with  the  terms  of the FCC
Licenses,  the  Communications  Act of 1934, as amended,  and applicable  rules,
regulations  and  policies  of the FCC ("FCC  Rules and  Regulations").  All FCC
Licenses held by the MMP II Licensee Entities, a true and complete list of which
is set forth on Schedule 5.3h to the MRI Agreement, and true and complete copies
of each of which have been  delivered to Purchaser,  are valid and in full force
and  effect.  Except  as set forth on  Schedule  5.3h to the MRI  Agreement,  no
application,  action or proceeding is pending for the renewal or modification of
any of the FCC Licenses and, to Seller's and MMP's  Knowledge,  there is not now
before  the FCC any  investigation  or  complaint  against  MMP II or the MMP II
Licensee Entities relating to the MMP II Stations, the unfavorable resolution of
which


                                       6
<PAGE>

would impair the  qualifications of the MMP II Licensee Entities to hold any FCC
Licenses. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3h to the MRI Agreement, there is no
proceeding  pending  before  the FCC,  and  there is no  outstanding  notice  of
violation from the FCC with respect to the MMP II Stations.  Except as set forth
on Schedule 5.3h to the MRI Agreement,  no order or notice of violation has been
issued  by  any   governmental   entity  which  permits,   revocation,   adverse
modification or termination of any FCC License.  Except as set forth on Schedule
5.3h to the MRI  Agreement  and  except  for those  conditions  or  restrictions
appearing on the face of the FCC Licenses,  or other  licenses,  none of the FCC
Licenses or other  licenses is subject to any  restriction  or  condition  which
would limit the operation of the MMP II Stations as currently operated.  The FCC
Licenses  listed in Schedule  5.3h to the MRI  Agreement are currently in effect
and are not  subject to any liens,  or other  encumbrances.  No license  renewal
applications are pending with respect to any of the FCC Licenses. As of the date
hereof,  Seller,  MMP, MMP II and the MMP II Licensee Entities have no reason to
believe that the FCC would not renew the FCC Licenses in the ordinary course for
a full license term without any adverse  conditions,  upon the timely  filing of
appropriate  applications and payment of the required filing fee. Other than the
waivers requested in the FCC Application, as of the date hereof, Seller, MMP II,
MMP and the MMP II  Licensee  Entities  have no reason to  believe  that the FCC
would not grant the FCC  Application in the ordinary  course without any adverse
conditions.  All documents  required by 47 C.F.R.  Section 73.3526 to be kept in
each of the MMP II Station's public  inspection files are in such file, and such
file will be  maintained  in proper  order and  complete  up to and  through the
Closing Date.

                  i.  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY.  MMP II and  the  MMP II  Licensee
Entities do not own any Intellectual Property.

                  j. BENEFIT PLANS.  MMP II and the MMP II Licensee  Entities do
not and have not in the past maintained or contributed to Benefit Plans. Neither
MMP II nor MMP II Licensee  Entities,  nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has  sponsored,
maintained, or had any liability (direct or indirect, actual or contingent) with
respect to any Benefit Plan subject to Title IV or ERISA. Neither MMP II nor MMP
II Licensee Entities, nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever made or been obligated to
make,  or  reimbursed  or been  obligated to  reimburse  another  employer  for,
contributions to any multiemployer  plan (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37). MMP
II and  the  MMP  II  Licensee  Entities  have  no  liability  (whether  actual,
contingent,   or  otherwise)  with  respect  to  any  Benefit  Plan  or  Benefit
Arrangement,  and no facts exist that could  reasonably be expected to result in
such liability, as a result of termination,  withdrawal,  or funding waiver with
respect to any such plan, program, or arrangement.

                  k. LABOR. Other than the FCC Employees, neither MMP II nor the
MMP II Licensee  Entities  have  employed or currently  employ  employees.  With
respect

                                       7

Seller's Knowledge, threatened alleging noncompliance therewith.

                  o. LITIGATION.  There is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or

the Closing Date,  except as described in Section  8.2(a),  and (ii) for Taxable
Periods beginning before and ending after the Closing Date ("Straddle Periods").
Purchaser  shall  pay or  cause to be paid  all  Taxes  shown as due on such Tax
Returns;  provided  that  this  sentence  shall  not in any way  limit or affect
Purchaser's  rights to any  indemnification  to which it may be  entitled  under
other  provisions  of this  Agreement  or under the MMP  Acquisition  Documents.
Purchaser shall provide Seller a reasonable opportunity to review and consent to
the filing of such Tax Returns, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. Purchaser shall not file amended Tax Returns with respect to Taxable
Periods  ending  on or before  the  Closing  Date or  Straddle  Periods  without
Seller's consent; provided, however, that Purchaser may file amended Tax Returns
for such  Taxable  Periods  without  Seller's  consent if (i) such  amended  Tax
Returns are filed to correct errors or omissions in previously filed Tax Returns
that  either  constitute  or are  related to a breach of any  representation  or
warranty set forth in Sections  5.2 or 5.3r  (determined  without  regard to the
limitation on the survival of such  representations  and warranties set forth in
Section  7.1),  or (ii) the filing of such amended Tax Return would not increase
the Taxes of Seller or Taxes for which Seller has indemnification responsibility
hereunder or under the MMP Acquisition Documents by more than $25,000.

                  (c)  All Tax  Returns  prepared  and  filed  pursuant  to this
Section 8.2 shall be prepared and filed in accordance with applicable law and in
a  manner  consistent  with  past  practices  of MMP II and the MMP II  Licensee
Entities (to the extent consistent with applicable law).

         8.3.  APPORTIONMENT.  The parties  agree to cause MMP II and the MMP II
Licensee  Entities to file all Tax  Returns  for any  Taxable  Period that would
otherwise  be a Straddle  Period on the basis that the relevant  Taxable  Period
consists of two  periods,  one ending as of the close of business on the Closing
Date and one beginning  the day after the Closing Date,  unless the relevant Tax
Authority  will not accept a Tax Return  filed on that  basis.  For  purposes of
apportioning  any Tax to the  portion of any  Straddle  Period  that ends on the
Closing Date, the determination  shall be made assuming that there was a closing
of the  books  as of the  close of  business  on the  Closing  Date and that the
taxable  years of MMP II and the MMP II  Licensee  Entities  ended on that date,
except that real,  personal and  intangible  property Taxes shall be apportioned
ratably  on a daily  basis  between  the  portions  of the  Straddle  Period  in
question.

         8.4.  COOPERATION  IN TAX  MATTERS.  Seller  and  Purchaser  shall  (a)
cooperate


                                       14
<PAGE>

fully, as reasonably requested, in connection with the preparation and filing of
all Tax Returns  prepared and filed  pursuant to Section 8.2; (b) make available
to the other, as reasonably  requested,  all  information,  records or documents
with respect to Tax matters pertinent to MMP II and the MMP II Licensee Entities
for all  Taxable  Periods  ending on or before  the  Closing  Date and  Straddle
Periods;  and (c) preserve  information,  records or  documents  relating to Tax
matters  pertinent to MMP II and the MMP II Licensee  Entities  that is in their
possession or under their control until the expiration of any applicable statute
of limitations.

         8.5. CERTAIN TAXES. Seller shall timely pay all transfer,  documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees arising from or
relating to the sale and  transfer of the  Assets,  and Seller  shall at its own
expense file all necessary Tax Returns and other  documentation  with respect to
all such  transfer,  documentary,  sales,  use,  stamp,  registration  and other
similar Taxes and fees. If required by applicable  law,  Purchaser  will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

         8.6.  FIRPTA.  Seller  shall  deliver  to  Purchaser  at the  Closing a
certificate or  certificates  in form and substance  satisfactory  to Purchaser,
duly executed and  acknowledged,  certifying  all facts  necessary to exempt the
transactions  contemplated  hereunder from withholding under Section 1445 of the
Code.

         8.7. SECTION 754 ELECTION.  Purchaser may at any time after the Closing
Date, in its sole and absolute discretion, cause the MMP II Licensee Entities to
make a Code Section 754 Election with respect to the Taxable Period in which the
Closing occurs or later Taxable Periods.

         8.8. CLOSING DATE ACTIONS.  Following the Closing,  Purchaser shall not
cause MMP II or the MMP II Licensee  Entities to take any actions on the Closing
Date  other  than in the  ordinary  course of their  business,  except  (i) such
actions as are expressly  contemplated by this Agreement,  and (ii) such actions
as  would  not  increase   Taxes  of  Seller  or  Taxes  for  which  Seller  has
indemification responsibility hereunder.

Date,  Seller shall  indemnify and hold Purchaser  harmless from and against any

                     (i) any breach of any  representation or warranty of Seller
set forth in  Sections  5.2 or 5.3 of this  Agreement;  provided,  however,  for
purposes of this Section  10.1(a)(i),  the  representation  set forth in Section
5.2c of the MTC Agreement (as  incorporated by reference  herein) will be deemed
not to include the requirement of a Material Adverse Effect;

                     (ii) the material failure by Seller to perform any covenant
of Seller contained herein;

                     (iii) breaches by Seller,  MMP II or the  MMP  II  Licensee
Entities of other agreements and certificates specifically contemplated hereby;

                     (iv) any and all  Taxes  of  Seller,  MMP II and the MMP II
Licensee  Entities  (including  any  liability  of Seller,  MMP II or the MMP II
Licensee  Entities for Taxes of any other entity or person) for any  Pre-Closing
Tax Period;

                     (v) RESERVED;

                     (vi) RESERVED;

                (b) the material failure by Purchaser to perform any covenant of
Purchaser contained herein; or


                                       21
<PAGE>


                (c) any and all Taxes of MMP II and the MMP II Licensee Entities
(including any liability of MMP or the MMP II Licensee Entities for Taxes of any
other  persons) for any  Post-Closing  Tax Period except to the extent that such
Taxes  arise  out  of,  result  from  or are  attributable  to a  breach  of any
representation, warranty or covenant of Sellers set forth in this Agreement.

         10.3.  LIMITATIONS  AND  OTHER  PROVISIONS  REGARDING   INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS.

         Seller's  obligation  to indemnify  Purchaser  pursuant to Section 10.1
shall be subject to all of the following limitations:

                (a)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in this  Agreement or
applicable law to the contrary,  Purchaser  agrees that the payment of any claim
(whether such claim is framed in tort, contract, or otherwise) made by Purchaser
for  indemnification  hereunder  subsequent  to the Closing  Date,  for whatever
reason,  shall be limited to, and shall only be made from,  the  Indemnification
Amount in accordance with the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement and, except for
claims against the Indemnification  Amount,  Purchaser waives and releases,  and
shall  have no  recourse  against,  Seller  as a  result  of the  breach  of any
representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement of Seller contained herein, or
otherwise  arising out of or in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated
hereby,  or the  operation  or the  business  of MMP II or the  MMP II  Licensee
Entities prior to the Closing,  and such  indemnification  shall be the sole and
exclusive   remedy   for   Purchaser   with   respect  to  any  such  claim  for
indemnification  after the Closing Date; provided,  however, that nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit any  rights or  remedies  that  Purchaser  may have for
Sellers' fraud. The Indemnification Escrow shall be disbursed in accordance with
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

                (b)  Anything in this  Agreement  or any  applicable  law to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  it is understood and agreed by Purchaser that, other
than with respect to Seller (but not including any partner,  director,  officer,
employee,  agent or  Affiliate  Seller  (including  any  shareholder,  director,
officer,  employee, agent or Affiliate of the Seller)) as expressly provided for
in Section 10.1, no partner, director,  officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of
Seller  (including  any  shareholder,  director,  officer,  employee,  agent  or
Affiliate  of Seller)  shall have (i) any  personal  liability to Purchaser as a
result of the breach of any representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement of
Seller  contained  herein or otherwise  arising out of or in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby, or the operations or the business
of MMP II or the MMP II  Licensee  Entities  prior to the  Closing,  or (ii) any
personal  obligation  to  indemnify  Purchaser  for  any of  Purchaser's  claims
pursuant to Section  10.1 and  Purchaser  waives and  releases and shall

                                       22
<PAGE>


have no recourse  against any of such parties  described in this Section 10.3(b)
as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of Seller contained herein or otherwise arising out of or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the operations or the business of
MMP II or the MMP II Licensee Entities prior to the Closing; provided,  however,
that  nothing  herein  shall be  deemed to limit any  rights  or  remedies  that
Purchaser may have for Seller's fraud.

                (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,   Seller   shall  not  be  liable  to  Purchaser  in  respect  of  any
indemnification  hereunder  until the  aggregate  amount of Losses of  Purchaser
under this Agreement and the MMP Acquisition Documents exceeds Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000.00)  (the  "Basket  Amount"),  and then only to the
extent of the  excess of Losses  over the  amount  of One  Hundred  Twenty  Five
Thousand Dollars ($125,000.00); provided, that this paragraph shall not apply to
indemnification  pursuant to Section 10.1(a)(iv) and indemnification pursuant to
Section 10.1(a)(i) for breaches of the  representations and warranties set forth
in Section  5.3r of this  Agreement  and Section  5.2m of the MTC  Agreement  as
incorporated by reference herein.

                (d) In determining the amount of any Tax or other Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement,  such Loss shall be (i) net of
any insurance  recovery made by the indemnified party, (ii) reduced to take into
account any net Tax benefit  realized by the indemnified  party arising from the
deductibility  of such Tax or Loss,  and (iii)  increased to take account of any
net Tax cost  incurred  by the  indemnified  party  arising  from the receipt of
indemnification  payments hereunder. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall
initially  be made  without  regard to this  paragraph  and shall be  reduced to
reflect any net Tax benefit or  increased to reflect any net Tax cost only after
the indemnified  party has actually  realized such benefit or cost. For purposes
of this  Agreement,  an  indemnified  party  shall be deemed  to have  "actually
realized" a net Tax benefit or net Tax cost to the extent that, and at such time
as, the amount of Taxes payable by such  indemnified  party is (x) reduced below
the amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay
but for the  deductibility  of such Tax or Losses,  and (y) increased  above the
amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay but
for the receipt of such  indemnification  payments.  The amount of any reduction
hereunder  shall be  adjusted to reflect any final  determination  (which  shall
include the  execution  of Form 870-AD or  successor  form) with  respect to the
indemnified  party's  liability  for Taxes.  Any indemnity  payments  under this
Agreement  shall be  treated  as an  adjustment  to the  Purchase  Price for Tax
purposes,  unless a final determination with respect to the indemnified party or
any of its affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.


                                       23
<PAGE>

                (e) No claim for  indemnification for Losses shall be made after
expiration  of the  applicable  period  set  forth  in  Section  7.1 of the  MTC
Agreement  as  incorporated  by  reference  herein;  provided  that  if  Closing
hereunder takes place after expiration of all applicable  periods  referenced in
Section 7.1 of the MTC Agreement as incorporated by reference  herein,  no party
hereunder shall have any right of indemnification.

                (f)   Anything   to  the   contrary   in   this   Section   10.3
notwithstanding, the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Section
10.3 do not apply to or limit Purchaser's rights under Section 14.2.

         10.4. NOTICE OF CLAIM; DEFENSE OF ACTION.

                (a) An indemnified  party shall  promptly give the  indemnifying
party notice of any matter which an  indemnified  party has determined has given
or could give rise to a right of indemnification  under this Agreement,  stating
the nature and, if known,  the amount of the Losses,  and method of  computation
thereof,  all with  reasonable  particularity  and containing a reference to the
provisions of this  Agreement in respect of which such right to  indemnification
is claimed  or arises;  provided  that the  failure of any party to give  notice
promptly  as required in this  Section  10.4 shall not relieve any  indemnifying
party of its indemnification  obligations except to the extent that such failure
materially  prejudices the rights of such  indemnifying  party.  The indemnified
party shall give continuing notice to the indemnifying party promptly thereafter
of all developments coming to such indemnified  part(ies)'  attention materially
affecting any matter relating to any indemnification claims.

                (b)  Except  as  otherwise   provided  in  Section   10.5,   the
obligations and liabilities of an indemnifying  party under this Section 10 with
respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that are subject to the
indemnification  provided  for in this  Section  10,  shall be  governed  by and
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

                     (i) With  respect to third  party  claims,  promptly  after
receipt by an indemnified  party of notice of the  commencement of any action or
the  presentation  or other  assertion  of any claim which  could  result in any
indemnification  claim pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2 hereof, such indemnified
party shall give prompt  notice  thereof to the  indemnifying  part(ies) and the
indemnifying  part(ies)  shall be  entitled  to  participate  therein or, to the
extent that it desires, assume the defense thereof with its own counsel.

                     (ii) If the  indemnifying  part(ies) elects  to  assume the
defense of any such action or claim,  the  indemnifying  part(ies)  shall not be
liable  to the  indemnified

                                       24
<PAGE>

party for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof.

                     (iii) The  indemnifying  part(ies)  shall  be   authorized,
without consent of the indemnified party being required, to settle or compromise
any such action or claim,  provided that such settlement or compromise  includes
an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out
of such action or claim.

                     (iv) Whether or not an  indemnifying  part(ies)  elects  to
assume the defense of any action or claim, the indemnifying  part(ies) shall not
be liable for any  compromise or settlement of any such action or claim effected
without its consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                     (v) The parties  agree to cooperate to the  fullest  extent
possible in  connection  with any claim for which  indemnification  is or may be
sought under this Agreement, including, without limitation, making available all
witnesses,  pertinent  records,  materials and  information in its possession or
under its  control  relating  thereto as is  reasonably  requested  by the other
party.

         10.5     TAX CONTESTS.

                  (a) If any  party  receives  written  notice  from any  Taxing
Authority  of any Tax  Proceeding  with  respect  to any Tax for which the other
party is obligated to provide  indemnification under this Agreement,  such party
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party; provided,  however,
that the  failure  to give such  notice  shall not  affect  the  indemnification
provided  hereunder  except to the extent  that the  failure to give such notice
materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

                  (b)  Seller  shall  have the  right,  at its own  expense,  to
control  and make all  decisions  with  respect to any Tax  Proceeding  relating
solely to Taxes of MMP II and the MMP II Licensee  Entities for Taxable  Periods
ending on or before the Closing Date;  provided,  that  Purchaser and counsel of
its  own  choosing  shall  have  the  right,  at  Purchaser's  own  expense,  to
participate  fully in all  aspects  of the  prosecution  or  defense of such Tax
Proceeding;  and  provided  further  that  Seller  shall not settle any such Tax
Proceeding  without the prior written  consent of Purchaser if such  settlements
could increase the past,  present or future Tax liability of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates,  or any Tax Liability of MMP II or the MMP II Licensee  Entities
for any Post-Closing Tax Period by an amount greater than $25,000.

                  (c)  Seller  shall  have the  right,  at its own  expense,  to
jointly control and participate  with Purchaser in all Tax Proceedings  relating
to Taxes of MMP II and the


                                       25
<PAGE>

MMP II Licensee  Entities for a Straddle Period. If Seller exercises such right,
neither  party shall settle any such Tax  Proceeding  without the prior  written
consent of the other.

                  (d) If Seller does not exercise its right to assume control of
or  participate  in any Tax  Proceeding  as provided  under this  Section  10.5,
Purchaser may, without waiving any rights to indemnification  hereunder,  defend
or settle  the same in such  manner as it may deem  appropriate  in its sole and
absolute discretion.

                  (e)      RESERVED.

                  (f) In the event that the  provisions of this Section 10.5 and
the provisions of Section 10.4(b) conflict or otherwise each apply by the terms,
this Section 10.5 shall exclusively govern all matters concerning Taxes.

                                 SELLERS' AGENTS
                                 ---------------

         16.1.  SELLERS'  AGENTS.  Seller hereby  irrevocably  appoints Allen B.
Rider,  III,  Anthony R.  Ignaczak,  and  Stephen W.  Burke  (herein  called the
"Sellers'  Agents") as his,  her or its agent and  attorney-in-fact  to take any
action  required  or  permitted  to be taken by  Seller  under the terms of this
Agreement,  including,  without limiting,  the generality of the foregoing,  the
payment of expenses relating to the transactions  contemplated by the Agreement,
and the right to waive,  modify or amend any of the terms of this  Agreement  in
any  respect,  whether  or not  material,  and agrees to be bound by any and all
actions  taken by the  Sellers'  Agents on his or its  behalf.  Any action to be
taken by the  Sellers'  Agents  shall


                                       34

<PAGE>

be unanimous.  In the event of the death,  incapacity or  liquidation  of any of
Sellers' Agents, such person or entity shall not be replaced,  and the remaining
Sellers' Agents shall continue in that capacity.  Seller agrees to indemnify the
Sellers'  Agents  from and  against  and in respect of any and all  liabilities,
damages,  claims, costs, and expenses,  including, but not limited to attorneys'
fees, arising out of or due to any action by them as the Sellers' Agents and any
and all actions,  proceedings,  demands,  assessments,  or judgments, costs, and
expenses incidental thereto,  except to the extent that the same result from bad
faith or gross negligence on the part of the Sellers' Agents. Purchaser shall be
entitled  to rely  exclusively  upon any  communications  given by the  Sellers'
Agents on behalf of Seller,  and shall not be liable for any action taken or not
taken in  reliance  upon the  Sellers'  Agents.  Purchaser  shall be entitled to
disregard any notices or communications  given or made by Seller unless given or
made through the Sellers' Agents.


                                   SECTION 17

                                  MISCELLANEOUS
                                  -------------

         17.1.  HEADINGS.  The headings contained in this Agreement  (including,
but not limited to, the titles of the Schedules  and Exhibits  hereto) have been
inserted for the  convenience  of reference  only, and neither such headings nor
the placement of any term hereof under any  particular  heading shall in any way
restrict  or modify  any of the terms or  provisions  hereof.  Terms used in the
singular  shall be read in the  plural,  and vice  versa,  and terms used in the
masculine gender shall be read in the feminine or neuter gender when the context
so requires.

         17.2.  SCHEDULES  AND  EXHIBITS.  All Annexes,  Schedules  and Exhibits
attached to or referenced in this Agreement or incorporated by reference in this
Agreement  constitute an integral part of this  Agreement as if fully  rewritten
herein.

         17.3. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one
or more  counterparts,  each of which  shall be deemed an  original,  but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same document.

         17.4. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, the MMP Acquisition Documents,
and the FCC Licensee Transfer Agreement, the Annexes, Schedules and Exhibits and
the documents to be delivered  hereunder and  thereunder  constitute  the entire
understanding  and agreement  between the parties hereto  concerning the subject
matter  hereof.  All  negotiations  and writings  between the parties hereto are
merged into this  Agreement,  the MMP  Acquisition  Documents,  the FCC Licensee
Transfer  Agreement,  and there are no representations,  warranties,  covenants,
understandings,  or agreements,  oral or otherwise,


                                       35

<PAGE>

in relation thereto between the parties other than those incorporated  herein or
to be delivered hereunder.

         17.5. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is to be delivered in and should be
construed in  accordance  with and governed by the laws of the  Commonwealth  of
Virginia without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.

         17.6. MODIFICATION. This Agreement cannot be modified or amended except
in writing signed by each of the Seller, MMP, Purchaser and MMP II.

         17.7.  SUCCESSORS  AND ASSIGNS.  Neither this  Agreement nor any of the
rights  and   obligations   hereunder  shall  be  assigned,   delegated,   sold,
transferred,  sublicensed,  or  otherwise  disposed  of by  operation  of law or
otherwise  by  Seller,  MMP or MMP II,  without  the prior  written  consent  of
Purchaser.  Purchaser  may assign its rights and  obligations  hereunder  to any
Person  without the prior  written  consent of any other party hereto so long as
Purchaser is not relieved of its obligations hereunder. Purchaser shall promptly
notify Seller of any  assignment.  In the event of such permitted  assignment or
other transfer, all of the rights, obligations, liabilities, and other terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be  enforceable  by and against,  the  respective  successors and assigns of the
parties hereto, whether so expressed or not.

         17.8.  WAIVER.  Any waiver of any  provision  hereof (or in any related
document or  instrument)  shall not be effective  unless made expressly and in a
writing  executed in the name of the party sought to be charged.  The failure of
any party to insist, in any one or more instances,  on performance of any of the
terms or  conditions  of this  Agreement  shall not be  construed as a waiver or
relinquishment of any rights granted  hereunder or of the future  performance of
any such term, covenant,  or condition,  but the obligations of the parties with
respect hereto shall continue in full force and effect.

         17.9.  SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Agreement  shall be deemed
severable,  and if any  part  of any  provision  is held  to be  illegal,  void,
voidable,  invalid,  nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or
as to any party, for any reason, such provision may be changed,  consistent with
the intent of the parties hereto, to the extent reasonably necessary to make the
provision,  as so  changed,  legal,  valid,  binding,  and  enforceable.  If any
provision of this  Agreement  is held to be illegal,  void,  voidable,  invalid,
nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or as to any party, for
any reason,  and if such provision cannot be changed  consistent with the intent
of the parties hereto to make it fully legal,  valid,  binding and  enforceable,
then such provisions  shall be stricken from this  Agreement,  and the remaining
provisions of this Agreement  shall not in any way be affected or impaired,  but
shall remain in full force and effect.

         17.10.  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  From the date of this  Agreement,  all  further
public announcements relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby will be made only as agreed upon  jointly by the parties  hereto,  except
that nothing herein shall prevent  Seller or any Affiliate  thereof or Purchaser
from making any disclosure in connection with the  transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement if required by applicable law or otherwise as a result of its, or
its  Affiliate's,  being a public  company,  provided  that prior notice of such
disclosure is given to the other party hereto.

         17.11. SPECIFIC  PERFORMANCE.  Sellers acknowledges that Purchaser will
have no  adequate  remedy at law if Seller  fails to perform its  obligation  to
consummate the sale of Stock contemplated  under this Agreement.  In such event,
Purchaser  shall have the right,  in addition to any other rights or remedies it
may have, to specific performance of this Agreement.

         17.12  FEES  AND  EXPENSES.   Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this
Agreement,  each party shall pay their own expenses  incurred in connection with
the authorization, preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement and
the  exhibits,  Schedules,  and  other  documentation,  including  all  fees and
expenses of counsel,  accountants,  and each party shall be responsible  for all
fees and commissions  payable to any finder,  broker,  adviser, or other similar
Person  retained  by or on behalf of such  party;  provided,  however,  that all
transfer  taxes,   recordation  taxes,  sales  taxes,  and  document  stamps  in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
one-half  (1/2) by Purchaser  and one-half  (1/2) by Seller and all other filing
fees (including all FCC and H-S-R Act filing fees),  and other charges levied by
any governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  shall be paid  one-half  (1/2) by  Purchaser  and  one-half  (1/2) by
Seller. Purchaser hereby waives compliance with the provisions of any applicable
bulk transfer law.

         17.13 THIRD PARTY  BENEFICIARIES.  Nothing  expressed or referred to in
this  Agreement  shall be construed to give any Person other than the parties to
this  Agreement  any legal or equitable  right,  remedy,  or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and
all of its provisions  and conditions are for the sole and exclusive  benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

         17.14 INTERPRETATION. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
preparation  and  drafting of this  Agreement  and the  Exhibits  hereto are the
result of the efforts of all parties to this Agreement and every covenant, term,
and provision of this Agreement shall be construed according to its fair meaning
and shall not be construed  against any particular  party as the drafter of such
covenant, term, and/or provision. The


                                       37

<PAGE>

parties agree that this Agreement is to be construed in a manner consistent with
the terms of the MMP Acquisition Documents; provided, however, that in the event
the terms and  conditions of this Agreement  vary or are  inconsistent  with the
terms and conditions of the Time Brokerage  Agreement as executed by the parties
thereto and in effect, the terms and conditions of the Time Brokerage  Agreement
shall prevail over the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

     2.4. PURCHASE PRICE.

         For and in  consideration  of the  conveyances  and  assignments of the

accept from Buyer, an amount equal to SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS  ($72,000,000)
(the "Base  Purchase  Price"),  plus or minus (as the case may be) the Proration
Amount (collectively, the "Purchase Price").


     2.5. PAYMENT OF PURCHASE PRICE.

         2.5.1.  At the  Non-License  Transfer  pursuant to Section 11.2,  Buyer
shall pay to Sellers  by wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  funds to an

immediately  available  federal  funds to an account which will be identified by
Sellers not less than two (2) days prior to the Closing Date.


     2.6. PRORATION AMOUNT.

         2.6.1. At least five (5) days prior to the Transfer Date, Sellers shall
make a good  faith  estimate  of the  adjustments  to the  Base  Purchase  Price
customary in television  broadcast station transactions for Proration Items (the
"Proration Amount") to reflect that all Proration Items of the Stations shall be
apportioned  between  Buyer and Sellers in accordance  with the  principle  that
Sellers shall receive the benefit of all revenues, refunds, deposits (other than
deposits for Program  Contracts  which shall be prorated based on the percentage
of the term  that the film or  program  was  aired on the  Stations  before  the
Transfer Date and the percentage available to be aired on and after the Transfer
Date) and prepaid expenses, and shall be responsible for all expenses, costs and
liabilities  allocable to the conduct of the  businesses  or  operations  of the
Stations for the period prior to the Transfer  Date, and Buyer shall receive the
benefit of all revenues,  refunds,  deposits and prepaid expenses,  and shall be
responsible for all expenses,  costs and liabilities allocable to the conduct of
the  businesses or operations of the Stations from and after the Transfer  Date;
provided,  however,  that there  shall be no  adjustment  or  proration  for any
negative or positive  net trade  balance  except to the extent that the negative
trade  balance  (i.e.,  the amount by which the value of goods or services to be
received is less than the value of any advertising time remaining to be run) for
any Station  exceeds Fifty Thousand  Dollars  ($50,000) as of the Transfer Date;
provided,  further,  that  if  there  shall  be  a  Non-License  Transfer,  then
prorations  and  adjustments  for Proration  Items related to the License Assets
shall  be  made   pursuant  to  this  Section  2.6  as  of  the  Closing   Date.
Determinations  pursuant to this Section 2.6.1 shall be made in accordance  with
generally accepted  accounting  principles  consistently  applied for the period
prior to the Non-License Transfer Date or the Closing Date, as applicable.

         2.6.2  Within  ninety (90) days after the  Transfer  Date,  Buyer shall
deliver  to  Sellers  in writing  and in  reasonable  detail a good faith  final
determination of the Proration  Amount  determined as of the Transfer Date under
Section 2.6.1 ("Final Proration  Amount").  Sellers shall assist Buyer in making
such  determination,  and Buyer shall provide Sellers with reasonable  access to
the  properties,  books and records  relating to the Stations for the purpose of
determining the Final Proration  Amount.  Sellers shall have the right to review
the computations  and workpapers used in connection with Buyer's  preparation of
the Final  Proration  Amount.  If Sellers  disagree with the amount of the Final
Proration Amount  determined by Buyer,  Sellers shall so notify Buyer in writing
within  thirty  (30) days after the date of receipt of Buyer's  Final  Proration
Amount, specifying in detail any point of disagreement;  provided, however, that
if Sellers fail to notify

                                       -9-

<PAGE>



Buyer in writing of  Sellers'  disagreement  within such thirty (30) day period,
Buyer's  determination of the Final Proration Amount shall be final,  conclusive
and  binding  on  Sellers  and  Buyer.  After  the  receipt  of  any  notice  of
disagreement,  Buyer and Sellers  shall  negotiate  in good faith to resolve any
disagreements  regarding the Final Proration  Amount.  If any such  disagreement
cannot be resolved by Sellers and Buyer within  thirty (30) days after Buyer has
received  notice from Sellers of the existence of such  disagreement,  Buyer and
Sellers  shall  jointly  select  a  nationally  recognized   independent  public
accounting firm (the "Accounting Firm"), to review Buyer's  determination of the
Final  Proration  Amount  and to  resolve  as soon as  possible  all  points  of
disagreement  raised by Sellers.  All determinations made by the Accounting Firm
with  respect  to the Final  Proration  Amount  shall be final,  conclusive  and
binding on Buyer and  Sellers.  The fees and  expenses  of the  Accounting  Firm
incurred in connection with any such  determination  shall be shared one-half by
Buyer and one-half by Sellers.

                   If the Final Proration Amount is such that Buyer's payment of
the Proration  Amount was an underpayment to Sellers,  then Buyer shall pay such
underpayment  amount to Sellers in cash,  within two (2) business days following
the final  determination of the Final Proration  Amount.  If the Final Proration
Amount is such that Buyer's  payment of the Proration  Amount was an overpayment
to Sellers,  then  Sellers  shall pay such  overpayment  amount to Buyer in cash
within two (2) business  days  following  the final  determination  of the Final
Proration  Amount.  Any amounts paid  pursuant to this Section 2.6.2 shall be by
wire transfer of  immediately  available  funds for credit to the recipient at a
bank account identified by such recipient in writing.

                   Buyer and  Sellers  agree that prior to the date of the final
determination  of the Final Proration A mount pursuant to this Section 2.6.2 (by
the  Accounting  Firm or  otherwise),  neither  party will  destroy  any records
pertaining to, or necessary for, the final  determination of the Final Proration
Amount.

                   Each Seller hereby appoints Sinclair as its  attorney-in-fact
with power and  authority to act for and on behalf of each Seller in  connection
with all matters arising under this Section 2.6. Buyer shall be entitled to rely
on such appointment and treat Sinclair as the duly appointed attorney-in-fact of
each Seller.


     2.7. ALLOCATION OF BASE PURCHASE PRICE.

         Each party hereto represents,  warrants, covenants and agrees with each
other party hereto that the Base  Purchase  Price shall be  allocated  among the
classes of Assets for each  Station as agreed by the parties  within  sixty (60)
days after the date hereof; provided, however, that if the parties are unable to
agree on such  allocation  within such sixty (60) day  period,  each party shall
have the right to


                                      -10-

determination. The parties agree, pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code, that the
Base Purchase Price shall be allocated in accordance  with this Section 2.7, and
that all Tax returns and reports shall be filed consistent with such allocation.
The  parties  acknowledge  and agree that the payment of the  Purchase  Price as
contemplated  herein does not reflect the allocation among the classes of Assets
for each Station as determined pursuant to this Section 2.7. Notwithstanding any
other  provision of this  Agreement,  the  provisions  of this Section 2.7 shall

downward   adjustment  to  the  Base  Purchase  Price  in  connection  with  the

Subsidiary is (and no Seller will be as of the Transfer  Date)  obligated to pay
any royalty or other fees to anyone with respect to the  Intellectual  Property.
Neither  Seller nor any Heritage  Subsidiary  has received any written notice to
the effect that any service  rendered by any Seller or any  Heritage  Subsidiary
relating to the business of the Stations may infringe, or that any Seller or any
Heritage Subsidiary is otherwise infringing,  on any Intellectual Property right
or other legally protectable right of another. No director,  officer or employee
of any Seller or any Heritage  Subsidiary  has any interest in any  Intellectual
Property.

to termination, nor will a default occur, as a result of the consummation of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby,  except to the extent that failure to obtain
the prior consent to  assignment  thereof of any party thereto shall or could be
interpreted  to constitute a termination or  modification  of or a default under
any such Station Contract;  and (d) to the knowledge of Sellers and the Heritage
Subsidiaries,  no other  party to any such  Station  Contract  is in  breach  or
default in any material respect of the terms thereunder.


     3.13. TAXES.

         The Heritage Subsidiaries have (or, in the case of returns becoming due
after  the  date  hereof  and on or  before  the  Transfer  Date,  the  Heritage
Subsidiaries  or Sellers  will have prior to the  Transfer  Date) duly filed all
material  Seller  Tax  Returns  required  to be filed by them on or  before  the
Transfer Date with respect to all material  applicable Taxes. In the case of any
Seller Tax Returns  which  receive an extension  for their date of filing,  such
Seller Tax Returns will be considered due on, and not considered  required to be
filed before, the extended due


                                      -17-

date. To the knowledge of Sellers and the Heritage Subsidiaries,  all Seller Tax
Returns are (or, in the case of returns  becoming  due after the date hereof and
on or before the  Transfer  Date,  will be) true and  complete  in all  material
respects.  The Heritage  Subsidiaries or Sellers have: (a) paid all Taxes due to
any  Governmental  Authority  as  indicated  on the Seller Tax  Returns;  or (b)
established  (or,  in the case of amounts  becoming  due after the date  hereof,
prior  to the  Transfer  Date  will  have  established)  adequate  reserves  (in
conformity with generally accepted accounting  principles  consistently applied)
for the payment of such Taxes.

     3.14. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

         3.14.1.   Schedule  3.14  lists  all  Plans  and  Benefit  Arrangements
(exclusive of severance  arrangements and retention agreements) maintained by or
contributed  to for the benefit of the employees of the Stations  (collectively,
the  "Benefit  Plans").  Each  Benefit  Plan has  been  maintained  in  material
compliance with its terms and with ERISA, the Code and other applicable Laws.

         3.14.2.  Schedule  3.14  sets  forth  a  list  of all  Qualified  Plans
maintained  by or  contributed  to  for  the  benefit  of the  employees  of the
Stations.  All such Qualified Plans and any related trust  agreements or annuity
agreements  (or any other  funding  document)  have been  maintained in material
compliance  with  ERISA  and  the  Code  (including,   without  limitation,  the
requirements for tax qualification described in Section 401 thereof), other than
any   Multiemployer   Plan.  To  the  knowledge  of  Sellers  and  the  Heritage
Subsidiaries,  any trusts  established  under such Plans are exempt from federal
income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code.

         3.14.3.  Schedule  3.14 lists all  funded  Welfare  Plans that  provide
benefits to current or former employees of the Stations or their  beneficiaries.
To the  knowledge of Sellers,  the funding under each such Welfare Plan does not
exceed and has not exceeded the limitations  under Sections  419A(b) and 419A(c)
of the Code.  To the  knowledge  of Sellers and the  Heritage  Subsidiaries,  no
Seller  Party is subject to  taxation on the income of any such  Welfare  Plan's
welfare  benefit  fund (as such term is defined  in Section  419(e) of the Code)
under Section 419A(g) of the Code.

         3.14.4. There are no post-retirement  medical,  life insurance or other
benefits  promised,  provided or otherwise  due now or in the future to current,
former or retired employees of the Stations.

         3.14.5.  To the  knowledge  of Sellers and the  Heritage  Subsidiaries,
except as set forth in  Schedule  3.14,  the  Seller  Parties  have (a) filed or
caused to be filed all returns  and reports on the Plans that they are  required
to file and (b) paid

                                      -18-

<PAGE>



or made adequate  provision for all fees,  interest,  penalties,  assessments or
deficiencies  that have  become  due  pursuant  to those  returns  or reports or
pursuant to any  assessment or  adjustment  that has been made relating to those
returns or reports. All other fees, interest, penalties and assessments that are
payable by or for the Seller Parties have been timely  reported,  fully paid and
discharged.  There are no unpaid fees,  penalties,  interest or assessments  due
from any  Seller  Party or from any  other  person  that are or could  become an
Encumbrance  on any of the  Assets  or  could  otherwise  adversely  affect  the
businesses  of the Stations or the Assets.  To the  knowledge of Sellers and the
Heritage Subsidiaries, the Seller Parties have collected or withheld all amounts
that are  required  to be  collected  or  withheld  by them to  discharge  their
obligations,  and  all of  those  amounts  have  been  paid  to the  appropriate
Governmental  Authority or set aside in appropriate  accounts for future payment
when due.  Sellers  have  furnished  to Buyer  true and  complete  copies of all
documents setting forth the terms and funding of each Plan.

         3.14.6.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.14, neither any Seller Party
nor any ERISA Affiliate has ever sponsored or maintained,  had any obligation to
sponsor or maintain,  or had any liability  (whether actual or contingent,  with
respect to any of its assets or  otherwise)  with respect to any Plan subject to
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA  (including
any Multiemployer Plan). Neither any Seller Party nor any ERISA Affiliate (since
January 1, 1989) has  terminated  or withdrawn  from or sought a funding  waiver
with respect to any plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA,  and no facts exist that
could reasonably be expected to cause such actions in the future; no accumulated
funding  deficiency  (as defined in Code  Section  412),  whether or not waived,
exists with respect to any such plan; no  reportable  event (as defined in ERISA
Section  4043) has occurred with respect to any such plan (other than events for
which  reporting is waived);  all costs of any such plans have been provided for
on  the  basis  of  consistent   methods  in  accordance  with  sound  actuarial
assumptions  and  practices,  and the assets of each such  plan,  as of its last
valuation date, exceeded its "Benefit  Liabilities" (as defined in ERISA Section
4001(a)(16));  and,  since the last  valuation  date for each such plan, no such
plan has been amended or changed to increase the amounts of benefits  thereunder
and, to the knowledge of Sellers and the Heritage  Subsidiaries,  there has been
no event that would  reduce the excess of assets over benefit  liabilities;  and
except as set forth in Schedule  3.14,  neither  any Seller  Party nor any ERISA
Affiliate  has ever  made or been  obligated  to  make,  or  reimbursed  or been
obligated to reimburse another employer for,  contributions to any Multiemployer
Plan.

         3.14.7.  No claims or  lawsuits  are pending  or, to the  knowledge  of
Sellers and the Heritage  Subsidiaries,  threatened by, against,  or relating to
any Benefit Plan. To the knowledge of Sellers and the Heritage Subsidiaries, the
Benefit Plans are not presently under audit or examination (nor has notice been

                                      -19-

<PAGE>



received of a potential  audit or  examination)  by the IRS, the  Department  of
Labor,  or any other  governmental  agency or entity and no matters  are pending
with  respect  to any  Qualified  Plan  under  the  IRS's  Voluntary  Compliance
Resolution program, its Closing Agreement Program, or other similar programs.

         3.14.8.  With respect to each Plan,  there has  occurred no  non-exempt
"prohibited  transaction"  (within the  meaning of Section  4975 of the Code) or
transaction  prohibited by Section 406 of ERISA or breach of any fiduciary  duty
described  in Section  404 of ERISA that  would,  if  successful,  result in any
liability for any of the Seller Parties.

         3.14.9. No Seller Party has any liability (whether actual,  contingent,
with  respect to any of its Assets or  otherwise)  with  respect to any employee
benefit plan that is not a Benefit Plan (exclusive of severance arrangements and
retention  agreements) or with respect to any employee benefit plan sponsored or
maintained  (or which has been or should have been  sponsored or  maintained) by
any ERISA Affiliate.

         3.14.10.  All group  health  plans of the Seller  Parties and the ERISA
Affiliates  covering any current or former  employees of the Stations  have been
operated in material compliance with the requirements of Sections 4980B (and its
predecessor) and 5000 of the Code, and the Seller Parties have provided, or will
have provided  before the Transfer  Date, to  individuals  entitled  thereto all
required  notices and  coverage  pursuant to Section  4980B with  respect to any
"qualifying  event" (as defined  therein)  occurring  before or on the  Transfer
Date.


     3.15. LABOR RELATIONS.

         Sellers have made  available  to Buyer a true and complete  list of all
employees of the Heritage  Subsidiaries  and Sellers  engaged in the business or
operations  of the Stations as of the date set forth on the list,  together with
such  employee's  position,  salary  and date of hire.  Schedule  3.15 lists all
written employment contracts with any such employees and all written agreements,
plans, arrangements, commitments and understandings pursuant to which any of the
Seller Parties have severance  obligations or retention obligations with respect
to such employees. No labor union or other collective bargaining unit represents
or,  to the  knowledge  of  Sellers  and the  Heritage  Subsidiaries,  claims to
represent,  any of the  employees of the  Stations.  There are no strikes,  work
stoppages,   grievance   proceedings,   union  organization  efforts,  or  other
controversies  pending  between any Seller or any  Heritage  Subsidiary  and any
union or  collective  bargaining  unit  representing  (or, to the  knowledge  of
Sellers and the Heritage  Subsidiaries,  claiming to represent) any employees of
the  Stations.  The  Heritage  Subsidiaries  are (and  Sellers will be as of the
Transfer Date) in compliance with all Laws

                                      -20-

<PAGE>



relating to the  employment of employees of the Stations or the workplace of the
Stations,  including,  without limitation,  provisions relating to wages, hours,
collective bargaining,  safety and health, work authorization,  equal employment
opportunity,  immigration  and the  withholding  of income  taxes,  unemployment
compensation,  worker's  compensation,  employee  privacy  and right to know and
social security contributions, except for any noncompliance which would not have
a  Material  Adverse  Effect.  There  are no  collective  bargaining  agreements
relating to the Stations or the business and operations thereof.


     3.16. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

         3.16.1.  Except as set forth in  Schedule  3.16,  to the  knowledge  of
Sellers and the Heritage Subsidiaries (which knowledge is based on the items set
forth on Schedule 3.16),  the Heritage  Subsidiaries are (and Sellers will be as
of the Transfer Date) in material compliance with, and the Real Property and all
improvements thereon are in material compliance with, all Environmental Laws.

         3.16.2.  Except as set forth in Schedule 3.16, there are no pending or,
to the knowledge of Sellers and the Heritage  Subsidiaries,  threatened actions,
suits,  claims,  or other legal proceedings based on (and neither any Seller nor
any  of the  Heritage  Subsidiaries  has  received  any  written  notice  of any
complaint,  order,  directive,  citation,  notice of  responsibility,  notice of
potential responsibility, or information request from any Governmental Authority
arising out of or attributable to): (a) the current or past presence at any part
of the Real Property of Hazardous Materials;  (b) the current or past release or
threatened  release  into the  environment  from the Real  Property  (including,
without limitation, into any storm drain, sewer, septic system or publicly owned
treatment  works) of any  Hazardous  Materials;  (c) the  off-site  disposal  of
Hazardous  Materials  originating  on or from the Real Property or the Assets or
businesses  of the  Stations;  (d) any facility  operations or procedures of the
Stations which do not conform to requirements of the Environmental  Laws; or (e)
any violation of  Environmental  Laws at any part of the Real  Property  arising
from activities of the Stations involving Hazardous Materials.  To the knowledge
of Sellers and the Heritage  Subsidiaries,  the Heritage  Subsidiaries have been
(and Sellers will have been prior to the Transfer Date) duly issued all material
permits,  licenses,  certificates and approvals required under any Environmental
Law.


     3.17. INSURANCE.

all policies of title,  property,  fire,  casualty,  liability,  life, workmen's
compensation,  libel and  slander,  and  other  forms of  insurance  of any kind

the Heritage Subsidiaries in all material respects. All of such reports, returns
and  statements are complete and correct in all material  respects as filed.  To
the knowledge of Sellers and the Heritage  Subsidiaries,  all documents required
by the FCC to be  deposited  by the owners of the Stations in their public files
(as  defined  in the rules and  regulations  of the FCC)  during  the  period of
operation  of the Stations by the  Heritage  Subsidiaries  and Sellers have been

be duly  qualified to do business as a foreign  corporation  in the State of New
York and the State of Vermont.  Buyer has the full corporate power and corporate
authority  to enter into and perform the terms of this  Agreement  and the other
Buyer  Documents  and to carry  out the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  and
thereby.


     4.2. AUTHORIZATION.

         The  execution,  delivery and  performance of this Agreement and of the

actions of Buyer (none of which  actions has been  modified or rescinded and all
of which actions are in full force and effect).  This  Agreement and the Deposit
Escrow  Agreement  constitute,  and upon  execution and delivery each such other
Buyer Document will constitute, a valid and binding agreement and

<PAGE>



obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its respective
terms,   except  as  the  same  may  be  limited  by   bankruptcy,   insolvency,
reorganization,  moratorium  and other  similar  laws of  general  applicability
relating to or affecting  creditors'  rights generally and by the application of
general principles of equity.


     4.3. CONSENTS AND APPROVALS; NO CONFLICTS.

         4.3.1.   The  execution  and  delivery  of  this  Agreement,   and  the
performance of the transactions  contemplated  herein by Buyer, will not require
any  consent,  approval,  authorization  or other  action by, or filing  with or

Closing will remain  legally,  financially  and  otherwise  qualified  under the
Communications Act and all rules, regulations and policies of the FCC to acquire
and  operate  the  Stations.  There  are no facts  or  proceedings  which  would
reasonably  be expected to  disqualify  Buyer  under the  Communications  Act or
otherwise from acquiring or operating any of the Stations or would cause the FCC
not to approve the assignment of the FCC Licenses to Buyer.  Except as disclosed
in Schedule 4.5.1,  Buyer has no knowledge of any fact or circumstance  relating
to

                                      -23-

<PAGE>



Buyer or any of Buyer's  Affiliates  that would  reasonably  be  expected to (a)
cause the filing of any  objection  to the  assignment  of the FCC  Licenses  to
Buyer,  or (b) lead to a delay in the processing by the FCC of the  applications
for such assignment.  Except for existing waivers pertaining to the Stations, no
waiver of any FCC rule or policy is  necessary  to be obtained  for the grant of
the  applications  for the  assignment  of the FCC  Licenses to Buyer,  nor will
processing  pursuant  to any  exception  or rule  of  general  applicability  be
requested or required in connection with the  consummation  of the  transactions
herein.

         4.5.2.  As of the date hereof and through the later to occur of the HSR

4.5.1,  neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer (a) owns,  controls or operates
any  television  or radio  station  located in the  Burlington  DMA; (b) has any
direct or indirect interest,  including,  without limitation,  any equity, debt,

any  television  or radio  station  located in the  Burlington  DMA, or (ii) any
applicant seeking to construct or acquire,  by assignment of license or transfer
of control,  any such television or radio station (an "Applicant");  or (c) is a
party to any TBA with a television  or radio station  located in the  Burlington
DMA,  or  with  any   Applicant.   Buyer   acknowledges   and  agrees  that  the
representations  set forth in this  Section  4.5.2  shall take into  account and
include (a) the  consummation of any proposed or pending  acquisition (as of the
date  hereof and  through the later to occur of the HSR Filing and the filing of
the FCC Applications) of television or radio stations (including the acquisition
of the  Stations) by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer or any  Applicant,  and (b)
any TBA or  proposed or pending TBA (as of the date hereof and through the later
to occur of the HSR  Filing  and the  filing of the FCC  Applications)  to which
Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer is or may become a party.


     4.6. WARN ACT.

         Buyer is not planning or contemplating,  and has not made or taken, any
decisions or actions concerning the employees of the Stations after the Transfer
Date that would  require the service of notice under the Worker  Adjustment  and
Retraining Act of 1988, as amended.


     4.7. NO OUTSIDE RELIANCE.

         Buyer  has  not   relied  and  is  not   relying   on  any   statement,
representation  or warranty not made in this  Agreement,  any Schedule hereto or
any  certificate  to be  delivered to Buyer at the  Non-License  Transfer or the
Closing  pursuant to this Agreement.  Buyer is not relying on any projections or
other  predictions  contained  or  referred  to in  materials  (other  than  the
Schedules) that

                                      -24-

<PAGE>



have been or may hereafter be provided to Buyer or any of its Affiliates, agents
or  representatives,  and Sellers make no  representations  or  warranties  with
respect to any such projections or other predictions.


     4.8. INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS.

         Buyer has not relied and is not  relying  on the  specification  of any
dollar amount in any  representation  or warranty made in this  Agreement or any
Schedule hereto to indicate that such amounts,  or higher or lower amounts,  are
or are not  material,  and  agrees not to assert in any  dispute or  controversy
between the parties hereto that  specification  of such amounts  indicates or is
evidence  as to  whether  or not any  obligation,  item or  matter  is or is not
material  for  purposes  of this  Agreement  and the  transactions  contemplated
hereby.


                                   ARTICLE 5.

         Neither  Buyer nor any  Seller  shall have any  obligation  to take any
steps pursuant to Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 which would be reasonably  expected
to

                                      -25-

result in the  incurrence of a material  cost or other  liability or which would
require the  divestiture  of any  business or assets of any party  hereto or any
Affiliate thereof.


                                   ARTICLE 6.

efforts to cause each Seller Party not to,  enter into (a) any Program  Contract
for any Station  which will be binding on Buyer after the  Non-License  Transfer
Date or the Closing Date, or (b) any other Station Contract  requiring  payments
by a Seller  Party  under  each  Station  Contract  in excess of Fifty  Thousand
Dollars  ($50,000).  For purposes of clause (a) above, each Seller  acknowledges
that it shall not be  unreasonable  for Buyer to withhold its consent to approve
of any  Program  Contract  where  Buyer,  acting in good  faith,  has  reason to
conclude that it can acquire such programming on better terms.

                   (b) From and after the Sellers'  acquisition  of the Stations
from the Heritage  Subsidiaries,  Sellers  shall not,  without the prior written
consent  of Buyer,  acquire  or enter into any new  Station  Contract  or renew,
extend,  amend, alter, modify or otherwise change any existing Station Contract,
which in any case  requires  payments by a Seller  Party under any such  Station
Contract in excess of Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000).

case on arm's length terms.


     6.2. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

         Pending and prior to the  Non-License  Transfer and the  Closing,  each
Seller will, and will use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to enforce such

the business and operations of the Stations in substantially  the same manner as

consistently with the Ordinary Course of Business, any Asset that may be damaged

         6.2.6. TAXES.

                   Pay or discharge all Taxes when due and payable.

         6.2.7. ACCESS.

                   Subject to the  cooperation  of the Trustee and the  Heritage
Subsidiaries, cause to be afforded to representatives of Buyer reasonable access
during normal business hours to offices, properties,  assets, books and records,
contracts  and  reports  of the  Stations,  as  Buyer  shall  from  time to time
reasonably request; provided, however, that (a) such investigation shall only be
upon  reasonable  notice and shall not  unreasonably  disrupt the  personnel  or
operations of any Seller Party or the Stations,  and (b) under no  circumstances
shall  any  Seller  Party  be  required  to  provide  access  to  Buyer  or  any
representative   of  Buyer  (i)  any   information   or  materials   subject  to
confidentiality  agreements with third parties required to be kept  confidential
by applicable  Laws, or (ii) any privileged  attorney-client  communications  or
attorney  work  product.  All requests  for access to the  offices,  properties,
assets,  books and records,  contracts and reports of the Stations shall be made
to such  representatives  as Sellers  shall  designate in writing,  who shall be
solely  responsible for  coordinating all such requests and all access permitted
hereunder.   Buyer   acknowledges   and  agrees  that  neither   Buyer  nor  its
representatives  shall  contact  any of  the  employees,  customers,  suppliers,
partners, or other associates or Affiliates of any Seller Party or the Stations,
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in person or by
telephone,  mail or other means of  communication,  without the  specific  prior
written  authorization  of such  representatives  of Sellers.  Subject to and in
accordance  with the terms of this Section 6.2.7,  each Seller shall,  and shall
use its  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to  enforce  such  rights  under the
Heritage  Agreement  to cause  each  other  Seller  Party to,  cooperate  in all
reasonable  respects  with Buyer's  request to conduct an audit of any financial
information  of the Stations as Buyer may  reasonably  determine is necessary to
satisfy any public company reporting requirements pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933 or the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 including,  without  limitation,
(a) using  commercially  reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of auditors to
permit  Buyer,  any  Affiliate  of Buyer and their  respective  auditors to have
access to such  auditors'  work  papers,  and (b)  consenting  to such access by
Buyer. Under no circumstance  shall the preparation of any financial  statements
pursuant  to such audit:  (a)  require any Seller  Party to change or modify any
accounting  policy,  (b) cause any  unreasonable  disruption  in the business or
operations  of any Station,  or (c) cause any delay that is more than de minimis
in any  internal  reporting  requirements  of any  Seller  Party.  All costs and
expenses  incurred in connection  with the  preparation of (and  assimilation of
relevant information for) any such financial statements shall be paid by Buyer.

         6.2.8. INSURANCE.

                   Maintain  in  full  force  and  effect  all of  its  existing
casualty,  liability,  and other  insurance  in  amounts  not less than those in
effect on the date hereof.

         6.2.9. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

                   Prior  to  Sellers'  acquisition  of the  Stations  from  the
Heritage  Subsidiaries,  provide Buyer with, to the extent received by Seller in
connection  with the Heritage  Agreement  (a)  unaudited  monthly  statements of
assets and liabilities  relating to the business and operations of the Stations,
and  monthly  statements  of revenues  and  expenses  reflecting  the results of
business  and  operations  of the  Stations  for January 1998 and for each month
thereafter,  within  thirty (30) days after the end of each such month,  and (b)
weekly  sales  pacing  reports  for the  Stations  and  copies of any  financial
statements.  After  Sellers'  acquisition  of the  Stations  from  the  Heritage
Subsidiaries  and prior to the Transfer  Date,  provide Buyer with (a) unaudited
monthly  statements  of assets and  liabilities  relating  to the  business  and
operations  of the  Stations,  and monthly  statements  of revenues and expenses
reflecting  the results of business and operations of the Stations for the month
following the month such  financial  statements  were last provided and for each
month thereafter,  within thirty (30) days after the end of each such month, and
(b) weekly  sales pacing  reports for the  Stations and copies of any  financial
statements.

         6.2.10. CONSENTS.

                   (a)  Take  all  reasonable  action  required  to  obtain  all
consents,  approvals and agreements of any third parties necessary to authorize,
approve or permit the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement,  including,  without  limitation,  any  consent of the parties to the
Station Contracts designated as necessary in Schedule 3.4 in order to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the "Restricted Contracts").
Notwithstanding  anything  to the  contrary  set  forth  in  this  Agreement  or
otherwise,  to the extent  that the  consent or  approval  of any third party is
required  under any Restricted  Contract,  such Seller shall only be required to
use reasonable efforts (not involving the payment by such Seller of any money to
any party to any such  Restricted  Contract,  except to the extent  required  by
Section 6.2.10(b)) to obtain such consents and approvals,  and in the event that
such Seller fails to obtain any such  consent or  approval,  Buyer shall have no
right to terminate this Agreement.

                   (b)  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary in clause (a)
above, each Seller shall, and shall use its commercially  reasonable  efforts to
enforce such rights under the Heritage Agreement to cause a Heritage  Subsidiary
to retain

                                      -31-

<PAGE>



until  such time as any  required  consents  shall  have been  obtained  by such
Seller,  all rights to and under any Station Contract which requires the consent
of any other party thereto for  assignment to Buyer if such consent has not been
obtained on the Closing Date (the "Deferred Contract").  Until the assignment of
the Deferred  Contract,  (i) each Seller shall continue to use all  commercially
reasonable  efforts and Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers to obtain the consent
and/or to remove any other impediments to such assignment,  and (ii) Sellers and
Buyer agree to  cooperate  in any lawful  arrangement  to provide (to the extent
permitted without breach of such Deferred Contract) that Buyer shall receive the
benefits of such  interest  after the  Closing  Date to the same extent as if it
were the lessee thereunder;  provided,  however,  if Buyer shall fail to receive
such  benefits  after the Closing  Date for any Leased  Property  that is a main
transmitter  tower  site or a  studio  site  for any  Station  (the  "Designated
Properties"),  Sellers agree to make such payments as are necessary for Buyer to
receive such benefits as long as the aggregate  amount of all such payments does
not exceed Two  Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($200,000)  for all such  Designated
Properties under this Agreement. If, subsequent to the Closing, any Seller shall
obtain required consents to assign any Deferred Contract,  the Deferred Contract
for which consent to assign has been obtained shall at that time be deemed to be
conveyed,  granted, bargained, sold, transferred,  setover, assigned,  released,
delivered and confirmed to Buyer,  without need of further  action by any Seller
or of future documentation.

         6.2.11. CORPORATE ACTION.

                   Take all corporate action (including, without limitation, all
shareholder  action),  under the Law of any state having  jurisdiction over such
Seller necessary to effectuate the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
and the other Seller Documents.

         6.2.12. ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT.

                   Subject to the  cooperation of the Trustee,  permit Buyer and
Buyer's  agents,  as soon as  practical  after the date hereof and upon  Buyer's
request  therefor,  access to the Real Property and the Leased  Property for the
purpose of conducting,  at Buyer's  expense,  Phase I and Phase II environmental
audits.  Any  such  environmental  audits  shall  be  conducted  by a  reputable
environmental  investigatory  firm of Buyer's  choice  subject to the reasonable
approval of Sellers and in a manner as will not unreasonably  interfere with the
normal business and operations of any of the Stations.

         6.2.13. HERITAGE AGREEMENT.

                   Consummate the  acquisition of the Assets in accordance  with
all of the provisions of the Heritage Agreement and use commercially

                                      -32-

<PAGE>



reasonable  efforts  to pursue in a timely  manner any  claims  relating  to the
Stations that Sellers may have under the Heritage Agreement.


     6.3. CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Each Seller shall, at all times,  maintain strict  confidentiality with
respect to all  documents  and  information  furnished  to such  Seller by or on
behalf of Buyer.  Nothing shall be deemed to be confidential  information  that:
(a) is known  to a Seller  at the time of its  disclosure  to such  Seller;  (b)
becomes publicly known or available to a Seller other than through disclosure by
such Seller;  (c) is received by a Seller from a third party not actually  known
by such Seller to be bound by a confidentiality  agreement with or obligation to
Buyer;  or (d) is  independently  developed  by a  Seller.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing  provisions  of this  Section  6.3,  each  Seller  may  disclose  such
confidential  information  (a) to the extent  required  or deemed  advisable  to
comply  with  applicable  Laws;  (b)  to  its  officers,  directors,  employees,
representatives,  financial advisors,  attorneys,  accountants,  and agents with
respect to the transactions  contemplated  hereby (so long as such parties agree
to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of such  information);  (c) to the  Heritage
Subsidiaries  and the Trustee,  as necessary,  with respect to the  transactions
contemplated   hereby  (so  long  as  such   parties   agree  to  maintain   the
confidentiality of such information);  and (d) to any Governmental  Authority in
connection  with  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.  In  the  event  this
Agreement  is  terminated,  each Seller will return to Buyer all  documents  and
other  material  prepared or  furnished  by Buyer  relating to the  transactions
contemplated  hereunder,  whether obtained before or after the execution of this
Agreement.


     6.4. HERITAGE ACQUISITION.

         Upon  receipt of a written  notice by Sellers from Buyer that the Buyer
is prepared to proceed with the Non-License  Transfer  hereunder  simultaneously
with  (or  immediately  following)  the  acquisition  of the  Stations  from the
Heritage  Subsidiaries,  Sellers agree to acquire the Stations from the Heritage
Subsidiaries as promptly as possible to the extent  permitted under the Heritage
Agreement.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  nothing in the preceding  sentence
shall  constitute  a waiver  by Buyer of any  conditions  precedent  to  Buyer's
obligation to proceed with the Non-License Transfer.


                                   ARTICLE 7.
                        COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS OF BUYER

         Buyer covenants and agrees with Sellers as follows:

                                      -33-

<PAGE>



     7.1. CONFIDENTIALITY.

         Buyer  shall,  at all times prior to the  Non-License  Transfer and the
Closing,  maintain  strict  confidentiality  with respect to all  documents  and
information  furnished  to Buyer by or on behalf of a Seller.  Nothing  shall be
deemed to be confidential information that: (a) is known to Buyer at the time of
its  disclosure to Buyer;  (b) becomes  publicly  known or available  other than
through  disclosure  by Buyer;  (c) is  received by Buyer from a third party not
actually  known by Buyer to be  bound  by a  confidentiality  agreement  with or
obligation  to  a  Seller;   or  (d)  is   independently   developed  by  Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.1, Buyer may disclose
such confidential  information (a) to the extent required or deemed advisable to
comply  with  applicable  Laws;  (b)  to  its  officers,  directors,   partners,
employees, representatives,  financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents,
underwriters,  lenders,  investors and any other potential  sources of financing
with respect to the  transactions  contemplated  hereby (so long as such parties
agree to  maintain  the  confidentiality  of such  information);  and (c) to any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions  contemplated hereby.
In the event this  Agreement  is  terminated,  Buyer will  return to Sellers all
documents and other  material  prepared or furnished by Sellers  relating to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  whether  obtained before or after
the execution of this Agreement.


     7.2. CORPORATE ACTION.

         Prior to the Non-License Transfer and the Closing, Buyer shall take all
corporate action (including,  without limitation, all shareholder action), under
the Laws of any state having jurisdiction over Buyer necessary to effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Buyer Documents.


     7.3. ACCESS.

         From and after the Transfer Date for a period of three (3) years, Buyer
shall  cause to be  afforded  to  representatives  of Sellers  and the  Heritage
Subsidiaries  reasonable  access  during normal  business  hours to the offices,
books and records,  contracts  and reports of the  Stations  which relate to the
operations  of the Stations  during the period  during  which the Stations  were
owned by the Sellers or the  Heritage  Subsidiaries,  as Sellers or the Heritage
Subsidiaries shall from time to time reasonably request; provided, however, that
(a) such  investigation  shall  only be upon  reasonable  notice  and  shall not
unreasonably  disrupt the personnel or operations of Buyer or the Stations,  and
(b) under no  circumstances  shall Buyer be  required  to provide  access to any
Seller,  any Heritage  Subsidiary  or any  representatives  of any Seller or any
Heritage  Subsidiary (i) any information or materials subject to confidentiality
agreements with third parties required to be

                                      -34-

<PAGE>



kept  confidential  by applicable  Laws, or (ii) any privileged  attorney-client
communications or attorney work product. All requests for access to the offices,
books and records,  contracts and reports of the Stations  shall be made to such
representatives  as Buyer  shall  designate  in  writing,  who  shall be  solely
responsible  for  coordinating  all  such  requests  and  all  access  permitted
hereunder.  Buyer agrees not to dispose of any such books and records, contracts
and reports of the  Stations  which  relate to the  operations  of the  Stations
during  the  period  during  which the  Stations  were  owned by  Sellers or the
Heritage  Subsidiaries without consulting with Sellers prior to disposal thereof
and taking any reasonable  action requested by Sellers with respect to retention
and transfer to Sellers thereof.


     7.4. COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES.

         At the  earlier of the  Non-License  Transfer or the  Closing,  Sellers
shall assign the Accounts Receivable to Buyer for collection purposes only, and,
within ten (10) business days after the Transfer  Date,  Seller shall furnish to
Buyer a list of the Accounts  Receivable by accounts and the amounts then owing.
Buyer  agrees,  for a period of one  hundred  fifty  (150)  days  following  the
Transfer  Date,  without any  requirement  to  litigate to collect the  Accounts
Receivable,  to use its reasonable efforts (with at least the care and diligence
Buyer uses to collect its own  accounts  receivable)  to collect for Sellers the
Accounts  Receivable  and to remit to Sellers (or their  designees) on the fifth
day following the last day of each month occurring during such one hundred fifty
(150) day period (or, if any such day is a Saturday,  Sunday or holiday,  on the
next day on which banking  transactions  are resumed),  collections  received by
Buyer with respect to the Accounts Receivable. Buyer shall not make any referral
or compromise of any Accounts  Receivable to a collection agency or attorney for
collection  and  shall not  compromise  for less  than  full  value any  Account
Receivable without the prior written consent of Sellers.  Any Account Receivable
not collected by Buyer within one hundred fifty (150) days following the Closing
Date shall revert to Sellers (or their designees). Buyer shall reassign, without
recourse to Buyer, each Account  Receivable and deliver to Sellers,  all records
relating  thereto on the same day as it remits to Sellers  (or their  designees)
the  collections  received.  All payments in respect of the Accounts  Receivable
received during the one hundred fifty (150) day period shall be first applied to
the oldest balance then due on the Accounts Receivable unless the account debtor
indicates in writing that  payment is to be applied  otherwise  due to a dispute
over an  Account  Receivable.  Buyer  agrees,  upon the  reasonable  request  of
Sellers,  to furnish to Sellers  periodic  reports on the status of its Accounts
Receivable.  Buyer  shall have no right to set-off  any  amounts  collected  for
Accounts Receivable for any amounts owed to Buyer by Sellers; provided, however,
that Buyer shall have the right to seek  indemnification  in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement.

                              OF SELLERS AND BUYER


     8.1. POSSESSION AND CONTROL.

         Between the date hereof and the Closing Date,  Buyer shall not directly
or indirectly control,  supervise or direct, or attempt to control, supervise or
direct,  the  business  and  operations  of the  Stations,  and such  operation,
including complete control and supervision of all programming, shall be the sole
responsibility of the owners of the Stations,  except as contemplated by the LMA
Agreement after the Non-License Transfer. On and after the Closing Date, Sellers
shall  have no  control  over,  or  right to  intervene,  supervise,  direct  or
participate in, the business and operations of the Stations.


     8.2. RISK OF LOSS.

         The risk of loss or  damage by fire or other  casualty  or cause to the
Assets  until the  Transfer  Date  shall be upon  Sellers.  Except as  otherwise
provided in Section  9.3, in the event of loss or damage  prior to the  Transfer
Date with respect to which Sellers have adequate  replacement cost insurance and
which has not been  restored,  replaced,  or repaired as of the  Transfer  Date,
Buyer shall proceed with the Non-License Transfer or the Closing, as applicable,
and receive at the  Non-License  Transfer or the  Closing,  as  applicable,  the
insurance  proceeds  or an  assignment  of the right to receive  such  insurance
proceeds, as applicable, to which Sellers otherwise would be entitled, whereupon
Sellers shall have no further liability to Buyer for such loss or damage.


     8.3. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS.

         Sellers  and Buyer shall  consult  with each other  before  issuing any
press  release or otherwise  making any public  statements  with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated  herein and shall not issue any such
press  release  or make any such  public  statement  without  the prior  written
consent of the other parties hereto,  which shall not be unreasonably  withheld;
provided,  however, that a party may, without consulting with the other parties,
issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by Law
or any listing  agreement  with a national  securities  exchange to which STC or
Sinclair is a party if it has used all  reasonable  efforts to consult  with the
other party and to obtain such party's consent but has been unable to do so in a
timely manner.

     8.4. EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

         8.4.1.  Upon the earlier of the  Non-License  Transfer or the  Closing,
Buyer shall offer employment to each of the employees of the Stations (including
those on leave of absence,  whether short-term,  long-term,  family,  maternity,
disability,  paid, unpaid or other), at a comparable salary,  position and place
of employment as held by each such  employee  immediately  prior to the Transfer
Date (such  employees  who are given such offers of  employment  and accept such
offers  are  referred  to  herein  as the  "Transferred  Employees");  provided,
however,  that  the two (2)  employees  of the  Stations  designated  in the TBA
Agreement   shall  continue  as  employees  of  Sellers  and  shall  not  become
Transferred Employees hereunder until the Closing. Nothing in this Section 8.4.1
is intended to guarantee  employment for any Transferred Employee for any length
of time after the Transfer Date.

         8.4.2.  Except as provided otherwise in this Section 8.4, Sellers shall
pay, discharge and be responsible for (a) all salary and wages arising out of or
relating  to the  employment  of the  employees  of the  Stations  prior  to the
Transfer Date and (b) any employee  benefits  arising under the Benefit Plans of
any Seller Party, any Heritage Subsidiary and their Affiliates during the period
prior to the Transfer Date.  From and after the Transfer Date,  Buyer shall pay,
discharge and be responsible for all salary,  wages and benefits  arising out of

practicable  after the Transfer Date,  Buyer shall take all necessary  action to
qualify the Buyer's Plan under the applicable  provisions of the Code (including
but not limited to Section 401),  if it is not yet so  qualified,  and Buyer and
Sellers  shall  make any and all  filings  and  submissions  to the  appropriate

Revenue Service regarding the qualified status of both the Sellers' Plan and the
Buyer's Plan (each as amended to the date of transfer) or sooner, if Sellers and
Buyer so agree,  Sellers  shall,  and shall  use their  commercially  reasonable
efforts to enforce  such  rights  under the  Heritage  Agreement  to,  cause the
Heritage  Subsidiaries  to cause to be  transferred to the Buyer's Plan, in cash
and in kind, all of the  individual  account  balances of Transferred  Employees
under the  Sellers'  Plan,  including  any  outstanding  plan  participant  loan

herein as the "Closing Date").

         11.1.2. If the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to such date

secure the necessary governmental approvals to cause the designated successor to
become the licensee.  If the Closing shall not have occurred on or prior to such

Buyer; provided, however, to the

Sellers at Closing pursuant to Section 2.5.2.

consummate  the  sale to a  third  party  of both  the  License  Assets  and the
Non-License  Assets in an orderly and mutually  satisfactory  manner (the "Third
Party  Sale").  At the closing of the Third Party Sale  pursuant to this Section
11.1.3,  (a) up to Two Million Dollars  ($2,000,000)  of the proceeds  therefrom
shall be paid  directly  to Sellers by wire  transfer of  immediately  available
funds to an  account  identified  by Sellers in  writing,  and (b) any  proceeds

Date  specified  by Buyer in  writing  at least five (5) days prior to such date

the Outside  Date,  the  Outside  Date shall be such date which is ten (10) days
after  satisfaction  of all such  conditions  (subject  to rights of Sellers and
Buyer to terminate this Agreement  prior to such date in accordance with Article
13).

         11.2.2.  At the  Non-License  Transfer,  Sellers  shall  sell,  assign,
transfer,  convey and deliver to Buyer free and clear of any Encumbrances  other

         Subject to the  conditions  and  provisions of Section 12.4 and Section

     12.4. LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION.

         12.4.1.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,  in no event shall Losses include a party's incidental,  consequential
or punitive  damages,  regardless  of the theory of recovery.  Each party hereto
agrees to use reasonable efforts to mitigate any losses which form the basis for
any claim for indemnification hereunder.

         12.4.2.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Sellers shall not be liable to Buyer in respect of any indemnification
hereunder  except to the  extent  that the  aggregate  amount of Losses of Buyer
under

                                      -48-

<PAGE>



this Agreement  exceeds Five Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($500,000) (the "Basket
Amount"),  and then only to the  extent  of the  excess  over the  amount of Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000); provided, however, that the aggregate
amount of Losses of Buyer under this  Agreement  shall not exceed  Four  Million
Dollars  ($4,000,000) (the "Indemnity  Cap");  further  provided,  however,  the
Basket Amount shall not be applicable to any amounts owed in connection with the
determination of the Proration Amount pursuant to Section 2.6, to the payment or
reimbursement  obligations  of Sellers under  Sections 8.2 and 8.4.8,  or to the
indemnities set forth in Section 12.2(a) or Section 12.2(b);  further  provided,
however,  the Indemnity  Cap shall not be applicable  (i) if the transfer of the
License  Assets to Buyer has not occurred on or prior to such date which is four
(4) years from the date of this  Agreement  as a result of a default  under,  or
breach of, any of the terms of this  Agreement  by Sellers,  (ii) if the Closing
has not  occurred on or prior to such date which is four (4) years from the date
of this Agreement  under the  circumstances  described in the second sentence of
Section 11.1.2, or (iii) in the event of fraud.

         12.4.3.  Notwithstanding  any other  provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,  Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the maximum aggregate liability of
Sellers  pursuant to this  Agreement to Buyer and any third  parties for any and
all Losses shall not exceed the Indemnity Cap, regardless of whether Buyer seeks
indemnification  pursuant to this Article 12,  regardless of the form of action,
whether in contract or tort, including negligence,  and regardless of whether or
not Sellers are  notified  of the  possibility  of damages to Buyer or any other
third party; provided, however, the Indemnity Cap shall not be applicable if the
transfer  of the  License  Assets to Buyer has not  occurred on or prior to such
date  which is four (4) years from the date of this  Agreement  as a result of a
default under, or breach of, any of the terms of this Agreement by Sellers, (ii)
if the Closing has not occurred on or prior to such date which is four (4) years
from the date of this Agreement under the circumstances  described in the second
sentence of Section 11.1.2, or (iii) in the event of fraud.

         12.4.4.  Each party (a "recipient  party") shall notify the other party
in writing  (the  "representing  party")  reasonably  promptly of any  perceived
breach by the  representing  party of which the recipient party has knowledge of
any  representations,  warranties,  covenants and agreements,  and of any Losses
(including  a brief  description  of the  same) of the  recipient  party  caused
thereby.  In the event of any breach that is cured prior to the Transfer Date in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement,  the representing  party shall have
no  obligation  under Section 12.2 or Section 12.3 or otherwise to indemnify the
recipient party with respect to such Losses.

     12.5. CONDITIONS OF INDEMNIFICATION.

         The  obligations and liabilities of Sellers and of Buyer hereunder with
respect to their respective  indemnities  pursuant to this Article 12, resulting
from any Losses, shall be subject to the following terms and conditions:

         12.5.1.  The party seeking  indemnification  (the "Indemnified  Party")
must  give the other  party or  parties,  as the case may be (the  "Indemnifying
Party"), notice of any such Losses promptly after the Indemnified Party receives
notice  thereof;  provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the rights of the  Indemnified  Party  hereunder  except to the extent  that the
Indemnifying Party shall have suffered actual damage by reason of such failure.

         12.5.2.  The Indemnifying  Party shall have the right to undertake,  by
counsel or other representatives of its own choosing, the defense of such Losses
at the Indemnifying Party's risk and expense.

         12.5.3.  In the event that the  Indemnifying  Party  shall elect not to
undertake  such  defense,  or,  within a  reasonable  time after notice from the
Indemnified  Party of any such  Losses,  shall fail to defend,  the  Indemnified
Party (upon further  written  notice to the  Indemnifying  Party) shall have the
right to undertake the defense,  compromise  or  settlement  of such Losses,  by
counsel or other  representatives of its own choosing,  on behalf of and for the
account  and  risk  of the  Indemnifying  Party  (subject  to the  right  of the
Indemnifying  Party to  assume  defense  of such  Losses  at any  time  prior to
settlement,  compromise  or final  determination  thereof).  In such event,  the
Indemnifying  Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party, in addition to the other
sums  required  to be paid  hereunder,  the costs and  expenses  incurred by the
Indemnified  Party in connection with such defense,  compromise or settlement as
and when such costs and expenses are so incurred.

         12.5.4. Anything in this Section 12.5 to the contrary  notwithstanding,
(a) if  there  is a  reasonable  possibility  that  Losses  may  materially  and
adversely  affect the Indemnified  Party other than as a result of money damages
or other money payments,  the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own
cost and expense, to participate in the defense, compromise or settlement of the
Losses,  (b) the Indemnifying  Party shall not, without the Indemnified  Party's
written  consent,  settle or  compromise  any  Losses or consent to entry of any
judgment which does not include as an  unconditional  term thereof the giving by
the  claimant or the  plaintiff to the  Indemnified  Party of a release from all
liability in respect of such Losses in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the
Indemnified  Party, and (c) in the event that the Indemnifying  Party undertakes
defense of any Losses, the Indemnified Party, by counsel or other representative
of its own choosing  and at its sole cost and  expense,  shall have the right to
consult with the Indemnifying

                                      -50-

<PAGE>



Party and its counsel or other  representatives  concerning  such Losses and the
Indemnifying  Party and the Indemnified  Party and their  respective  counsel or
other representatives shall cooperate with respect to such Losses and (d) in the
event  that  the  Indemnifying  Party  undertakes  defense  of any  Losses,  the
Indemnifying  Party  shall  have an  obligation  to keep the  Indemnified  Party
informed of the status of the defense of such Losses and furnish the Indemnified
Party with all documents, instruments and information that the Indemnified Party
shall reasonably request in connection therewith.


     12.6. CURE OF BREACH.

         Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
a breach by  Sellers  of any  representations  and  warranties  or a failure  to
perform any covenant or agreement hereunder may be cured by Sellers prior to the
Transfer  Date (a) by  reducing  the  Purchase  Price in an amount  equal to the
Losses to Buyer caused by such breach, (b) by making payment to a third party or
taking other action to discharge  the Losses,  (c) by placing an amount equal to
the  Losses  in  an  escrow  account  under  an  escrow  arrangement  reasonably
satisfactory to Sellers and Buyer or (d) a combination of the foregoing.  If the
foregoing actions fully cure the breach,  Sellers shall have no obligation under
Section 12.2 or otherwise to indemnify  Buyer with respect to the Losses  caused
by such  breach;  if such  actions  partially  cure the  breach,  Sellers  shall
continue  to have an  obligation  under  Section  12.2 to  indemnify  Buyer with
respect to the remaining portion of the Losses caused by such breach.


                                   ARTICLE 13.

return of the Letter of Credit, this Agreement shall be deemed null, void and of
no further  force or effect,  and the parties  hereto shall be released from all
future obligations hereunder;  provided,  however, that the obligations of Buyer
and Sellers set forth in Sections 6.3 and 7.1 (which relate to confidentiality),
and Section 15.3 (which relates to payment of certain  expenses),  shall survive
such  termination  and the  parties  hereto  shall have any and all  remedies to
enforce such obligations  provided at law or in equity or otherwise  (including,
without limitation, specific performance).

         13.3.2.  In the event this  Agreement  is  terminated  as  provided  in
Section  13.1.2,  this  Agreement  shall be deemed null,  void and of no further

obligations  hereunder;  provided,  however,  that the  obligations of Buyer and
Sellers set forth in  Sections  6.3 and 7.1 (which  relate to  confidentiality),
Article 14 (which relates to remedies and the Letter of Credit) and Section 15.3
(which relates to payment of certain  expenses),  shall survive such termination
and the  parties  hereto  shall  have  any  and all  remedies  to  enforce  such
obligations  provided  at law or in  equity  or  otherwise  (including,  without
limitation, specific performance).


                                   ARTICLE 14.
                                    REMEDIES


     14.1. DEFAULT BY BUYER.

         If Buyer shall default in the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement  in any material  respect and such default is not cured within  thirty
(30) days after  notice  thereof (it being  understood  that Buyer shall have no
right to such  thirty (30) day cure  period  with  respect to a payment  default
under  Section  2.5),  and provided  that Sellers  shall not then be in material
default in the performance of

                                      -52-

<PAGE>



their  obligations  hereunder,  Sellers shall be entitled,  by written notice to
Buyer,  to terminate  this  Agreement,  and as the sole and exclusive  remedy of
Sellers under this Agreement, to receive the Deposit by drawing on the Letter of
Credit in  accordance  with the terms of the Deposit  Escrow  Agreement  and the
Letter of Credit  (without  set-off,  deduction or  counterclaim)  as liquidated
damages,  and upon such  payment  Buyer  shall be  discharged  from all  further
liability under this Agreement.


     14.2. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES.

         Sellers  and Buyer have  provided  for the amount of the  Deposit to be
liquidated damages as a remedy for Sellers after having considered carefully the
anticipated and actual harms and losses that would be incurred if Buyer defaults
and thus  fails to  perform  its  obligations  to  consummate  the  transactions
contemplated  hereunder,  the difficulty of ascertaining at this time the actual
amount of damages,  special and general, that Sellers will suffer in such event,
and the  inconvenience  or  nonfeasibility  of  otherwise  obtaining an adequate
remedy in such event.


     14.3. SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE.

         Sellers  acknowledge  that the Assets to be sold and delivered to Buyer
pursuant to this  Agreement are unique and that Buyer has no adequate  remedy at
law if Sellers  shall fail to perform any of their  obligations  hereunder,  and
Sellers therefore  confirm and agree that Buyer's right to specific  performance
is  essential  to protect the rights and  interests  of Buyer.  Accordingly,  in
addition to any other  remedies  which Buyer may have  hereunder or at law or in
equity or  otherwise,  Sellers  hereby  agree that Buyer shall have the right to
have all  obligations,  undertakings,  agreements  and other  provisions of this
Agreement  specifically performed by Sellers and that Buyer shall have the right
to obtain an order or decree of such specific  performance  in any of the courts
of the United States or of any state or other political subdivision thereof.

                               GENERAL PROVISIONS


     15.1. ADDITIONAL ACTIONS, DOCUMENTS AND INFORMATION.

         Buyer  agrees  that it will,  at any  time,  prior  to, at or after the
Transfer  Date,  take or cause to be taken such  further  actions,  and execute,
deliver  and file or cause to be  executed,  delivered  and filed  such  further
documents  and  instruments  and  obtain  such  consents,  as may be  reasonably
requested by Sellers in

                                      -53-

<PAGE>



connection with the  consummation of the purchase and sale  contemplated by this
Agreement.  Sellers agree that they will, at any time, prior to, at or after the
Transfer  Date,  take or cause to be taken such  further  actions,  and execute,
deliver  and file or cause to be  executed,  delivered  and filed  such  further
documents  and  instruments  and  obtain  such  consents,  as may be  reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with the  consummation of the purchase and sale
contemplated by this Agreement.


     15.2. BROKERS.

         Each Seller  represents  to Buyer that such Seller has not engaged,  or
incurred  any  unpaid   liability  (for  any  brokerage  fees,   finders'  fees,
commissions or otherwise) to, any broker, finder or agent in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement;  except for Salomon Smith Barney
(whose fee is the sole  responsibility  of Buyer),  Buyer  represents to Sellers
that Buyer has not engaged,  or incurred any unpaid liability (for any brokerage
fees, finders' fees,  commissions or otherwise) to, any broker,  finder or agent
in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement;  and Seller
agrees to indemnify  Buyer, and Buyer agrees to indemnify  Sellers,  against any
claims asserted  against the other party for any such fees or commissions by any
person  purporting to act or to have acted for or on behalf of the  indemnifying
party.   Notwithstanding   any  other   provision   of  this   Agreement,   this
representation  and warranty shall survive the Transfer Date without  limitation
and shall not be subject to the Basket Amount contained in Section 12.4.


     15.3. EXPENSES AND TAXES.

         Each party  hereto shall pay its own  expenses  incurred in  connection
with  this  Agreement  and  in  the  preparation  for  and  consummation  of the
transactions provided for herein.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Buyer, on the
one hand,  and  Sellers,  on the other hand,  shall each pay one-half of (a) all
sales (including,  without  limitation,  bulk sales), use,  documentary,  stamp,
gross receipts,  registration,  transfer, conveyance, excise, recording, license
and other similar Taxes and fees ("Transfer  Taxes") applicable to, imposed upon
or arising  out of the sale by Sellers  and the  purchase by Buyer of the Assets
whether now in effect or hereinafter  adopted and regardless of which party such
Transfer Tax is imposed upon (except for any Taxes  incurred by Sellers from any
gain realized on the sale of the Assets hereunder, which Taxes shall be the sole
responsibility of Sellers),  (b) any FCC filing fees incurred in connection with
the assignment of the FCC Licenses to Buyer, (c) any fees and expenses  incurred
in connection with any HSR Filings,  and (d) the fees and expenses of Geraghty &

<PAGE>



         WHEREAS,   Programmer  is  experienced   in  broadcast   ownership  and
operation;

         WHEREAS,  during the terms of this  Agreement,  Owner  wishes to retain
Programmer to provide programming and related services for the Stations,  all in
conformity with Station policies and procedures, FCC rules and policies for time
brokerage arrangements, and the provisions hereof,

         WHEREAS,  Programmer  agrees  to use the  Stations  to  broadcast  such

and policies of the FCC, subject to Owner's full authority to manage and control

                                   AGREEMENT:

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the above recitals,  and mutual
promises and covenants  contained  herein,  the parties  intending to be legally
bound, agree as follows:

         SECTION 1     USE OF STATION AIR TIME.

         1.1  Scope.  During  the  term  of this  Agreement,  Owner  shall  make
available  to  Programmer  broadcast  time on the  Stations as set forth in this
Agreement.  Programmer shall deliver such  programming,  at its expense,  to the
Stations'  transmitters or other authorized  remote control points designated by
Owner.  Programmer  shall provide such  programming  of  Programmer's  selection
complete with commercial  matter,  news, public service  announcements and other
suitable  programming  to the  Stations  for at least one hundred and  sixty-six
(166) hours

                                       2

<PAGE>



per week.  Except as  otherwise  provided  in this  Agreement,  Owner  agrees to
broadcast such programming in its entirety,  including  commercials at the times
specified, on the facilities of the Stations without interruption,  deletion, or
addition of any kind. Owner may use such time as Owner may require up to two (2)
hours per week, for the broadcast of its own  regularly-scheduled  news,  public
affairs, and other nonentertainment programming on the Stations, to be scheduled
at mutually  agreeable  times.  Owner may elect to set aside additional air time
(up to two (2) hours per week)  (the  "Additional  Time") to be  scheduled  at a
mutually  agreeable  time,  for  the  broadcast  of  specific  non-entertainment
programming on issues of importance to the local community.  Owner shall provide
Programmer with as much notice as possible,  but in no event less than three (3)
weeks' notice,  of its intention to set aside such Additional  Time. All program
time not  reserved  by or  designated  for Owner shall be  available  for use by
Programmer.  Owner agrees that  Programmer  may sell, or engage a third party to
sell,  commercial  time during the  programming  provided by  Programmer  to the
Stations for Programmer's account.

         1.2 Term.  This Agreement shall commence on the date of the Non-License
Transfer as contemplated in the Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Effective Date"),
and end on the Closing Date (the "Term"),  unless terminated earlier pursuant to
any of the provisions of Section 5 hereof.

         SECTION 2      STATION OPERATIONS.

         2.1 Owner Control Over Station Operations.

                  (a) Owner shall retain full authority,  power and control over
the  management  and  operations  of the  Stations  during  the Term,  including
specifically,  control  over the  personnel,  programming  and  finances  of the
Stations.

                                       3

<PAGE>



                  (b) Subject to Owner's full authority,  power and control over
the  management  and  operations of the Stations,  Programmer  agrees to provide
programming and related  services to the Stations.  Such related  services shall
include: (i) the sale of advertising time on the Stations;  (ii) coordination of
traffic and billing functions; (iii) maintenance,  repair and replacement of the
Stations'  transmitting or studio equipment and the other Assets, and (iv) other
administrative  or  operational  functions as Owner and Programmer may agree to,
consistent with FCC rules and regulations relating to time brokerage agreements.
Programmer  shall  provide  and  perform  Programmer's   obligations  hereunder,
including  all related  services,  diligently  and in a manner  consistent  with
broadcast industry practices.

                  (c) Owner  shall  employ at WPTZ's main  studio  location,  at
Owner's expense,  a Station Manager and a staff level employee,  who will direct
the  day-to-day  operations  of the  Stations,  and who  will  report  to and be
accountable  to Owner.  Such  employees  shall be paid  reasonable  compensation
commensurate with their job responsibilities, as mutually agreed to by Owner and
Programmer.

                  (d) When on the Owner's premises,  all employees of Programmer
used to provide Programmer's programming or other services to the Stations shall
be subject to the overall supervision of Owner's management personnel.

         2.2 Station Expenses.  During the Term, Programmer shall be responsible
for and shall  reimburse  Owner within fifteen (15) days following  receipt of a
request for reimbursement by Owner for any direct  out-of-pocket  costs incurred
by Owner as necessary to preserve and maintain the FCC Licenses and other Assets
of the Stations then owned by Owner (including the expenses of Owner as a result
of Section 2.1(c) above).

         2.3  Consideration.  As  consideration  for the air time made available
hereunder and the

                                       4

<PAGE>



other agreements of the parties made hereunder,  Programmer  agrees to pay Owner
the payments set forth in Attachment 2.3 hereto.  Notwithstanding  any provision
of this  Agreement to the  contrary,  in the event of a  preemption  by Owner of
Programmer's programming under Sections 1.1 (with respect to the Additional Time
only),  3.2,  4.1 or 4.2 of this  Agreement,  the Monthly  Payment as defined in
Attachment  2.3 shall be  reduced  by an amount  equal to (a) the  amount of the
Monthly  Payment  multiplied  by (b) a fraction  the  numerator  of which is the
number of minutes of  Programmer's  programming  preempted  by Owner during such
month and the denominator of which is one hundred sixty-six (166).

         SECTION 3      STATION PUBLIC INTEREST OBLIGATIONS.

         3.1 Owner  Authority.  Owner  shall be  responsible  for the  Stations'
compliance with all applicable  provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as
amended  (the  "Act"),  the rules,  regulations  and policies of the FCC and all
other  applicable  laws.  Programmer shall cooperate with Owner, at Programmer's
expense,  in taking such actions as Owner may reasonably request to assist Owner
in maintaining the Stations'  compliance  with the Act,  rules,  regulations and
policies of the FCC and all other  applicable  laws.  Notwithstanding  any other
provision  of this  Agreement,  Programmer  recognizes  that  Owner has  certain
obligations  to operate the  Stations in the public  interest,  and to broadcast
programming  to meet the needs and  interests of the  Stations'  communities  of
license  and  service  area.  From time to time  Owner  shall  air,  or if Owner
requests, Programmer shall air, programming on issues of importance to the local
community.  Nothing in this Agreement  shall abrogate or limit the  unrestricted
authority of Owner to discharge Owner's  obligations to the public and to comply
with the Act and the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC, and Owner shall
have no liability or obligation to Programmer, for

                                       5

<PAGE>



taking any action that Owner deems  necessary or  appropriate  to discharge such
obligations or comply with such laws, rules, regulations or policies.

         3.2 Additional  Owner  Obligations.  Although both Owner and Programmer
shall  cooperate in the  broadcast of emergency  information  over the Stations,
Owner shall retain the right, without any liability or obligation to Programmer,
to interrupt Programmer's programming in case of an emergency or for programming
which,  in the good faith  judgment  of Owner,  is of greater  local or national
public  importance.  In all such cases,  Owner  shall use  Owner's  commercially
reasonable  efforts  to  provide  Programmer  notice  of  Owner's  intention  to
interrupt Programmer's programming.  Owner shall coordinate with Programmer each
Station's hourly station  identification and any other announcements required to
be aired by FCC rules or  regulations.  Owner shall (a) continue to maintain and
staff a main studio in  compliance  with the rules of the FCC, (b) maintain each
Station's  local  public  inspection  file within each  Station's  community  of
license,  and (c) prepare and place in such  inspection  file in a timely manner
all material  required by Section 73.3526 of the FCC's Rules,  including without
limitation each Station's  quarterly  issues and program lists and FCC Form 398.
Programmer  shall,  upon  request  by Owner,  promptly  provide  Owner with such
information concerning  Programmer's programs and advertising as is necessary to
assist Owner in the preparation of such information or to enable Owner to verify
independently the Stations'  compliance with any other laws, rules,  regulations
or policies applicable to the Stations' operation. Owner shall also maintain the
station  logs,  receive  and  respond to  telephone  inquiries,  and control and
oversee any remote control point for the Stations.

                                       6

         SECTION 4     STATION PROGRAMMING & OPERATIONAL POLICIES.

         4.1 Broadcast Station Programming Policy Statement. Owner has adopted a
Broadcast Station Programming Policy Statement (the "Policy Statement"),  a copy
of which appears as Attachment  4.1 hereto and which may be amended from time to
time in order to comply with the rules and  regulations of the FCC by Owner upon
written notice to Programmer.  Programmer  agrees and covenants to comply in all
material respects with the Policy  Statement,  with all rules and regulations of
the FCC, and with all changes  subsequently made by Owner or the FCC. Programmer
shall furnish or cause to be furnished  the artistic  personnel and material for
the programs as provided by this  Agreement  and all programs  shall be prepared
and presented in conformity with the rules,  regulations and policies of the FCC
and with the Policy Statement. All advertising spots and promotional material or
announcements  shall  comply  with  all  applicable  federal,  state  and  local
regulations  and  policies  and the Policy  Statement,  and shall be produced in
accordance with quality standards established by Programmer. If Owner determines
that a program,  commercial  announcement  or promotional  material  supplied by
Programmer is for any reason, in Owner's reasonable  discretion,  unsatisfactory
or  unsuitable or contrary to the public  interest,  or does not comply with the
Policy  Statement  Owner may, upon written  notice to Programmer  (to the extent
time permits such notice), and without any liability or obligation to Programmer
suspend or cancel such program,  commercial announcement or promotional material
and substitute  its own  programming  or, if Owner  requests,  Programmer  shall
provide  promptly  suitable  programming,   commercial   announcement  or  other
announcement or promotional material.

         4.2 Owner Control of Station Programming.  Notwithstanding any contrary
provision  contained in this Agreement,  and consistent with Owner's obligations
pursuant to the Act and the

                                       7

<PAGE>



rules and  regulations  of the FCC,  Owner  shall  have the right,  without  any
liability or obligation  to  Programmer to delete any material  contained in any
programming or commercial  matter furnished by Programmer for broadcast over the
Stations that Owner  determines is unsuitable  for broadcast or the broadcast of
which Owner believes would be contrary to the public interest.  Owner shall have
the right,  without any  liability  or  obligation  to  Programmer  to broadcast
Owner's own programming in place of such deleted material.

         4.3 [INTENTIONALLY OMITTED].

         4.4 Political Advertising.  Owner shall oversee and shall take ultimate
responsibility  for the Stations'  compliance  with the  political  broadcasting
rules of the FCC and Sections 312 and 315 of the Act,  including but not limited
to, the  provision of equal  opportunities,  compliance  with lowest unit charge
requirements,  and the  provision  of  reasonable  access to  federal  political
candidates.  Programmer shall cooperate with Owner, at Programmer's  expense, to
assist  Owner in complying  with the  political  broadcasting  rules of the FCC.
Programmer shall supply such  information  promptly to Owner as may be necessary
to comply with the lowest unit charge and other applicable  political  broadcast
requirements  of federal  law.  To the  extent  that Owner  deems  necessary  or
appropriate,  Programmer shall release  advertising  availabilities  to Owner to
permit  Owner to comply  with the  political  broadcasting  rules of the FCC and
Sections  312 and 315 of the Act.  Programmer  shall be entitled to all revenues
received by Owner for such advertising.

         4.5 Advertising of Credit Terms. To the extent  prohibited by the rules
of the Federal Trade  Commission,  no  advertising of credit terms shall be made
over broadcast  material supplied  hereunder by Programmer beyond mention of the
fact that credit terms are available.

         4.6  Payola/Plugola.  In  order to  enable  Owner  to  fulfill  Owner's
obligations under Section 317 of the Act, Programmer, in compliance with Section
507 of the Act,  will,  in advance

                                       8

<PAGE>



of any scheduled broadcast by the Stations, disclose to Owner any information of
which  Programmer  has knowledge or which has been disclosed to Programmer as to
any money, service, or other valuable  consideration that any person has paid or
accepted,  or has agreed to pay or to accept, for the inclusion of any matter as
a part of the programming or commercial  matter to be supplied to Owner pursuant
to this  Agreement.  Programmer  will  cooperate  with  Owner,  at  Programmer's
expense,  as  necessary to ensure  compliance  with this  provision.  Commercial
matter with obvious sponsorship  identifications shall not require disclosure in
addition to that contained in the commercial copy.

         4.7 Programmer Compliance with Copyright Act. Programmer represents and
warrants that  Programmer  will have full authority to broadcast the programming
on the Stations;  that Programmer  shall not broadcast any material in violation
of the  Copyright  Act;  and the  performing  rights to all music  contained  in
broadcast  material supplied hereunder by Programmer are licensed by BMI, ASCAP,
or SESAC, are in the public domain, are controlled by Programmer, or are cleared
at the source by Programmer.

         SECTION 5       TERMINATION.

         5.1 Termination by Programmer.

                  Unless  terminated  pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.2,
this  Agreement may be terminated by Programmer by written  notice to Owner,  if
Programmer is not then in material default or breach hereof, upon the occurrence
of either of the following:

                  (a) five (5) days  following  the date of  termination  of the
Asset Purchase Agreement; or

                  (b) Owner is in material breach of Owner's  representations or
Owner's material obligations hereunder or under the Asset Purchase Agreement and
has  failed  to  cure

                                       9

<PAGE>



such breach within thirty (30) days of notice from Programmer.

         5.2 Termination by Owner.  Unless terminated pursuant to the provisions
of Section 1.2, this  Agreement may be terminated by Owner by written  notice to
Programmer,  if Owner is not then in material default or breach hereof, upon the
occurrence of any of the following:

                  (a) five (5) days  following  the date of  termination  of the
Asset Purchase Agreement; or
 
                  (b)   Programmer  is  in  material   breach  of   Programmer's
representations  or  Programmer's  material  obligations  hereunder or under the
Asset  Purchase  Agreement and has failed to cure such breach within thirty (30)
days of notice from Owner.

         5.3 Termination.  If not otherwise earlier  terminated,  this Agreement
will terminate, upon the first to occur of any of the following:

                  (a) this Agreement is declared  invalid or illegal in whole or
substantial part by an order or decree of an  administrative  agency or court of
competent  jurisdiction  and such order or decree has become final and no longer
subject to further  administrative  or  judicial  review,  unless as a result of
actions taken by Programmer in violation of the terms hereof;

                  (b) there has been a material  change in FCC rules or policies
that would cause this Agreement to be in violation thereof and such change is in
effect  and not the  subject  of an appeal  or  further  administrative  review,
provided that in such event the parties shall first  negotiate in good faith and
attempt to agree on an amendment to this Agreement that will provide the parties
with a valid,  binding and  enforceable  agreement  that conforms to the new FCC
rules, policies or precedent; or

                  (c) the mutual, written consent of both parties.

         5.4  Severability.  The parties  hereto  intend  that the  transactions
contemplated

                                       10

<PAGE>



hereunder  comply  in all  respects  with  the  Act and  all  applicable  rules,
regulations,  and policies of the FCC. If any provision of this Agreement  shall
be  declared  void,  illegal,  or invalid  by any  governmental  authority  with
jurisdiction thereof, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force
and  effect  without  such  offending   provision  so  long  as  such  remainder
substantially   reflects  the  original  agreement  of  the  parties  hereunder.
Furthermore,  in such event, the parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to reach agreement promptly on lawful substitute  provisions in place of
said  offending  provision  so as to  effectuate  more  closely  their intent as
expressed hereunder. If any governmental authority grants to any other entity or
individual  rights which are not contained in this  Agreement,  then the parties
shall use their  commercially  reasonable  efforts  to amend this  Agreement  to
provide the parties hereto such lawful  provisions which comport with any rules,
regulations and policies adopted after the date of this Agreement.

         5.5 Force Majeure. Any failure or impairment of the Assets or any delay
or interruption in the broadcast of programs,  or failure at any time to furnish
facilities, in whole or in part, for broadcast, due to Acts of God, restrictions
by any governmental authority, civil riot, floods or any other similar cause not
reasonably  within the control of Owner,  shall not  constitute a breach of this
Agreement  and Owner  will not be  liable to  Programmer  for any  liability  or
obligation with respect thereto.

         5.6 Insurance; Risk of Loss.

                  (a) From the date hereof  through  the end of the Term,  Owner
shall  maintain with  reputable  insurance  companies  reasonably  acceptable to
Programmer,  commercially  reasonable  amounts of insurance as is conventionally
carried by broadcasters  operating television stations in the area comparable to
those  of  the  Stations,  including  replacement  cost  insurance  and  general
liability insurance, with respect to the Assets and shall cause Programmer to be
named as

                                       11

<PAGE>



an  additional  insured  on  Owner's  policies.  The risk of any  loss,  damage,
impairment,  confiscation,  or  condemnation  of any equipment or other personal
property  owned and used by Owner in the business and operations of the Stations
("Risk of Loss") shall be borne by Owner at all times  throughout  the Term,  to
the  extent  of, but  solely to the  extent  of,  Owner's  receipt of  insurance
proceeds in respect  thereof and in no event shall Owner have any  liability  or
obligation  to  Programmer  in  respect of any such  loss,  damage,  impairment,
confiscation or condemnation. The Risk of Loss beyond that specifically borne by
the Owner in accordance with the immediately  preceding  sentence shall be borne
by  Programmer.  Owner shall use such proceeds of insurance to repair or replace
any such  equipment  or such other  personal  property of Owner to the extent of
such  proceeds.  At Owner's  request  and  subject to  Owner's  supervision  and
direction,  Programmer  shall  effect  in a timely  fashion  any  repairs  to or
replacement of any of Owner's damaged equipment or property.

                  (b)  From  the  date  hereof  through  the  end of  the  Term,
Programmer  shall  maintain  with  reputable  insurance   companies   reasonably
acceptable  to Owner,  insurance in such amounts and with respect to such risks,

naming  Owner as an  additional  insured,  each with a  commercially  reasonable
amount of  coverage  as is  conventionally  carried  by  broadcasters  operating
television stations in the area comparable to those of the Stations. The risk of
any loss, damage, impairment,  confiscation, or condemnation of any equipment or
other  personal  property  owned  or  leased  and  used  by  Programmer  in  the
performance  of its  obligations  hereunder  shall be borne by Programmer at all
times throughout the Term.

misconduct,  or a breach of Owner's  representations  or obligations  under this
Agreement  or the  Asset  Purchase  Agreement)  from and  after the date of this
Agreement.

         6.2  Indemnification  by Owner. Owner shall indemnify and hold harmless
Programmer  from and against any and all Damages  arising or  resulting  from or
relating to (a) Owner's  breach of any  representation,  covenant,  agreement or
other  obligation of Owner contained in this Agreement,  (b) any action taken by
Owner or Owner's  employees  and agents  with  respect to the  Stations,  or any
failure by Owner or Owner's employees and agents to take any action with respect
to the Stations,  including, without limitation,  Damages relating to violations
of the Act, or any rule, regulation or policy of the FCC, slander, defamation or
other

                                       13

claims relating to programming  provided by Owner or Owner's  broadcast and sale
of  advertising  time on the Stations,  or (c) the business or operations of the
Stations by Owner (except where Damages are caused by  Programmer's  negligence,
recklessness, willful misconduct, or a breach of Programmer's representations or
obligations under this Agreement or the Asset Purchase Agreement) from and after
the date of this Agreement.

         6.3  Indemnification  Procedure.  Neither Owner nor Programmer shall be
entitled to  indemnification  pursuant to this Section 6.3 unless (a) such claim
for  indemnification  is  asserted  in  writing  delivered  to the other  party,
together  with a statement as to the factual  basis for the claim and the amount
of the claim and (b) such claim,  in the aggregate with all other claims made by
such party under this Agreement and the Asset Purchase  Agreement,  exceeds Five
Hundred Thousand Dollars  ($500,000),  and then only to the extent of the excess
over the amount of Two Hundred  Fifty  Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000);  provided,
however, that the aggregate dollar amount of claims under this Agreement and the
Asset Purchase Agreement shall not exceed Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000). The
party making the claim (the "Claimant")  shall make available to the other party
(the  "Indemnitor") the information  relied upon by the Claimant to substantiate
the claim. The Indemnitor under this Section 6.3 shall have the right to conduct
and control through counsel of such Indemnitor's own choosing the defense of any
third party claim,  action or suit (and the Claimant shall  cooperate fully with
the  Indemnitor),  but the Claimant  may, at its  election,  participate  in the
defense of any such claim, action or suit at its sole cost and expense; provided
that,  if the  Indemnitor  shall fail to defend any such claim,  action or suit,
then the Claimant  may defend  through  counsel of its own choosing  such claim,
action or suit,  and (so long as it gives the  Indemnitor  at least fifteen (15)
days'  notice of the terms of the  proposed  settlement  thereof and permits the
Indemnitor to then undertake the defense  thereof) settle such

                                       14

<PAGE>



claim,  action or suit,  and to recover from the  Indemnitor  the amount of such
settlement  or of any judgment and the costs and expenses of such  defense.  The
Indemnitor shall not compromise or settle any third party claim,  action or suit
without the prior  written  consent of the  Claimant,  which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.

         6.4  Arbitration.  To the fullest  extent not  prohibited  by law,  any
controversy,  claim or dispute  arising out of or  relating  to this  Agreement,
including the  determination  of the scope or applicability of this Agreement to
arbitrate,  shall be settled by final and binding arbitration in accordance with
the rules then in effect of the American  Arbitration  Association  ("AAA"),  as
modified  or  supplemented  under  this  section,  and  subject  to the  Federal
Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.  ss.ss. 1-16. The decision of the arbitrators shall be
final and  binding  provided  that,  where a remedy  for  breach  is  prescribed
hereunder or limitations on remedies are prescribed,  the  arbitrators  shall be
bound  by such  restrictions,  and  judgment  upon  the  award  rendered  by the
arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

         If any series of claims arising out of the same or related transactions
shall involve  claims which are  arbitrable  under the  preceding  paragraph and
claims which are not, the  arbitrable  claims shall first be finally  determined
before suit may be  instituted  upon the others and the  parties  will take such
action as may be  necessary  to toll any  statutes of  limitations,  or defenses
based upon the passage of time, that are applicable to such nonarbitrable claims
during the period in which the arbitrable  claims are being  determined.  In the
event of any controversy,  claim or dispute that is subject to arbitration under
this  Section  6.4,  any party  thereto may  commence  arbitration  hereunder by
delivering notice to the other party or parties thereto; provided, in advance of
the commencement of any arbitration each of the parties agrees to participate in
a non-binding mediation effort (not to exceed thirty (30) days) in an attempt to
resolve such

                                       15

<PAGE>



controversy,  claim or dispute. The arbitration panel shall consist of three (3)
arbitrators,  appointed  in  accordance  with the  procedures  set forth in this
paragraph.  Within  ten  (10)  business  days  of  delivery  of  the  notice  of
commencement  of  arbitration  referred to above,  Owner,  on the one hand,  and
Programmer,  on the other hand,  shall each appoint one arbitrator,  and the two
arbitrators  so  appointed   shall  within  ten  (10)  business  days  of  their
appointment  mutually agree upon and appoint one additional  arbitrator  (or, if
such  arbitrators  cannot  agree on an  additional  arbitrator,  the  additional
arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA as provided under its rules); provided,
that  persons  eligible  to be  selected  as  arbitrators  shall be  limited  to
attorneys  at law who (a) are on the AAA's Large,  Complex Case Panel,  (b) have
practiced  law for at least  fifteen (15) years as an attorney  specializing  in
either  general  commercial  litigation  or  general  corporate  and  commercial
matters, and (c) are experienced in matters involving the broadcasting industry.

         The  arbitration  hearing shall be held in  Washington,  D.C. and shall
commence no later than thirty (30)  business  days after the  completion  of the
selection of the  arbitrators.  Consistent with the intent of the parties hereto
that the  arbitration  be conducted as  expeditiously  as possible,  the parties
agree that (a) discovery  shall be limited to the  production of such  documents
and the taking of such  depositions as the arbitrators  determine are reasonably
necessary to the  resolution  of the  controversy,  claim or dispute and (b) the
arbitrators  shall  limit  the  presentation  of  evidence  by each side in such
arbitration  to not more than ten (10) full days'  (equivalent  thereof) or such
shorter period as the  arbitrators  shall  determine to be necessary in order to
resolve the controversy,  claim or dispute.  The arbitrators shall be instructed
to  render  a  decision  within  ten  (10)  business  days of the  close  of the
arbitration  hearing.  If arbitration has not been completed  within ninety (90)
days of the commencement of such  arbitration,  any party to the arbitration may
initiate  litigation upon ten (10) days' written notice to the other party(ies);
provided,  however,

                                       16

<PAGE>



that if one party has requested the other to participate  in an arbitration  and
the  other  has  failed  to  participate,  the  requesting  party  may  initiate
litigation  before  the  expiration  of such  ninety-day  period;  and  provided
further,  that if any  party  to the  arbitration  fails to meet any of the time
limits  set  forth  in  this  Section  6.4  or set  by  the  arbitrators  in the
arbitration,  any other party may provide ten (10) days'  written  notice of its
intent to institute litigation with respect to the controversy, claim or dispute
without the need to continue or complete the  arbitration  and without  awaiting
the expiration of such ninety-day  period. The parties hereto further agree that
if any of the rules of the AAA are  contrary to or in  conflict  with any of the
time periods provided for hereunder, or with any other aspect of the matters set
forth in this  Section  6.4,  that such  rules  shall be  modified  in  respects
necessary to accord with the provisions of this Section 6.4 (and the arbitrators
shall be so instructed by the parties).

         The  arbitrators  shall  base  their  decision  on the  terms  of  this
Agreement and  applicable  law and judicial  precedent in the State of New York,
and shall  render  their  decision  in writing  and  include in such  decision a
statement of the finding of fact and  conclusions of law upon which the decision
is based. Each party agrees to cooperate fully with the arbitrator(s) to resolve
any controversy,  claim, or dispute.  The arbitrators  shall not be empowered to
award punitive damages or damages in excess of actual damages.

         6.5      Damages: Specific Performance.

         (a) In the event of a material  breach by Owner of Owner's  obligations
hereunder,  Programmer shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against Owner.
The parties recognize, however, that given the unique nature of the Stations and
this  Agreement,  monetary  damages  alone will not be  adequate  to  compensate
Programmer  for any injury  resulting  from  Owner's  breach.  Programmer  shall
therefore  be  entitled,  as an  alternative  to the  right to seek and  collect

                                       17

<PAGE>



monetary damages, to obtain specific performance of the terms of this Agreement.

         (b) In the event of a material  breach by Programmer of its obligations
hereunder, Owner shall be entitled to seek monetary damages against Programmer.

         SECTION 7     REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, AND COVENANTS.

         7.1  Representations,   Warranties,   and  Covenants  of  Owner.  Owner
represents, warrants, and covenants that:

                  (a) Owner is legally qualified,  empowered,  and authorized to
enter into this  Agreement,  and that the  execution,  delivery and  performance
hereof shall not constitute a breach or violation of any agreement,  contract or
other obligation to which Owner is subject or by which Owner is bound.

                  (b) Owner is now, and for so long as this  Agreement  shall be
in effect, will be the holder of the FCC Licenses necessary for the operation of
WPTZ and WNNE as then being operated.

                  (c)  Owner  does  not  know  of  any  current  or  prospective
governmental  investigation  having a material  adverse  effect on the Stations,
their properties or business.

                  (d) As of this date,  Owner  does not know of any facts  which
would cause the Commission to refuse to renew the FCC Licenses.

                  (e) Owner shall not take any action or omit to take any action
which  would have a  materially  adverse  impact upon  Owner,  the  Assets,  the
Stations or upon Owner's ability to perform this Agreement.

                  (f) This Agreement  constitutes  the legal,  valid and binding
obligation of Owner,  enforceable  in accordance  with its terms,  except to the
extent  that  the  enforcement

                                       18

<PAGE>



thereof  may  be  limited  by  (i)   bankruptcy,   insolvency,   reorganization,
moratorium,  or similar law affecting  creditors' rights and remedies generally,
and (ii) general  principles of equity  (regardless  of whether  enforcement  is
sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

         7.2 Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Programmer. Programmer
represents, warrants, and covenants that:

                  (a) Programmer is legally qualified, empowered, and authorized
to enter into this Agreement,  and that the execution,  delivery and performance
hereof shall not constitute a breach or violation of any agreement,  contract or
other obligation to which Programmer is subject or by which Programmer is bound.

                  (b) This Agreement  constitutes  the legal,  valid and binding
obligation of Programmer,  enforceable in accordance  with its terms,  except to
the extent  that the  enforcement  thereof  may be  limited  by (i)  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganizations,  moratorium or similar laws  affecting  creditors'
rights and remedies generally, and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity).

         SECTION 8:     MISCELLANEOUS.

         8.1  Assignment.  This  Agreement  shall not be  assigned  by any party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably  withheld,  except that Programmer may assign its rights and
interests  hereunder to any reputable  broadcasting  entity  provided,  that (a)
Programmer  gives  Owner  written  notice  of  any  such  assignment;  (b)  such
assignment shall not relieve Programmer of any of its obligations or liabilities
hereunder; and (c) such assignment would not violate any applicable laws, rules,
regulations  or  policies  of  any  applicable  governmental  authority.  It  is
understood  and agreed that

                                       19

<PAGE>



nothing  herein  shall be deemed to expand the rights  granted  hereunder to any
permitted  assignee,  which  rights  shall be in  combination  with,  and not in
addition to, the rights of Programmer.  This  Agreement  shall be binding on the
parties' respective heirs and permitted assigns.

         8.2 Entire Agreement; Amendments. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement  between the parties  hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and, except for the Asset Purchase  Agreement,  and documents delivered pursuant
thereto,  supersedes any and all prior agreements,  broadcasting commitments, or
any other  understandings  between  Programmer  and Owner  with  respect to such
subject matter. No provision of this Agreement shall be changed or modified, nor
shall this  Agreement be discharged in whole or in part,  except by an agreement
in  writing  signed by the  party  against  whom the  change,  modification,  or
discharge  is claimed or sought to be  enforced,  nor shall any waiver of any of
the  conditions or provisions of this  Agreement be effective and binding unless
such waiver shall be in writing and signed by the party  against whom the waiver
is asserted, and no waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to
be a waiver  of any  preceding  or  succeeding  breach  of the same or any other
provision.

         8.3 Further  Assurances.  Owner and Programmer  shall use  commercially
reasonable  efforts  in  the  performance  and  fulfillment  of  the  terms  and
conditions  of this  Agreement  in  effectuating  the intent of such  parties as
expressed   under  this   Agreement.   From  time  to  time,   without   further
consideration,  Owner and  Programmer  shall  execute  and  deliver  such  other
documents  and take such other  actions as either  party hereto  reasonably  may
request to effectuate such intent.

         8.4  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be  signed  in any  number  of
counterparts  with the same effect as if the signatures to each such counterpart
were upon the same instrument.

                                   MONTHLY FEE

         During the first nine (9) months of this  Agreement,  Programmer  shall
pay to Owner a monthly  fee equal to Thirteen  Thousand  Three  Hundred  Dollars
($13,300)  plus the  salaries of the two  employees  retained  by Owner.  If the
Closing  under the Asset  Purchase  Agreement  has not occurred  within nine (9)
months of the date of this  Agreement,  the monthly fee from and after such date
shall increase to Twenty Thousand Dollars ($20,000) plus the salaries of the two
employees  retained  by Owner;  provided,  however,  the  monthly  fee shall not
increase if the reason that the Closing has not  occurred by such nine (9) month
date is  because  of a breach or  default  by Owner  under  the  Asset  Purchase
Agreement.

                 BROADCAST STATION PROGRAMMING POLICY STATEMENT

                   I. No Plugola or Payola. Except for commercial messages aired
              in  compliance  with 47 C.F.R.  ss.73.1212,  Programmer  shall not
              receive any consideration in money, goods, services, or otherwise,
              directly or indirectly  (including to relatives)  from any persons
              or  company  for the  presentation  of any  programming  over  the
              Stations  without  reporting the same to Owner's Station  Manager.
              The commercial  mention of any business activity or "plug" for any
              commercial,  professional, or other related endeavor, except where
              contained  in  an  actual  commercial  message  of a  sponsor,  is
              prohibited.

                   II. No Lotteries.  Announcements giving any information about
              lotteries or games  prohibited by applicable  federal or state law
              or regulation are prohibited.

                   III. Election  Procedures.  At least fifteen (15) days before
              the start of any primary or  election  campaign,  Programmer  will
              clear with  Owner's  Station  Manager  the rates  Programmer  will
              charge for the time to be sold for use by qualified candidates for
              the public office and/or their supporters to make certain that the
              rates  charged  are in  conformance  with  applicable  law and the
              Stations' policies.

                   IV. Required Announcements. Programmer shall broadcast (i) an
              announcement  in a form  satisfactory to Owner at the beginning of

                                       26

<PAGE>



              each  hour  to   identify   the   Stations   and  (ii)  any  other
              announcements that may be required by law or regulation.

                   V. No Illegal  Announcements.  No  announcements or promotion
              prohibited by applicable federal, state law or regulation shall be
              made over the Stations.  Any game,  contest, or promotion relating
              to or to be presented  over the Stations  must be fully stated and
              explained  in advance to Owner,  which  reserves  the right in its
              sole discretion to reject any game, contest, or promotion.

                   VI.  Owner  Discretion  Paramount.  In  accordance  with  the
              Owner's  responsibility  under the  Communications Act of 1934, as
              amended,   and  the  Rules   and   Regulations   of  the   Federal
              Communications  Commission,  Owner reserves the right to reject or
              terminate  any  advertising  proposed  to be  presented  or  being
              presented over the Stations which is in conflict with  established
              policies  of the  Stations  or which  in  Owner's  or its  Station
              Manager's  reasonable  judgment  would be  contrary  to the public
              interest.

         Owner may waive any of the foregoing regulations in specific instances,
if, in its opinion,  the Stations will remain in compliance  with all applicable
laws, rules, regulations and policies and broadcasting in the public interest is
served.  In  any  case  where  questions  of  policy  or  interpretation  arise,
Programmer  should  submit  the same to Owner for  decision  before  making  any
commitments in connection therewith.

and  applicable  rules,  regulations  and  policies  of the FCC ("FCC  Rules and
Regulations").  All FCC Licenses, a true and complete list of which is set forth
on  Schedule  5.2g,  and true and  complete  copies  of each of which  have been
delivered to  Purchaser,  are valid and in full force and effect.  Except as set
forth on Schedule 5.2g, no application,  action or proceeding is pending for the
renewal  or  modification  of any of the  FCC  Licenses  and,  to the  Company's
Knowledge,  there  is not now  before  the FCC any  investigation  or  complaint
against the Company or relating to the Station,  the  unfavorable  resolution of
which would impair the  qualifications  of the Company to hold any FCC Licenses.
Except as set forth on Schedule 5.2g, there is no proceeding  pending before the
FCC,  and the Company  has  received  no notice of  violation  from the FCC with
respect to the Station.  Except as set forth on Schedule  5.2g,  the Company has
received no order or notice of violation issued by any governmental entity which
permits  revocation,  adverse  modification  or  termination of


                                       8

<PAGE>



any FCC License.  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.2g, none of the FCC Licenses
or other licenses is subject to any  restriction or condition which requires any
material change in the operation of the Station as currently  operated.  The FCC
Licenses  listed  in  Schedule  5.2g are  currently  in  effect  and,  except as
disclosed on the Schedules, are not subject to any liens, or other encumbrances.
No license  renewal  applications  are  pending  with  respect to any of the FCC
Licenses,  but the  Company  must file an  application  for  renewal  of the FCC
Licenses on or before  December 1, 1997. As of the date hereof,  the Company has
received  no notice or other  information  to the effect  that the FCC would not
renew the FCC  Licenses in the  ordinary  course for a full license term without
any adverse conditions,  upon the timely filing of appropriate  applications and
payment of the  required  filing  fee.  As of the date  hereof,  the Company has
received  no notice or other  information  to the effect  that the FCC would not
grant the FCC Application in the ordinary course without any adverse conditions.
All documents required by 47 C.F.R.  Section 73.3526 to be kept in the Station's
public  inspection files are in such file, other than documents,  the absence of
which either  individually or in the aggregate would not have a material adverse
effect on the renewal of the FCC Licenses or the Company's ability to consummate
the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  and  such  file  will  be
maintained  in proper  order and  complete up to and  through the Closing  Date,
except for any such immaterial documents.

or charge and does not interfere with the rights of others.  Except as set forth
on Schedule  5.2h,  the Company has not received  any written  notice or written
claim that any such Intellectual Property is not valid or enforceable, or of any
infringement  upon  or  conflict  with  any  patent,  trademark,  service  mark,
copyright or trade name of any third party by the  Company.  Except as set forth
on Schedule  5.2h, the Company has not given any notice of  infringement  to any
third  party  with  respect  to  any  of the  Intellectual  Property  and to the
Company's Knowledge no such infringement exists.

         i. EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLANS.  With respect,  as  applicable,  to Benefit
Plans and Benefit Arrangements:

                     (i)  Schedule  5.2i  completely  and  accurately  lists all
Company Plans and Company Benefit  Arrangements and specifically  identifies any
that are  Qualified  Plans.  Neither  the Company  nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has
maintained or contributed to any Qualified  Plans since October 18, 1991,  other
than the IDS Financial  Services Inc. Defined  Contribution  Prototype Plan (the
"401(k)  Plan").  The 401(k) Plan is qualified in form and operation  under Code
Section  401(a) and has a  currently  applicable  determination  letter


                                       9

<PAGE>



from the Internal  Revenue  Service,  and its trust is exempt under Code Section
501, and nothing has occurred with respect to the 401(k) Plan or such trust that
could cause the loss of such qualification or exemption or the imposition of any
material  liability,  lien,  penalty, or tax under ERISA or the Code, other than
the obligation to make contributions in accordance with the 401(k) Plan.

                     (ii) Each Company Plan and each Company Benefit Arrangement
has been maintained in accordance  with its  constituent  documents and with all
applicable  provisions of the Code,  ERISA and other  domestic and foreign laws,
including  federal,  state, and foreign  securities laws and all laws respecting
reporting and disclosure, in each case in all material respects. No Company Plan
holds employer securities.

                     (iii) The Company  neither  has nor has ever had any  ERISA
Affiliates.  The Company has never sponsored,  maintained,  or had any liability
(direct or  indirect,  actual or  contingent)  with  respect to any Benefit Plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, nor has the Company ever made or been obligated to
make  or  reimbursed  or been  obligated  to  reimburse  another  employer  for,
contributions to any multi-employer  plan (as defined in ERISA,  Section 3(37)).
The Company has no liability  (whether  actual,  contingent or  otherwise)  with
respect to any Benefit Plan or Benefit Arrangement that is not a Company Benefit
Plan or Arrangement.

                     (iv)  No  claims or lawsuits  (other than  routine  benefit
claims)  have been  asserted,  instituted  or, to the  knowledge of the Company,
threatened  by,  against,  or relating to any  Company  Plan or Company  Benefit
Arrangement, and the Company does not have knowledge of any fact that could form
the basis for any  material  liability  of the  Company in the event of any such
claim or lawsuit. The Company has not received any notice that the Company Plans
and Company Benefit  Arrangements  are presently under audit or examination (and
has not received notice of a potential audit or examination by any  governmental
authority,  or of any matters  pending with respect to the 401(k) Plan under any
governmental compliance programs).

                     (v)  No  Company  Plan  or  Company   Benefit   Arrangement
contains  any  provision  or is  subject  to any law that would give rise to any
vesting of benefits, severance, termination, or other payments or liabilities as
a result  of the  transactions  this  Agreement  contemplates,  and,  except  as
disclosed  herein or in the Schedule  5.2i, the Company has not declared or paid
any bonus or other  incentive  compensation  or established  any severance plan,
program,  or arrangement in contemplation  of the  transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement.

                     (vi) With respect to each Company Plan,  there have been no
violations  of


                                       10

<PAGE>



Code Section 4975 or ERISA  Sections  404 or 406 as to which  successful  claims
would result in any material liability for the Company or any Person required to
be indemnified by it.

                     (vii) The Company has made all  required  contributions  to
the Company Plan as of the last day of each plan's most recent fiscal year,  all
benefits accrued under any unfunded Company Plan or Company Benefit  Arrangement
will have been paid,  accrued,  or otherwise  adequately  reserved in accordance
with  generally  accepted  accounting  principles  as of July 31, 1997;  and all
monies withheld from employee  paychecks with respect to Company Plans have been
transferred to the  appropriate  plan within the timing required by governmental
regulations.

                     (viii) The Company has complied  in  all  material respects
with the health  continuation rules of Code Sections 4980B (and its predecessor)
and with Code Section  5000.  No employee or former  employee of the Company nor
dependent  of any such  employee  or  former  employee  is,  by  reason  of such
employee's  or former  employee's  employment,  entitled to receive any benefits
subject to reporting under Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 106,
other than as required by Code Section 4980B or other applicable law.

                     (ix) There   are   no  contracts,   agreements,   plans  or
arrangements  covering  any  employee or former  employee  of the Company  that,
individually or  collectively,  could give rise to the payment of any amount (or
portion  thereof)  that,  under Code Sections  280G,  404 or 162(m) would not be
deductible when paid.

         j. LABOR. With respect to employees of the Company:

                     (i)  The  Company  is and  has  been in  compliance  in all
material respects with all applicable laws respecting  employment and employment
practices,  terms and  conditions of employment  and wages and hours,  including
without limitation any such laws respecting employment discrimination,  workers'
compensation,  family and medical leave, the Immigration Reform and Control Act,
and occupational safety and health requirements,  and has not and is not engaged
in any unfair labor practice.

                     (ii) The  employees  of the  Company are not and have never
been  represented  by any  labor  union in  connection  with  employment  by the
Company, and no collective bargaining agreement is binding and in force against,
or currently being negotiated by, the Company.  To the Company's  knowledge,  no
labor representation organization effort currently exists nor has there been any
such activity within the past three years.

                     (iv) Since  December 31, 1996,  no employee of the Company,
or group of employees, the loss of whom would have significant adverse effect on
the business of the Company,  has notified the Company of his or their intent to
(A) terminate his or their relationship with the Company, or (B) make any demand
for material  payments or  modifications of his or their  arrangements  with the
Company.

                     (v)  The  Company  has  received no notice of any charge or

by the Company  (or,  to its  knowledge)  any other  party to any such  Material
Contract or which would permit termination, modification or acceleration. Except
as disclosed  in Schedule  5.21,  the Company has not received  notice (or other

violate any of the  provisions  of the articles of  incorporation  or by-laws of
Purchaser,  (b) violate any  provision of applicable  law,  rule or  regulation,
which violation would prevent or interfere with  Purchaser's  ability to perform
hereunder,  or (c)  conflict  with or result  in a breach  of, or give rise to a
right of termination of, or accelerate the performance  required by the terms of
any  judgment,  court  order or consent  decree,  or any  agreement,  indenture,
mortgage or instrument to which Purchaser is a party or to which its property is
subject, or constitute a default thereunder, except where such conflict, breach,
right of termination,  acceleration or default would not have a material adverse
effect on the  business  or  financial  condition  of  Purchaser  or  prevent or
materially interfere with Purchaser's ability to perform hereunder.

         6.4. CONSENTS. Except (i) as set forth on Schedule 6.4 hereto, (ii) for

otherwise qualified to be the licensee of, acquire,  own and operate the Station
under the  Communications  Act, and the rules,  regulations  and policies of the
FCC.  Purchaser knows of no fact that would, under existing law and the existing
rules, regulations,  policies and procedures of the FCC (a) disqualify Purchaser
as a transferee of the FCC Licenses or as the owner and operator of the Station,
or (b) cause the FCC to fail to approve in a timely


                                       18

requested or required in connection with the  consummation  of the  transactions
contemplated hereby.

any additional shares of its capital stock except as required by the exercise of
options outstanding on the date hereof as described in Annex 2 or any securities
or obligations  convertible or exchangeable  into shares of its capital stock or
issue or grant any option,  warrant or other right to purchase any shares of its
capital stock;

               (f) The Company will not incur,  or agree to incur,  any debt for
borrowed money other than draws under the Company's  existing  revolving  credit
agreement;

               (g) The Company will not change its historic practices concerning
the payment of accounts payable;

               (h) The Company will not declare, issue, or otherwise approve the
payment of dividends of any kind in respect of the Stock or redeem,  purchase or
acquire any of its capital stock;

               (j) Except as stated in Schedule  9.3(j) and except as  otherwise
agreed to by  Purchaser,  the  Company  will not  permit  any  increases  in the
compensation of any of the employees of the Station except as required by law or
existing  contract  or  agreement  or enter  into or amend any  Company  Plan or
Company Benefit Arrangement;

               (k) The  Company  shall not enter into or renew any  contract  or
commitment  relating to the Station or the assets of the  Station,  or incur any
obligation  that will be  binding  on  Purchaser  after  Closing,  except in the
ordinary  course of business;  provided that (i) except for time sales contracts
for cash at  prevailing  rates  for a term not  exceeding  twelve  (12)  months,
Sellers  shall not enter  into time  sales  agreement  that will be  binding  on
Purchaser  after  Closing;  and (ii) the Company  shall not enter into,  modify,
amend, renew, or change any contract with respect to programming for the Station
for any period after the Closing Date (each a  Programming  Action)  without the
prior approval of Purchaser which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.  For purposes of clause (ii) above,  Sellers  acknowledge that it shall
not be  unreasonable  for  Purchaser  to withhold  its consent to approve of any
Programming  Action  where  Purchaser,  acting in good  faith,  has  advised the
Company in writing  that  Purchaser  has reason to conclude  that it can acquire
such programming on better terms. Purchaser acknowledges that any failure of the
Company  or Sellers to take any  Programming  Action as a result of  Purchaser's
withholding  consent shall not be a breach of any provision of this Agreement by
Sellers and shall not be a failure to satisfy any  condition  to be satisfied by
the Company or Sellers hereunder;

               (l) The Company  shall not enter into any  transactions  with any
Affiliate of the Company or any Seller that will be binding upon  Purchaser,  or
the Station following the Closing Date;

               (m) The Company shall use all commercially  reasonable efforts to
maintain  the assets of the Station or  replacements  thereof in good  operating
condition and adequate repair;

               (n) The Company  shall,  in connection  with the operation of the
Station, make expenditures  materially consistent with the estimates of expenses
set forth in the Company's operating budget and, including,  without limitation,
the Company shall make such  materially  consistent  expenditures  in respect to
promotional,  programming  and  engineering  activities for the Station (and any
employee  expenditures related to such activities) for any period covered by the
current operating budget of the Station;


                                       24

<PAGE>



               (o) The  Company  shall  not  make or  change  any  material  Tax
election,  amend any Tax Return, or take or omit to take any other action not in
the ordinary  course of business and  consistent  with past  practice that would
have the effect of increasing  any Taxes of Purchaser or any of its  Affiliates,
or any Taxes of the Company.

               (p) The Company  shall file all Tax Returns  when due;  provided,
however,  that the  Company  shall  not file any  material  Tax  Return  without
providing  Purchaser  with  reasonable  opportunity to review and consent to the
filing of such Tax Return,  which  consent  will not be  unreasonably  withheld;
provided  further,  however,  that the  Company  shall  not be in breach of this
Section  9.3(p) if Purchaser has not consented to such filing by the fifth (5th)
Business Day preceding the due date  (including  any extension  periods) of such
filing.

         9.4.  H-S-R  ACT.  Each of  Purchaser  and  Sellers  shall,  within ten
Business  Days  following  the date  hereof,  file duly  completed  and executed
Pre-Merger  Notification  and Report  Forms as required  under the H-S-R Act and
shall  otherwise use their  respective  best efforts to comply promptly with any
requests  made by the Federal  Trade  Commission  or the  Department  of Justice
pursuant to the H-S-R Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder.  All filing
fees and other similar  payments in connection with the H-S-R Act shall be split
equally by Purchaser and the Company.

         9.5.  FCC APPLICATION.

               (a) Purchaser  and Sellers  jointly  shall,  within five Business
Days following the date hereof, file (or cause to be filed) with the FCC the FCC
Application;  provided that the parties shall  cooperate  with each other in the
preparation  of the FCC  Application  and  shall  in good  faith  and  with  due
diligence take all reasonable  steps necessary to expedite the processing of the
FCC  Application  and to secure such consents or approvals as  expeditiously  as
practicable.  If the Closing  shall not have  occurred for any reason within the
initial   effective  periods  of  the  granting  of  FCC  approval  of  the  FCC
Application, and no party shall have terminated this Agreement under Section 14,
the parties  shall  jointly  request and use their  respective  best  efforts to
obtain one or more extensions of the effective  periods of such grants. No party
shall  knowingly  take,  or fail to take,  any  action  of which  the  intent or
reasonably  anticipated  consequence  would  be to  cause  the FCC not to  grant
approval of the FCC Application.

                  (b)  Sellers  shall  cause the  Company to publish the notices
required  by the FCC Rules and  Regulations  relative  to the  filing of the FCC
Application. Copies of all applications, documents and papers filed with the FCC
after the date hereof and prior to the Closing,  or filed after the Closing with
respect to the transaction  under this Agreement,  by


                                       25

<PAGE>

Purchaser or Sellers shall be mailed to the other simultaneously with the filing
of the same with the FCC or as soon as practicable thereafter. Each of Purchaser
and the Company  shall bear its own costs and expenses  (including  the fees and
disbursements  of its counsel) in connection with the preparation of the portion
of the application to be prepared by it and in connection with the processing of
that  application.  All filing and grant fees, if any, paid to the FCC, shall be
split equally by Purchaser and the Company. None of the information contained in
any  filing  made by  Purchaser  or  Sellers  with the FCC with  respect  to the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall contain any untrue statement of
a material fact.

         9.6. BOOKS AND RECORDS.  Following the Closing,  Purchaser shall permit
each Seller (a) to have reasonable  access to the books and records of Purchaser
and those retained or maintained by the Company relating to the operation of the
Business  prior to the  Closing or after the  Closing  to the extent  related to
transactions  or  events  occurring  prior  to the  Closing,  and  (b)  to  have
reasonable   access  to  employees  of  the  Company  and  Purchaser  to  obtain
information  relating to such matters.  Purchaser  shall maintain such books and
records for a period of three (3) years following the Closing.

         9.7.  CONTRACTUAL  OBLIGATIONS.  At all times after Closing,  Purchaser
shall cause the Company to:

               (a) honor all of the Company's contractual  obligations disclosed
herein  (including,  without  limitation,  those under  employment  arrangements
disclosed  herein or in any Schedule  hereto),  in each case in accordance  with
their respective terms and conditions;

               (b)  continue,  for at least  ninety  (90) days after the Closing
Date, the  employment of each person who is employed by the Company  immediately
prior to  Closing,  in each  case  under  terms  and  conditions  of  employment
(including, without limitation,  compensation and benefits as such are disclosed
herein or in any  Schedule  hereto)  that are not less  favorable to such person
than those  existing  immediately  prior to  Closing,  provided,  however,  that
nothing  in this  clause  (b) shall  require  the  continued  employment  of the
Station's general manager or general sales manager,  except to the extent of any
such contractual obligations disclosed herein or in any Schedule hereto.

         9.8. CONTROL OF STATIONS.  From the date hereof until the Closing Date,
subject  to the  express  provisions  of this  Agreement,  Purchaser  shall  not
directly  or  indirectly  control,  supervise  or direct  the  operation  of the
Station.

         9.9. ASSUMPTION OF BROKERAGE AMOUNTS.  At the Closing,  Purchaser shall
pay the


                                       26

<PAGE>


brokerage  fees and expenses due from the Company to Dain Bosworth  Incorporated
in accordance  with the engagement  letter dated November 12, 1996,  executed by
the Company as set forth on Schedule 9.9 hereto.

         9.10. INTERRUPTION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION.

               (a) In the event of any loss, damage or impairment,  confiscation
or  condemnation  of any of the assets of the Station prior to the completion of
the Closing that materially interferes with the normal operation of the Station,
the Company shall notify  Purchaser of same in writing  immediately,  specifying
with particularity the loss, damage or impairment,  confiscation or condemnation
incurred,  the cause  thereof,  if known or  reasonably  ascertainable,  and the
insurance  coverage.  The  Company  shall apply the  proceeds  of any  insurance
policy,  judgment or award with respect thereto and take such other commercially
reasonable  actions,  as determined in its sole discretion,  as are necessary to
repair,  replace or restore such assets of the Station to their prior  condition
as soon as possible  after such loss,  damages or  impairment,  confiscation  or
condemnation.

               (b) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction of
the assets of the Station, the regular broadcast  transmission of the Station in
the  normal  and  usual  manner  is  interrupted  for a period  of  twelve  (12)
continuous  hours or more,  the Company shall give prompt written notice thereof
to  Purchaser.  If on the Closing  Date,  due to damages or  destruction  of the
assets of the Station the regular  broadcast  transmission of the Station in the
normal and usual manner is interrupted such that the regular broadcast signal of
such Station  (including  its  effective  radiated  power) is  diminished in any
material  respect,  then (i) the Company shall  immediately  give written notice
thereof  to  Purchaser;  and (ii)  either,  and both of, the  Sellers'  Agent or
Purchaser shall have the right, by giving prompt written notice to the other, to
postpone the Closing Date for a period of up to ninety (90) days.

               (c) In the event the Station's normal and usual  transmission has
not been resumed by the Closing Date as postponed pursuant to section (b) above,
either Purchaser or Sellers' Agent,  may pursuant to Section 14.1(e),  terminate
this  Agreement  by  written  notice to the  other  party.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  however,  Purchaser  may,  at its  option,  proceed  to  close  this
Agreement and complete the  restoration and replacement of any damaged assets of
the Station  after the Closing  Date,  in which  event  Sellers  shall cause the
Company  to deliver  or assign to  Purchaser  all  insurance  or other  proceeds
received in connection  therewith to the extent such proceeds are received by or
payable to the Company and have not  therefore  been used in or committed to the
restoration  or  replacement  of the  assets  but  Sellers  shall  have no other
liability or obligation to 


                                       27
<PAGE>

Purchaser in connection therewith.

               (d) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction of
the assets the regular  broadcast  transmission of the Station in the normal and
usual manner is interrupted  for a period of seven (7) continuous  days or more,
Sellers shall give prompt written notice thereof (the "Interruption  Notice") to
Purchaser.  Upon receipt of the  Interruption  Notice,  Purchaser shall have the
right,  in its sole and absolute  discretion,  by giving prompt  written  notice
thereof to Sellers within two (2) Business Days of the date of the  Interruption
Notice, to terminate this Agreement with the effect specified in Section 14.2(a)
hereof.


                                   SECTION 10

                                 INDEMNIFICATION
                                 ---------------

         10.1. INDEMNIFICATION OF PURCHASER BY SELLERS.

               (a) Subject to Section 10.3 hereof,  each Seller,  severally  but
not jointly,  shall  indemnify and hold Purchaser  harmless from and against any
and all Losses,  however incurred,  which arise out of or result from any breach
by such Seller of any  representation or warranty of such Seller as to itself or
himself, in Section 5.1 of this Agreement.

               (b) Subject to Section 10.3  hereof,  Sellers  shall  jointly and
severally  indemnify  and hold  Purchaser  harmless from and against any and all
Losses, howsoever incurred, which arise out of or result from:

                   (i) any breach of any  representation  or warranty of Sellers
set forth in Section  5.2 of this  Agreement  other than any  representation  or
warranty of any Seller set forth in Section 5.1 of this Agreement; or

                   (ii) the material  failure by Sellers to perform any covenant
of Sellers contained herein; or

                   (iii) breaches of other agreements contemplated hereby.


                                       28

<PAGE>



         10.2. INDEMNIFICATION OF SELLERS BY PURCHASER.  Subject to Section 10.3
hereof, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Sellers harmless from and against any
and all Losses, howsoever incurred, which arise out of or result from:

               (a) any breach by Purchaser of any  representation or warranty of
Purchaser set forth in Section 6 of this Agreement;

               (b) the material  failure by Purchaser to perform any covenant of
Purchaser contained herein; or

               (c) breaches of other agreements contemplated hereby.

         10.3.  LIMITATIONS  AND  OTHER  PROVISIONS  REGARDING   INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS.

               (a)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of  Section  10.1  hereof,
Purchaser shall not be entitled to indemnification or to receive indemnification
payments  with  respect  to any  Losses  except  if and to the  extent  that the
aggregate  amount of Losses incurred by Purchaser and its Affiliates to which it
or they would  otherwise  be  entitled to  indemnification  under  Section  10.1
hereof, exceeds $50,000.00.

               (b)  In   determining   the   amount  of  any  Losses  for  which
indemnification  is provided under this Agreement,  such Losses shall be (i) net
of any insurance  recovery made by the indemnified  party,  (ii) reduced to take
into account any net Tax benefit realized by the indemnified  party arising from
the deductibility of such Losses, and (iii) increased to take account of any net
Tax  cost  incurred  by the  indemnified  party  arising  from  the  receipt  of
indemnification  payments hereunder. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall
initially  be made  without  regard to this  paragraph  and shall be  reduced to
reflect any net Tax benefit or  increased to reflect any net Tax cost only after
the indemnified  party has actually  realized such benefit or cost. For purposes
of this  Agreement,  an  indemnified  party  shall be deemed  to have  "actually
realized" a net Tax benefit or net Tax cost to the extent that, and at such time
as, the amount of Taxes payable by such  indemnified  party is (x) reduced below
the amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay
but for the  deductibility  of such Tax or Loss,  and (y)  increased  above  the
amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay but
for the receipt of such  indemnification  payments.  The amount of any reduction
hereunder  shall be  adjusted to reflect any final  determination  (which  shall
include the  execution  of Form 870-AD or  successor  form) with  respect to the
indemnified  party's  liability  for Taxes.  Any indemnity  payments  under this
Agreement


                                       29
<PAGE>

shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
a final  determination  with  respect  to the  indemnified  party  or any of its
affiliates  causes any such  payment not to be treated as an  adjustment  to the
Purchase Price.

               (c) No claim  for  indemnification  for  Losses  shall be made or
available after the first  anniversary of the Closing Date (except to the extent
of any claims made on or before such first anniversary).

               (d) Indemnification pursuant to this Section 10 shall be the sole
and  exclusive  remedy  of  each  party  hereto  with  respect  to  any  Losses,
notwithstanding  that  indemnification may not be available and shall be in lieu
of any and all other  rights  and  remedies  after  the  Closing  Date  (whether
asserted as claims for breach of  contract,  tort  claims,  actions in equity or
otherwise.

               (e) The maximum  aggregate  liability of all Sellers  (including,
without  limitation,  all liability for  indemnification  under this Article 10)
shall not exceed the amount held in the  Indemnification  Escrow,  and Purchaser
shall not (and shall have no right to) proceed  against  any Seller,  other than
the right to proceed against the Indemnification  Escrow to the extent of Losses
incurred  by  Purchaser  for which  Purchaser  is  entitled  to  indemnification
hereunder.

               (f) The terms and conditions of Section 10.3(a) through (e) shall
not be deemed to limit any rights or remedies  Purchaser may have for any act or
acts of fraud by Sellers or any Seller.

         10.4. NOTICE OF CLAIM /DEFENSE OF ACTION.

               (a) An  indemnified  party shall  promptly give the  indemnifying
part(ies)  notice of any matter which an  indemnified  party has  determined has
given or could give rise to a right of  indemnification  under  this  Agreement,
stating  the  nature  and,  if known,  the amount of the  Losses,  and method of
computation  thereof,  all  with  reasonable   particularity  and  containing  a
reference to the  provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right to
indemnification is claimed or arises;  provided that the failure of any party to
give notice  promptly as  required  in this  Section  10.4 shall not relieve any
indemnifying party of its indemnification  obligations except to the extent that
such failure  materially  prejudices the rights of such indemnifying  party. The
indemnified  party  shall give  continuing  notice  promptly  thereafter  of all
developments  coming to the indemnified party's attention  materially  affecting
any matter relating to any indemnification claims.


                                       30

<PAGE>



                  (b)  Except  as  otherwise   provided  in  Section  10.5,  the
obligations and liabilities of an indemnifying  party under this Section 10 with
respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that are subject to the
indemnification  provided  for in this  Section  10,  shall be  governed  by and
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

                       (i) With respect to third party  claims,  promptly  after
receipt by an indemnified  party of notice of the  commencement of any action or
the  presentation  or other  assertion  of any claim which  could  result in any
indemnification  claim pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2 hereof, such indemnified
party shall give prompt  notice  thereof to the  indemnifying  part(ies) and the
indemnifying  part(ies)  shall be  entitled  to  participate  therein or, to the
extent that it shall wish, assume the defense thereof with its own counsel.

                       (ii) If the  indemnifying  part(ies) elects to assume the
defense of any such action or claim,  the  indemnifying  part(ies)  shall not be
liable  to the  indemnified  party  for any fees of other  counsel  or any other
expenses, in each case incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof.

                       (iii) The  indemnifying  part(ies)  shall be  authorized,
without consent of the indemnified party being required, to settle or compromise
any such action or claim,  provided that such settlement or compromise  includes
an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out
of such action or claim.

                       (iv) Whether or not an indemnifying  part(ies)  elects to
assume the defense of any action or claim, the indemnifying  part(ies) shall not
be liable for any  compromise or settlement of any such action or claim effected
without its consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                       (v) The parties agree to cooperate to the fullest  extent
possible in  connection  with any claim for which  indemnification  is or may be
sought under this Agreement, including, without limitation, making available all
witnesses,  pertinent  records,  materials and  information in its possession or
under its  control  relating  thereto as is  reasonably  requested  by the other
party.

         10.5     TAX CONTESTS.

                  (a) If any  party  receives  written  notice  from any  Taxing
Authority  of any Tax  Proceeding  with  respect  to any Tax for which the other
party is obligated to provide  indemnification under this Agreement,  such party
shall give prompt written notice thereof to the other party; provided,  however,
that the  failure  to give such  notice  shall not  affect  the  indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent that the failure to give such


                                       31

<PAGE>



notice materially prejudices the indemnifying party.

                  (b) Sellers,  acting through  Sellers'  Agent,  shall have the
right,  at their own expense,  to control and make all decisions with respect to
any Tax Proceeding relating solely to Taxes of the Company for which Sellers are
liable to indemnify Purchaser;  provided,  that Purchaser and counsel of its own
choosing shall have the right, at Purchaser's own expense,  to participate fully
in all  aspects  of the  prosecution  or  defense  of such Tax  Proceeding;  and
provided  further that Sellers shall not settle any such Tax Proceeding  without
the prior written consent of Purchaser if such settlement could adversely affect
the past, present or future Tax liability of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
or any Tax  liability  of the  Company  for  which  Seller is not  obligated  to
indemnify Purchaser.

                  (c) If Sellers do not exercise  their right to assume  control
of or  participate  in any Tax  Proceeding as provided  under this Section 10.5,
Purchaser may, without waiving any rights to indemnification  hereunder,  defend
or settle  the same in such  manner as it may deem  appropriate  in its sole and
absolute discretion.

                  (d) In the event that the  provisions of this Section 10.5 and
the  provisions of Section 10.4  conflict or otherwise  each apply by the terms,
this Section 10.5 shall exclusively govern all matters concerning Taxes.

<PAGE>

               (b) No  statute,  rule or  regulation,  or order of any  court or
administrative  agency shall be in effect which restrains or prohibits Purchaser
from  consummating  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  and  no  action  or
proceeding shall be pending wherein an unfavorable ruling would affect any right
to own the Stock or the assets of the Station.

               (c) All applicable waiting periods under the H-S-R Act shall have
expired or been terminated.

               (d) All consents  and/or  agreements  identified on Schedule 5.2p

renewal  of the  FCC  Licenses  shall  have  been  obtained.  All  the  material
conditions  contained in the Final Order required to be satisfied on or prior to
the Closing Date shall have been duly satisfied and  performed.  Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  if the consent of the FCC is  conditional  or  qualified in any
manner  that  has  a  material  adverse  effect  on  Purchaser,  Purchaser  may,
nevertheless,   in  its  sole  discretion,   require  the  consummation  of  the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but shall not be required to do so;
provided,  however,  that if the consent of the FCC  includes a condition to the
effect that  Closing  cannot  occur until  after  grant of the  application  for
renewal  of the FCC  Licenses,  such  condition  will  not be  deemed  to have a
material adverse effect on Purchaser.

               (f) Sellers shall have delivered to Purchaser at the Closing each
document required by Section 12.1 hereof.

               (g) The  Company  shall have  delivered  to  Purchaser  a written
statement by a duly  authorized  officer of Richfield  Bank & Trust Co. that the
Existing Debt of the Company does not exceed $2,500,000.00 on the Closing Date.

               (h) Since the date of this  Agreement  through the Closing  Date,
there  shall  not  have  been  any  Material  Adverse  Effect  to the  business,
operations,  properties, assets, or condition of the Company, and no event shall
have occurred or circumstance  exist that would reasonably be expected to result
in such a Material Adverse Effect.

                                   TERMINATION
                                   -----------

         14.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated:

              (a) at any  time  by  mutual  written  consent  of  Purchaser  and
Sellers;

              (b) by either  Purchaser or Sellers,  if the terminating  party is
not in default  or breach in any  material  respect of its or their  obligations
under this Agreement,  if the Closing hereunder has not taken place on or before
twelve (12) calendar months from the date hereof,  except where Closing has been
postponed  pursuant to the provisions of 9.10, in which case the applicable date
shall be upon the  expiration  of the ninety (90) period  referred to in Section
9.10;

              (c) by  Sellers,  if  Sellers  are not in default or breach in any
material  respect  of  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  if  all of the
conditions  in  Section  11.2  have not been  satisfied  or  waived  by the date
scheduled  for the  Closing (as such date may be  postponed  pursuant to Section
9.10);

              (d) by Purchaser,  if Purchaser is not in default or breach in any
material  respect  of  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  if  all of the
conditions  in  Section  11.1  have not been  satisfied  or  waived  by the date
scheduled  for the  Closing (as such date may be  postponed  pursuant to Section
9.10);

              (e) by Purchaser or Sellers, pursuant to Section 9.10.

         14.2 PROCEDURE AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

              (a) In the event of  termination  of this  Agreement  by either or
both Purchaser and/or Sellers  pursuant to Sections 9.10 or 14.1 hereof,  prompt
written  notice  thereof  shall  forthwith  be given to the other party and this
Agreement  shall  terminate and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be
abandoned  without further action by any of the parties  hereto,  but subject to
and without  limiting  any other rights of the parties  specified  herein in the
event a party is in default or breach in any material respect of its


                                       37

<PAGE>

obligations  under this  Agreement.  If this Agreement is terminated as provided
herein,  all  filings,  applications  and  other  submissions  relating  to  the
transactions  contemplated hereby as to which termination has occurred shall, to
the extent  practicable,  be withdrawn  from the agency or other Person to which
such filing is made.

              (b) If this Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Sections 14.1(b),
14.1(d),  or 14.1(e),  the payment made by Purchaser  pursuant to Section 3.1(1)
shall be returned to Purchaser.  In recognition  of the unique  character of the
property to be sold  hereunder,  and the damages which  Purchaser will suffer in
the event of a  termination  of this  Agreement  caused by a breach by  Sellers,
Purchaser shall have the right to pursue all remedies available hereunder at law
or in  equity,  including,  without  limitation,  the  right  to  seek  specific
performance  and/or  monetary  damages.  Sellers  hereby  waive any defense that
Purchaser  has an adequate  remedy at law for such breach of this  Agreement  by
Sellers.

              (c) If this  Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section  14.1(c)
and Purchaser shall be in breach in any material respect of its representations,
warranties,  covenants,  agreements, or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
then and in that  event,  Sellers  shall  have the  right to retain  the  amount
delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.1(1) as liquidated damages,  and as
the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers as a consequence of Purchaser's default
(which  aggregate  amount the  parties  agree is a  reasonable  estimate  of the
damages that will be suffered by Sellers as a result of the default by Purchaser
and does not  constitute  a  penalty),  the  parties  hereby  acknowledging  the
inconvenience and nonfeasability of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy.

              (d) If this Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section  14.1(a),
the payment  made by Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1) shall be returned to
Purchaser.

              (e) In the event of a default by either  party  that  results in a
lawsuit or other proceeding for any remedy  available under this Agreement,  the
prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement  from the other party of its
reasonable legal fees and expenses,  whether incurred in arbitration,  at trial,
or on appeal.

                                 SELLERS' AGENT
                                 --------------

         16.1.  SELLERS' AGENT. Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably  appoints
Linda Rios Brook (herein called the "Sellers' Agent"), or any successor Sellers'
Agent  appointed in  accordance  with this Section 16.1 as his, her or its agent
and  attorney-in-fact  to take any action  required or  permitted to be taken by
such Seller under the terms of this Agreement,  including,  without limiting the
generality  of  the  foregoing,   the  payment  of  expenses   relating  to  the
transactions  contemplated by the Agreement,  and the right to waive,  modify or
amend  any of the  terms  of  this  Agreement  in any  respect,  whether  or not
material,  and agrees to be bound by any and all actions  taken by the  Sellers'
Agent on his or its behalf.  In the event of the death or incapacity of Sellers'
Agent,  such person  shall be replaced by Miles J.  Kennedy  (automatically  and
without any action by any Seller) who shall continue in that capacity. If at any
time,  neither of the persons  named above is serving as  Sellers'  Agent,  then
Sellers'  Agent  shall be such  person  as may be  named as such in a notice  to
Purchaser,  executed  by Sellers  holding  (or,  if such time is after  Closing,
formerly  holding)  more than 50% of all shares of Stock  listed on Annex 2. The
Sellers agree  jointly and  severally to indemnify  the Sellers'  Agent from and
against and in respect of any and all liabilities,  damages,  claims, costs, and
expenses,  including,  but not limited to attorneys' fees, arising out of or due
to any  action  as the  Sellers'  Agent  and any and all  actions,  proceedings,
demands,  assessments,  or judgments,  costs, and expenses  incidental  thereto,
except to the extent that the same result from bad faith or gross  negligence on
the part of the Sellers' Agent.  Purchaser shall be entitled to rely exclusively
upon any communications given by the Sellers' Agent on behalf of any Seller, and
shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken in reliance  upon any


                                       40

<PAGE>

such  communications  from the Sellers'  Agent.  Purchaser  shall be entitled to
disregard any notices or communications given or made by Sellers unless given or
made through the Sellers' Agent.

                                  -------------

         17.1.  HEADINGS.  The headings contained in this Agreement  (including,
but not limited to, the titles of the Schedules  and Exhibits  hereto) have been
inserted for the  convenience  of reference  only, and neither such headings nor
the placement of any term hereof under any  particular  heading shall in any way
restrict  or modify  any of the terms or  provisions  hereof.  Terms used in the
singular  shall be read in the  plural,  and vice  versa,  and terms used in the
masculine gender shall be read in the feminine or neuter gender when the context
so requires.

         17.2.  SCHEDULES  AND  EXHIBITS.  All  Schedules,  Annexes and Exhibits
attached to this  Agreement  constitute an integral part of this Agreement as if
fully rewritten herein.

         17.3. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in two
(2) or more counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same document.

         17.4.  ENTIRE  AGREEMENT.  This  Agreement,  the  Annexes,   Schedules,
Exhibits,   and  other  documents  to  be  delivered  hereunder  and  thereunder
constitute  the entire  understanding  and agreement  between the parties hereto
concerning the subject matter hereof.  All negotiations and writings between the
parties hereto are merged into this Agreement, and there are no representations,
warranties,  covenants,  understandings,  or agreements,  oral or otherwise,  in
relation thereto between the parties other than those incorporated  herein or to
be delivered hereunder.

         17.5. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is to be delivered in and should be
construed in  accordance  with and governed by the laws of the State of Maryland
without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.

         17.7.  SUCCESSORS  AND ASSIGNS.  Neither this  Agreement nor any of the
rights  and   obligations   hereunder  shall  be  assigned,   delegated,   sold,
transferred,  sublicensed,  or  otherwise  disposed  of by  operation  of law or
otherwise,  without  the prior  written  consent  of each of the  other  parties
hereto; provided,  however, that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder  to one or more  subsidiaries  so long as Purchaser is not relieved of
its obligations  hereunder.  In the event of such permitted  assignment or other
transfer,  all of the  rights,  obligations,  liabilities,  and other  terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be  enforceable  by and against,  the  respective  successors and assigns of the
parties hereto, whether so expressed or not.

         17.8.  WAIVER.  Any waiver of any  provision  hereof (or in any related
document or  instrument)  shall not be effective  unless made expressly and in a
writing  executed in the name of the party sought to be charged.  The failure of
any party to insist, in any one or more instances,  on performance of any of the
terms or  conditions  of this  Agreement  shall not be  construed as a waiver or
relinquishment of any rights granted  hereunder or of the future  performance of
any such term, covenant,  or condition,  but the obligations of the parties with
respect hereto shall continue in full force and effect.

         17.9.  SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Agreement  shall be deemed
severable,  and if any  part  of any  provision  is held  to be  illegal,  void,
voidable,  invalid,  nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or
as to any party, for any reason, such provision may be changed,  consistent with
the intent of the parties hereto, to the extent reasonably necessary to make the
provision,  as so  changed,  legal,  valid,  binding,  and  enforceable.  If any
provision of this  Agreement  is held to be illegal,  void,  voidable,  invalid,
nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or as to any party, for
any reason,  and if such provision cannot be changed  consistent with the intent
of the parties hereto to make it fully legal,  valid,  binding and  enforceable,
then such provisions  shall be stricken from this  Agreement,  and the remaining
provisions of this Agreement  shall not in any way be affected or impaired,  but
shall remain in full force and effect.

         17.10.  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  From the  date of this  Agreement,  all  public
announcements relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
will be made only as agreed  upon  jointly by the  parties  hereto,  except that
nothing  herein shall prevent any Seller or any  Affiliate  thereof or Purchaser
from making any disclosure in connection with the  transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement if (and to the extent)  required by applicable law as a result of
its, or its Affiliate's,  being a public company,  provided that prior notice of
such disclosure is given to the other party hereto.

         17.11.  SPECIFIC  PERFORMANCE.  Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser will
have no adequate  remedy at law if Sellers fail to perform  their  obligation to
consummate the sale of Stock contemplated  under this Agreement.  In such event,
Purchaser  shall have the right,  in addition to any other rights or remedies it
may have, to specific performance of this Agreement.

         17.12  BULK  TRANSFERS.  Purchaser  hereby  waives  compliance  for the
provisions   of  any   applicable   bulk   transfer  laws  subject  to  Sellers'
indemnification as a result of such failure to comply.

         17.13 THIRD PARTY  BENEFICIARIES.  Nothing  expressed or referred to in

                  (ii) all  furniture,  fixtures  and  equipment  located at the

                  (v) subject to the terms and conditions of the Indemnification

of MMP;

                  (vi) the names "Max Media," "Max  Television," "Max Radio" and
"Max Media Properties".

         Any distribution of Excluded Assets by MMP will be made pro rata to the
holders of Membership Units in MMP unless otherwise agreed by Purchaser.

              (b)  Notwithstanding  anything to the  contrary in Section  2.2(a)
above,  the  Company,  MTR and MMP shall  each  retain  an amount of cash,  cash
equivalents  and other  cash items  that are  sufficient  to cover and pay their
respective  Closing Date Liabilities.  For purposes of this Agreement,  the term
"Closing Date  Liabilities"  shall mean the liabilities of the Company,  MTR and
MMP (other than for Funded Debt,  liabilities  with respect to program  contract
liabilities  accruing  after the Closing  Date and  liabilities  with respect to
trade and barter  obligations  arising  after the Closing  Date)  whether or not
disclosed on any Schedule  hereto (A) as of the Closing Date; (B) for operations
prior to the Closing Date; and (C) for all  liabilities  of any kind  whatsoever
under that certain  Mutual  Release dated as of January 1, 1997 and that certain
Settlement Agreement dated as of January 17, 1997 (collectively the "Shareholder
Settlement  Agreements").  Except as otherwise  provided in this Section 2.2(b),
the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shall be  determined  in  accordance  with GAAP
consistently  applied with prior


                                       4

<PAGE>

periods,  and shall be consistent with the books and records of the Company, MTR
and MMP. The amount of cash,  cash  equivalents and cash items retained to cover
the Closing Date Liabilities shall not be considered Excluded Assets.

                  (i)  MMP  shall   deliver  to   Purchaser  at  the  Closing  a
certificate (the "Estimate  Certificate")  setting forth its good faith estimate
of the Closing Date Liabilities,  which shall be used to determine the amount of
cash,  cash  equivalents  and other cash items  required  to be  retained by the
Company, MTR and MMP pursuant to this Section 2.2(b).

                  (ii)  Within one  hundred  twenty  (120) days of the  Closing,
Purchaser  shall  cause its  accountant  to  prepare  and  deliver  to Sellers a
certificate  setting forth its calculation of the Closing Date  Liabilities (the
"Accountant's  Certificate").  The amount of the Closing Date Liabilities as set
forth on the  Accountant's  Certificate  shall be final unless  Sellers'  Agents
notify  Purchaser within thirty (30) days from their receipt of the Accountant's
Certificate that they dispute the Accountant's  Certificate.  If Sellers' Agents
and Purchaser are unable to agree on the amount of the Closing Date  Liabilities
within  fifteen  (15) days after  Sellers'  Agents'  notice,  the parties  shall
jointly  appoint and engage an  independent  accountant  of national or regional
repute (the  "Independent  Accountant") to perform an independent  evaluation of
the Closing Date Liabilities.  The findings of the Independent  Accountant as to
the amount of the  Closing  Date  Liabilities  shall be final and binding on the
parties hereto.

                  (iii) Upon the  determination  of the Closing Date Liabilities
becoming  final which is  different  from the  Estimate  Certificate  either (A)
Purchaser shall be entitled to a payment from the  Indemnification  Escrow equal
to the amount by which the  aggregate  amount of the  Closing  Date  Liabilities
exceeds the Closing Date Liabilities shown on the Estimate  Certificate,  taking
into account any amounts paid from the  Indemnification  Escrow under provisions
similar to this provision in the MTC Agreement, the Management Agreement and the
Investors Agreement, or (B) Purchaser shall pay to Disbursing Agent an amount by
which the  aggregate  amount of Closing Date  Liabilities  shown on the Estimate
Certificate exceeds the Closing Date Liabilities as finally determined.

                  (iv)  For  purposes  of  determining  the  amount  of the  Tax
liabilities  of  the  Company  and  MTR  to be  included  in  the  Closing  Date
Liabilities  (the "Closing Date Tax  Liabilities"),  such Tax liabilities  shall
include all Tax  liabilities  of the Company  and MTR that are  attributable  to
items of income,  gain,  loss,  deduction and credit of MMP and the FCC Licensee
Entities accruing through and including the Closing Date,  notwithstanding  that
such items may be  reported  by the  Company,  MTR,  Purchaser,  or  Purchaser's
Affiliates in Taxable  Periods  ending after the Closing Date. The amount of the
Tax  liabilities  attributable  to the Tax  items  of MMP  and the FCC  Licensee
Entities  shall be


                                       5
<PAGE>

determined  by  assuming  that the  taxable  years  of MMP and the FCC  Licensee
Entities,  as well as the taxable  years of the  Company and MTR,  end as of the
close of  business on the Closing  Date and by assuming  Purchaser's  compliance
with  Section  8.8. The Closing  Date Tax  Liabilities  shall not  include,  and
Purchaser shall have no rights of Indemnification  under Section 10 with respect
to, any Tax Liabilities arising from the MMP II Distribution

                  (v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 2.2, the final  determination of the Closing Date Liabilities  hereunder
shall not affect  Purchaser's  indemnification  rights pursuant to Section 10 to
the extent the actual Closing Date  Liabilities  exceed the final  determination
thereunder.

              e. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. With respect, as applicable, to Benefit
Plans and Benefit Arrangements:

                 (a)  Schedule 5.2e completely and accurately lists all
Company Plans and Company Benefit  Arrangements and specifically  identifies any
that are  Qualified  Plans.  Neither  Company nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has ever
maintained  or  contributed  to any  Qualified  Plans other than those listed on
Schedule  5.2e.  The Qualified  Plan has always  qualified in form and operation
under Code Section 401(a) and has a currently  applicable  determination  letter
from the Internal  Revenue  Service,  and its trust has always been exempt under
Code Section  501, and nothing has occurred  with respect to such plan and trust
that could cause the loss of such  qualification  or exemption or the imposition
of any liability, lien, penalty, or tax under ERISA or the Code.

                 (b) Each Company Plan and each Company Benefit  Arrangement has
been  maintained  in  accordance  with its  constituent  documents  and with all
applicable  provisions of the Code,  ERISA and other  domestic and foreign laws,
including  federal,  state, and foreign  securities laws and all laws respecting
reporting and disclosure. No Company Plan holds employer securities.

                 (c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA  Affiliate  (since August
1, 1992) has sponsored,  maintained,  or had any liability  (direct or indirect,
actual or  contingent)  with  respect to any Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA.  Neither  the


                                       11

<PAGE>



Company nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has ever made or been  obligated  to make,  or
reimbursed or been obligated to reimburse another employer for, contributions to
any multiemployer  plan (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)).  The Company has no
liability (whether actual, contingent, or otherwise) with respect to any Benefit
Plan or Benefit  Arrangement  that is not a Company Benefit  Arrangement or with
respect to any Benefit Plan sponsored or maintained (or which has been or should
have been sponsored or maintained)  by any ERISA  Affiliate;  and no facts exist
that could  reasonably be expected to result in such  liability,  as a result of
termination,  withdrawal  or  funding  waiver  with  respect  to any such  plan,
program, or arrangements.

                 (d) There are no pending  claims or lawsuits  by,  against,  or
relating to any non-Company  Benefit Plans or non-Company  Benefit  Arrangements
that would, if successful, result in liability for the Company, and no claims or
lawsuits (other than routine benefit claims) have been asserted,  instituted or,
to the  Knowledge of the Company,  threatened  by,  against,  or relating to any
Company  Plan or Company  Benefit  Arrangement,  and the  Company  does not have
Knowledge  of any fact that could form the basis for any such claim or  lawsuit.
The Company Plans and Company Benefit Arrangements are not presently under audit
or  examination   (and  have  not  received  notice  of  a  potential  audit  or
examination)  by any  governmental  authority,  and no matters are pending  with
respect to the Qualified Plan under any governmental compliance programs.

                 (e) No Company Plan or Company Benefit Arrangement contains any
provision  or is  subject  to any law that  would  give rise to any  vesting  of
benefits,  severance,  termination, or other payments or liabilities as a result
of the  transactions  this  Agreement  contemplates,  and  the  Company  has not
declared or paid any bonus or other  incentive  compensation  or established any
severance plan,  program,  or arrangement in  contemplation  of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

<PAGE>



                 (f) With  respect  to each  Company  Plan,  there  have been no
violations  of  Code  Section  4975 or  ERISA  Sections  404 or 406 as to  which
successful  claims would result in any  liability  for the Company or any Person
required to be indemnified by it.

                 (g) The  Company  has made all  required  contributions  to the
Company  Plan as of the last day of each  plan's most recent  fiscal  year,  all
benefits accrued under any unfunded Company Plan or Company Benefit  Arrangement
will have been paid,  accrued,  or otherwise  adequately  reserved in accordance
with generally  accepted  accounting  principles;  and all monies  withheld from
employee  paychecks  with respect to Company Plans have been  transferred to the
appropriate plan within the timing required by governmental regulations.

                 (h) The Company and its ERISA Affiliates have complied with the
health  continuation rules of Code Sections 4980B (and its predecessor) and with
Code Section 5000. No employee or former employee of the Company nor beneficiary
of any such  employee or former  employee  is, by reason of such  employee's  or
former  employee's  employment,  entitled  to receive  any  benefits  subject to
reporting under Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 106, other than
as required by Code Section 4980B or other applicable law.

                 (i) There are no contracts,  agreements, plans or arrangements,
including  but not limited to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,  covering any
employee or former employee of the Company that,  individually or  collectively,
could give rise to the payment of any amount (or portion thereof) that would not
be deductible pursuant to Code Sections 280G, 404 or 162.

                 f. LABOR. With respect to employees of and service providers to
the Company, except as set forth on Schedule 5.2f:

                    (a)  The  Company  is and  has  been  in  compliance  in all
material respects with all applicable laws respecting  employment and employment
practices,  terms and  conditions of employment  and wages and hours,  including
without limitation any such laws respecting employment discrimination,  workers'
compensation,  family and medical leave, the Immigration Reform and Control Act,

                    (b) The employees of the Company are not and have never been
represented  by any labor  union,  and no  collective  bargaining  agreement  is
binding and in force against, or currently being negotiated by, the Company, and
to the Company's


                                       13

knowledge, no labor representation organization effort exists nor has there been
any such activity within the past three years.

                    (c) All Persons  classified  by the  Company as  independent
contractors  do  satisfy  and has  satisfied  the  requirements  of law to be so
classified,   and  the  Company  have  fully  and   accurately   reported  their
compensation on IRS Forms 1099 when required to do so.

                    (d) Since  December 31,  1996,  the Company has not employed
any employees.

                    (e)  There is no charge or  compliance  proceeding  actually
pending  or  threatened   against  the  Company  before  the  Equal   Employment
Opportunity  Commission or any state,  local, or foreign agency  responsible for
the prevention of unlawful employment practices.

                  g. INSURANCE.  Schedule  5.2g  hereto  contains  a list of all
insurance  policies  concerning the Business and describes  coverage  thereunder
(including  whether  occurrence  or claims  made),  other than  employee-benefit
related  insurance  policies.  All such  policies  are  legal,  valid,  binding,
enforceable  and in full force and  effect  subject  to  applicable  bankruptcy,
insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  and other laws affecting the rights of
creditors  generally  and to the exercise of judicial  discretion  in accordance
with general  principles of equity (whether  applied by court of law or equity).
There are no existing  breaches or defaults by the Company or, to the  Company's
Knowledge  by any other party with  respect to such  policies,  and no notice of

effect subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,  moratorium
and other laws affecting the right of creditors generally and to the exercise of
judicial  discretion in accordance  with general  principles of equity  (whether
applied by a court of law or equity).  There  exists no default or event  which,
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by the Company

         5.3.  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AS TO THE MMP AND THE FCC LICENSEE

         Sellers, MMP and the Company,  jointly and severally,  hereby represent
and warrant to Purchaser as to MMP and the FCC Licensee Entities as follows:

               a. MMP ORGANIZATION AND GOOD STANDING. MMP is a limited liability
company duly  organized and validly  existing under the laws of Virginia and has
full  corporate  power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted  and to own and use the  assets  owned and used by it.  To the  extent
required by law, MMP is qualified as a foreign limited  liability company and is
in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the conduct of its
business or the ownership of its  properties  requires such  qualification.  MMP
owns 98% of the outstanding partnership interests in the FCC Licensee Entities.


                                       18

<PAGE>

               b.  CAPITALIZATION  OF MMP. The designations of each class of the
membership  units of MMP and the number of authorized and issued and outstanding
membership  units thereof is as described on Schedule 5.3b. All membership units
have been validly  issued and are fully paid and  nonassessable  and are held of
record by the respective members of MMP as set forth on Schedule 5.3b. Except as
described on Schedule 5.3b, (i) there are no other issued or outstanding  equity
securities of MMP; (ii) there are no  membership or value  appreciation  rights,
phantom membership rights,  profit participation rights, or other similar rights
with  respect to  membership  units  outstanding;  and (iii)  there are no other
issued  or  outstanding   membership   interests  or  other  securities  of  MMP
convertible or exchangeable at any time into equity securities of MMP. Except as
set forth in the  Operating  Agreement of MMP as amended,  MMP is not subject to
any  commitment  or  obligation  that  would  require  the  issuance  or sale of
additional  membership  interests or  membership  units of MMP at any time under
options, subscriptions, warrants, rights or any other obligations. Schedule 5.3b
sets  forth  the  equity  interests  in any  corporation,  partnership,  limited
liability company, joint venture or other entity owned by MMP.

               c.  ORGANIZATION AND  CAPITALIZATION OF THE FCC LICENSE ENTITIES.
Each FCC License  Entity is a limited  partnership  duly  organized  and validly
existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and has full partnership
power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to
own and use the  assets  owned  and  used by it.  Each  FCC  License  Entity  is
qualified as a foreign  corporation  and is in good  standing  under the laws of
each  jurisdiction  in which the conduct of its business or the ownership of its
properties  requires  such  qualification,  except  where the  failure  to be so
qualified would not have a Material  Adverse Effect.  No FCC License Entity owns
any direct or indirect  subsidiaries.  MMP is the sole general  partner and owns
ninety-eight  percent  (98%)  of the  partnership  interests  of each of the FCC
License  Entities.  MTC is the sole limited partner and owns two percent (2%) of
the partnership  interests of each of the FCC License  Entities other than RLLP.
The  Company  is the sole  limited  partner  and owns  two  percent  (2%) of the
partnership  interests of RLLP. All such partnership interests have been validly
issued  and are  fully  paid and  nonassessable  and are held of  record  by the
respective  partners  as set  forth  above.  There  are no (i)  other  issued or
outstanding  equity  securities of any FCC License Entity,  (ii)  partnership or
value appreciation  rights,  phantom  partnership rights,  profit  participation
rights,   or  other  similar  rights  with  respect  to  partnership   interests
outstanding and (iii) other issued or outstanding partnership interests or other
securities of any FCC License  Entity  convertible or  exchangeable  at any time
into equity  securities  of such FCC License  Entity.  No FCC License  Entity is
subject to any commitment or obligation  that would require the issuance or sale
of additional  partnership interests of any FCC License Entity at any time under
options,  subscriptions,  warrants,  rights  or any  other  obligations.  No FCC
License  Entity  holds any  equity  interest  in any


                                       19
<PAGE>

corporation,  partnership,  limited  liability  company,  joint venture or other
entity.

               d. NO CONFLICTS.  Except as described on Schedule  5.3d,  neither
the  execution  and  delivery  of this  Agreement  nor the  consummation  of the
transactions  contemplated hereby will (i) violate any provision of the articles
of  organization  or  operating  agreement  of MMP or  the  limited  partnership
agreements  of  the  FCC  Licensee  Entities,  (ii)  violate  any  provision  of
applicable  material law, rule and regulation,  or (iii) conflict with or result
in a breach of, or give rise to a right of  termination  of, or  accelerate  the
performance  required  by the  terms of any  judgment,  court  order or  consent
decree, or any material  agreement,  indenture,  mortgage or instrument to which
either  MMP or any FCC  Licensee  Entity  is a party  or to  which  any of their
property is subject,  or constitute a default  thereunder,  where such conflict,
breach, right of termination,  acceleration or default would have a MMP Material
Adverse Effect.

               e. REAL PROPERTY.  The MMP Real Property owned and all leaseholds
and other  interests in MMP Real Property used or useful in the Business and all
buildings,  structures,  towers, and improvements  thereon used or useful in the
business and  operations  of the  Stations  are listed on Schedule  5.3e to this
Agreement and,  except for Permitted  Encumbrances  and as disclosed in Schedule
5.3e to this Agreement,  MMP has good and marketable fee simple title (insurable
at standard  rates by a  reputable  national  title  insurer) to all fee estates
included in the Real Property, and good title to all other MMP Real Property, in
each case clear of all liens.  The FCC Licensee  Entities own no real  property,
leaseholds  or other  interests  in real  property.  No  portion of the MMP Real
Property  or any  building,  structure,  fixture or  improvement  thereon is the
subject  of, or  affected  by,  any  condemnation,  eminent  domain  or  inverse
condemnation  proceeding currently instituted or pending or, to MMP's Knowledge,
threatened.

         MMP has a valid leasehold interest in all leased property and subleases
to  which it is a party,  and MMP is the  owner  and  holder  of all the  leased
property  purported  to be granted by such  leases and  subleases.  The MMP Real
Property and the leases and subleases  listed on Schedule 5.3e constitute all of
the real property owned, leased or used by MMP in the business and operations of
the Stations,  which is material to the business and operations of the Stations.
The Sellers have  delivered or caused to be delivered to the  Purchaser  correct
and complete copies of the deeds,  leases and subleases listed in Schedule 5.3e.
With respect to each lease and sublease listed in Schedule 5.3e:

                     (a)  the  lease  or  sublease  is  legal,  valid,  binding,
enforceable,  and in full force and effect in all material  respects  subject to
applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium and other laws
affecting  the rights of  creditors  generally  and to the  exercise of judicial
discretion in accordance with several principles of equity (whether applied by a
court of law or equity);

                     (b) MMP and,  to  MMP's  knowledge,  no other  party to the
lease or sublease is in material  breach or default,  and no event has  occurred
which,  with  notice or lapse of time,  would  constitute  a material  breach or
default or permit termination, modification, or acceleration thereunder;

                     (c) MMP and,  to  MMP's  knowledge,  no other  party to the
lease or sublease has repudiated any material provision thereof;

                     (d) MMP is not a party to and,  to MMP's  knowledge,  there
are no material disputes, oral agreements,  or forbearance programs in effect as
to the lease or sublease;

                     (e)  except  as set  forth on  Schedule  5.3e,  MMP has not
assigned,  transferred,  conveyed, mortgaged, deeded in trust, or encumbered any
interest in the leasehold or subleasehold; and

                     (f) all facilities leased or subleased  thereunder material
to the operation of the Stations  have  received all  approvals of  governmental
authorities  (including  material  licenses and permits)  required in connection
with the operation thereof,  and have been operated and maintained in accordance
with applicable laws, rules, and regulations in all material respects.

                  f.  PERSONAL  PROPERTY.  Schedule  5.3f  lists  as of the date
hereof all items of Personal  Property  having a fair market  value in excess of
$5,000.00.  Except  as set  forth  on  Schedule  5.3f  hereto,  MMP has good and
marketable title to all of its material items of tangible  personal property and
assets  used or  useful  by MMP  located  on its  premises  or  shown on the MMP
Financial  Statements  are free and clear of all liens,  security  interests and
encumbrances  other than those that would not materially affect  Purchaser's use
or ownership of such personal property after the Closing.  The tangible personal
property of MMP has been maintained in accordance with normal industry  practice
and is in good  condition  and  repair  given  the age and use of such  property
(subject to normal wear and tear) and is adequate for its present use by MMP.

                  g. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MMP has provided or made available to
Purchaser copies of the MMP Financial  Statements.  The MMP Financial Statements
have been  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP  consistently  applied  with prior
periods  except  in the case of the  unaudited  MMP  Financial  Statements,  the

present fairly the financial position of MMP as at and for the periods indicated

Distribution Agreement, MMP has not committed to any of the foregoing.

                  h.  FCC.  MMP and the FCC  Licensee  Entities  have  been  and
currently  are  operated  in  material  compliance  with  the  terms  of the FCC
Licenses,  the  Communications  Act of 1934, as amended,  and applicable  rules,
regulations  and  policies  of the FCC ("FCC  Rules and  Regulations").  All FCC
Licenses,  a true and complete list of which is set forth on Schedule  5.3h, and
true and complete copies of each of which have


                                       23
<PAGE>

been delivered to Purchaser,  are valid and in full force and effect.  Except as
set forth on Schedule 5.3h, no application,  action or proceeding is pending for
the renewal or  modification  of any of the FCC  Licenses  and, to Sellers'  and
MMP's Knowledge,  there is not now before the FCC any investigation or complaint
against  MMP or  the  FCC  Licensee  Entities  relating  to  the  Stations,  the
unfavorable  resolution  of which  would  impair the  qualifications  of the FCC
Licensee  Entities  to hold any FCC  Licenses.  Except as set forth on  Schedule
5.3h, there is no proceeding pending before the FCC, and there is no outstanding
notice of  violation  from the FCC with respect to the  Stations.  Except as set
forth on Schedule  5.3h,  no order or notice of violation has been issued by any
governmental  entity  which  permits,   revocation,   adverse   modification  or
termination of any FCC License.  Except as set forth on Schedule 5.3h and except
for those conditions or restrictions  appearing on the face of the FCC Licenses,
or other licenses,  none of the FCC Licenses or other licenses is subject to any
restriction  or  condition  which would limit the  operation  of the Stations as
currently  operated.  The FCC Licenses  listed in Schedule 5.3h are currently in
effect  and are not  subject  to any liens,  or other  encumbrances.  No license
renewal applications are pending with respect to any of the FCC Licenses.  As of
the date hereof, Sellers, the Company, MMP, and the FCC License Entities have no
reason to believe  that the FCC would not renew the FCC Licenses in the ordinary
course for a full license term without any adverse  conditions,  upon the timely
filing of appropriate applications and payment of the required filing fee. As of
the date hereof, Sellers, the Company, MMP and the FCC Licensee Entities have no
reason to  believe  that the FCC would  not  grant  the FCC  Application  in the
ordinary  course without any adverse  conditions.  All documents  required by 47
C.F.R.  Section 73.3526 to be kept in each Station's public inspection files are
in such file,  and such file will be  maintained in proper order and complete up
to and through the Closing Date.

                  i.  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY.  Set forth on  Schedule  5.3i is a
complete list of all  Intellectual  Property  owned by or licensed to MMP on the
date hereof  material to the  operations  of the Stations.  To MMP's  Knowledge,
except  as  otherwise  set  forth  on  Schedule  5.3i  hereto,   MMP  owns  such
Intellectual Property free and clear of any royalty, lien, encumbrance or charge
and does not  interfere  with the  rights  of  others.  Except  as set  forth on
Schedule 5.3i, MMP has not received any written notice or written claim that any
such Intellectual  Property is not valid or enforceable,  or of any infringement
upon or conflict with any patent,  trademark,  service mark,  copyright or trade
name of any third party by MMP.  Except as set forth on Schedule  5.3i,  MMP has
not given any notice of  infringement  to any third party with respect to any of
the Intellectual  Property and to MMP's Knowledge no such  infringement  exists.
There is no  Intellectual  Property  owned by or  licensed  to the FCC  Licensee
Entities.

                  j. EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT PLANS.  With respect,  as applicable,  to
Benefit Plans and Benefit Arrangements:


                                       24
<PAGE>

                     (a) Schedule 5.3j  completely and accurately  lists all MMP
Plans and MMP Benefit  Arrangements  currently  in  existence  and  specifically
identifies  any that are  Qualified  Plans.  Since  January 1, 1996 (the date of
formation of MMP),  MMP has  maintained or  contributed  solely to the Qualified
Plans listed on Schedule 5.3j. The Qualified  Plans listed on Schedule 5.3j have
always  qualified in form and  operation  under Code  Section  401(a) and have a
currently applicable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and
its trust has always  been  exempt  under Code  Section  501,  and  nothing  has
occurred  with  respect to such plan and trust that could cause the loss of such
qualification or exemption or the imposition of any liability, lien, penalty, or
tax under ERISA or the Code.

                     (b) Each MMP Plan and each MMP Benefit Arrangement has been
maintained in accordance with its constituent  documents and with all applicable
provisions of the Code,  ERISA and other  domestic and foreign  laws,  including
federal,  state, and foreign  securities laws and all laws respecting  reporting
and disclosure. No MMP Plan holds employer securities.

                     (c)  Neither  MMP nor any ERISA  Affiliate  has  sponsored,
maintained, or had any liability (direct or indirect, actual or contingent) with
respect to any Benefit  Plan  subject to Title IV of ERISA.  Neither MMP nor any
ERISA  Affiliate has never made or been obligated to make, or reimbursed or been
obligated to reimburse another employer for,  contributions to any multiemployer
plan (as defined in ERISA Section 3(37)).  MMP has no liability (whether actual,
contingent,   or  otherwise)  with  respect  to  any  Benefit  Plan  or  Benefit
Arrangement that is not a MMP Benefit Arrangement or with respect to any Benefit
Plan  sponsored or maintained (or that has been or should have been sponsored or
maintained) by any ERISA Affiliate;  and no facts exist that could reasonably be
expected to result in such liability, as a result of termination,  withdrawal or
funding waiver with respect to any such plan, program, or arrangements.

                     (d) There are no pending claims or lawsuits by, against, or
relating to any  non-MMP  Benefit  Plans or non-MMP  Benefit  Arrangements  that
would,  if  successful,  result in liability  for MMP, and no claims or lawsuits
(other than routine  benefit  claims) have been asserted,  instituted or, to the
knowledge of Sellers and the Company  after due inquiry of MMP,  threatened  by,
against,  or relating to any MMP Plan or MMP  Benefit  Arrangement,  and MMP has
advised  Sellers and the Company  that MMP does not have  knowledge  of any fact
that  could  form the basis  for any such  claim or  lawsuit.  MMP Plans and MMP
Benefit  Arrangements are not presently under audit or examination (and have not
received  notice  of a  potential  audit  or  examination)  by any  governmental
authority,  and no matters are pending with respect to the Qualified  Plan under
any governmental compliance programs.

                     (e) No MMP Plan or MMP  Benefit  Arrangement  contains  any
provision  or is  subject  to any law that  would  give rise to any  vesting  of
benefits,  severance,  termination, or other payments or liabilities as a result
of the  transactions  this Agreement  contemplates,  and MMP has not declared or
paid any bonus or other  incentive  compensation  or  established  any severance
plan, program, or arrangement in contemplation of the transactions  contemplated
by this Agreement,  the Investors Agreement, the Management Agreement or the MTC
Agreement.

                     (f) With  respect  to each MMP  Plan,  there  have  been no
violations  of  Code  Section  4975 or  ERISA  Sections  404 or 406 as to  which
successful  claims would result in any liability for MMP or any Person  required
to be indemnified by it.

                     (g) MMP has made  all  required  contributions  to each MMP
Plan as of the last day of each plan's most recent  fiscal  year,  all  benefits
accrued  under any unfunded MMP Plan or MMP Benefit  Arrangement  will have been
paid,  accrued,  or otherwise  adequately  reserved in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles;  and all monies withheld from employee paychecks
with respect to MMP Plans have been  transferred to the appropriate  plan within
the timing required by governmental regulations.

                     (h) MMP and its ERISA  Affiliates  have  complied  with the
health  continuation rules of Code Sections 4980B (and its predecessor) and with
Code Section 5000. No employee or former  employee of MMP nor beneficiary of any
such  employee or former  employee  is, by reason of such  employee's  or former
employee's  employment,  entitled to receive any  benefits  subject to reporting
under  Statement  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  No.  106,  other than as
required by Code Section 4980B or other applicable law.

                     (i)  There   are  no   contracts,   agreements,   plans  or
arrangements,  including but not limited to the  provisions  of this  Agreement,
covering  any  employee  or  former  employee  of  MMP  that,   individually  or
collectively,  could give rise to the payment of any amount (or portion thereof)
that would not be deductible pursuant to Code Sections 280G, 404 or 162.

MMP as of  the  Closing  Date  (collectively,  the  "MMP  Accounts  Receivable")
represent or will represent valid  obligations  arising from sales actually made
or services actually  performed in the ordinary course of business.  Unless paid
prior to the Closing Date, the MMP Accounts  Receivable are or will be as of the
Closing Date current and collectable net of the respective  reserve shown on the
MMP Financial  Statements or on the accounting  records of MMP as of the Closing
Date (which  reserves are adequate and calculated  consistent with past practice
and,  in the case of the reserve as of the Closing  Date,  will not  represent a
greater  percentage  of the MMP Accounts  Receivable as of the Closing Date than
the reserve  reflected in the MMP Financial  Statements  represented  of the MMP
Accounts  Receivable  reflected  therein and will not  represent a MMP  Material
Adverse Effect in the  composition  of such MMP Accounts  Receivable in terms of
aging). Subject to such reserves, each of the MMP Accounts Receivable either has
been or will be collected in full,  without any setoff,  within ninety (90) days
after the day on which it first  becomes due and  payable.  There is no contest,
claim,  or right of  setoff,  other  than  returns  in the  ordinary  course  of
business,  under any  contract  with any obligor of an MMP  Accounts  Receivable
relating to the amount or validity of such MMP  Accounts  Receivable.  MMP shall
deliver on the Closing  Date a complete  and  accurate  list of all MMP Accounts
Receivable as of the Closing Date.

and the beneficial  owner of a 98% general  partnership  interest in each of the
Television  Licensees;  (ii) MMP holds of  record  and owns  beneficially  these
interests free and clear of any lien,  security interest,  pledge or encumbrance
other  than  those set  forth on  Schedule  5.3t  hereof,  all of which  will be
released at or before the  Closing;  (iii) MMP has full power and  authority  to
enter into this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby has been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of MMP; (iv)
this  Agreement has been duly  executed and  delivered by MMP and  constitutes a
legal,  valid  and  binding  obligation  of  MMP,  enforceable  against  MMP  in
accordance  with  its


                                       32

and other laws  affecting the rights of creditors  generally and to the exercise
of judicial  discretion in accordance with general principles of equity (whether
applied by a court of law or equity);  and (v) except as  described  on Schedule
5.3t,  MMP's  interests  in the  Television  Licensees  are not  subject  to any
option(s) warrant(s),  voting trusts,  outstanding proxies,  registration rights
agreement(s), or other agreements regarding voting rights.

         5.4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES AS TO MTR.

         Sellers and the Company,  jointly and severally,  hereby  represent and
warrant to Purchaser as to MTR as follows:

              a.  ORGANIZATION  AND GOOD  STANDING.  MTR is a  corporation  duly
organized,  validly  existing  and  in  good  standing  under  the  laws  of the
Commonwealth  of Virginia and has full corporate power and authority to carry on
its  business as it is now being  conducted  and to own and use the assets owned
and used by it. MTR is not  qualified  as a foreign  corporation  in any foreign
jurisdiction.

              b.  CAPITALIZATION.  The designations of each class of the capital
stock of MTR and the number of  authorized  and issued  and  outstanding  shares
thereof is as described on Schedule 5.4b. All the shares of capital stock of MTR
have been validly  issued and are fully paid and  nonassessable  and are held of

Except as described on Schedule  5.4b, (i) no shares of capital stock of MTR are
held  in  treasury,  (ii)  there  are no  other  issued  or  outstanding  equity
securities of MTR, (iii) there are no stock appreciation  rights,  phantom stock

of MTR convertible or  exchangeable  at any time into equity  securities of MTR.
MTR is not  subject to any  commitment  or  obligation  that would  require  the

options,  subscriptions,  warrants, rights or any other obligations.  Except for
its ownership interest in MMP, MTR holds no equity interests in any corporation,
partnership,  limited liability company,  joint venture or other entity owned by
MTR.

              c. NO  CONFLICTS.  Neither  the  execution  and  delivery  of this
Agreement  by  Sellers,  MMP  and  the  Company  nor  the  consummation  of  the
transactions  contemplated hereby will (a) violate any provision of the articles
of incorporation or by-laws of MTR, (b) violate any provision of applicable law,
rule and  regulation,  which  violation would prevent or interfere with Sellers'
ability to perform hereunder,  or (c) conflict with or result in a breach of, or
give rise to a right of termination of, or accelerate the  performance  required
by the terms of any judgment,  court order or consent decree,  or any agreement,
indenture,


                                       33

<PAGE>

mortgage  or  instrument  to which  MTR is a party or to which its  property  is
subject, or constitute a default thereunder,  where such conflict, breach, right
of termination,  acceleration  or default would prevent or materially  interfere
with the Company's ownership of 31% of the equity of MTR.

hereto,  since  January 1, 1996 (the date MTR first held any assets),  there has
not been any  material  adverse  effect on the  business,  financial  condition,
operations or results of operations  of MTR taken as a whole.  Without  limiting
the generality of the foregoing, since that date:

                  (b)  Purchaser  shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file
or cause to be  filed,  within  the time and  manner  provided  by law,  all Tax

<PAGE>

Section 8.2a, and (ii) for Taxable Periods beginning before and ending after the

opportunity  to review  and  consent to the  filing of such Tax  Returns,  which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Purchaser shall not file
amended  Tax Returns  with  respect to Taxable  Periods  ending on or before the
Closing Date or Straddle Periods without Sellers'  consent;  provided,  however,
that  Purchaser  may file amended Tax Returns for such Taxable  Periods  without
Sellers'  consent if (i) such amended Tax Returns are filed to correct errors or
omissions in previously filed Tax Returns that either  constitute or are related
to a breach of any  representation  or warranty set forth in Sections 5.2m, 5.3r
or 5.4l  (determined  without  regard to the  limitation on the survival of such
representations  and warranties set forth in Section 7.1), or (ii) the filing of

that would otherwise be a Straddle Period on the basis that the relevant Taxable
Period  consists of two  periods,  one ending as of the close of business on the
Closing  Date and one  beginning  the day after the  Closing  Date,  unless  the
relevant Tax  Authority  will not accept a Tax Return  filed on that basis.  For
purposes of apportioning any Tax to the portion of any Straddle Period that ends
on the Closing Date, the  determination  shall be made assuming that there was a
closing of the books as of the close of business  on the  Closing  Date and that
the taxable years of the Company,  MTR, MMP and the FCC Licensee  Entities ended
on that date, except that real,  personal and intangible property Taxes shall be
apportioned ratably on a daily basis between the portions of the Straddle Period
in question.

under  their  control  until  the  expiration  of  any  applicable   statute  of
limitations.

         8.5. CERTAIN TAXES. Sellers shall timely pay all transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees arising from or
relating to the sale and transfer of the Stock,  and Sellers  shall at their own
expense file all necessary Tax Returns and other  documentation  with respect to
all such  transfer,  documentary,  sales,  use,  stamp,  registration  and other
similar Taxes and fees. If required by applicable  law,  Purchaser  will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

         8.6.  FIRPTA.  Sellers  shall  deliver to  Purchaser  at the  Closing a
certificate or  certificates  in form and substance  satisfactory  to Purchaser,

Code.

Date, in its sole and absolute discretion, cause MMP and any of the FCC Licensee
Entities to make a Code Section 754 Election with respect to the Taxable  Period

processing of that  application.  All filing and grant fees, if any, paid to the
FCC,  shall  be  split  equally  by  Purchaser  and  the  Sellers.  None  of the
information  contained  in any filing made by  Purchaser or Sellers with the FCC
with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement shall contain any

records for a period of four (4) years following the Closing.

         9.7.  EMPLOYEES  AND  EMPLOYEE  BENEFITS.  Purchaser is not planning or
contemplating,  and has not made or taken,  any decisions or actions  concerning
the  employees  of the Stations  after the Closing  Date that would  require the
service of notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988, as amended, (the so-called WARN Act) or any other similar law.

         9.8.  INTERRUPTION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION.

               (a) In the event of any loss, damage or impairment,  confiscation
or  condemnation of any of the assets of the Stations prior to the completion of

the loss, damage or impairment, confiscation or condemnation incurred, the cause
thereof, if known or reasonably  ascertainable,  and the insurance coverage. MMP

thereto and take such other commercially  reasonable  actions,  as determined in
its sole discretion,  as are necessary to repair, replace or restore such assets
of any Station so damaged to their  prior  condition  as soon as possible  after
such loss, damages or impairment, confiscation or condemnation.

               (b) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction of
the assets of any Station (other than WMMP-TV in the Charleston,  South Carolina
market),  the  regular  broadcast  transmission  of one (1) or  more  Television
Stations  or two (2) or more Radio  Stations  in the normal and usual  manner is
interrupted for a period of twelve (12) continuous hours or more, MMP shall give
prompt  written  notice  thereof to Purchaser.  If on the Closing  Date,  due to
damages  or  destruction  of the assets of one (1) or more  Television  Stations
(other than WMMP-TV in the Charleston, South Carolina market) or two (2) or more
Radio Stations the regular broadcast  transmission of one (1) or more Television
Stations  (other than WMMP-TV in the Charleston,  South Carolina  market) or two
(2) or more Radio  Stations in the normal and usual manner is  interrupted  such
that the regular  broadcast signal of any such Station  (including its effective
radiated  power)  is  diminished  in any  material  respect,  then (i) MMP shall
immediately  give written notice thereof to Purchaser;  and (ii) Purchaser shall
have the right,  by giving prompt written  notice to the other,  to postpone the
Closing Date for a period of up to sixty (60) days provided,  however,  that the
Closing shall occur no later than ten (10) Business Days after regular broadcast
transmission has been restored.

               (c) In the event any one (1) or more  Television  Stations (other
than  WMMP-TV in  Charleston,  South  Carolina  market) or two (2) or more Radio
Stations normal and usual  transmission has not been resumed by the Closing Date
as postponed


                                       49

<PAGE>


pursuant  to section (b) above,  Purchaser  may,  pursuant  to Section  14.1(e),
terminate   this   Agreement   by  written   notice  to  the   Sellers'   Agent.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Purchaser may, at its option, proceed to
close this Agreement and complete the restoration and replacement of any damaged
assets of the Station in question  after the Closing Date,  MMP shall deliver or
assign to Purchaser  all  insurance  or other  proceeds  received in  connection
therewith to the extent such  proceeds are received by or payable to the Company
or MMP and have not therefore  been used in or committed to the  restoration  or
replacement of the assets.

               (d) If before the Closing Date,  due to damage or  destruction of
the assets the regular broadcast transmission of any Station (other than WMMP-TV
in the  Charleston,  South  Carolina  market) in the normal and usual  manner is
interrupted  for a period of seven (7)  continuous  days or more, MMP shall give
prompt  written notice thereof (the  "Interruption  Notice") to Purchaser.  Upon
receipt of the Interruption Notice,  Purchaser shall have the right, in its sole
and absolute discretion,  by giving prompt written notice thereof to Sellers and
MMP within two (2)  Business  Days of the date of the  Interruption  Notice,  to
terminate this Agreement with the effect specified in Section 14.2(b) hereof.

               (e) Until the Closing Date, the Company and MMP will maintain and
cause MMP to maintain the existing  insurance  coverages listed on Schedule 5.3l
on the Stations and each Station's assets.

         9.9. INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS. Purchaser has not relied and
is not relying on the  specification of any dollar amount in any  representation
or warranty made in this Agreement or any Schedule  hereto to indicate that such
amounts, or higher or lower amounts, are or are not material,  and agrees not to
assert  in  any  dispute  or   controversy   between  the  parties  hereto  that
specification of such amounts  indicates or is evidence as to whether or not any
obligation,  item or matter is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby.

         9.10.  COLLECTION OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE.

               (a) At the Closing,  Sellers' Agents shall designate Purchaser as
its agent solely for the  purposes of  collecting  the MMP Accounts  Receivable.
Purchaser will collect the MMP Accounts  Receivable  during the period beginning

respect to its own accounts receivable and hold all such MMP Accounts Receivable
in trust for Sellers until remitted by Purchaser to the  Indemnification  Escrow
Agent or the Collections  Account pursuant hereto.  Purchaser shall not make any

agency or attorney for  collection  and shall not settle or adjust the amount of
any of the MMP  Accounts  Receivable  without the  written  approval of Sellers'
Agent.  If, during the  Collection  Period,  Purchaser  receives  monies from an
account  debtor of Purchaser  that is also an account debtor of MMP with respect
to any MMP Accounts Receivable,  Purchaser shall credit the sums received to the
oldest account due, except where an account is disputed by the account debtor as
properly due, and the account  debtor has so notified  Purchaser in writing,  in
which case,  payments  received shall be applied in accordance  with the account
debtor's  instructions;  provided  that upon  resolution  of such dispute if any
amounts in dispute are received by Purchaser, Purchaser shall remit such amounts
to the  Indemnification  Escrow  Agent in  accordance  with the  Indemnification
Escrow  Agreement  up to the  amount of the  Additional  Indemnification  Amount
Deposit and, thereafter, to the Collections Account.

               (b) On the ninetieth  (90th) day after the Closing Date and on or
before the fifth Business Day after the end of each full fifteen (15) day period
thereafter  during the Collection  Period,  Purchaser  shall deliver to Sellers'
Agents a list of the  amounts  collected  by  Purchaser  before  the end of such
period with respect to the Accounts Receivable.  On or before the fifth Business
Day after the end of the Collection Period,  Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers'
Agents a list of all of the Accounts Receivable that remain uncollected.

               (c) Sellers'  Agents  shall  establish  and  maintain  during the
Collection  Period (and for as long after the Collection  Period as Sellers deem
appropriate) a bank account (the "Collections  Account") at a commercial bank in
Norfolk,  Virginia,  as notified in writing by Sellers'  Agents to Purchaser for
the deposit of  collections  of the MMP Accounts  Receivable in accordance  with
this Section 9.10.  Sellers' Agents shall have sole disbursement  authority over
the Collections  Account. On the ninetieth (90th) day after the Closing Date (or
if such  day is not a  Business  Day,  on the  next  succeeding  Business  Day),
Purchaser  shall (i) deposit with the  Indemnification  Escrow Agent pursuant to
the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement all amounts collected with respect to


                                       51

<PAGE>



any MMP Accounts  Receivable,  not to exceed the excess of $12,750,000  over the
Initial Deposit (the  "Additional  Indemnification  Amount  Deposit"),  and (ii)
deposit in the Collections Account any other MMP Accounts  Receivable  collected
by Purchaser as of such date.  On and after the  ninetieth  (90th) day after the
Closing Date until the  expiration of the  Collections  Period,  within five (5)
Business Days of the end of each full fifteen (15) day period,  Purchaser  shall
deposit all amounts  collected with respect to the Accounts  Receivable with the
Indemnification  Escrow Agent pursuant to the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement
until the total of all amounts  deposited  pursuant to the previous sentence and
this  sentence  equals  the  Additional   Indemnification  Amount  Deposit  and,
thereafter,  in the  Collections  Account.  Sellers' Agents shall be entitled to
dispose of all amounts deposited in the Collections Account from time to time as
it chooses, in its sole discretion, and Purchaser and the Indemnification Escrow
Agent shall have no rights therein;  provided,  however,  that Purchasers  shall
have no  liability  whatsoever  to  Sellers  with  respect  to  Sellers'  Agents
disposition  of any amounts  disbursed  by Sellers'  Agent from the  Collections
Account.

               (d) After the  expiration  of the  Collection  Period,  Purchaser
shall have no further  obligation  hereunder  other than (1) so long as Sellers'
Agents continue to maintain the Collections  Account, to deposit in such account
any payments with respect to any of the MMP Accounts  Receivable  that Purchaser
subsequently receives, and (2) thereafter,  to remit directly to Sellers' Agents
any payments with respect to any of the MMP Accounts  Receivable  that Purchaser
subsequently receives.

               (e) Any MMP Accounts  Receivable  remaining  uncollected 180 days
after the Closing Date shall be  transferred to Sellers'  Agents,  together with
all files  concerning  the  collection  or attempt to collect  such MMP Accounts
Receivable   hereunder,   and  Purchaser   shall   thereafter  have  no  further
responsibility with respect thereto.

               (f) Purchaser shall have no right to setoff any amounts collected
for MMP  Accounts  Receivable  against any amounts owed to Purchaser by Sellers;
provided  that  this  Section  9.10  shall  not be  deemed to limit the right of
Purchaser to make claims against the Indemnification  Amount in accordance with,
and  subject  to,  the  terms  and   conditions   of  this   Agreement  and  the
Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

         9.11. OTHER ACQUISITIONS. Without limiting any other provisions of this
Agreement,  prior to the Closing,  without the prior written consent of Sellers'
Agents,  neither  Purchaser  nor any of its  subsidiaries  or any  party  acting
directly  or  indirectly  by or on behalf of any of them shall  acquire or enter
into any  agreement  to acquire a  television  station  or radio  station in any
markets in which any Television  Station or Radio Station currently  broadcasts,
if such acquisition  would materially delay the granting of the FCC


                                       52

<PAGE>

Application;  provided,  however,  that  nothing in this  Section  9.11 shall be
construed  to  preclude  Purchaser  proceeding  to closing  with  respect to any
transaction pending as of the date hereof.

         9.12. PAYMENT  OF CERTAIN  LIABILITIES PRIOR TO CLOSING.  Sellers,  the
Company,  and MMP shall  comply in all  respects  with their  obligations  under
Section 2.2(b) of this Agreement.

                                 ---------------

         10.1. INDEMNIFICATION OF PURCHASER BY SELLERS.

               (a) Subject to Section 10.3 hereof after the Closing  Date,  each
Seller, jointly and severally,  shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from
and against any and all Losses,  however incurred,  which arise out of or result
from any breach by such Seller of any  representation or warranty of such Seller
as to itself, himself or herself, in Section 5.1 of this Agreement.

               (b)  Subject to  Section  10.3  hereof  after the  Closing  Date,
Sellers shall jointly and severally  indemnify and hold Purchaser  harmless from

set  forth  in  Sections  5.2,  5.3 or 5.4 of  this  Agreement  other  than  any
representation  or  warranty  of any  Seller  set forth in  Section  5.1 of this
Agreement;  provided,  however,  for  purposes of this Section  10.1(b)(i),  the
representation set forth in Sections 5.2c and 5.3d will be deemed not to include
the requirement of a MMP Material Adverse Effect;

                     (ii)  the  material  failure  by  Sellers  to  perform  any
covenant of Sellers contained herein;

Closing Date  Liabilities  exceed (A) the aggregate cash,  cash  equivalents and
other cash items retained as provided by Section  2.2(b),  and (B) payments made
from the Indemnification Escrow as provided by Section 2.2(b)(iii);

               (c) For purposes of Section 10.1(b)(iv), Taxes of the Company and
MTR for  Pre-Closing Tax Periods shall be deemed to include Taxes payable by the
Company,  MTR,  Purchaser,  or Purchaser's  Affiliates that are  attributable to
items of income, gain, loss,  deduction,  and credit of MMP and the FCC Licensee
Entities accruing through the Closing Date, determined on the basis of a closing
of  the  books  of  MMP  and  the  FCC  Licensee   Entities  as  of  that  date,
notwithstanding  that such items may be reported in Taxable Periods ending after

<PAGE>


                  (c) any and all  Taxes of the  Company,  MTR,  MMP and the FCC
Licensee Entities  (including any liability of the Company,  MTR, MMP or the FCC
Licensee  Entities  for Taxes of any other  persons)  for any  Post-Closing  Tax

specifically  identified  in the Closing Date  Liabilities  or are  described in
Section  10.1(c),  or  (ii)  such  Taxes  arise  out  of,  result  from  or  are
attributable to a breach of any representation,  warranty or covenant of Sellers
set forth in this Agreement.

         10.3.  LIMITATIONS  AND  OTHER  PROVISIONS  REGARDING   INDEMNIFICATION
OBLIGATIONS.

         Sellers'  obligation  to indemnify  Purchaser  pursuant to Section 10.1
shall be subject to all of the following limitations:

                (a)  Notwithstanding  anything  contained  in this  Agreement or
applicable law to the contrary,  Purchaser  agrees that the payment of any claim
(whether such claim is framed in tort, contract, or otherwise) made by Purchaser
for  indemnification  hereunder  subsequent  to the Closing  Date,  for whatever
reason,  shall be limited to, and shall only be made from,  the  Indemnification
Amount in accordance with the  Indemnification  Escrow Agreement and, except for
claims against the Indemnification  Amount,  Purchaser waives and releases,  and
shall  have no  recourse  against,  Sellers  as a result  of the  breach  of any
representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement of Sellers contained herein, or
otherwise  arising out of or in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated
hereby or the operation of the Stations,  and such indemnification  shall be the
sole and  exclusive  remedy  for  Purchaser  with  respect to any such claim for
indemnification  after the Closing Date; provided,  however, that nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit any  rights or  remedies  that  Purchaser  may have for
Sellers' fraud. The Indemnification Escrow shall be disbursed in accordance with
the Indemnification Escrow Agreement.

                (b)  Anything in this  Agreement  or any  applicable  law to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  it is understood and agreed by Purchaser that, other
than with respect to Sellers (but not including any partner, director,  officer,
employee,  agent or Affiliate  Sellers  (including  any  shareholder,  director,
officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of the Sellers)) as expressly provided for
in Section 10.1, no partner, director,  officer, employee, agent or Affiliate of
Sellers  (including  any  shareholder,  director,  officer,  employee,  agent or
Affiliate of Sellers)  shall have (i) any  personal  liability to Purchaser as a
result of the breach of any representation,  warranty,  covenant or agreement of
Sellers  contained herein or otherwise  arising out of or in connection with the
transactions  contemplated  hereby or thereby or the operations of the Stations,
or (ii) any personal  obligation to indemnify  Purchaser for any of  Purchaser's
claims pursuant to Section 10.1 and Purchaser waives and releases and shall have
no recourse  against any of such parties  described in this


                                       55

<PAGE>

Section  10.3(c)  as a result  of the  breach of any  representation,  warranty,
covenant or agreement of Sellers contained herein or otherwise arising out of or
in  connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  hereby or  thereby  or the
operations  of the Stations;  provided,  however,  that nothing  herein shall be
deemed to limit any rights or  remedies  that  Purchaser  may have for  Sellers'
fraud.

                (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the
contrary,   Sellers  shall  not  be  liable  to  Purchaser  in  respect  of  any
indemnification  hereunder  until the  aggregate  amount of Losses of  Purchaser
under this  Agreement,  the  Management  Agreement,  the MTC  Agreement  and the
Investors  Agreement  exceeds Two Hundred Fifty Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000.00)
(the "Basket Amount"),  and then only to the extent of the excess of Losses over
the amount of One Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($125,000.00);  provided,
however, that this paragraph shall not apply to (i) payments pursuant to Section
2.2(b)(iii),  (ii) indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(iv),  10.1(b)(vi)
and 10.1(b)(vii) (to the extent indemnification pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(vii)
relates  to an item  either  disclosed  on a  Schedule  and/or  set forth on the
Estimate Certificate or the Accountant's Certificate),  or (iii) indemnification
pursuant  to  Sections  10.1(b)(i)  for  breaches  of  the  representations  and
warranties set forth in Sections 5.2m, 5.3r, and 5.41.

                (d) In determining the amount of any Tax or other Loss for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement,  such Loss shall be (i) net of
any insurance  recovery made by the indemnified party, (ii) reduced to take into
account any net Tax benefit  realized by the indemnified  party arising from the
deductibility  of such Tax or Loss,  and (iii)  increased to take account of any
net Tax cost  incurred  by the  indemnified  party  arising  from the receipt of
indemnification  payments hereunder. Any indemnification payment hereunder shall
initially  be made  without  regard to this  paragraph  and shall be  reduced to
reflect any net Tax benefit or  increased to reflect any net Tax cost only after
the indemnified  party has actually  realized such benefit or cost. For purposes
of this  Agreement,  an  indemnified  party  shall be deemed  to have  "actually
realized" a net Tax benefit or net Tax cost to the extent that, and at such time
as, the amount of Taxes payable by such  indemnified  party is (x) reduced below
the amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay
but for the  deductibility  of such Tax or Losses,  and (y) increased  above the
amount of Taxes that such indemnified  party would have been required to pay but
for the receipt of such  indemnification  payments.  The amount of any reduction
hereunder  shall be  adjusted to reflect any final  determination  (which  shall
include the  execution  of Form 870-AD or  successor  form) with  respect to the
indemnified  party's  liability  for Taxes.  Any indemnity  payments  under this
Agreement  shall be  treated  as an  adjustment  to the  Purchase  Price for Tax
purposes,  unless a final determination with respect to the indemnified party or
any of its affiliates causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price.


                                       56

<PAGE>

                (e) No claim for  indemnification for Losses shall be made after
expiration of the applicable period set forth in Section 7.1 hereof.

                (f)   Anything   to  the   contrary   in   this   Section   10.3
notwithstanding, the terms, conditions and limitations set forth in this Section
10.3 do not apply to or limit Purchaser's rights under Section 14.2.

         10.4. NOTICE OF CLAIM; DEFENSE OF ACTION.

                (a) An indemnified  party shall promptly give the Sellers' Agent
notice of any matter  which an  indemnified  party has  determined  has given or
could give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement,  stating the
nature  and,  if known,  the amount of the  Losses,  and  method of  computation
thereof,  all with  reasonable  particularity  and containing a reference to the
provisions of this  Agreement in respect of which such right to  indemnification
is claimed  or arises;  provided  that the  failure of any party to give  notice
promptly  as required in this  Section  10.4 shall not relieve any  indemnifying
party of its indemnification  obligations except to the extent that such failure
materially  prejudices the rights of such  indemnifying  party.  The indemnified
party shall give  continuing  notice  promptly  thereafter  of all  developments
coming to Sellers' Agent's attention materially affecting any matter relating to
any indemnification claims.

                (b)  Except  as  otherwise   provided  in  Section   10.5,   the
obligations and liabilities of an indemnifying  party under this Section 10 with
respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party that are subject to the
indemnification  provided  for in this  Section  10,  shall be  governed  by and
contingent upon the following additional terms and conditions:

                     (i) With  respect to third  party  claims,  promptly  after
receipt by an indemnified  party of notice of the  commencement of any action or
the  presentation  or other  assertion  of any claim which  could  result in any
indemnification  claim pursuant to Section 10.1 or 10.2 hereof, such indemnified
party shall give prompt notice  thereof to Sellers'  Agent and the  indemnifying
part(ies)  shall be  entitled to  participate  therein or, to the extent that it
desires, assume the defense thereof with its own counsel.

                     (ii) If the  indemnifying  part(ies)  elects to assume  the
defense of any such action or claim,  the  indemnifying  part(ies)  shall not be
liable  to the  indemnified  party  for any fees of other  counsel  or any other
expenses, in each case incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the
defense thereof.

                     (iii)  The  indemnifying  part(ies)  shall  be  authorized,
without consent of the indemnified party being required, to settle or compromise
any such action or claim,  provided that such settlement or compromise  includes
an unconditional release of the 


                                       57

<PAGE>

indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim.

                     (iv)  Whether or not an  indemnifying  part(ies)  elects to
assume the defense of any action or claim, the indemnifying  part(ies) shall not
be liable for any  compromise or settlement of any such action or claim effected
without its consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld.

                     (v) The parties  agree to cooperate  to the fullest  extent
possible in  connection  with any claim for which  indemnification  is or may be
sought under this Agreement, including, without limitation, making available all
witnesses,  pertinent  records,  materials and  information in its possession or
under its  control  relating  thereto as is  reasonably  requested  by the other
party.

         10.5 TAX CONTESTS.

              (a) If any party receives written notice from any Taxing Authority
of any Tax  Proceeding  with  respect  to any Tax for which  the other  party is
obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, such party shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the other party;  provided,  however,  that the
failure  to give such  notice  shall not  affect  the  indemnification  provided
hereunder  except to the extent that the failure to give such notice  materially
prejudices the indemnifying party.

              (b) Sellers, acting through Sellers' Agents, shall have the right,
at their own expense,  to control and make all decisions with respect to any Tax
Proceeding  relating  solely to Taxes of the Company and MTR for Taxable Periods
ending on or before the Closing Date;  provided,  that  Purchaser and counsel of
its  own  choosing  shall  have  the  right,  at  Purchaser's  own  expense,  to
participate  fully in all  aspects  of the  prosecution  or  defense of such Tax
Proceeding;  and provided  further  that  Sellers  shall not settle any such Tax
Proceeding  without the prior written  consent of Purchaser if such  settlements
could increase the past,  present or future Tax liability of Purchaser or any of
its Affiliates,  or any Tax liability of the Company or MTR for any Post-Closing
Tax Period by an amount greater than $25,000.

              (c) Sellers, acting through Sellers' Agents, shall have the right,
at their own expense,  to jointly control and participate  with Purchaser in all
Tax Proceedings  relating to Taxes of the Company or MTR for a Straddle  Period.
If  Sellers  exercise  such  right,  neither  party  shall  settle  any such Tax
Proceeding without the prior written consent of the other.

              (d) If Sellers,  acting through Sellers'  Agents,  do not exercise
their  right to  assume  control  of or  participate  in any Tax  Proceeding  as
provided under this Section


                                       58
<PAGE>

10.5,  Purchaser may, without waiving any rights to  indemnification  hereunder,
defend or settle the same in such manner as it may deem  appropriate in its sole
and absolute discretion.

              (e) Purchaser shall control all Tax Proceedings  relating to Taxes
or Tax  Returns  of MMP  and  the  FCC  Licensee  Entities.  In the  case of Tax
Proceedings  relating  solely to Taxable  Periods of MMP ending on or before the
Closing Date and Straddle  Periods of MMP,  Purchaser  shall keep Sellers  fully
informed as to the status of any such Tax Proceeding and shall not settle such a
Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of Sellers, which consent shall
not be  unreasonably  withheld;  provided  that  Sellers'  Agents'  consent to a
settlement  shall only be required if such settlements  could increase  Sellers'
Taxes or Taxes for which  Sellers'  Agents have  indemnification  responsibility
hereunder by an amount greater than $25,000.

              (f) In the event that the  provisions of this Section 10.5 and the
provisions  of Section  10.4(b)  conflict or otherwise  each apply by the terms,
this Section 10.5 shall exclusively govern all matters concerning Taxes.

                                   TERMINATION
                                   -----------

         14.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated:

              (a) At any  time  by  mutual  written  consent  of  Purchaser  and
Sellers;


                                       64
<PAGE>

              (b) By either  Purchaser or Sellers,  if the terminating  party is
not in default or breach in any material  respect of its obligations  under this
Agreement, if the Closing hereunder has not taken place on or before October 31,
1998, except where the Closing has been postponed  pursuant to the provisions of
Section 9.8, in which case the  applicable  date shall be upon the expiration of
the period referred to in Section 9.8(b) (the "Termination Date");

              (c) by  Sellers,  if  Sellers  are not in default or breach in any
respect of their obligations  under this Agreement,  if all of the conditions in
Section  11.2 have not been  satisfied or waived by the date  scheduled  for the
Closing (as such date may be postponed pursuant to Section 9.8);

              (d) by Purchaser,  if Purchaser is not in default or breach in any
material  respect  of  its  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  if  all of the
conditions  set forth in Section  11.1 have not been  satisfied or waived by the
date  scheduled  for the  Closing  (as such date may be  postponed  pursuant  to
Section 9.8);

              (e) by Purchaser, pursuant to Section 9.8.

         14.2 PROCEDURE AND EFFECT OF TERMINATION.

              (a) In the event of  termination  of this  Agreement  by either or
both Purchaser  and/or Sellers  pursuant to Sections 9.8 or 14.1 hereof,  prompt
written  notice  thereof  shall  forthwith  be given to the other party and this
Agreement  shall  terminate and the  transactions  contemplated  hereby shall be
abandoned  without further action by any of the parties  hereto,  but subject to
and without  limiting  any other rights of the parties  specified  herein in the
event a party is in default or breach in any material respect of its obligations
under this Agreement.  If this Agreement is terminated as provided  herein,  all
filings,  applications  and  other  submissions  relating  to  the  transactions
contemplated  hereby as to which  termination  has occurred shall, to the extent
practicable,  be withdrawn  from the agency or other Person to which such filing
is made.

              (b) If this Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section  14.1(d),
the payment  made by Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1) shall be returned to
Purchaser  and Purchaser  shall have the right to pursue all remedies  available
hereunder at law or in equity, including,  without limitation, the right to seek
specific performance and/or actual monetary damages, but excluding consequential
and incidental  damages.  In recognition of the unique character of the property
to be sold  hereunder,  and the damages which Purchaser will suffer in the event
of a termination  pursuant to the foregoing Sections of this Agreement,  Sellers
hereby waive any defense that  Purchaser  has an adequate  remedy at law for the
breach of this Agreement by Sellers.


                                       65

              (c) If this  Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section  14.1(c)
and Purchaser shall be in breach in any material respect of its representations,
warranties,  covenants,  agreements, or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
then and in that  event,  Sellers  shall  have the  right to retain  the  amount
delivered by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.1(1) as liquidated damages,  and as
the sole and exclusive remedy of Sellers as a consequence of Purchaser's default
(which  aggregate  amount the  parties  agree is a  reasonable  estimate  of the
damages that will be suffered by Sellers as a result of the default by Purchaser
and does not  constitute  a  penalty),  the  parties  hereby  acknowledging  the
inconvenience and nonfeasability of otherwise obtaining inadequate remedy.

              (d) If this Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Sections 14.1(a),
14.1(b) and 14.1(e),  the payment made by Purchaser  pursuant to Section  3.1(1)
shall be returned to Purchaser.

              (e) A notice of  termination  made under any  provision of Section
14.1 of this Agreement  shall be deemed to be a notice of termination  under the
termination  provisions of the Investor Agreement,  the Management Agreement and
the MTC Agreement.

              (f) In the event of a default by either  party  that  results in a
lawsuit or other proceeding for any remedy  available under this Agreement,  the
prevailing party, to the extent it is the prevailing party, shall be entitled to
reimbursement  from the other party of its  reasonable  legal fees and expenses,
whether incurred in arbitration, at trial, or on appeal.

                                 SELLERS' AGENTS
                                 ---------------

         16.1. SELLERS' AGENTS. Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably  appoints
Allen B. Rider,  III,  Anthony R. Ignaczak,  and Stephen W. Burke (herein called
the "Sellers' Agents") as his, her or its agent and attorney-in-fact to take any
action  required or permitted to be taken by such Seller under the terms of this
Agreement,  including,  without limiting,  the generality of the foregoing,  the
payment of expenses relating to the transactions  contemplated by the Agreement,
and the right to waive,  modify or amend any of the terms of this  Agreement  in
any  respect,  whether  or not  material,  and agrees to be bound by any and all
actions  taken by the  Sellers'  Agents on his or its  behalf.  Any action to be
taken by the  Sellers'  Agents  shall be  unanimous.  In the event of the death,
incapacity or liquidation of any of Sellers' Agents, such person or entity shall
not be  replaced,  and the  remaining  Sellers'  Agents  shall  continue in that
capacity.  The Sellers  agree  jointly and  severally to indemnify  the Sellers'
Agents  from and  against  and in respect of any and all  liabilities,  damages,
claims,  costs,  and expenses,  including,  but not limited to attorneys'  fees,
arising out of or due to any action by them as the  Sellers'  Agents and any and
all  actions,  proceedings,  demands,  assessments,  or  judgments,  costs,  and
expenses incidental thereto,  except to the extent that the same result from bad
faith or gross negligence on the part of the Sellers' Agents. Purchaser shall be
entitled  to rely  exclusively  upon any  communications  given by the  Sellers'
Agents on behalf of any Seller,  and shall not be liable for any action taken or
not taken in reliance upon the Sellers'  Agents.  Purchaser shall be entitled to
disregard any notices or communications given or made by Sellers unless given or
made through the Sellers' Agents.

                                   SECTION 17

                                  MISCELLANEOUS
                                  -------------

         17.1.  HEADINGS.  The headings contained in this Agreement  (including,
but not limited to, the titles of the Schedules  and Exhibits  hereto) have been
inserted for the  convenience  of reference  only, and neither such headings nor
the placement of any term hereof under any  particular  heading shall in any way
restrict  or modify  any of the terms or  provisions  hereof.  Terms used in the
singular  shall be read in the  plural,  and vice  versa,  and



                                       68
<PAGE>

terms  used in the  masculine  gender  shall be read in the  feminine  or neuter
gender when the context so requires.

         17.2.  SCHEDULES  AND  EXHIBITS.  All Annexes,  Schedules  and Exhibits
attached to this  Agreement  constitute an integral part of this Agreement as if
fully rewritten herein.

         17.3. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in one
or more  counterparts,  each of which  shall be deemed an  original,  but all of
which together shall constitute one and the same document.

         17.4. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement,  the Investors Agreement,  the
Management Agreement, the MTC Agreement and the FCC Licensee Transfer Agreement,
the Annexes,  Schedules and Exhibits and the documents to be delivered hereunder
and thereunder  constitute the entire  understanding  and agreement  between the
parties  hereto  concerning  the subject matter  hereof.  All  negotiations  and
writings  between  the  parties  hereto  are  merged  into this  Agreement,  the
Investors  Agreement,  the  Management  Agreement,  the MTC  Agreement,  the FCC
Licensee  Transfer  Agreement,  and  there are no  representations,  warranties,
covenants, understandings, or agreements, oral or otherwise, in relation thereto
between  the parties  other than those  incorporated  herein or to be  delivered
hereunder.

         17.5. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement is to be delivered in and should be
construed in  accordance  with and governed by the laws of the  Commonwealth  of
Virginia without giving effect to conflict of laws principles.

         17.6. MODIFICATION. This Agreement cannot be modified or amended except
in writing signed by each of the Purchaser and Sellers' Agent.

         17.7.  SUCCESSORS  AND ASSIGNS.  Neither this  Agreement nor any of the
rights  and   obligations   hereunder  shall  be  assigned,   delegated,   sold,
transferred,  sublicensed,  or  otherwise  disposed  of by  operation  of law or
otherwise,  without  the prior  written  consent  of each of the  other  parties
hereto; provided,  however, that Purchaser may assign its rights and obligations
hereunder  to one or more  subsidiaries  so long as Purchaser is not relieved of
its obligations  hereunder;  and provided  further that any change of control in
respect of Purchaser's  parent,  SBGI, shall not require the consent of Sellers.
In the event of such permitted assignment or other transfer,  all of the rights,
obligations, liabilities, and other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by and against, the
respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto, whether so expressed or
not.


                                       69
<PAGE>


         17.8.  WAIVER.  Any waiver of any  provision  hereof (or in any related
document or  instrument)  shall not be effective  unless made expressly and in a
writing  executed in the name of the party sought to be charged.  The failure of
any party to insist, in any one or more instances,  on performance of any of the
terms or  conditions  of this  Agreement  shall not be  construed as a waiver or
relinquishment of any rights granted  hereunder or of the future  performance of
any such term, covenant,  or condition,  but the obligations of the parties with
respect hereto shall continue in full force and effect.

         17.9.  SEVERABILITY.  The provisions of this Agreement  shall be deemed
severable,  and if any  part  of any  provision  is held  to be  illegal,  void,
voidable,  invalid,  nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or
as to any party, for any reason, such provision may be changed,  consistent with
the intent of the parties hereto, to the extent reasonably necessary to make the
provision,  as so  changed,  legal,  valid,  binding,  and  enforceable.  If any
provision of this  Agreement  is held to be illegal,  void,  voidable,  invalid,
nonbinding or unenforceable in its entirety or partially or as to any party, for
any reason,  and if such provision cannot be changed  consistent with the intent
of the parties hereto to make it fully legal,  valid,  binding and  enforceable,
then such provisions  shall be stricken from this  Agreement,  and the remaining
provisions of this Agreement  shall not in any way be affected or impaired,  but
shall remain in full force and effect.

         17.10.  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  From the date of this  Agreement,  all  further
public announcements relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby will be made only as agreed upon  jointly by the parties  hereto,  except
that  nothing  herein  shall  prevent  any  Seller or any  Affiliate  thereof or
Purchaser  from  making  any  disclosure  in  connection  with the  transactions
contemplated  by this  Agreement if required by applicable law or otherwise as a
result of its, or its Affiliate's,  being a public company,  provided that prior
notice of such disclosure is given to the other party hereto.

         17.11.  SPECIFIC  PERFORMANCE.  Sellers acknowledge that Purchaser will
have no adequate  remedy at law if Sellers fail to perform  their  obligation to
consummate the sale of Stock contemplated  under this Agreement.  In such event,
Purchaser  shall have the right,  in addition to any other rights or remedies it
may have, to specific performance of this Agreement.

         17.12  FEES  AND  EXPENSES.   Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this
Agreement,  each party shall pay their own expenses  incurred in connection with
the authorization, preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement and
the  exhibits,  Schedules,  and  other  documentation,  including  all  fees and
expenses of counsel,  accountants,  and each party shall be responsible  for all
fees and commissions  payable to any finder,  broker,  adviser, or other similar
Person  retained  by or on behalf of such  party;  provided,  however,


                                       70
<PAGE>

that all transfer taxes,  recordation taxes, sales taxes, and document stamps in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid
one-half  (1/2) by Purchaser and one-half  (1/2) by Sellers and all other filing
fees (including all FCC and H-S-R Act filing fees),  and other charges levied by
any governmental entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  shall be paid  one-half  (1/2) by  Purchaser  and  one-half  (1/2) by
Sellers.   Purchaser  hereby  waives  compliance  with  the  provisions  of  any
applicable bulk transfer law.

         17.13 THIRD PARTY  BENEFICIARIES.  Nothing  expressed or referred to in
this  Agreement  shall be construed to give any Person other than the parties to
this  Agreement  any legal or equitable  right,  remedy,  or claim under or with
respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and
all of its provisions  and conditions are for the sole and exclusive  benefit of
the parties to this Agreement and their successors and assigns.

         17.14  INTERPRETATION.  The Purchaser and Sellers acknowledge and agree
that the  preparation and drafting of this Agreement and the Exhibits hereto are
the result of the efforts of all parties to this  Agreement and every  covenant,
term, and provision of this Agreement  shall be construed  according to its fair
meaning and shall not be construed  against any particular  party as the drafter
of such covenant,  term, and/or provision.  The Purchaser and Sellers agree that
this Agreement is to be construed in a manner  consistent  with the terms of the
Investors Agreement, the Management Agreement and the MTC Agreement.

                  WHEREAS,  the parties to this  Agreement are among the parties
to an  Agreement  and Plan of Merger  dated as of February  23, 1998 (the "Prior

Prior Agreement by entering into this Agreement and certain other agreements;

                  NOW, THEREFORE, FOR GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION,  the

Sinclair  will  form  a  wholly-owned   Subsidiary  which  will  be  a  Delaware

its  Subsidiaries  to,  take such  actions as may be  required  to (1) cause the
capital stock of Sullivan Two to be  distributed  to the holders of the Sullivan
Common Share Equivalents immediately prior to such distribution,  with each such
holder receiving a number of shares of common stock which is equal to the number
of  shares  of  common  stock  of  Sullivan  then  held  by such  holders  (on a
fully-diluted,  as-exercised  basis)  and with such  shares  of common  stock of
Sullivan  Two having the same  relative  voting  rights as such shares of common
stock  of  Sullivan  which  are  then  held  by  each  of  them  (on  a  similar
fully-diluted,  as-exercised  basis),  and  (2)  cause  the  FCC  Authorizations
relating to the Sullivan  Two  Stations  and the other  assets  described in the
attached  Exhibit A to be  transferred  to Sullivan Two in  consideration  for a
promissory  note of  Sullivan  Two in a  principal  amount  equal to the  amount

Spin-Off  are then  effective  and any other  required  Consent for the Sullivan
Three Spin-Off has been obtained and is then effective,  Sullivan will, and will
cause its Subsidiaries to, take such actions as may be required to (1) cause the

holder receiving a number of shares of common stock which is equal to the number
of  shares  of  common  stock  of  Sullivan  then  held  by such  holders  (on a
fully-diluted,  as-exercised  basis)  and with such  shares  of common  stock of
Sullivan  Three having the same relative  voting rights as such shares of common
stock  of  Sullivan  which  are  then  held  by  each  of  them  (on  a  similar
fully-diluted,  as-exercised  basis),  and  (2)  cause  the  FCC  Authorizations
relating to the Sullivan  Three  Stations and the other assets  described in the
attached  Exhibit B to be transferred to Sullivan Three in  consideration  for a
promissory  note of  Sullivan  Three in a principal  amount  equal to the amount
specified on the attached Exhibit B. The transactions described in the preceding
sentence  are  referred to as the  "Sullivan  Three  Spin-Off,"  and each of the
Sullivan  Two  Spin-Off  and the  Sullivan  Three  Spin- Off is referred to as a
"Spin-Off."

                  1.D  SPIN-OFF  TAXES.  Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries  will be
responsible  for the  payment  of any Tax  arising  solely  by  reason of either
Spin-Off (a "Spin-Off  Tax").  To the extent not paid at the Effective Time, the
liability  of  Sullivan  and its  Subsidiaries  (if any) for any  Spin-  Off Tax
arising by reason of the Sullivan  Three  Spin-Off (as  determined in accordance
with  Section  3.D(6))  will be  reflected  in the  computation  of the  Current
Liabilities.

stated in this  Agreement,  on the Closing  Date,  effective as of the Effective

terms and conditions of this Agreement.  Sullivan will be the corporation  which
survives such merger (the  "Merger") and in such capacity is sometimes  referred
to in this Agreement as "Post-Merger Sullivan."

                  2.B EFFECT ON SULLIVAN SHARE  EQUIVALENTS.  Immediately  after
the  Closing,  effective  at  the  Effective  Time,  subject  to the  terms  and
conditions of this  Agreement (1) the Merger will be effected by the filing with
the  Secretary  of the State of Delaware of a  Certificate  of Merger;  (2) each
Sullivan Share Equivalent  outstanding at the Effective Time, by said occurrence
and  with  no  further  action  on the  part  of the  holder  thereof,  will  be
transformed and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for
such Sullivan Share Equivalent,  without interest or any similar payment thereon
or with respect  thereto,  upon surrender of the certificate  representing  such
Sullivan  Share  Equivalent;  (3) each  share of common  stock of the Merger Sub
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will, by said occurrence and
with no further action on the part of the holder  thereof,  be  transformed  and
converted  into one  share of  common  stock of  Post-Merger  Sullivan,  so that
immediately  thereafter  Sinclair  will be the sole and  exclusive  owner of all
equity securities of Post-Merger Sullivan;  and (4) Post-Merger Sullivan will be
the owner of the  business,  assets,  rights,  privileges,  immunities,  powers,
franchises and other attributes of Sullivan

                  2.C  CERTIFICATE  OF  INCORPORATION.   Immediately  after  the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of Post-Merger Sullivan will be
the  certificate  of  incorporation  of the Merger Sub as in effect  immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

                  2.D BYLAWS.  Immediately  after the Effective Time, the bylaws
of  Post-Merger  Sullivan  will be the  bylaws  of the  Merger  Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

                  2.E BOARD OF DIRECTORS  AND  OFFICERS.  The board of directors
and officers of the Merger Sub  immediately  prior to the Effective Time will be
the board of directors and the officers,  respectively,  of Post-Merger Sullivan
immediately  after the Effective Time, and such  individuals  will serve in such
positions for the respective terms provided by applicable Legal  Requirements or
in the bylaws of  Post-Merger  Sullivan  until their  respective  successors are
elected and qualified.

                  2.F NAME. The name of Post-Merger  Sullivan will be designated
by Sinclair.

                  2.G EXCHANGE PROCEDURES.  At or after the Closing, each holder
of record of Sullivan Share Equivalents will deliver to Post-Merger Sullivan for
cancellation the  certificate(s)  representing  such Sullivan Share  Equivalents
(the  "Old  Sullivan   Certificates").   Upon  surrender  of  any  Old  Sullivan
Certificate for cancellation,  subject to the provisions of this Agreement,  (a)
the holder of such Old Sullivan  Certificate  will receive in exchange  therefor
the Merger Consideration for the Sullivan Share Equivalents  represented by such
Old  Sullivan  Certificate,  and  (b)  such  Old  Sullivan  Certificate  will be
canceled.  Until  surrendered  as  contemplated  by this Section  2.G,  each Old
Sullivan  Certificate  will,  at and  after  the  Effective  Time,  be deemed to
represent  only the  right  to  receive,  upon  surrender  of such Old  Sullivan
Certificate,  the  Merger  Consideration  for  the  Sullivan  Share  Equivalents
represented by such Old Sullivan Certificate.

                  2.H NO FURTHER RIGHTS;  TRANSFER OF SULLIVAN STOCK. The Merger
Consideration  paid for any Sullivan  Share  Equivalent in  accordance  with the
terms of this Agreement will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of
all rights pertaining to such Sullivan Share Equivalent.  At the Effective Time,
the stock  transfer books of Sullivan will be closed and no transfer of Sullivan
Share Equivalents will thereafter be made.

                  after the time of the Closing the ABRY Fund will distribute to
                  its partners (who may in turn  distribute  to their  partners,
                  and so on) any or all of the  shares  of the  Sinclair  Common
                  Stock  which may be  issuable  to the ABRY Fund as part of the
                  Sullivan Common Base Merger  Consideration.  At the request of
                  the Stockholder  Representative,  the Merger Sub will cause to
                  be issued and delivered to the Stockholder Representative (for
                  the account of the ABRY Fund)  certificates  for any or all of
                  such  shares  of  Sinclair   Common  Stock,   issued  in  such
                  whole-number  denominations  and  registered  in such names or
                  nominees, as the Stockholder  Representative may request. Such
                  certificates  will be issued in whole  number of shares  only,
                  and in lieu of any fractional share Sinclair or the Merger Sub
                  will pay the  Stockholder  Representative  (for the account of
                  the ABRY  Fund) an  amount  in cash  equal to a  corresponding
                  fraction of the Average Trading Price.

                                    (D)    ESCROW    DEPOSIT    UNDER    CERTAIN
                  CIRCUMSTANCES. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Estimated
                  Receivable Amount set forth in Sullivan's  Estimate Report (as
                  it may be revised by Sullivan  as provided in the  penultimate
                  sentence of Section 3.E(2)) is less than $24,000,000,  then an
                  amount equal to the excess of $24,000,000  over such Estimated
                  Receivable  Amount will be withheld  from the cash  portion of
                  the Sullivan  Common Base Merger  Consideration  to be paid to
                  the Stockholder  Representative  pursuant to Section 3.A(3)(b)
                  and will instead be deposited  with the Estimate  Escrow Agent
                  as the Estimate Fund.

                           (4)      EFFECT OF DELAY.

                                    (A) IF CAUSED BY SULLIVAN. If the Closing is
                  delayed  (a  "Delay")  solely  by  reason  of (i) a breach  by
                  Sullivan of its  obligations  under this  Agreement,  (ii) the
                  failure of a Sullivan Consent to be obtained,  (iii) any loss,
                  damage, impairment, condemnation, confiscation or interruption
                  described in Section 7.L(1) or 7.L(2),  and/or (iv) a delay in
                  the Grant of any  Required  FCC Consent for a Spin-Off,  or in
                  the  expiration  of the  applicable  waiting  period under the
                  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Act, solely as a result of actions taken by
                  Sullivan or its Subsidiaries  (items described in clauses (i),
                  (ii),  (iii), and (iv) being  "Causes"),  then for purposes of
                  determining the Cash Flow Multiplier and the amount  described
                  in  Section  3.D(1)(b),  the  Closing  will be  deemed to have
                  occurred on the day upon which it would have  occurred but for
                  such breach, failure, loss, damage, impairment,  condemnation,
                  confiscation or interruption.

                                    (B) IF CAUSED BY GROSS REVENUE SHORTFALL. As
                  part of the Cash Flow  Report  delivered  pursuant  to Section
                  7.C(1) for each of March, April and May of 1998, Sullivan will
                  deliver to Sinclair its good faith determination of the amount
                  of the Gross  Revenues,  determined  as if the last day of the
                  month in question were the Measurement Date (such amount being
                  the  "Estimated  Gross  Revenues"  for  such  month).  If  the
                  Estimated  Gross Revenues for each of March,  April and May of
                  1998 set forth in the corresponding  Cash Flow Reports is less
                  than the  corresponding  amount set forth in Section  10.E and
                  all  conditions  to the Closing set forth in Articles IX and X
                  (other than  Section  10.E) have been  satisfied  or waived in
                  writing (or would be satisfied by the delivery of documents or
                  taking  of  other  actions  to be  delivered  or  taken at the
                  Closing) on June 23, 1998,  then for  purposes of  determining
                  the Cash Flow  Multiplier,  the Closing will be deemed to have
                  occurred  prior  to June 23,  1998,  if the  Closing  actually
                  occurs on or prior to the fifth (5th)  Business  Day after the
                  delivery of the Monthly Cash Flow Report for June, 1998.

                  3.B  ANNUALIZED TRAILING CASH FLOW.

                       (1) TRAILING  CASH FLOW -- BASIC  DEFINITION.  Subject to
         Sections  3.B(2),   3.B(3),  3.B(4),  3.B(5),  3.B(6),  and  13.Q,  the
         "Trailing Cash Flow" means the amount of

                           (a) the consolidated net operating income of Sullivan
                  and its Subsidiaries for the period (the "Measurement Period")
                  beginning  on January 1, 1998 and ending on the earlier of (i)
                  the last day of the last full  calendar  month  ended prior to
                  the Closing  Date and (ii) August 31, 1998 (such  earlier date
                  being the "Measurement Date"),

                           (b)  increased  by the  amount  of all  non-recurring
                  items incurred other than in the ordinary  course of business,
                  corporate overhead (including  management and consulting fees,
                  reimbursements  paid  or  payable  to  ABRY  Partners  and all
                  discretionary  profit-sharing and 401(k) plan  contributions),
                  income taxes, interest expense,  depreciation and amortization
                  (including   amortization  in  respect  of  Film  Obligations)
                  deducted in computing such net operating income,

                           (c)  reduced  by the  aggregate  amount  of all  Film
                  Obligations  which  were  actually  paid in cash  pursuant  to
                  Program  Contracts  with respect to the  Stations  during such
                  period  and  which  became  due  after   September   30,  1997
                  (determined  under  the terms and  conditions  of the  related
                  Program  Contracts as in effect on December  31,  1997,  or as
                  initially  entered  into,  if entered into after  December 31,
                  1997), and

                           (d) further  reduced by the  aggregate  amount of all
                  Film  Obligations  which  were not paid in cash on or prior to
                  the  Measurement  Date  and  which  became  due  prior  to the
                  three-calendar-month-period  ending  on the  Measurement  Date
                  (determined  under  the terms and  conditions  of the  related
                  Program  Contracts as in effect on December  31,  1997,  or as
                  initially  entered  into,  if entered into after  December 31,
                  1997).

         For purposes of clause (b) above, except as provided in Section 3.B(3),
         "corporate  overhead" is understood  and agreed to include all expenses
         incurred in connection  with the activities of the Corporate  Personnel
         and (without  duplication)  all expenses which are not incurred for the
         benefit of a single  Station (with an LMA Station and the Owned Station
         serving  the  same  market  being  considered  a single  "Station"  for
         purposes of this  sentence)  and which  would not be  incurred  for the
         benefit of a single Station under customary industry practice.

                       (2) TREATMENT OF  BARTER-RELATED  ITEMS.  Notwithstanding
         GAAP to the extent GAAP are to the  contrary,  the  Trailing  Cash Flow
         will be determined exclusive of the value of any consideration received
         in barter for time on any Station  pursuant  to any Trade and  expenses
         pertaining  to air time  provided  in barter for  products  or services
         pursuant to any Trade.

                       (3) LOBBYING  EXPENSES.  For purposes of determining  the
         Trailing Cash Flow, and notwithstanding  GAAP to the extent GAAP are to
         the  contrary,  50% (and only 50%) of the  amounts  paid or  payable to
         Policy   Communications,   Inc.  and  which  are  attributable  to  the
         Measurement  Period will be deemed to  constitute  a part of  corporate
         overhead, and therefore will be added pursuant to clause (b) of Section
         3.B(1).

                       (4) TREATMENT OF CERTAIN  CASCOM  ITEMS.  For purposes of
         determining  the Trailing Cash Flow,  and  notwithstanding  GAAP to the
         extent GAAP are to the  contrary,  any payment or accrual in respect of
         the "Cascom Bonus" (as that term is defined in the Executive Employment
         Agreement  dated  as of  December  9,  1996  among  Sullivan,  Sullivan
         Broadcasting  and Victor Rumore  ("Rumore")) (so long as, by its terms,
         such Cascom Bonus will not continue to accrue after the Closing  Date),
         and any expense relating to or arising out of the issuance in February,
         1998 of shares of Sullivan Common Stock to Rumore, will be disregarded.

                       (5)  TREATMENT OF CERTAIN LMA  PAYMENTS.  For purposes of
         determining  the Trailing Cash Flow,  and  notwithstanding  GAAP to the
         extent  GAAP are to the  contrary,  a portion of the amount  payable by
         Sullivan  or a  Subsidiary  of Sullivan  under an Existing  LMA for any
         period  which is equal to the  amount of the  interest  expense  of the
         Person to whom such amount is payable for such period,  plus the amount
         of all  repayments  of the  principal  amount of  indebtedness  of such
         Person  from  the  proceeds  of  any  such  payment  by  Sullivan  or a
         Subsidiary of Sullivan,  will be treated as if it were interest expense
         of Sullivan and its Subsidiaries.

                       (6) APPLICATION OF GAAP. Except as otherwise  provided in
         this Agreement, the Trailing Cash Flow will be determined in accordance
         with GAAP.

                       (7)   ANNUALIZED   TRAILING   CASH  FLOW   DEFINED.   The
         "Annualized  Trailing Cash Flow" means the product of the Trailing Cash
         Flow  multiplied by the amount (the  "Annualization  Factor") set forth
         below for the date which is the Measurement Date:

         30, 1998 to the date of the Closing computed at the Yield Rate, plus

                       (2)  for  each  payment  made by  Sullivan  or any of its
         Subsidiaries  after January 30, 1998 in respect of the "Purchase Price"
         under the KOKH Purchase Agreement or any out-of-pocket expense incurred
         in connection with the  transactions  contemplated by the KOKH Purchase
         Agreement,  the amount of such payment plus a yield on such amount from
         the date it was paid to the Closing Date (or, if earlier in the case of

         reimbursed by Sinclair), computed at the Yield Rate, plus

                       (3) for each  capital  contribution,  loan or  advance to

         proceeds thereof were used in connection with the operations of Station
         KOKH, the amount of such capital contribution,  loan or advance, plus a
         yield on such amount from the date of such capital  contribution,  loan
         or advance to the Closing  Date (or,  if  earlier,  the date upon which
         such capital contribution, loan or advance is repaid) computed  at  the
         Yield Rate, less

                           (4) the amount of each  payment  made to  Sullivan or
         any of its  Subsidiaries  after  January 30, 1998  pursuant to the KOKH
         Purchase  Agreement  representing  a reduction in the "Purchase  Price"
         thereunder or a reimbursement of expenses incurred by SBOC or SBLH, and
         less

                           (5) the amount of any capital  contribution,  loan or
         advance  described  in clause  (3) above  which is repaid  prior to the

         of determining the Adjustment Amount, and  notwithstanding  GAAP to the
         extent GAAP are

         incurred by Sullivan or any of its Subsidiaries (including on behalf of
         any Old Sullivan Stockholder,  and including the fees and disbursements
         of advisors to Sullivan, Sullivan Two, Sullivan Three, the Old Sullivan
         Stockholders  and the Stockholder  Representative),  in connection with

         Subsidiaries of the Corporate  Personnel or any Non-Continuing  Station
         Manager effective as of the Closing Date.

                       (4)  TRADE-OUT  ITEMS.  For purposes of  determining  the
         Adjustment Amount, and  notwithstanding  GAAP to the extent GAAP are to
         the  contrary,  with respect to  Trade-Out  Receivables  and  Trade-Out
         Payables:

                                    (a) the amount of  Sullivan's  or any of its
                  Subsidiaries'  obligations under, and the amount of the goods,
                  services and other items to be received under,  any Trade will
                  be determined in accordance with standard  industry  valuation
                  methods as of the date of this  Agreement  (provided  that, in
                  the case of goods, services and other items to be so received,
                  no such item will be valued at an amount which is greater than
                  the fair value of such item at the Adjustment Time);

                                    (b) the  "Current  Assets"  will not include
                  Trade-Out Receivables with respect to any Station;

                                    (c)  the  "Current   Liabilities"  will  not
                  include Trade-Out  Payables with respect to any Station except
                  to the  extent  (and only to the  extent)  that the  aggregate
                  amount of the Trade-Out  Payables with respect to such Station
                  as of the Adjustment Time exceeds the aggregate  amount of the
                  Trade-Out  Receivables  with respect to such Station as of the
                  Adjustment Time by more than $50,000; and

                                    (d)   for   purposes   of   this   Agreement
                  (including  clause  (c)  above),   each  Station  which  is  a
                  television translator station will be considered together with
                  the related Station which is a full-power  television  station
                  and all other related television translator stations.

                       (5) PROGRAM  PAYMENTS.  For purposes of  determining  the
         Adjustment Amount, and  notwithstanding  GAAP to the extent GAAP are to
         the  contrary,  "Current  Assets" and  "Current  Liabilities"  will not
         include any amounts in respect of Film Obligations, except that:

                                     (a) the Current  Liabilities  will  include
                  the aggregate amount of all Film Obligations  which become due
                  prior to the first day of the  calendar  month which  includes
                  the Closing Date (determined under the terms and conditions of
                  the related Program Contracts as then in effect) and which are
                  not paid prior to the Adjustment Time;

                                    (b) the Current  Liabilities will include an
                  amount  equal  to  (i)  the  aggregate   amount  of  all  Film
                  Obligations  which are not paid prior to the  Adjustment  Time
                  and which become due during the calendar  month which includes

                  Date (determined under the terms and conditions of the related
                  Program  Contracts  as then in effect),  multiplied  by (ii) a
                  fraction,  the numerator of which is the number of days during
                  such calendar month prior to, but not  including,  the Closing
                  Date,  and the  denominator  of  which is the  number  of days
                  during such calendar month;1

                                    (c)  the  Current  Assets  will  include  an
                  amount  equal  to  (i)  the  aggregate   amount  of  all  Film
                  Obligations  which are paid prior to the  Adjustment  Time and
                  which become due during the calendar  month which includes the
                  Closing Date (determined under the terms and conditions of the
                  related  Program  Contracts as then in effect),  multiplied by
                  (ii) a fraction,  the numerator of which is the number of days
                  during such calendar month on and after, but not prior to, the
                  Closing Date,  and the  denominator  of which is the number of
                  days during such calendar month;2 and

                                    (d)  the  Current  Assets  will  include  an
                  amount equal to the aggregate  amount of all Film  Obligations
                  which  become  due after the final day of the  calendar  month
                  which  includes the Closing Date  (determined  under the terms
                  and  conditions  of the related  Program  Contracts as then in
                  effect) and which are paid prior to the Adjustment Time.

                       (6)  TAX  MATTERS.   For  purposes  of  determining   the
         Adjustment  Amount and  notwithstanding  GAAP to the extent GAAP are to
         the contrary:

                                    (A)  CLOSING OF BOOKS.  The Tax  liabilities
                  for each  Straddle  Period will be  determined  by closing the
                  books and records of Sullivan, its Subsidiaries,  Sullivan Two
                  and Sullivan Three as of the Adjustment  Time, and by treating
                  the portion of such Straddle  Period ending on (and including)
                  the day  prior  to the  Closing  Date and the  portion  of the
                  Straddle Period  beginning on the Closing Date as if they were
                  separate Tax  periods,  and by  employing  accounting  methods
                  which are consistent  with those employed in preparing the Tax
                  Returns  for  Sullivan,  its  Subsidiaries,  Sullivan  Two and
                  Sullivan Three in prior periods  except as otherwise  required
                  by  applicable  law,  and  which  do not have  the  effect  of
                  distorting   income  or  expenses  (taking  into  account  the
                  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement),  except  that
                  Taxes  based on items  other  than  income or sales  (for this
                  purpose, a Tax imposed under alternative methods, at least one
                  of which is based on income, will be considered an income Tax)
                  will be computed  for such  Straddle  Period by prorating on a
                  time  basis  between  the  portion  of  the  Straddle   Period
                  beginning on the first day of the applicable  Straddle  Period
                  and  ending on (and  including)  the day prior to the  Closing
                  Date and the period  beginning  on the Closing Date and ending
                  on the last day of such  Straddle  Period;  provided  that (x)

- -------------------

     1 e.g., if the Closing occurs on June 20, 1998, then the fraction described
in this clause (b) will be 19/30.

     2 e.g., if the Closing occurs on June 20, 1998, then the fraction described
in this clause (c) will be 11/30.

                  in effect during the entire Straddle Period,  the proration of
                  such  Tax  will be based on the  period  during  the  Straddle
                  Period  that  such  Tax was in  effect,  and (y) for all  such
                  purposes,  the Sullivan  Two  Spin-Off  will be deemed to have
                  occurred  after the  Adjustment  Time and the  Sullivan  Three
                  Spin-Off  will  be  deemed  to  have  occurred  prior  to  the
                  Adjustment  Time,  with  the  effect  that any  liability  for
                  Spin-Off Taxes relating to the Sullivan  Three  Spin-Off,  but
                  not Spin-Off Taxes relating to the Sullivan Two Spin-Off, will
                  constitute Current Liabilities.

                                    (B)    DETERMINATION    OF   SPIN-OFF    TAX
                  LIABILITIES.   The  respective  amounts  of  Sullivan's,   its
                  Subsidiaries',  Sullivan Two's and Sullivan Three's  aggregate
                  liabilities  for the Spin-Off  Taxes arising from the Sullivan
                  Two Spin- Off (the "Sullivan Two Spin-Off Tax  Liability") and
                  the Sullivan Three Spin-Off (the "Sullivan  Three Spin-Off Tax
                  Liability")  will be  determined by applying all available net
                  operating  losses  and other  items of  deduction  and  credit
                  (collectively,  "Tax Benefits").  Those Tax Benefits which are
                  permitted  under  the  applicable  Legal  Requirements  to  be
                  applied  to  reduce  either  the  Sullivan  Two  Spin-Off  Tax
                  Liability  or  Sullivan   Three  Spin-Off  Tax  Liability  (as
                  distinct from those Tax Benefits  which are only  permitted to
                  be applied to reduce one such Tax Liability but not the other)
                  will be applied pro rata,  based on the respective  amounts of
                  the  Sullivan  Two  Spin-Off  Tax  Liability  for  the  Tax in
                  question and the Sullivan Three Spin-Off Tax Liability for the
                  Tax in question  determined  prior to the  application of such
                  Tax Benefits.

                           (7) APPLICATION OF GAAP. Except as otherwise provided
         in  this  Agreement,  the  Adjustment  Amount  will  be  determined  in
         accordance with GAAP.

                  3.E  ESTIMATES OF ANNUALIZED  TRAILING CASH FLOW,  KOKH AMOUNT
AND ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT FOR CLOSING PURPOSES.

                       (1)  ESTIMATES  TO  BE  GIVEN  EFFECT.  For  purposes  of
         determining the amount of Base Merger  Consideration  to be paid at the
         Closing,  the  Annualized  Trailing Cash Flow,  the KOKH Amount and the
         Adjustment  Amount  will  be  deemed  to  be  equal  to  the  Estimated
         Annualized  Trailing  Cash  Flow,  the  Estimated  KOKH  Amount and the
         Estimated  Adjustment  Amount,  respectively,   determined  under  this
         Section 3.E.  Notwithstanding  this Section 3.E and Section 3.F, if the
         Annualized  Trailing Cash Flow has been finally determined  pursuant to
         Section  3.J,  then the  amount so finally  determined  will be used to
         determine  the amount of the Sullivan Base Merger  Consideration  to be
         paid at the Closing and the ultimate amount of the Sullivan Common Base
         Merger  Consideration,  and  the  provisions  of this  Section  3.E and
         Section  3.F will  apply  only to the KOKH  Amount  and the  Adjustment
         Amount and not the  Annualized  Trailing  Cash Flow.  For  purposes  of
         determining the Estimated  Adjustment  Amount,  the aggregate amount of
         the  Current  Liabilities  will be  assumed  to be  $5,600,000  (unless
         Sullivan proposes a larger amount in Sullivan's Estimate Report).

                       (2) SULLIVAN'S  ESTIMATE  REPORT.  At least five Business
         Days prior to any date  scheduled  for the Closing  pursuant to Section
         3.H, Sullivan will prepare and deliver to 


                                       14


<PAGE>



         Sinclair a written report ("Sullivan's  Estimate Report") setting forth
         in reasonable  detail Sullivan's good faith estimates of the Annualized
         Trailing  Cash Flow,  the KOKH Amount and the  Adjustment  Amount as of
         such scheduled  Closing date and Sullivan's  good faith estimate of the
         gross  amount  of all  Sullivan  Receivables  for which the date of the
         underlying  invoice  is not  earlier  than the  120th  day prior to the
         Closing Date (the amount of such latter  estimate  being the "Estimated
         Receivable  Amount").  After  delivery of Sullivan's  Estimate  Report,
         Sullivan will (and will cause its  Subsidiaries  to) allow Sinclair and
         its legal and accounting representatives and advisors reasonable access
         to  Sullivan's  and its  Subsidiaries'  books  and  records  to  enable
         Sinclair to verify the accuracy of the  estimated  amounts set forth in
         Sullivan's Estimate Report.  Sullivan will, in good faith, consider and
         make revisions to such estimated amounts,  but will not be obligated to
         make any adjustment with which,  in good faith, it does not agree.  The
         estimates of the Annualized Trailing Cash Flow, the KOKH Amount and the
         Adjustment Amount set forth in Sullivan's Estimate Report," as they may
         be adjusted by Sullivan as described in the preceding sentence, will be
         the  "Estimated  Annualized  Trailing Cash Flow," the  "Estimated  KOKH
         Amount" and the "Estimated  Adjustment Amount,"  respectively,  for the
         scheduled Closing date in question.

                  3.F FINAL DETERMINATION OF BASE MERGER CONSIDERATION AFTER THE
CLOSING.

                       (1) POST-CLOSING  REPORT.  On or prior to the one hundred
         tenth  (110th) day after the Closing Date,  Post-Closing  Sullivan will
         prepare and submit to the Stockholder  Representative  consolidated and
         consolidating  statements  of income for Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries
         for  the  period  beginning  on  January  1,  1998  and  ending  on the
         Measurement Date and consolidated and consolidating  balance sheets for
         Sullivan  and its  Subsidiaries  (including  each of  Sullivan  Two and
         Sullivan  Three,  as if it  were a  Subsidiary  of  Sullivan  as of the
         Adjustment Time) as of the Adjustment  Time,  together with Post-Merger
         Sullivan's  determination  of the aggregate  Base Merger  Consideration
         (the "Post-Closing Report");  provided that, if the Annualized Trailing
         Cash Flow has been finally  determined prior to the Closing pursuant to
         Section  3.J,  then  the  Post-Closing  Report  need not  contain  such
         consolidated  and  consolidating  statements  of income.  The Acquiring
         Parties will (and will cause their  respective  Subsidiaries  to) allow
         the   Stockholder   Representative   and  its  legal   and   accounting
         representatives   and  advisors   reasonable   access  to   Post-Merger
         Sullivan's  and its  Subsidiaries'  books and  records  to  enable  the
         Stockholder Representative to timely review and dispute the contents of
         the Post-Closing Report.  Post-Closing Sullivan's  determination of the
         aggregate  Sullivan Common Base Merger  Consideration  set forth in the
         Post-Closing  Report will become final and binding upon the Parties and
         the Old Sullivan Common  Stockholders on the thirtieth (30th) day after
         the  Post-Closing  Report  is given to the  Stockholder  Representative
         unless,   prior  to  such   thirtieth   (30th)  day,  the   Stockholder
         Representative gives Post-Closing  Sullivan written notice stating that
         the Stockholder  Representative  disagrees with such  determination and
         stating in reasonable detail the nature,  extent of, and basis for, the
         Stockholder   Representative's   disagreement   and   the   Stockholder
         Representative's  determination  of the aggregate  Sullivan Common Base
         Merger Consideration.

                       (2)   GOOD   FAITH   RESOLUTION.   If   the   Stockholder
         Representative  timely  gives  Post-Closing  Sullivan  such  a  dispute
         notice, then, during the thirty (30) days after the


                                       15


<PAGE>



         Stockholder  Representative  gives such dispute notice, the Stockholder
         Representative  and Post-Merger  Sullivan will attempt in good faith to
         resolve such disagreement,  and any mutual  determination of the amount
         of the  aggregate  Sullivan  Common  Base Merger  Consideration  by the
         Stockholder  Representative and Post-Merger  Sullivan will be final and
         binding upon the Parties and the Old Sullivan  Stockholders on the date
         of such mutual determination.

                       (3) ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE. If any such dispute cannot be
         resolved by the Stockholder  Representative and Post-Merger Sullivan on
         or prior to such  thirtieth  (30th)  day,  then  such  dispute  will be
         referred  to  Ernst &  Young,  and  such  firm's  determination  of the
         aggregate  Sullivan Common Base Merger  Consideration will be final and
         binding upon the Parties and the Old Sullivan  Common  Stockholders  on
         the date such  firm's  report  of its  determination  of the  aggregate
         Sullivan  Common  Base  Merger  Consideration  has  been  delivered  to
         Post-Merger Sullivan and the Stockholder Representative.

                       (4)   COMPUTATION   AND   ENTITLEMENT  TO  PAYMENT  AFTER
         RESOLUTION.  If the amount of the aggregate Sullivan Common Base Merger
         Consideration  finally  determined in accordance  with this Section 3.F
         exceeds  the  amount  of the  estimated  Sullivan  Common  Base  Merger
         Consideration paid to the Stockholder Representative for the account of
         the Old Sullivan Common  Stockholders at the Closing  (disregarding the
         amount,  if any,  deposited  in the Estimate  Fund  pursuant to Section
         3.A(3)(d)) (the "Estimated Sullivan Common Base Merger Consideration"),
         then  (subject to the  provisions of Article II regarding the surrender
         of Old Sullivan Certificates) the Old Sullivan Common Stockholders will
         be entitled  to receive  the amount of such excess  pursuant to Section
         3.F(5).  If the  Estimated  Sullivan  Common Base Merger  Consideration
         exceeds  the  amount  of the  aggregate  Sullivan  Common  Base  Merger
         Consideration  finally  determined in accordance with this Section 3.F,
         then  (subject  to  the  limitation   set  forth  in  Section   3.F(5))
         Post-Merger  Sullivan  will be  entitled  to receive the amount of such
         excess  pursuant to Section  3.F(5).  Any amount which becomes  payable
         pursuant  to  this  Section  3.F(4)  (except  to  the  extent  paid  to
         Post-Merger  Sullivan  from  the  Estimate  Fund)  will  constitute  an
         adjustment of the aggregate  Sullivan Common Base Merger  Consideration
         paid at the Closing.

                       (5) PAYMENT AFTER RESOLUTION.

                                    (A)  IF   PAYABLE   TO  THE   OLD   SULLIVAN
                  STOCKHOLDERS.  Any  amount  which  becomes  payable to the Old
                  Sullivan Common  Stockholders  pursuant to Section 3.F(4) will
                  be paid to the Stockholder Representative, for distribution by
                  the  Stockholder  Representative  to the Old  Sullivan  Common
                  Stockholders,  pro rata according to the remaining  amounts of
                  the Sullivan Common Base Merger Consideration payable to them.
                  Any such amount will be paid to the Stockholder Representative
                  from  the  amount  (if any)  deposited  in the  Estimate  Fund
                  pursuant to Section 3.A(3)(d),  to the extent of the amount so
                  deposited.  If no such deposit is made,  or if such deposit is
                  made  and the  amount  to be paid to the Old  Sullivan  Common
                  Stockholders  pursuant to Section 3.F(4) exceeds the amount so
                  deposited,  then  the  amount  (or the  remaining  amount,  as
                  applicable)  so payable  (for the Old  Sullivan  Stockholders'
                  benefit) will be paid by Post-Merger Sullivan.

                                    (B) IF PAYABLE TO POST-MERGER SULLIVAN.  Any
                  amount which becomes payable to Post-Merger  Sullivan pursuant
                  to  Section  3.F(4)  will be paid  from  the  amount  (if any)
                  deposited in the Estimate Fund pursuant to Section  3.A(3)(d),
                  to the extent of the amount so  deposited.  If no such deposit
                  is made,  or if such deposit is made and the amount to be paid
                  to Post-Merger Sullivan pursuant to Section 3.F(4) exceeds the
                  amount so deposited, then the amount (or the remaining amount,
                  as  applicable)  so payable  to  Post-Merger  Sullivan  may be
                  recovered by  Post-Merger  Sullivan from either or both of (i)
                  the proceeds of the Sullivan  Receivables received by Sinclair
                  and its Subsidiaries  during the Collection Period as provided
                  in  Section  3.G(4)  and (ii)  the  amounts  deposited  in the
                  Indemnity  Fund,  and no additional  amount will be payable to
                  Post-Merger  Sullivan  (the amount,  if any,  deposited in the
                  Estimate  Fund  pursuant to Section  3.A(3)(d),  the amount of
                  such  proceeds of the  Sullivan  Receivables,  and the amounts
                  deposited in the  Indemnity  Fund  pursuant to Section  3.G(4)
                  being  Post-Merger  Sullivan's  sole  source of payment of any
                  amount which may be owing to Post-Merger Sullivan by reason of
                  the  estimated  amount of the aggregate  Sullivan  Common Base
                  Merger Consideration paid to the Stockholder Representative at
                  the Closing being greater than the Sullivan Common Base Merger
                  Consideration as finally  determined  pursuant to this Section
                  3.F).

                                    (C) INTEREST ON CERTAIN AMOUNTS.  Any amount
                  payable  by  Post-Merger  Sullivan  pursuant  to this  Section
                  3.F(5)  will bear  interest  at the rate of 18% per annum from
                  the third  (3rd)  Business  Day after the date upon  which the
                  aggregate Sullivan Common Base Merger Consideration is finally
                  determined  in  accordance  with this  Section 3.F through and
                  including  the  date  upon  which  such  amount  and all  such
                  interest  are paid in full  (it  being  understood  that in no
                  event will  interest  be payable  to any Old  Sullivan  Common
                  Stockholder  in respect  of any period  prior to the date upon
                  which such Old Sullivan Common Stockholder  surrenders the Old
                  Sullivan  Certificate  representing  the Sullivan Common Share
                  Equivalent in question).

                                    (D)  PAYMENT OF  UNDISPUTED  AMOUNT.  To the
                  extent the aggregate Sullivan Common Base Merger Consideration
                  and the resulting  amount of any payment which may be required
                  pursuant  to Section  3.F(4) are not in  dispute,  Post-Merger
                  Sullivan  may  retain  proceeds  of  Sullivan  Receivables  as
                  provided  in  Section  3.G(4),  Post-Merger  Sullivan  or  the
                  Stockholder   Representative  will  be  entitled  to  withdraw
                  amounts from the Estimate Fund and/or the Indemnity  Fund, and
                  the  Stockholder  Representative  will be  entitled to receive
                  payments from Post-Merger Sullivan (for the account of the Old
                  Sullivan  Common  Stockholders)  of the amounts payable to the
                  Old Sullivan Common Stockholders, as the case may be.3


- -------------------

         3 By way of  illustration,  assume  that (a) the  Estimated  Adjustment
Amount is  $20,000,000,  (b) neither the amount of the Annualized  Trailing Cash
Flow nor the KOKH Amount is in dispute,  and (c) no amount is  deposited  in the
Estimate Fund. If the Post-Closing Report indicates that the

                                       17


<PAGE>




                                    (E) PAYMENTS FROM ESCROW FUNDS. All payments
                  made from the Estimate Fund or the Indemnity  Fund pursuant to
                  this Section  3.F(5) will be requested  and made in accordance
                  with  the  terms  of  the  Estimate  Escrow  Agreement  or the
                  Indemnity  Escrow  Agreement,  as applicable.  Earnings on the
                  amount  (if  any)  deposited  in  the  Estimate  Fund  or  the
                  Indemnity  Fund  will  be  paid  to the  Person(s)  ultimately
                  entitled to receive the amount so deposited, pro rata based on
                  the respective  portions of the amount  deposited in such Fund
                  to be paid to them.

                       (6) COSTS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  The prevailing party in
         any  determination  pursuant  to Section  3.F(3)  will be  entitled  to
         recover  from  the   non-prevailing   party  such  prevailing   party's
         reasonable  attorneys' fees and disbursements in addition to any amount
         owing to it at the Closing,  and the  nonprevailing  party also will be
         required to pay all other reasonable costs and expenses associated with
         such  determination;  provided  that  (a)  if  the  independent  public
         accounting firm which makes such  determination  is unable to determine
         that a party is the prevailing party, then such costs and expenses will
         be  equitably  allocated  by such firm upon the basis of the outcome of
         such  determination,  and (b) if such firm is unable to  allocate  such
         costs and  expenses  in such a manner,  then the costs and  expenses of
         such  arbitration  will be paid  one-half by  Post-Merger  Sullivan and
         one-half  by the  Stockholder  Representative  (on  behalf  of the  Old
         Sullivan  Stockholders),  and each of them  will pay the  out-of-pocket
         expenses incurred by it. Such independent accounting firm may designate
         the prevailing party for purposes of this Section 3.F(6).

                  3.G      SULLIVAN RECEIVABLES.

                           (1) DEFINED.  The  "Sullivan  Receivables"  means all
         trade and other  accounts  and notes  receivable  of  Sullivan  and its
         Subsidiaries  (including each of Sullivan Two and Sullivan  Three,  for
         this  purpose)  arising from the sale of  advertising  time  (including
         so-called  "infomercials")  and  other  paid  programming  time  on the
         Stations, determined on a consolidated basis as of the Adjustment Time.

                           (2)  COLLECTION AND  APPLICATION.  On, and during the
         120 days after, the Closing Date (the "Collection Period"), Post-Merger
         Sullivan  and   Sinclair   will,   and  will  cause  their   respective
         Subsidiaries  to,  use  reasonable  efforts  in  accordance  with their
         respective  normal  business  practices (not including  resorting to or
         threatening litigation) to collect the Sullivan Receivables,  including
         issuing invoices for those Sullivan Receivables for which invoices have
         not been issued prior to the Closing Date.  Collections from any Person
         which is a debtor with respect to any Sullivan  Receivable (a "Sullivan
         Debtor") will be applied in the chronological  order of the billings of
         Sullivan,  Sullivan Two, Sullivan 

- -------------------

Adjustment  Amount is $18,500,000  and the Stockholder  Representative  disputes
that  determination and asserts that the Adjustment Amount is $19,000,000,  then
only $500,000 is in dispute.  In that case, even prior to the resolution of such
dispute,  Post-Merger  Sullivan  will be entitled to retain from the proceeds of
the Sullivan  Receivables  as provided in Section  3.G(4),  or withdraw from the
Indemnity  Fund,  $1,000,000  (along with a  proportionate  share of the "Escrow
Income"  referred to in the Indemnity  Escrow  Agreement,  in the case of such a
withdrawal from the Indemnity Fund).

         Three,  Post-Merger  Sullivan and  their  respective  Subsidiaries,  as
         applicable,  to such  Sullivan  Debtor  (i.e.,  to  the  oldest  unpaid
         billing first) unless (i) such Sullivan Debtor disputes in writing  its
         obligation to pay such billing, (ii) such Sullivan Debtor indicates  in
         writing  that such  payment  is to be  applied  in  another,  specified
         manner, or (iii) other facts or circumstances  exist in light  of which
         it would be reasonable to conclude that such Sullivan  Debtor does  not
         intend such payment to be applied in such a manner.

                           (3)  EFFORTS  BY  STOCKHOLDER  REPRESENTATIVE  OR OLD
         SULLIVAN STOCKHOLDERS. So long as Post-Merger Sullivan and Sinclair are
         in  compliance   with  this  Section  3.G,   neither  the   Stockholder
         Representative  nor any Old Sullivan  Stockholder  will make any direct
         solicitation  of any  Sullivan  Debtor for purposes of  collecting  any
         Sullivan  Receivable  during the  Collection  Period,  except as may be
         agreed to by Post-Merger  Sullivan and the  Stockholder  Representative
         and except with respect to those Sullivan  Receivables  which may be or
         become more than 180 days past due and those Sullivan  Receivables with
         respect  to  which  Post-Merger  Sullivan,  Sinclair  or any  of  their
         respective  Subsidiaries  has received written notice of a dispute from
         the  related  Sullivan  Debtor  (a copy  of  which  notice  Post-Merger
         Sullivan will promptly forward to the Stockholder Representative).

                       (4) PAYMENT OF PROCEEDS.  After the end of the Collection
         Period  and on or  prior to the  150th  day  after  the  Closing  Date,
         Post-Merger  Sullivan  will pay over an amount  equal to the  aggregate
         proceeds  received  by  Sinclair  and its  Subsidiaries  in  respect of
         Sullivan  Receivables  during  the  Collection  Period,  plus  interest
         thereon  computed  as  described  below  (collectively,  the  "Sullivan
         Receivable  Proceeds"),  as follows  (without set-off in respect of any
         other liability or obligation of any Person,  whether arising  pursuant
         to this  Agreement  or otherwise  except as expressly  provided in this
         Section 3.G(4)):

                           (a) the sum of (x) an amount  equal to the  aggregate
                  amount of all Loss and Expense (as that term is defined in the
                  Indemnity Agreement) asserted in writing pursuant to Section 2
                  of the Indemnity  Agreement as recoverable  under Section 3 of
                  the Indemnity  Agreement and (y) the amount which  Post-Merger
                  Sullivan  asserts  in good faith it will be owed  pursuant  to
                  Section 3.F(4), if the amount of the aggregate Sullivan Common
                  Base Merger  Consideration has not been finally  determined in
                  accordance  with  Section 3.F (or, if less than such sum,  the
                  entire  amount of the Sullivan  Receivable  Proceeds)  will be
                  paid  to the  Indemnity  Escrow  Agent  and  deposited  in the
                  Indemnity Fund, and

                           (b) the remainder of the Sullivan Receivable Proceeds
                  will  be  paid  to the  Stockholder  Representative,  for  the
                  account of the Old Sullivan  Common  Stockholders,  as part of
                  the  Merger   Consideration  for  the  Sullivan  Common  Share
                  Equivalents,

         in each case by wire  transfer of  immediately  available  funds to the
         account  specified by the recipient  thereof;  provided that,  from and
         after the time when the amount of the  aggregate  Sullivan  Common Base
         Merger  Consideration is finally  determined in accordance with Section
         3.F,  if any amount is  payable to  Post-Merger  Sullivan  pursuant  to
         Section 3.F(4) based on such determination,  then Post-Merger  Sullivan
         may retain from the aggregate


                                       19

         proceeds  received by Sinclair and its  Subsidiaries  in respect of the
         Sullivan Receivables during the Collection Period the amount so owed to
         it,  and the  Sullivan  Receivable  Proceeds  will be  reduced  by such
         amount.  At the time of the  payments  described in clauses (a) and (b)
         above,   Post-Merger   Sullivan   will   deliver  to  the   Stockholder
         Representative a report which specifies the application to the Sullivan
         Receivables and other accounts  receivable of the collections  received
         during the  Collection  Period.  Interest  will be computed on the full
         amount of the Sullivan Receivable Proceeds (exclusive of interest which
         is part  thereof)  from and after the 74th day after the Closing to the
         date upon which the payments described in clauses (a) and (b) above are
         made), at the rate of 7.125% per annum.

                       (5)  TRANSFER  AFTER   COLLECTION   PERIOD.   Immediately
         following the last day of the Collection Period,  Post-Merger  Sullivan
         and Sinclair will,  and will cause their  respective  Subsidiaries  to,
         transfer and assign to the Stockholder  Representative (for the account
         of the Old Sullivan Common Stockholders) all rights with respect to the
         Sullivan Receivables to the extent they have not then been collected in
         full, together with all files concerning such Sullivan Receivables, and
         Post-Merger Sullivan,  Sinclair and their respective  Subsidiaries will
         have no further  responsibilities  pursuant  to this  Section  3.G with
         respect to any Sullivan  Receivable  except to remit to the Stockholder
         Representative (on behalf of the Old Sullivan Stockholders) as provided
         in Section 3.G(4) any Sullivan  Receivable  Proceeds received after the
         Collection  Period.  Such  transfer,  assignment  and  remittance  will
         constitute  a  part  of  the  payment  of the  Sullivan  Common  Merger
         Consideration.

                           (6)  ACCESS  TO  INFORMATION.  During  and  after the
         Collection  Period,  the Acquiring  Parties will,  and will cause their
         respective Subsidiaries to, furnish the Stockholder  Representative and
         its  agents,   representatives   and  advisors  with  all   information
         (including  reasonable  access to their  respective  books and records)
         which the Stockholder  Representative  reasonably  requests in order to
         monitor, confirm or dispute the Acquiring Parties' compliance with this
         Section 3.G.

                  3.H  CLOSING  TIME AND PLACE.  Subject to  Section  12.A,  the
consummation of the Merger and the payment of the Base Merger  Consideration for

Sub by written  notice to Sullivan not less than ten Business Days in advance of
such date (which  designated  date will be not later than the Expiration  Date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Section 12.A, if on a date for the
Closing  described  in the  preceding  sentence  or  specified  pursuant to this
sentence any condition of the Merger Sub or Sullivan  specified in Article IX or
X has not been satisfied (and will not be satisfied by the delivery of documents
at the  Closing)  or waived in writing,  then the date for the  Closing  will be
extended to any date  specified by the Merger Sub to Sullivan with not less than
10  Business  Days'  notice  to the  other  (subject  to the  Merger  Sub's  and
Sullivan's  respective  conditions to the Closing set forth in Articles IX and X
being satisfied or waived in writing on such specified date);  provided that any
such specified date will be on or prior to the Expiration Date.

                                    (e) a certified  copy of the  resolutions or
                  action  by  written  consent  of the  board of  directors  and
                  stockholders  of the Merger Sub authorizing the Merger and the

                  action  by  written  consent  of the  board  of  directors  of
                  Sinclair  authorizing   Sinclair's  execution,   delivery  and
                  performance of this Agreement;

                                    (g)  certificates as to the existence and/or
                  good  standing  of  Sinclair  and the Merger Sub, in each case
                  issued by the  Secretary of State or a comparable  official of
                  such  jurisdictions  as Sullivan  may  reasonably  request and

                  effectuate the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated
                  by this Agreement to be consummated at the Closing  (including
                  the  registration  and issuance of any  Sinclair  Common Stock
                  which is part of the Merger Consideration).

         Each  of the  foregoing  will  be  reasonably  satisfactory  in form to
         Sullivan and its legal counsel.

                  3.J    DETERMINATION OF TRAILING CASH FLOW AND GROSS REVENUES.

                       (1) GROSS REVENUES DEFINED.  The "Gross Revenues" for any
         period  means the  amount of the gross  revenues  of  Sullivan  and its
         Subsidiaries from all sources,  determined in accordance with GAAP on a
         consolidated basis, but excluding revenues (other than from the sale of
         advertising   or  paid   programming   time  on  the   Stations)  of  a
         non-recurring  nature  generated  other than in the ordinary  course of
         business.

                       (2)  EXAMINATION OF CASH FLOW REPORTS.  Without  limiting
         Section  7.C(2),  Sullivan  will (and will cause its  Subsidiaries  to)
         allow  Sinclair  and  its  legal  and  accounting  representatives  and
         advisors  reasonable access to Sullivan's and its  Subsidiaries'  books
         and  records to enable  Sinclair to  evaluate  and  dispute  Sullivan's
         determination  of the  Trailing  Cash Flow and the Gross  Revenues  set
         forth  in  each  Cash  Flow  Report.  Sullivan's  determination  of the
         Trailing  Cash  Flow or the Gross  Revenues  set forth in any Cash Flow
         Report will become final and binding upon the parties to this Agreement
         and the Old Sullivan  Stockholders on the fifteenth (15th) Business Day
         after such Cash Flow Report is given to Sinclair unless,  prior to such
         fifteenth (15th) Business Day, Sinclair gives


                                       23



<PAGE>

         Sullivan  written  notice  stating that  Sinclair  disagrees  with such
         determination and stating in reasonable  detail the nature,  extent of,
         and basis for, Sinclair's disagreement and Sinclair's  determination of
         the Trailing Cash Flow or Gross  Revenues,  as the case may be, for the
         period in question.

                       (3) GOOD  FAITH  RESOLUTION.  If  Sinclair  timely  gives
         Sullivan such a dispute notice, then, during the five (5) Business Days
         after  Sinclair gives such dispute  notice,  Sullivan and Sinclair will
         attempt  in good  faith to resolve  such  disagreement,  and any mutual
         determination  of the amount of the Gross Revenues or the Trailing Cash
         Flow,  as the case may be, for the period in question  by Sullivan  and
         Sinclair  will be final and binding upon the parties to this  Agreement
         and  the  Old  Sullivan   Stockholders  on  the  date  of  such  mutual
         determination.

                       (4) ARBITRATION OF DISPUTE. If any such dispute cannot be
         resolved  by  Sullivan  and  Sinclair  on or prior to such fifth  (5th)
         Business Day, then such dispute will be referred to Ernst & Young,  and
         such firm's  determination  of the Gross  Revenues or the Trailing Cash
         Flow,  as the case may be, for the period in question will be final and
         binding  upon  the  parties  to this  Agreement  and  the Old  Sullivan
         Stockholders on the date such firm's report of its determination of the
         Gross  Revenues or the Trailing Cash Flow, as the case may be, for such
         period has been delivered to Sullivan and Sinclair.

                       (5) COSTS OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION.  The prevailing party in
         any  determination  pursuant  to Section  3.J(4)  will be  entitled  to
         recover  from  the   non-prevailing   party  such  prevailing   party's
         reasonable  attorneys' fees and  disbursements,  and the  nonprevailing
         party  also  will be  required  to pay all other  reasonable  costs and
         expenses associated with such  determination;  provided that (a) if the
         independent  public  accounting firm which makes such  determination is
         unable to determine  that a party is the  prevailing  party,  then such
         costs and expenses  will be  equitably  allocated by such firm upon the
         basis of the  outcome  of such  determination,  and (b) if such firm is
         unable to allocate  such costs and expenses in such a manner,  then the
         costs  and  expenses  of such  arbitration  will be  paid  one-half  by
         Sullivan  and  one-half  by  Sinclair,  and  each of them  will pay the
         out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it. Such independent accounting firm
         may designate the prevailing party for purposes of this Section 3.J(5).

                       (6) OUTDATED DETERMINATION.  If the Trailing Cash Flow or
         the Gross Revenues for any period believed to be the Measurement Period
         are  determined in accordance  with this Section 3.J but such period is
         not the actual Measurement  Period,  then the Trailing Cash Flow or the
         Gross  Revenues,  as the case may be, will later be determined  for the
         actual Measurement Period in accordance with this Section 3.J.

                  3.K      MANDATORY PAYMENT TO SULLIVAN.

                       (1) WHEN MANDATORY  PAYMENT BECOMES OWING AND DUE. Except
         as provided in Section  12.B(4)(d),  on the Approval  Date a payment in
         the amount of Seventy Five Million  Dollars  ($75,000,000)  will become
         owing to Sullivan by the Merger Sub.  Whether or not this  Agreement is
         thereafter terminated pursuant to Section 12.A, such


                                       24

<PAGE>

         payment  (the  "Mandatory  Payment")  will be due and payable  upon the
         termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.A (or, if earlier,
         the  later of June 23,  1998  and the  fifth  Business  Day  after  the
         Approval  Date),  unless the Closing has occurred or the  circumstances
         described in Section  12.B(4)(d)  apply. If the Merger Sub does not pay
         such  amount on or prior to such later  date,  then  Sullivan  may seek
         payment of such amount from the Earnest Money Fund  (including by means
         a drawing under the Earnest Money Letter of Credit), in accordance with
         the  terms  of  the  Earnest   Money  Escrow   Agreement,   unless  the
         circumstances described in Section 12.B(4)(d) exist.

                       (2) RETURN OF EARNEST MONEY FUND.  Upon the making of the
         Mandatory  Payment,  the Merger Sub will be entitled to a return of the
         Earnest  Money  Fund.  Any such return to the Merger Sub of the Earnest
         Money Fund may be requested,  and will be effected,  in accordance with
         the terms of the Earnest Money Escrow  Agreement.  After receipt of the
         Mandatory  Payment by Sullivan,  at the Merger Sub's  request  Sullivan
         will  execute  and  deliver  to  the  Merger  Sub  such  joint  written
         instructions  to the Earnest  Money  Escrow Agent as the Merger Sub may
         reasonably  request in order to effect the return of the Earnest  Money
         Fund to the Merger Sub.

                       (3) TREATMENT OF MANDATORY  PAYMENT.  The Parties  intend
         that,  if the  Mandatory  Payment  is  required  to be  made,  then the
         Mandatory Payment will become the property of Sullivan, for the benefit
         of its securityholders, and (whether or not the Closing occurs) will be
         required to be repaid by Sullivan only as expressly provided in Section
         12.B(4)(d).  If the Mandatory  Payment is made,  then the amount of the
         Mandatory  Payment will  constitute a prepayment  of the portion of the
         aggregate Base Merger Consideration  payable in respect of the Sullivan
         Share  Equivalents  and will be  credited  against  the  amount of such
         portion of the aggregate  Base Merger  Consideration  to be paid at the
         Closing in cash. If this  Agreement is  terminated  pursuant to Section
         12.A after the Mandatory  Payment is made, then Sullivan may retain the
         Mandatory Payment except under the  circumstances  described in Section
         12.B(4)(d).  If this  Agreement is terminated  pursuant to Section 12.A
         prior to the  making  of the  Mandatory  Payment,  then  the  Mandatory
         Payment  will  thereupon  become  due and  payable,  except  under  the
         circumstances  described in Section  12.A(4)(d),  and the Earnest Money
         Fund will not be  released  (except to  Sullivan)  until the  Mandatory
         Payment  has been  made.  Unless  this  Agreement  has been  terminated
         pursuant  to  Section  12.A and  Sullivan  is  entitled  to retain  the
         Mandatory Payment, Sullivan will not distribute or loan the proceeds of
         the  Mandatory   Payment  to  its   stockholders  or  their  respective
         Affiliates (other than Sullivan's Subsidiaries), but may utilize all or
         a portion of such  proceeds to repay  Indebtedness  of Sullivan and its
         Subsidiaries  (so long as the amount repaid may be reborrowed,  subject
         to the satisfaction of customary conditions for the purpose of repaying
         such amount to Sinclair as provided in Section  12.B(4)(d))  or for any
         other purpose not prohibited hereunder.

                  4.G  TITLE, ETC.

                       (1)  REALTY.   The   attached   Schedule  4G  contains  a
         description   of  all  parcels  of  Realty  owned  by   Sullivan,   its
         Subsidiaries, Sullivan Two and Sullivan Three (collectively, the "Owned
         Realty").  The Person  designated as the  "Titleholder" on the attached
         Schedule 4G has good and marketable fee title to such parcel,  free and
         clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Encumbrances.  Included in the
         attached  Schedule  4G is a copy of the  policy (if any)  insuring  the
         Titleholder's title thereto as of the date of this Agreement.  Sullivan
         and  its  Subsidiaries  have  valid  leasehold  interests  in all  real
         property subject to the leases (the "Leases") described on the attached
         Schedule 4G. The attached Schedule 4G contains a description of all the
         material Leases to which Sullivan, any Subsidiary of Sullivan, Sullivan
         Two or Sullivan Three is a party as a tenant (or subtenant) or landlord
         with  respect to any  Station as of the date of this  Agreement,  other
         than any lease  pursuant to which  Sullivan or a Subsidiary (as lessor)
         leases space on a tower on terms which were  customary  when such lease
         was entered into. Neither Sullivan,  any of its Subsidiaries,  Sullivan
         Two nor Sullivan Three is in material  default under any of the Leases,
         and Sullivan,  any Sullivan Subsidiary,  Sullivan Two or Sullivan Three
         is the holder of the leaseholds purported to be granted to it under the
         Leases  under which it is a lessee.  Each of the Leases (x) is valid as
         to Sullivan,


                                       28
<PAGE>



         any Sullivan  Subsidiary,  Sullivan  Two or Sullivan  Three and, to the
         knowledge of Sullivan,  is valid as to any other party thereto,  (y) is
         in full force and effect and constitutes a legal and binding obligation
         of,  and  is  legally  enforceable  against,   Sullivan,  any  Sullivan
         Subsidiary,   Sullivan  Two  or  Sullivan   Three  and,  to  Sullivan's
         knowledge,   each  other  party  thereto,  subject  to  the  effect  of
         applicable   bankruptcy,   insolvency,    reorganization,    fraudulent
         conveyance,  arrangement,  moratorium  or similar  laws  affecting  the
         rights  of  creditors  generally  and  the  availability  of  equitable
         remedies,  and (z)  grants  substantially  the  leasehold  interest  it
         purports to grant,  including any rights to nondisturbance and peaceful
         and  quiet  enjoyment  that may be  contained  therein.  To  Sullivan's
         knowledge,  each party other than  Sullivan,  any Sullivan  Subsidiary,
         Sullivan  Two or  Sullivan  Three  is in  compliance  in  all  material
         respects with the  provisions  of the Leases.  The Owned Realty and the
         real property subject to the Leases listed in the attached  Schedule 4G
         constitute all of the real property owned,  leased or used by Sullivan,
         any Sullivan Subsidiary, Sullivan Two or Sullivan Three in the business
         and  operations of the Stations which is material to the businesses and
         operations of the Stations.

                       (2)  COMPLIANCE.  The Owned  Realty and its present  uses
         comply in all material  respects  with all  applicable  zoning laws and
         ordinances and no material  exemption or waiver  thereunder will expire
         or be terminated by reason of the Merger.  To the knowledge of Sullivan
         and  its   Subsidiaries,   there  exists  no  notice  of  any  material
         uncorrected violations of housing, building, safety, or fire ordinances
         with  respect  to the  Owned  Realty  or the real  property  leased  by
         Sullivan or a Subsidiary  pursuant to any Lease. Except as disclosed on
         the attached  Schedule 4G, the Owned Realty is currently  serviced by a
         community sewage system.

                       (3) CONDEMNATION OR DISPOSITION. Neither Sullivan, any of
         its  Subsidiaries,  Sullivan  Two nor  Sullivan  Three has received any
         notice of, and none of them has knowledge of, any pending,  threatened,
         or contemplated  condemnation  proceeding affecting the Owned Realty or
         the real  property  leased by Sullivan or a Subsidiary  pursuant to any
         Lease, or any part thereof,  or of any sale or other disposition of the
         Owned Realty or any portion thereof in lieu of condemnation.

                       (4)   NON-REALTY.    Taken   together,    Sullivan,   its
         Subsidiaries,  Sullivan Two and Sullivan Three have good title to, or a
         valid  leasehold  in, the tangible  assets  (other than the Realty) and
         personal property  included in the Station Assets,  and all such assets
         and personal  property will on the Closing Date (after the repayment in
         full of the Funded  Indebtedness of Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries  and
         all  related  interest  and other  obligations  and the  release of all
         related  Liens  and the  Mission  Guarantees)  be free and clear of all
         Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances.

                  4.H CALL LETTERS,  TRADEMARKS, ETC. Taken together,  Sullivan,
its Subsidiaries, Sullivan Two and Sullivan Three possess (and immediately after
the Merger, will possess) adequate rights,  licenses,  or other authority to use
the call letters  presently  used by the Stations and all  trademarks  and trade
names  relating to the  Stations  which are  required  for the  operation of the
Stations or which are material to the conduct of the  business of the  Stations,
in each case as presently  conducted by Sullivan and its Subsidiaries,  and have
good title to such call letters, trademarks and

Sullivan Two's and  Sullivan's  Three's  respective  rights thereto are free and
clear of all Liens other than  Permitted  Encumbrances.  None of  Sullivan,  its
Subsidiaries,  Sullivan Two and Sullivan  Three has received any written  notice
with  respect to any alleged  infringement  or  unlawful or improper  use of any
copyright,  trademark,  trade name, or other intangible  property right owned or
alleged to be owned by others and used in connection with the Stations.

                  4.I  INSURANCE.  The attached  Schedule 4I is, in all material
respects,  a correct and complete summary of the material terms of each material
policy of insurance  which is in effect on the date of this  Agreement  insuring
Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries  against loss or damage to any Station  Assets by
fire,  casualty and other hazards and risks relating to their  tangible  assets,
and each such policy of  insurance  is in full force and effect in all  material
respects.

         respect  to any  order,  writ,  injunction,  or  decree of any court or
         federal,   state,   municipal,   or  other   governmental   department,
         commission,   board,  agency,  or  instrumentality  arising  out  of  a
         proceeding  to which it is or was a party,  and on the Closing Date, no
         such item will have or  reasonably  be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Change; and

                       (2) on the date of this Agreement, there is no litigation
         pending by or  against,  or to the  knowledge  of  Sullivan  threatened
         against,  Sullivan or any of its Subsidiaries which interferes with, or
         could  reasonably be expected to interfere  with, (a) the operations of
         the Stations as  presently  conducted or (b) the ability of Sullivan to
         carry  out  the  transactions  contemplated  to be  carried  out  by it
         pursuant to this Agreement, and on the Closing Date, no such pending or
         threatened  litigation  will have or will  reasonably  be  expected  to
         result in a Material Adverse Change.

                  4.M COMPLIANCE  WITH LAWS.  Other than with respect to matters

obtaining  all  applicable  Consents:  (a) Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries,  with
respect to the Station Assets,  are in compliance in all material  respects with
all applicable Legal Requirements,  and (b) the present uses by Sullivan and its
Subsidiaries of the Station Assets which they own do not in any material respect

Sullivan of this  Agreement,  nor the  consummation by Sullivan of the Merger or
the other  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement to be  consummated  by

Legal Requirement to which Sullivan or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or of
the  certificate  of  incorporation  or  by-laws  of  Sullivan  or  any  of  its

                  4.O      SUBSIDIARIES.

                       (1)   SUBSIDIARIES'   STOCK.   All  of  the   issued  and
         outstanding  capital  stock  of each of the  corporations  named on the
         attached Schedule 4O (other than Sullivan,  and other than Sullivan Two
         and  Sullivan  Three,  as of the  Closing  Date)  is  owned  of  record
         (directly or  indirectly  through one or more of its  Subsidiaries)  by
         Sullivan free and clear of all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances.
         All such capital  stock has been  validly  issued and is fully paid and
         nonassessable,  there  is not  outstanding  any  right to  acquire  any
         capital stock or other equity  securities of any Subsidiary of Sullivan
         (by exercise of any right or by conversion, exchange or otherwise), and
         such capital stock is not subject to any option, warrant, voting trust,
         outstanding  proxy,  registration  rights  agreement or other agreement
         regarding voting rights, other than any Permitted Encumbrance.

                       (2) SUBSIDIARIES' STATUS. Each of Sullivan's Subsidiaries
         named on the  attached  Schedule 4O is a  corporation  duly  organized,
         validly  existing  and in good  standing (or having  comparable  active
         status) under the laws of the  jurisdiction  indicated on such Schedule
         under the heading  "Organization"  and has the power and  authority  to
         carry on the business  conducted by it and own the properties  owned by
         it under the laws of such


                                       32


<PAGE>

         jurisdiction  and each other  jurisdiction  in which it is  required to
         have such  authority.  A true and correct  copy of the  certificate  or
         articles of  incorporation  and by-laws of each of such  Subsidiary has
         been provided to the Merger Sub. On the Closing Date,  neither Sullivan
         nor any other  corporation  named on the attached  Schedule 4O will own
         any  shares  of stock  or other  equity  or debt  securities  of or any
         interest in any Person other than another  Person named on the attached
         Schedule 4O, Sullivan Two or Sullivan Three.

         foreign tax returns and tax reports required to be filed by Sullivan or
         any of its Subsidiaries have been timely filed (taking into account any

         availed  itself)  with the  appropriate  governmental  agencies  in all
         jurisdictions  in which such  returns and  reports  are  required to be
         filed,  and all of the foregoing  (including any summary balance sheets
         included  therein) are true,  correct,  and complete;  (b) all federal,
         state,  local and  foreign  income,  profits,  franchise,  sales,  use,
         occupation,  property,  excise, and other taxes (including interest and
         penalties) due and payable by Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries  have been
         fully  paid;  (c) no  issues  have  been  raised  in  writing  (or,  to
         Sullivan's knowledge, orally) and are currently pending by the Internal
         Revenue Service or any other taxing authority in connection with any of
         such returns and reports;  (d) no waivers of statutes of limitations as
         to tax matters  have been given or  requested  with respect to Sullivan
         and its Subsidiaries; (e) the federal, state, local, and foreign income
         tax and  franchise  tax returns of or with  respect to Sullivan and its
         Subsidiaries  have not been examined by the Internal Revenue Service or
         by appropriate state, provincial, or departmental tax authorities;  (f)
         no issue has been  raised in  writing  (or,  to  Sullivan's  knowledge,
         orally)  with  Sullivan  or  any  of its  Subsidiaries  by  any  taxing
         authority  which can  reasonably  be expected to result in a deficiency
         for  any  fiscal  year  or all  deficiencies  asserted  or  assessments
         (including interest and penalties) made as a result of any examinations
         have been fully  paid,  and no  proposed  (but  unassessed)  additional
         taxes,  interest, or penalties have been asserted; (g) neither Sullivan
         nor any of its  Subsidiaries  is (or has ever  been) a party to any Tax

         group of  corporations  (as that term is defined in Section  1504(a) of
         the Tax Code, or any analogous combined,  consolidated or unitary group
         defined under state,  local or foreign Tax law)  consisting in whole or
         in part of the parties to such agreement,  and neither Sullivan nor any
         of its Subsidiaries has any liability for the Taxes of any other Person
         (other than  Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries)  pursuant to Reg.  Section
         1.1502-6 under the Tax Code (or any similar  provision of state,  local
         or foreign Tax law) or as a transferee or successor or by contract; and
         (h) Sullivan has provided Sinclair with copies of all federal and state
         income or  franchise  tax returns  that have been filed with respect to
         Sullivan or any of its Subsidiaries since January 4, 1996.

                       (2) TAX ELECTIONS  AND SPECIAL TAX STATUS.  Except as set
         forth on the attached  Schedule 4P: (a) neither Sullivan nor any of its
         Subsidiaries  is or has  been a United  States  real  property  holding
         corporation  within the  meaning of Section  897(c)(2)  of the Tax Code
         during the applicable period specified in Section  897(c)(1)(A)(ii)  of
         the Tax Code, and


                                       33

<PAGE>

         Sinclair  is not  required  to  withhold  tax in  respect of the Merger
         Consideration  for the Sullivan Share  Equivalents by reason of Section
         1445 of the Tax Code; (b) neither  Sullivan nor any of its Subsidiaries
         has made any election or filed any consent  pursuant to Section  341(f)
         of the Tax Code  relating  to  collapsible  corporations;  (c)  neither
         Sullivan nor any of its  Subsidiaries has entered into any compensatory
         agreements  with respect to the  performance  of services which payment
         thereunder  would result in a nondeductible  expense to Sullivan or any
         of its  Subsidiaries  pursuant  to  Section  280G of the Tax Code or an
         excise tax to the recipient of such payment pursuant to Section 4999 of
         the Tax  Code;  and (d)  Sullivan  has not  agreed  to make,  nor is it
         required to make, any  adjustment  under Section 481(a) of the Tax Code
         by reason of a change in accounting method or otherwise.

                  4.Q CAPITAL STOCK. As of the date of this Agreement,  Sullivan
has authorized  capital stock consisting of 90,000,000  shares of capital stock,
of which (a) 25,000,000  shares are designated  Class A Common Stock,  par value
$0.001 per share, of which no shares are issued and outstanding,  (b) 25,000,000
shares are  designated  Class B-1 Common Stock,  par value $0.001 per share,  of
which 1,201,577  shares are issued and  outstanding,  (c) 25,000,000  shares are
designated  Class  B-2  Common  Stock,  par value  $0.001  per  share,  of which
6,158,211 shares are issued and outstanding, (d) 5,000,000 shares are designated
Class C Common Stock,  par value $0.001 per share, of which 1,021,872 shares are
issued and  outstanding,  and (e)  10,000,000  shares are  designated  Preferred
Stock,  $0.001 par value per  share,  of which  1,150,000  shares are issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Sullivan is duly
authorized and validly issued,  fully paid and  nonassessable,  and there are no
preemptive  rights in respect  thereof in favor of any  Person  (other  than any
Person which holds  Sullivan Share  Equivalents).  Except for warrants which are
presently  exercisable for 2,406,307 shares of Class B-1 Common Stock, there are
no  outstanding  options,  warrants or other rights to subscribe for or purchase
from Sullivan, no contracts or commitments providing for the issuance of, or the
granting  of  rights  to  acquire,   and  no  securities   convertible  into  or
exchangeable for, any shares of capital stock or any other ownership interest of
Sullivan.

                  4.R BOOKS AND  RECORDS.  The minute  books of each of Sullivan
and its  Subsidiaries  contain  records  which are  complete and accurate in all
material   respects  of  all  meetings  and  other  corporate   actions  of  its
stockholders,  its board of directors and all committees,  if any,  appointed by
its board of directors. The books of accounts, ledgers, order books, records and
documents of each of Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries,  in all material  respects,
accurately  and completely  reflect  information  relating to its business,  the
nature,   acquisitions,   maintenance   and  location  of  its  assets  and  the
transactions giving rise to its obligations and accounts receivable.

                  4.S ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT  UNDISCLOSED  LIABILITIES.  Neither
Sullivan nor its Subsidiaries has any debt, liability or obligation of any kind,
whether accrued, absolute,  contingent or otherwise,  including any liability or
obligation on account of Taxes or any governmental charges or penalty,  interest
or fines,  which would be required to be  reflected in  Sullivan's  consolidated
balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP and which would have, or which in
the case of  contingent  or  inchoate  liabilities,  would  have if  accrued  or
absolute,  a material adverse effect on the financial  condition of Sullivan and
its  Subsidiaries,  other than any liability or obligation  (a) reflected in any
Financial Statement,  (b) identified with particularity in any attached Schedule
or arising since  September 30, 1997 under any Contract  which is described,  or
which is not required to be described,


                                       34

<PAGE>


on any attached Schedule,  (c) incurred in the ordinary course of business since
September  30,  1997,  or (d)  incurred  in  connection  with  the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.  Each of Sullivan and Sullivan  Broadcasting has
filed  with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  all  material  documents
required by the Securities Act or the Securities  Exchange Act to be filed by it
since  January  4, 1996 (the  "Sullivan  SEC  Reports").  Neither  Sullivan  nor
Sullivan Broadcasting has any liability by reason of any Sullivan SEC Report not
complying  in all material  respects at the time of the filing  thereof with the
requirements of the Securities Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, or
the Securities  Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations  thereunder,  as the
case may be, or containing  any untrue  statement of a material fact or omitting
to state a material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not misleading.

                  4.T  EMPLOYEE  BENEFIT  PLANS.  Except  as  set  forth  on the
attached  Schedule 4T, neither Sullivan nor its  Subsidiaries  maintains or is a
party to or  makes  contributions  to any of the  following:  (a) any  "employee
pension  benefit plan," (as such term is defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"));  or (b) any "employee welfare
benefit  plan" (as such term is  defined  in  Section  3(a) of  ERISA),  whether
written or oral. All employee  benefit plans and other Benefit  Arrangements now
or formerly  maintained by Sullivan or its  Subsidiaries or to which Sullivan or
its Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute,  are, and have in the past been, in
all material  respects  maintained,  funded and  administered in compliance with
ERISA,  and other  applicable  law.  No such  employee  benefit  plan  holds any
securities issued by Sullivan.  Neither Sullivan nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
has ever sponsored or maintained,  had any obligation to sponsor or maintain, or
had any  liability  (whether  actual or  contingent,  with respect to any of its
assets or otherwise)  with respect to any employee  pension benefit plan subject
to  Section  302 of  ERISA or  Section  412 of the Tax Code or Title IV of ERISA
(including any multiemployer plan). Excluding routine claims for benefits, there
are no pending  claims or lawsuits  by,  against,  or  relating to any  employee
benefit plans or other Benefit Arrangements that would, if successful, result in
liability  of  Sullivan or any of its  Subsidiaries.  Neither  Sullivan  nor any
Subsidiary  has  maintained or contributed to any plan intended to qualify under
Section  401(a) of the Tax Code since  January 4, 1996,  other than the Sullivan
Broadcasting Company 401(k) Plan (the "401(k) Plan"). The 401(k) Plan has always
qualified in all material respects in form and operation under Section 401(a) of
the Tax  Code  and has a  currently  applicable  determination  letter  from the
Internal Revenue Service, and its trust has always been exempt under Section 501
of the Tax Code,  and nothing has  occurred  with respect to such plan and trust
that could cause the loss of such  qualification  or exemption or the imposition
of any  liability,  lien,  penalty,  or tax  under  ERISA or the Tax  Code.  The
employee benefit plans and Benefit  Arrangements  maintained by Sullivan are not
presently under audit or examination  (and have not received notice of potential
audit or examination) by any governmental authority,  and no matters are pending
with respect to the 401(k) Plan under any governmental  compliance programs.  No
employee  benefit  plan or Benefit  Arrangement  contains  any  provision  or is
subject to any law that would give rise to any vesting of  benefits,  severance,
termination,  or other payments or  liabilities as a result of the  transactions
this Agreement contemplates,  and Sullivan has not declared or paid any bonus or
other incentive  compensation or established  any severance  plan,  program,  or
arrangement in contemplation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
in each case other than those  which have been paid or which will be included as
part of the  Current  Liabilities.  Sullivan  has  made or has  recorded  proper
accruals for all required  contributions to its employee benefit plans as of the
last day of each


                                       35

<PAGE>


plan's most recent  fiscal  year,  and all benefits  accrued  under any unfunded
Sullivan  employee  benefit  plan or  Benefit  Arrangement  will have been paid,
accrued,  or otherwise  adequately  reserved in accordance  with GAAP. All group
health plans of Sullivan and its ERISA Affiliates have been operated in material
compliance with the requirements of Section 4980B (and its predecessor) and 5000
of the Code. No employee or former employee of Sullivan or its Subsidiaries, and
no  beneficiary of any such employee or former  employee,  is, by reason of such
employee's or former employee's  employment by Sullivan or such ERISA Affiliate,
entitled to receive any benefits,  including death or medical benefits  (whether
or not  insured)  beyond  retirement  or  other  termination  of  employment  as
described in Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 106,  other than
continuation coverage mandated under Section 4980B of the Tax Code or comparable
state law.

                  4.U BROKERS.  There is no broker or finder or other Person who
would have any valid claim against  Sullivan,  any  Subsidiary  thereof,  or any
Acquiring  Party for a  commission  or  brokerage  fee in  connection  with this
Agreement or the transactions  contemplated  hereby as a result of any agreement
or understanding of or action taken by Sullivan or any of its Affiliates.

                  4.V DISCLOSURE.  To the knowledge of Sullivan, no statement of
a material  fact set forth in this  Article IV  contains  any  statement  of any
material  fact  which is  untrue  in any  material  respect  or omits to state a
material  fact which is necessary in order to make the  statements  set forth in
this Article IV not misleading in any material respect.

                  4.W  ENVIRONMENTAL.  All of the operations of Sullivan and its
Subsidiaries  at or  from  any  Realty  comply  in all  material  respects  with
applicable Environmental Laws. Neither Sullivan nor its Subsidiaries has engaged
in or permitted  any  operations  or  activities  upon any of the Realty for the
purpose of or  involving  the  treatment,  storage,  use,  generation,  release,
discharge,  emission,  or disposal  of any  Hazardous  Materials  at the Realty,
except in substantial  compliance  with  applicable  Environmental  Laws. To the
knowledge  of  Sullivan,  there are no  conditions  existing  at the Realty that
require, or which with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would
likely require remedial or corrective action, removal or closure pursuant to the
Environmental Laws. To the knowledge of Sullivan,  Sullivan and its Subsidiaries
have all the material permits, authorizations,  licenses, consents and approvals
necessary for the current  operation of the Stations and for the  operations on,
in or at the Realty which are required under applicable  Environmental  Laws and
are in substantial compliance with the terms and conditions of all such permits,
authorizations, licenses, consents and approvals.

                        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF

delivery by Sinclair or the Merger Sub of this Agreement,  nor the  consummation
by  Sinclair  or the  Merger  Sub of  the  Merger  and  the  other  transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement to be consummated  by it, will  constitute,  or,
with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both,  would  constitute,  a
material  violation of or would conflict in any material  respect with or result
in any  material  breach of or any  material  default  under,  any of the terms,
conditions,  or provisions  of any Legal  Requirement  to which  Sinclair or the
Merger Sub is subject,  or of  Sinclair's  or the Merger  Sub's  certificate  of

statement of a material  fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be
stated  therein or necessary  to make the  statements  therein,  in light of the
circumstances   under  which  they  were  made,  not  misleading.   The  Parties
acknowledge  that  no  representation  or  warranty  will be  deemed  to be made
pursuant to this  Section 5.F if no Sinclair  Common  Stock is issued as part of

this Article V not misleading in any material respect.

                  reasonable  efforts to obtain the  consent of its  auditors to
                  permit  inclusion of the  Financial  Statements  in applicable
                  securities filings of Sinclair and, if Sinclair  requests,  it
                  shall  have the right to have the access  provided  by Section
                  7.C(2)(a)  to  conduct  an audit of each  Station's  financial
                  information,  and,  subject to the  foregoing,  Sullivan shall
                  cooperate with  Sinclair's  reasonable  requests in connection
                  with such audit,  including giving all reasonable  consents in
                  connection therewith; and

                                    (c) all such other information in Sullivan's
                  and its Subsidiaries' possession concerning the affairs of the
                  Stations as such Acquiring Party may reasonably request,

         in each  case at the  Acquiring  Parties'  expense;  provided  that the
         foregoing   does  not  disrupt  or  interfere  with  the  business  and
         operations of Sullivan, its Subsidiaries or any Station in any material
         respect  ("materiality," for purposes of this proviso, being determined
         by  reference to Sullivan,  each of its  Subsidiaries  and each Station
         individually, and not taken as a whole).

                  7.D HART-SCOTT-RODINO MATTERS. As soon as practicable,  but in
any event not later than March 20, 1998,  Sullivan  will  complete all documents
required  to be filed with the  Federal  Trade  Commission  (the  "FTC") and the
United  States  Department  of Justice (the "DOJ") with respect to itself and/or
its  Affiliate(s)  and  concerning  the  Merger  in  order  to  comply  with the
Hart-Scott-Rodino   Act  and  together  with  Sinclair  and/or  the  appropriate
Affiliate(s) of Sinclair who are required to join in such filings, will file the
same with the FTC and the DOJ. Sullivan will reimburse  Sinclair for one-half of
the filing fees associated with all such filings. Sullivan will promptly furnish
all materials  thereafter required by the FTC, the DOJ or any other governmental
entity  having  jurisdiction  over such  filings,  and will take all  reasonable
actions and will file and use reasonable  efforts to have declared  effective or
approved all documents and notifications  with any such governmental  entity, as
may be required under the  Hart-Scott-Rodino Act or other federal antitrust laws
for the consummation of the Merger.

                  7.E  CONSENTS.  Except as provided in Sections 6.A and 7.D, it
is agreed that (1) as between Sullivan and the Acquiring Parties, it will be the
sole  responsibility  of the  Acquiring  Parties to timely  obtain all Acquiring
Party Consents, including with respect to the Stations' network affiliations and
Program  Contracts and with respect to the Sullivan  Indentures,  (2) so long as
Sullivan  complies with its obligations  pursuant to the following  sentence and
Sections  6.A  and  7.D,  Sullivan,   the  Old  Sullivan  Stockholders  and  the
Stockholder  Representative  will not be liable to any Person for any failure to
obtain or other absence of any effective Acquiring Party Consent, and (3) except
as provided in Sections 10.C and 10.D, the absence of any effective Consent will
not excuse any Acquiring Party from consummating the Merger.  Sullivan will send
notices requesting all Consents required under Program  Contracts,  and will use
reasonable  efforts (without being required to make any payment not specifically
required by the terms of any licenses,  leases, and other contracts),  including
executing any related  agreement or undertaking which does not take effect until
the Effective Time, to obtain the Sullivan  Consents and to assist the Acquiring
Parties (at the


                                       43


<PAGE>

Acquiring Parties' request and expense) to (a) timely obtain prior all Acquiring
Party  Consents  or,  in the  absence  of any  Acquiring  Party  Consent  (where
applicable),  one or more replacement agreements,  and (b) cause each Consent or
replacement  agreement  to become  effective  as of the time of the Sullivan Two
Spin-Off,  the  time  of  Sullivan  Three  Spin-Off  or the  Effective  Time  as
applicable.

                  7.F NOTICE OF PROCEEDINGS. Prior to the Closing, Sullivan will
promptly  notify  Sinclair in writing upon becoming aware of any order or decree
or any  complaint  praying for an order or decree  restraining  or enjoining the
consummation  of  either   Spin-Off,   the  Merger  or  any  other   transaction
contemplated  by  this  Agreement,   or  upon  receiving  any  notice  from  any
governmental  department,  court,  agency,  or  commission  of its  intention to
institute an investigation into or institute a suit or proceeding to restrain or
enjoin  the  consummation  of either  Spin-Off,  the  Merger  or any such  other
transaction,  or  to  nullify  or  render  ineffective  this  Agreement,  either
Spin-Off, the Merger or any such other transaction if consummated.

                  7.G   CONFIDENTIAL   INFORMATION.   If  for  any   reason  the
transactions  contemplated in this Agreement are not consummated,  Sullivan will
not use or disclose to any Person  (except to its  agents,  representatives  and
advisors,  to its lenders and  security  holders  and their  respective  agents,
representatives  and advisors,  or as may be required by any Legal  Requirement)
any confidential  information  received from any Acquiring Party or any of their
respective agents,  representatives  and advisors (each a "disclosing party" for
purposes of this Section 7.G) in the course of investigating,  negotiating,  and
completing the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  Nothing will be
deemed to be confidential information for purposes of this Section 7.G that: (a)
is or was  known  to any  Sullivan-Related  Entity  at the  time of its  initial
disclosure by a disclosing party to any Sullivan-Related  Entity; (b) has become
or becomes  publicly  known or available  other than through  disclosure  by any
Sullivan-Related   Entity;   (c)  is  or   was   rightfully   received   by  any
Sullivan-Related Entity from any Person unrelated to any Sullivan-Related Entity
(other than any Person engaged by any Sullivan-Related Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement); or (d) is or was independently
developed by any Sullivan- Related Entity.

                  7.H  EFFORTS  TO  CONSUMMATE.  Subject  to the  provisions  of
Article IX and Section 12.A, Sullivan will use reasonable efforts to fulfill and
perform all conditions and obligations on its part to be fulfilled and performed
under this  Agreement and to cause the conditions set forth in Articles IX and X
to be fulfilled and cause the Spin-Offs,  the Merger and the other  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in connection with the Merger to be fully carried
out.  Without  limiting  the  foregoing,  Sullivan  will use, and will cause its
Subsidiaries to use,  reasonable efforts to consummate the Merger in a manner to
avoid  the  increase  in the Cash  Flow  Multiplier  caused  by any delay in the
Closing and the increase in the element of the  Adjustment  Amount  described in
Section 3.D(1)(b).  In addition,  promptly after Sullivan becomes aware prior to
the Closing of a breach of any fact or circumstance  which  constitutes or would
constitute a breach of any other Party's representation or warranty set forth in
this Agreement,  Sullivan will give such Party notice thereof so that such Party
may attempt to cure the same.

                  7.I NOTICE OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS.  Sullivan will give prompt
written notice to Sinclair if, prior to the Closing:  (1) Sullivan or any of its
Subsidiaries  receives a National Labor Relations Board union election  petition
relating to employees of any Station, (2) Sullivan or any of


                                       44

<PAGE>

its Subsidiaries receives notice from any Market Cable System currently carrying
a  Station's  signal of such  Market  Cable  System's  intention  to delete such
Station from carriage or change such Station's  channel  position on such Market
Cable System, or (3) Sullivan becomes aware of any breach of any  representation
or warranty of Sullivan set forth in Article IV.

                  7.J  UPDATED  INFORMATION.   Sullivan  agrees  to  provide  to
Sinclair  and the  Merger  Sub at or prior  to the  Closing,  for  informational
purposes  only,  copies of all Contracts in existence at the time of the Closing
which would have been  required to be described  on the attached  Schedule 4J if
such  Contracts  had existed on the date of this  Agreement and which are not so
disclosed.

                  7.K  NON-SOLICITATION.  From the date of this Agreement  until
the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement,  each of ABRY Partners
and Sullivan will not, and each of them will not cause (and will use  reasonable
efforts not to permit) any of its Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,
employees,  representatives  or agents to,  directly or indirectly  solicit,  or
initiate,  entertain or enter into any  discussions  or  transactions  with,  or
encourage  or provide  any  information  to, any Person  (other  than any Person
described  in  Section  7.C(2)),  concerning  any sale of any of the  assets  of
Sullivan or its  Subsidiaries  (other than any sale which is not  prohibited  by
Section  7.A(5))  or  any  merger,  stock  acquisition  or  similar  transaction
involving Sullivan or its Subsidiaries  (other than an issuance of capital stock
or capital  stock  equivalents  by Sullivan and the  Spin-Offs);  provided  that
nothing in this  Section  7.K will  prohibit  ABRY  Partners  or  Sullivan  from
furnishing,  or causing or permitting  any other Person to furnish,  information
concerning  Sullivan or its Subsidiaries to any governmental  authority or court
of  competent  jurisdiction  or any other Person as may be required by any Legal
Requirement.

                  7.L      INTERRUPTION OF BROADCAST TRANSMISSION.

                       (1) NOTICE OF LOSS OR  DAMAGE.  In the event of any loss,
         damage, impairment,  confiscation or condemnation of any of the Station
         Assets  prior to the  Approval  Date that  interferes  with the  normal
         operations of the Stations,  Sullivan will notify  Sinclair of the same
         in writing  promptly after Sullivan  becomes aware thereof,  specifying
         with  reasonable   particularity   the  loss,   damage  or  impairment,
         confiscation or condemnation  incurred,  the cause thereof, if known or
         reasonably ascertainable, and any applicable insurance coverage. To the
         extent  thereof,  Sullivan  will apply the  proceeds  of any  insurance
         policy,  judgment or award with respect thereto as necessary to repair,
         replace or restore such Station Assets to their prior condition as soon
         as practicable  after such loss,  damage,  impairment,  confiscation or
         condemnation.

                       (2) INTERRUPTION OF TRANSMISSION.  If before the Approval
         Date, due to damage or  destruction  of the assets of any Station,  the
         regular  broadcast  transmission  of one (1) or more of the Stations in
         the normal and usual manner is interrupted  for a period of twelve (12)
         continuous  hours or more,  Sullivan  will give prompt  written  notice
         thereof to Sinclair.  If prior to the Approval  Date,  due to damage or
         destruction  of the  assets  of one (1) or more  of the  Stations,  the
         regular  broadcast  transmission  of one  (1) or more  Stations  in the
         normal and usual manner is interrupted such that the regular  broadcast
         signal of any such Station  (including its effective radiated power) is
         diminished in any material respect, then


                                       45


<PAGE>

         (i)  Sullivan  will give  written  notice to  Sinclair  promptly  after
         Sullivan becomes aware thereof, and (ii) Sinclair shall have the right,
         by giving prompt written notice to Sullivan to postpone the Closing for
         a period up to sixty (60) days.

                       (3) FAILURE TO RESUME TRANSMISSION.  In the event any one
         (1) or more  Stations'  normal  and  usual  transmission  has not  been
         substantially  resumed  by the  date  scheduled  for  the  Closing,  as
         postponed  pursuant to Section 7.L(2) above,  Sinclair may, pursuant to
         Section  12.A(2)(c),  terminate  this  Agreement  by written  notice to
         Sullivan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Sinclair may, at its
         option, proceed to complete the Merger and complete the restoration and
         replacement  of any damaged assets of the Station in question after the
         Closing  Date,  in which event:  (a) all  insurance  or other  proceeds
         received  in  connection  therewith,  to the extent such  proceeds  are
         received  by  Sullivan  and  have  not  therefore   been  used  in  the
         restoration or  replacement  of such assets,  will be excluded from the
         Current  Assets,  and (b) the lesser of  $5,000,000  and the excess (if
         any) of the reasonable cost to complete such restoration or replacement
         over the amount of such proceeds will be included in the computation of
         the  Current  Liabilities  (the  exclusion  of  such  proceeds  and the
         inclusion of such cost being in lieu and to the exclusion of any remedy
         pursuant to the  Indemnity  Agreement in respect of the failure of such
         restoration or replacement to be completed).

                       (4)  INTERRUPTION   NOTICE/TERMINATION.   If  before  the
         Approval Date, due to damage or destruction of the Station Assets,  the
         regular  broadcast  transmission of any Station in the normal and usual
         manner is  interrupted  for a period of seven  (7)  continuous  days or
         more,   Sullivan   shall  give  prompt   written  notice  thereof  (the
         "Interruption  Notice") to Sinclair.  During the two (2) Business  Days
         after the receipt of the Interruption  Notice,  Sinclair shall have the
         right,  in its sole and absolute  discretion,  by giving written notice
         thereof to Sullivan to  terminate  this  Agreement  pursuant to Section
         12.A(2)(c).

                  7.M NO PREMATURE  ASSUMPTION OF CONTROL.  Nothing contained in
this  Agreement  will  give  any  Acquiring  Party  any  right  to  control  the
programming,  operations,  or any other matter relating to the Stations, and the
respective  licensees  thereof,  will have complete  control of the programming,
operations, and all other matters relating to the Stations (it being agreed that
in any event Sinclair will have the right to withhold its Consent to any Program
Contract to the extent  provided  in Section  7.A(3),  if not deemed  granted as
provided therein).

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                    COVENANTS OF SINCLAIR AND THE MERGER SUB

                  8.A HART-SCOTT-RODINO  MATTERS. On or prior to March 20, 1998,
Sinclair will  complete all documents  required to be filed with the FTC and the
DOJ with respect to itself and/or its  Affiliate(s) and concerning the Merger in
order to comply with the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and together with Sullivan and/or
the  appropriate  Affiliate(s)  of  Sullivan  who are  required  to join in such
filings,  will  file the same  with the FTC and the DOJ.  Sinclair  will pay the
filing fees associated with all such filings  (subject to partial  reimbursement
by Sullivan as provided in Section  7.D).  Sinclair


                                       46


<PAGE>



and the Merger Sub will promptly  furnish all materials  thereafter  required by
the FTC, the DOJ or any other governmental  entity having jurisdiction over such
filings,  and will take all reasonable  actions and will file and use reasonable
efforts to have declared  effective or approved all documents and  notifications
with   any  such   governmental   entity,   as  may  be   required   under   the
Hart-Scott-Rodino  Act or other federal  antitrust laws for the  consummation of
the Merger.

                  8.B   CONFIDENTIAL   INFORMATION.   If  for  any   reason  the
transactions  contemplated  in  this  Agreement  are  not  consummated,  each of
Sinclair  and the Merger Sub will not use or disclose  to any Person  (except to
its agents,  representatives  and advisors,  to its lenders and their respective
agents,  representatives  and  advisors,  or as may  be  required  by any  Legal
Requirement) any  confidential  information  received from Sullivan,  any of its
Subsidiaries,  Sullivan Two or Sullivan Three or any of their respective agents,
representatives  and advisors  (each a  "disclosing  party" for purposes of this
Section 8.B) in the course of  investigating,  negotiating,  and  completing the
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement.  Nothing  will be  deemed  to be
confidential  information  for purposes of this Section 8.B that:  (a) is or was
known to any Sinclair-Related  Entity at the time of its initial disclosure by a
disclosing  party to any  Sinclair-Related  Entity;  (b) has  become or  becomes
publicly   known  or   available   other   than   through   disclosure   by  any
Sinclair-Related   Entity;   (c)  is  or   was   rightfully   received   by  any
Sinclair-Related Entity from any Person unrelated to any Sinclair-Related Entity
(other than any Person  engaged by any  Sinclair-  Related  Entity in connection
with  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement);  or  (d)  is or was
independently developed by any Sinclair-Related  Entity. In addition, the Merger
Sub agrees to be bound by the same  obligations as Sinclair is bound pursuant to
the confidentiality agreement dated as of November 20, 1997 between Sinclair and
Sullivan  Broadcasting,   which  confidentiality   agreement  will  survive  the
execution  and delivery of this  Agreement  and will survive the  execution  and
termination  of this  Agreement,  and no  provision  of this Section 8.B will be
deemed to  supersede  or in any way limit any  obligation  or right  under  such
confidentiality agreement.

                  8.C  EFFORTS  TO  CONSUMMATE.  Subject  to the  provisions  of
Article  X and  Section  12.A,  each of  Sinclair  and the  Merger  Sub will use
reasonable  efforts to fulfill and perform all conditions and obligations on its
part to be  fulfilled  and  performed  under  this  Agreement  and to cause  the
conditions  set  forth in  Articles  IX and X to be  fulfilled  and  cause  each
Spin-Off,  the Merger and the  transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement in
connection with the Merger to be fully carried out. In addition,  promptly after
Sinclair or the Merger Sub becomes aware prior to the Closing of a breach of any
fact or  circumstance  which  constitutes  or would  constitute  a breach of any
representation  or warranty of Sullivan  set forth in this  Agreement,  Sinclair
will give Sullivan notice thereof so that Sullivan may attempt to cure the same.

                  8.D NOTICE OF PROCEEDINGS. Each of Sinclair and the Merger Sub
will  promptly  notify  Sullivan  (prior  to the  Closing)  or  the  Stockholder
Representative  (after the Closing) in writing upon becoming  aware of any order
or  decree  or any  complaint  praying  for an order or  decree  restraining  or
enjoining  the  consummation  of  either  Spin-Off,  the  Merger  or  any  other
transaction  contemplated by this  Agreement,  or upon receiving any notice from
any governmental  department,  court,  agency, or commission of its intention to
institute an investigation into or institute a suit or proceeding to restrain or
enjoin  the  consummation  of either  Spin-Off,  the  Merger  or any such  other
transaction,  or  to  nullify  or  render  ineffective  this  Agreement,  either
Spin-Off,  the Merger or any such other  transaction,  if consummated.  Sinclair
will give the Stockholder Representative prompt


                                       47


<PAGE>

written  notice  if any  Acquiring  Party  becomes  aware of any  breach  of any
representation or warranty of any Acquiring Party set forth in Article V.

                  8.E      CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT.

                       (1) GENERALLY.  Except as provided in Section 8.E(2), the
         Merger Sub, in its capacity as Post-Merger Sullivan after the Effective
         Time,  agrees  to employ  after the  Closing,  directly  or  indirectly
         through one or more of its  Subsidiaries,  all of those Persons who are
         common law  employees of Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries  at the time of
         the  Closing  at the same  rates of base pay and the  other  terms  and
         conditions applicable to such employment at such time, and Sinclair and
         the Merger Sub agree to  indemnify  and hold  harmless the Old Sullivan
         Stockholders, the Stockholder Representative and the present and former
         officers,  directors,  employees and agents of each of the Old Sullivan
         Stockholders,  the  Stockholder  Representative,   Sullivan  and  their
         respective  Subsidiaries  in  respect  of any  loss,  liability,  cost,
         damage,  claim or expense which may be incurred by or asserted  against
         any of them  arising out of or relating to any failure or refusal to so
         employ any such Person  (including  any change in any term or condition
         of such  employment),  or the termination of the employment of any such
         Person,  at or  after  the  Closing.  Without  limiting  the  foregoing
         indemnity,  it is acknowledged that except as provided in any agreement
         referred to on the attached  Schedule 4J, such  employees will continue
         to be at-will  employees,  and the  respective  employers may terminate
         their  employment or change their terms of  employment at will,  and/or
         Post-Merger Sullivan or its Subsidiaries may cover such employees under
         existing or new benefit  plans,  programs,  and  arrangements,  and may
         amend  or  terminate  the  terms  of  any  such  plans,   programs,  or
         arrangements at any time (in each case,  without reducing the indemnity
         obligation  set  forth  in the  preceding  sentence).  No  employee  or
         beneficiary  of Post- Merger  Sullivan or its  Subsidiaries  may sue to
         enforce  the  terms  of this  Agreement,  including  specifically  this
         Section 8.E, and no such employee or beneficiary  shall be treated as a
         third party beneficiary of this Agreement.

                       (2) EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES.  The provisions of Section 8.E(1)
         will not apply to the Corporate Personnel,  the Non-Continuing  Station
         Managers or any Person employed by Sullivan or any of its  Subsidiaries
         pursuant to an agreement  of a type  described in clause (z) of Section
         7.A(5)(b).  Sullivan will cause the  employment of each  Non-Continuing
         Manager and the Corporate  Personnel to be terminated,  effective as of
         the  time  of  the  Closing.   The  liabilities  of  Sullivan  and  its
         Subsidiaries  for  amounts  required to be paid in  connection  with or
         after the termination of any such excluded  Person whose  employment is
         terminated  prior to or at the time of the Closing will be reflected in
         the computation of the Current Liabilities.

                  8.F   SECTION   338   ELECTION.    Without   the   Stockholder
Representative's prior written consent, Sinclair will not, and will not cause or
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make an election under Section 338 of the Tax
Code, or under any analogous provision of any other Legal Requirements  relating
to Taxes, with respect to the Merger.

                                   ARTICLE IX

<PAGE>



             CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF SULLIVANAT THE CLOSING

                  The  obligation  of Sullivan to  consummate  the Merger is, at
Sullivan's option, subject to the fulfillment of the following conditions at the
time of the Closing (Sullivan expressly  acknowledging that the effectiveness of
the Sullivan Consents is not a condition to such obligation):

                  9.A      REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS.

                       (1) Each of the  representations  and  warranties  of the
         Acquiring Parties set forth in Article V, considered  without regard to
         any materiality qualifiers contained therein, will be deemed to be made
         again  at and as of the  time  of the  Closing  (other  than  any  such
         representation  or warranty which is expressly made with reference to a
         time prior to the time of the Closing,  which will be deemed  remade as
         of such time  only),  and  taken as a whole  such  representations  and
         warranties,  as so  remade,  will have been  true and  accurate  in all
         material  respects,  except  to  the  extent  of  deviations  therefrom

         have performed and complied with the covenants and agreements  required
         by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it prior to or at
         the time of the  Closing,  taken as a whole (other than the delivery of
         the Merger Consideration for the Sullivan Share Equivalents,  which the
         Merger Sub will have established to Sullivan's reasonable  satisfaction
         that it is prepared to deliver).

                  9.B      PROCEEDINGS.

                       (1) No action or proceeding will have been instituted and
         be  pending  before  any  court or  governmental  body to  restrain  or
         prohibit,  or to obtain a material amount of damages in respect of, the
         consummation of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement that,
         in the  reasonable  opinion of Sullivan,  may reasonably be expected to
         result  in  a  preliminary   or  permanent   injunction   against  such
         consummation   or,  if  the  transactions   contemplated   hereby  were
         consummated,  an order to nullify or render  ineffective this Agreement
         or such  transactions or for the recovery against any Sullivan- Related
         Entity or any officer,  director or stockholder of any Sullivan-Related
         Entity of a material amount of damages; and

                       (2) no Party will have received  written  notice from any
         governmental  body  of  (a)  such  governmental   body's  intention  to
         institute  any action or  proceeding  to  restrain or enjoin or nullify
         this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby, or to commence
         any investigation  (other than a routine letter of inquiry,  including,
         without  limitation,  a routine  Civil  Investigative  Demand) into the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (b)
         the actual  commencement of such an investigation,  in each case unless
         the same has been withdrawn, resolved, concluded or abandoned.

                  9.D SPIN-OFFS. The Required FCC Consent for each Spin-Off will
have been  Granted  and be in full  force and  effect  and all  Acquiring  Party
Consents  for the  Spin-Offs  will have been  obtained  and be in full force and
effect;  provided that the Grant and  effectiveness of such Required FCC Consent
and the effectiveness of such Acquiring Party Consents will not be conditions to
Sullivan's  obligation to consummate the Merger so long as any Sullivan  Consent
for the Spin-Offs is not in effect.

                  9.E  SUFFICIENT  FUNDS TO SATISFY  OBLIGATIONS.  Sullivan will
have  received  evidence  which is  reasonably  satisfactory  to Sullivan to the
effect that the Merger Sub and Post-  Merger  Sullivan  and/or its  Subsidiaries
have or will have the funds described in Section 11.E.

                  9.F SINCLAIR  COMMON  STOCK.  If the Merger Sub has elected to
pay part of the Merger  Consideration  for the Sullivan Share Equivalents in the
form of shares of Sinclair  Common  Stock as provided  in Section  3.A(3),  then
Sinclair  will have taken such  actions as may be  required,  or are  reasonably
requested by the Stockholder  Representative,  in order that the Sinclair Common
Stock be registered and tradeable as described in Section 3.C(3),  including any
registration,  notice of  issuance  or other  action or notice to or by  NASDAQ,
Nasdaq  National Market or any relevant  securities  exchange in order that such
shares of Sinclair Common Stock be tradeable thereon.

                  9.G OTHER.  The Merger Sub will have delivered,  or will stand
ready to deliver, to Sullivan such instruments,  documents,  and certificates as
are contemplated by Section 3.I(3).

                        CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF
                          THE MERGER SUB AT THE CLOSING

                  The   obligations   of  the  Merger  Sub  to  pay  the  Merger
Consideration  for the Sullivan Share  Equivalents  and consummate the Merger on
the Closing Date are, at the Merger Sub's option,  subject to the fulfillment of
the following conditions at the time of the Closing (Sinclair and the Merger Sub
expressly acknowledging that neither the availability to the Merger Sub of funds
sufficient to pay such Merger Consideration and to fulfill the obligations under
Section 11.E,  nor the  effectiveness  of the  Acquiring  Party  Consents,  is a
condition to such obligations):

                  10.A     REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, COVENANTS.

                       (1)  Each  of  the   representations  and  warranties  of
         Sullivan and set forth in Article IV (other than any  representation or
         warranty  which  speaks  as of a time  after the  Closing),  considered
         without regard to any materiality qualifiers contained therein, will be
         deemed  to be made  again at and as of the time of the  Closing  (other
         than any such  representation  or warranty which is expressly made with
         reference  to a time  prior to the time of the  Closing,  which will be
         deemed  remade  as of such  time  only),  and  taken  as a  whole  such
         representations  and warranties,  as so remade, will have been true and
         accurate,  except  to the  extent  of  deviations  therefrom  which are
         permitted or contemplated by this Agreement or which, in the aggregate,
         do not constitute and have not caused a Material Adverse Change;


                                       50

         and

                       (2) Sullivan will in all material respects have performed
         and  complied  with  the  covenants  and  agreements  required  by this
         Agreement  to be  performed  or complied  with by it prior to or at the
         time of the Closing, taken as a whole.

                  10.B     PROCEEDINGS.

                       (1) No action or proceeding will have been instituted and
         be  pending  before  any  court or  governmental  body to  restrain  or
         prohibit,  or to obtain a material amount of damages in respect of, the
         consummation of the  transactions  contemplated by this Agreement that,
         in the  reasonable  opinion of Sinclair,  may reasonably be expected to
         result  in  a  preliminary   or  permanent   injunction   against  such
         consummation   or,  if  the  transactions   contemplated   hereby  were
         consummated,  an order to nullify or render  ineffective this Agreement
         or such  transactions or for the recovery against any Sinclair- Related
         Entity or any officer,  director or stockholder of any Sinclair-Related
         Entity of a material amount of damages; and

                       (2) no Party will have received  written  notice from any
         governmental  body  of  (a)  such  governmental   body's  intention  to
         institute  any action or  proceeding  to  restrain or enjoin or nullify
         this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated hereby, or to commence
         any investigation  (other than a routine letter of inquiry,  including,
         without  limitation,  a routine  Civil  Investigative  Demand) into the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (b)
         the actual  commencement of such an investigation,  in each case unless
         the same has been withdrawn, resolved, concluded or abandoned.

                  10.C  HART-SCOTT-RODINO  AND  OTHER  CONSENTS.  The  requisite
waiting  period  under the  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Act for the  consummation  of the
Merger will have expired or been terminated and all Sullivan  Consents will have
been obtained and be effective.  If the representation and warranty set forth in
the final  sentence  of  Section  4.N is  untrue,  then each  Consent  of a type
described therein will have been obtained and be effective.

                  10.D  SPIN-OFFS.  The Required FCC Consents for the  Spin-Offs
will have been Granted and be in full force and effect and  Sullivan  will stand
ready to effect, or will have effected, the Spin-Offs,  and each of Sullivan Two
and Sullivan Three will have entered into the New LMA applicable to it; provided
that the  foregoing  will not be  conditions  to the Merger Sub's  obligation to
consummate  the Merger so long as any  Acquiring  Party Consent to a Spin-Off or
the Merger is not in effect.

                  10.E MINIMUM GROSS REVENUES.  The amount of the Gross Revenues
for the Measurement  Period will have been determined in accordance with Section
3.J and will be not less than the amount set forth below:

                  10.F LIMIT ON DISSENTERS. The holders of Sullivan Common Stock
who have  demanded  appraisal  pursuant to Section 262 of the  Delaware  General
Corporation  Act and who have not  subsequently  withdrawn  or  waived  (or been
deemed  to have  withdrawn  or  waived)  or who are not  otherwise  barred  from
requiring any such  appraisal,  if there are any such holders at the time of the
Closing,  will not hold  Sullivan  Common  Stock  which  (absent  such  right of
appraisal)  would be entitled to receive in excess of 6% of the aggregate Merger
Consideration  for the  Sullivan  Share  Equivalents  (determined  based  on the
Estimated  Annualized  Trailing Cash Flow, or the Annualized Trailing Cash Flow,
if it has been  finally  determined  in  accordance  with  Section  3.J, and the
Estimated KOKH Amount and the Estimated Adjustment Amount determined pursuant to

                                   ARTICLE XI

                              POST-CLOSING MATTERS

                  11.A   SURVIVAL.    The   representations,    warranties   and
certifications  of the Parties  contained in or made pursuant to this  Agreement
(including  any  certification  contained  in any  certificate  to be  delivered
pursuant to Section 3.I) will survive the  execution of this  Agreement  and the
Closing only to the extent expressly  provided in the Indemnity  Agreement.  The
covenants and agreements of the Parties set forth in this Agreement will survive
until performed and discharged in full.

                  11.B  LIMITATION  OF  RECOURSE.  Except  as  provided  in  the
Indemnity  Agreement,  after the Closing,  no claim may be brought or maintained
against any Party or any Old  Sullivan  Stockholder  or any of their  respective
present or former  officers,  directors,  employees or other  affiliates  by any
Party or Old Sullivan  Stockholder or any of its  successors or assigns,  and no
recourse may be sought or granted against any Person, by virtue of or based upon
any  alleged   misstatement,   omission,   inaccuracy   in,  or  breach  of  any
representation,  warranty  or  certification  of any  Party set forth in or made
pursuant  to this  Agreement,  and in no  event  will  Sinclair  or  Post-Merger
Sullivan be entitled to claim or seek any rescission of the Merger or any of the
other


                                       52

<PAGE>


transactions  consummated pursuant to the Transaction Documents,  any such right
of  rescission or rights to damages  which any such Party might  otherwise  have
being  hereby  expressly  waived  and any  claims  or  judgments  being  limited
accordingly; provided that nothing in this Agreement will constitute a waiver of
or limit any Old  Sullivan  Stockholder's  recourse  or remedy  pursuant  to any
federal or state  securities  laws arising out of or relating to the offering or
issuance of Sinclair Common Stock hereunder.

                  11.C  ACKNOWLEDGMENT  BY THE  ACQUIRING  PARTIES.  Each of the
Acquiring   Parties  has  conducted,   to  its   satisfaction,   an  independent
investigation and verification of Sullivan,  its Subsidiaries,  the Stations and
the Station Assets and the financial condition,  results of operations,  assets,
liabilities,  properties and projected operations of Sullivan, its Subsidiaries,
the Stations and the Station Assets. In determining to enter into this Agreement
and proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each Acquiring
Person has relied on the covenants of Sullivan,  the results of such independent
investigation  and  verification  and  the  representations  and  warranties  of
Sullivan (in conjunction with the Schedules  hereto) set forth in this Agreement
(including  the  certifications  to be made in any  certificate  to be delivered
pursuant to Section 3.I), all of which each  Acquiring  Party  acknowledges  and
agrees will survive for a limited duration. SUCH REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
CERTIFICATIONS CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND
CERTIFICATIONS WITH RESPECT TO SULLIVAN, ITS SUBSIDIARIES,  THE STATIONS AND THE
STATION  ASSETS TO THE  ACQUIRING  PARTIES IN CONNECTION  WITH THE  TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED  HEREBY,  AND EACH ACQUIRING PARTY  UNDERSTANDS,  ACKNOWLEDGES  AND
AGREES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND CERTIFICATIONS OF ANY KIND
OR NATURE AND WHETHER ORAL OR CONTAINED IN ANY WRITING OTHER THAN THIS AGREEMENT
OR ANY SUCH  CERTIFICATE  (INCLUDING  WITHOUT  LIMITATION,  ANY  REPRESENTATION,
WARRANTY  OR  CERTIFICATION  RELATING  TO THE  PROJECTED,  FUTURE OR  HISTORICAL
FINANCIAL  CONDITION,  RESULTS OR OPERATIONS,  ASSETS OR LIABILITIES RELATING TO
THE  STATIONS)  ARE  SPECIFICALLY   DISCLAIMED  BY  SULLIVAN,   THE  STOCKHOLDER
REPRESENTATIVE,  THE  OFFICERS  OF  SULLIVAN  AND ITS  SUBSIDIARIES  AND THE OLD
SULLIVAN STOCKHOLDERS.

                  11.D  CORPORATE  NAMES.  After the Merger  (but on the Closing
Date),  Post- Merger Sullivan will take and will cause its  Subsidiaries to take
such action as is necessary to change its corporate  name in its  certificate or
articles of incorporation  filed with the Secretary of State or similar official
of the jurisdiction of its  incorporation to a name which does not include,  and
is not confusingly similar to, the name "Sullivan" and will cease the use of all
Sullivan  Broadcasting  logos or any similar mark.  Notwithstanding  anything in
this Agreement to the contrary,  Post-Merger  Sullivan and its Subsidiaries will
be entitled to  continue  to use its present  corporate  name until such time as
such name change is effective  and to the extent  necessary to  accomplish  such
name change, and may endorse checks and other instruments in such name.

                  11.E SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS. On the Closing Date,
immediately  after the Effective  Time,  the Merger Sub will,  and Sinclair will
cause Post-Merger Sullivan and each of Post-Merger  Sullivan's  Subsidiaries to,
pay in full all Funded  Indebtedness of Sullivan and its  Subsidiaries  pursuant
to, and otherwise satisfy all obligations of Sullivan and its


                                       53


<PAGE>

Subsidiaries  under,  the  Sullivan  Senior  Debt  Arrangements  and the Mission
Guarantees  (other than Funded  Indebtedness  incurred  pursuant to any Sullivan
Indenture,  to the extent  any  Consent  necessary  to permit the same to remain
outstanding  after the Closing) . Without limiting the foregoing,  Sinclair will
cause Post-Merger Sullivan and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries to have on the
Closing Date funds which are sufficient to permit  Post-Merger  Sullivan  and/or
its Subsidiaries to take the actions  contemplated by this Section 11.E and will
cause the Merger Sub to have funds necessary to permit the Merger Sub to pay the
Merger Consideration for the Sullivan Share Equivalents and make the deposit (if
any) in the Estimate Fund pursuant to Section 3.A(3)(d).

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                   TERMINATION

                  12.A  TERMINATION  OF AGREEMENT  PRIOR TO CLOSING.  Subject to

         "Sullivan Termination Notice") to Sinclair:

                                    (a) at any time when any material  breach by

                           adversely  affects  the  likelihood  that  any of the
                           conditions  set forth in any of Article IX or Article
                           X which  has not been  satisfied  or  waived  will be
                           satisfied or  materially  and  adversely  affects any
                           Party's   ability  to  comply  with  its  obligations
                           pursuant to this Agreement, and

                           elapsed since Sullivan gave Sinclair  written  notice
                           requesting  that  such  Acquiring  Party   cure  such
                           breach,

                  unless prior to the giving of the Sullivan  Termination Notice
                  each such breaching Acquiring Party has cured such breach;

                                    (b) at any time  after  the  Merger  Sub has
                  failed to make the Mandatory  Payment when required by Section
                  3.K(1),  if the Merger Sub has not made the Mandatory  Payment
                  prior to the giving of such  Sullivan  Termination  Notice (in
                  which event the termination of this Agreement  pursuant to the
                  delivery of such Sullivan Termination Notice will be effective

                  Payment is made prior to such time);

                                    (c) at any time after the  Expiration  Date,

                           any set forth in Sections 9.D and 10.D) was satisfied

                                            (iii) the absence of satisfaction of
                           each of Sullivan's and the Merger Sub's conditions to
                           closing  set forth in Articles IX and X which was not
                           waived in writing or satisfied  as of the  Expiration

                           Parties of any provision of this Agreement, or

                           Parties and the Affiliates thereof refused, failed or
                           declined  to take any action  (other  than  divesting

                           staff of any of them indicates to any Acquiring Party

                  12.A(1)(c),  unless  the  absence of  satisfaction  of each of
                  Sullivan's  and the Merger Sub's closing  conditions set forth
                  in Articles IX and X which has not been satisfied or waived in
                  writing  has  been  caused  by a  breach  by  Sullivan  of its
                  obligations under this Agreement.

                  Sullivan of its  obligations  pursuant to this  Agreement  has
                  occurred and is continuing, if both

                           adversely  affects  the  likelihood  that  any of the
                           conditions  set forth in Article IX or Article X will
                           be satisfied or materially and adversely  affects any
                           Party's ability to comply

                  since Sinclair gave Sullivan  notice of the occurrence of such
                  Material  Adverse  Change,  unless the facts or  circumstances
                  causing or constituting such Material Adverse Change have been

                  $71,630,000;

                                    (e) at any time after the  Expiration  Date,
                  under any circumstances described in Section 12.A(1)(c); or

                                    (f) at any time after the  Expiration  Date,
                  in any case not described in Section 12.A(2)(e).

                       (3) WHEN  TERMINATION  NOT  PERMITTED.  Sullivan  may not
         terminate this Agreement  pursuant to Section  12.A(1) at any time when

                       (2) DISPOSITION OF EARNEST MONEY FUND AND INCOME. If this
         Agreement  is  terminated  pursuant  to  any  of  Sections  12.A(1)(a),
         12.A(1)(b),  12.A(1)(c) or 12.A(2)(e), then the Earnest Money Fund will
         be paid to Sullivan (unless the Mandatory  Payment has theretofore been
         made  to  Sullivan),  and  all  Earnest  Money  Income  will be paid to
         Sinclair.  If this Agreement is terminated  pursuant to any of Sections
         12.A(1)(d),   12.A(2)(a),   12.A(2)(b),   12.A(2)(c),   12.A(2)(d)   or
         12.A(2)(f),  then the Earnest  Money Fund and all Earnest  Money Income
         will be paid to  Sinclair  (unless  the  Mandatory  Payment  is due and
         payable and has not been paid, in which case the Mandatory Payment will
         be made from the Earnest Money Fund and the Earnest  Money Income,  and
         the remainder thereof will be paid to Sinclair). Any payment to be made
         pursuant to this Section 12.B(2) may be requested, and will be made, in
         accordance with the Earnest Money Escrow Agreement.

                       (3) FOR SULLIVAN.  Sullivan's  sole and exclusive  remedy
         for any  termination of this Agreement or any failure of performance or
         compliance  by any  Acquiring  Party  with any  covenant  or  agreement
         contained in this  Agreement  prior to the Closing  will be  Sullivan's
         right (if any) to receive  the  Earnest  Money Fund as  provided in the
         Earnest  Money Escrow  Agreement  (or its right,  if any, to receive or
         retain the Mandatory  Payment,  unless otherwise  expressly provided in
         Section 12.B(4)(d), as liquidated damages and not as a penalty).

                       (4) FOR THE ACQUIRING  PARTIES.  The  Acquiring  Parties'
         sole and exclusive  remedies for the  termination  of this Agreement or
         any failure of  performance or compliance by Sullivan with any covenant
         or agreement contained in this Agreement prior to the Closing will be

                                    (a) in the  case  of  any  such  termination
                  pursuant to Section 12.A, Sinclair's right (if any) to receive
                  the Earnest Money Fund and the Earnest Money Income (including
                  the right to any Earnest  Money Income not yet received by the
                  Earnest Money Escrow Agent) as provided in Section 12.B(2) and
                  the Earnest Money Escrow Agreement;

                                    (b) in the case of any such  failure,  their
                  respective  rights (if any) under  applicable law or equitable
                  principles   to  seek  damages  in  respect  of  their  direct
                  out-of-pocket  losses  or  expenses  (but not any  damages  in
                  respect of lost profits or other similar or  consequential  or
                  incidental damages) occasioned by and as a consequence of such
                  breach;

                                    (c) their  respective  rights (if any) under
                  applicable  law  or  equitable  principles  to  seek  specific
                  enforcement  of this  Agreement  against  Sullivan,  including
                  specific  enforecement of Sullivan's  obligation to consummate
                  the  Merger  (subject  to  FCC  approval  and  other  required
                  Consents being  obtained),  it being  acknowledged by Sullivan
                  that the Acquiring  Parties would not have an adequate  remedy
                  at law in the  event of any  such  failure,  provided  that no
                  Acquiring Party will be entitled to such specific  performance
                  unless (i) each  Acquiring  Party has complied in all material
                  respects with its material  obligations  under this  Agreement
                  and (ii) either (A) each  condition to closing of Sullivan set
                  forth in Article IX has been


                                       57


<PAGE>

                  satisfied   or  waived  in  writing  or  (B)  the  absence  of
                  satisfaction  of each such  condition to closing which has not
                  been  satisfied  or waived in  writing  is caused  solely by a
                  breach by Sullivan of its obligations under this Agreement;

                                    (d) in the  case of any such  failure  after
                  the  Approval  Date,  the  release  of the Merger Sub from the
                  obligation  to pay,  or the return of, as the case may be, the
                  Mandatory  Payment,   if  (i)  Sinclair  has  terminated  this
                  Agreement   pursuant   to   Section   12.A(2)(a)   or  Section
                  12.A(2)(d), (ii) each Acquiring Party complied in all material
                  respects with its material  obligations  under this  Agreement
                  prior to such  termination,  and (iii) if Sinclair  terminated
                  this Agreement pursuant to Section 12.A(2)(a), then either (A)
                  each  condition  to  closing  set  forth  in  Articles  IX was
                  satisfied  or waived in writing as of the  Expiration  Date or
                  (B) the absence of  satisfaction  of each such condition which
                  was not  satisfied  or waived in writing as of the  Expiration
                  Date  was  caused  solely  by a  breach  by  Sullivan  of  its
                  obligations under this Agreement (it being agreed that, except
                  as  expressly  provided  in this  Section  12.B(4)(d),  if the
                  Approval Date occurs and this Agreement is terminated prior to
                  the Closing,  then the Merger Sub will nonetheless be required
                  to make the Mandatory  Payment and, if the  Mandatory  Payment
                  has been made prior to such termination, then Sullivan will be
                  entitled to retain the Mandatory Payment); and

                                    (e)  if (i)  Sinclair  has  terminated  this
                  Agreement  pursuant to Section  12.A(2)(a)  based on a willful
                  breach of this Agreement by Sullivan,  (ii) the  circumstances
                  described  in  clauses  (ii) and (iii) of  Section  12.B(4)(d)
                  apply,  and (iii) Sinclair has disclaimed in writing its right
                  to  seek   specific   performance   as  described  in  Section
                  12.B(4)(c) or Sinclair has asserted such right and such remedy
                  has been  denied  in a final,  nonappealable  judgment  on the
                  grounds  that the  obligation  of Sullivan to  consummate  the
                  Merger   hereunder  is  not  of  a  type  for  which  specific
                  enforcement  is an  available  remedy,  then  in  addition  to
                  Sinclair's  right to  receive  the  Earnest  Money Fund as the
                  Earnest Money Income as provided in Section  12.B(4)(a),  upon
                  the  occurrence of the event  described in clause (iii) above,
                  Sullivan  will pay to  Sinclair  the  amount of  Seventy  Five
                  Million Dollars ($75,000,000) in cash as liquidated damages.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

                  13.A EXPENSES.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement,  Sullivan will bear all of the expenses incurred prior to the Closing
by  Sullivan  and  the  Stockholder   Representative   in  connection  with  the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreemen,  and each of the Acquiring  Parties
will bear all of its  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with the  transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement,  in each case  including,  without  limitation,
account ing and legal fees incurred in connection herewith.

                  13.B     ASSIGNMENTS.

                       (1) BY SULLIVAN.  This  Agreement  may not be assigned by
         Sullivan without the prior written consent of the Acquiring Parties.

                       (2) BY SINCLAIR OR THE MERGER SUB.  Prior to the Closing,
         this  Agreement  may be  assigned by Sinclair or the Merger Sub (or the
         Merger Sub may cease to be a wholly-owned  Subsidiary of Sinclair prior
         to the Closing) only with the prior written consent of Sullivan, except
         that at any time  Sinclair  or the Merger Sub may assign its rights and
         interests  hereunder  absolutely  to one or more directly or indirectly
         wholly-owned  Subsidiaries of Sinclair without  obtaining such consent;
         provided in each case, that the assigning Person gives Sullivan,  prior
         to the Closing, or the Stockholder  Representative,  after the Closing,
         prior written notice of such  assignment and that such  assignment will
         not delay the  satisfaction  of any  condition  to closing set forth in
         this Agreement,  and provided further that any such assignment will not
         relieve the assigning  Person of any of its  obligations or liabilities
         hereunder.

                       (3) EXCEPTIONS.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Party
         may assign its rights under this Agreement for collateral purposes only
         to any lender to it, or any agent for any such  lender(s),  without the
         consent of any other  Party,  and any such lender or agent may transfer
         such rights  pursuant to the exercise of remedies  with respect to such
         collateral  security to any other Person (it being  understood that any
         such lender or agent will be a third-party beneficiary of the agreement
         constituted by this Section 13.B(3)).

                           (4)  GENERAL  RULES.   Any  attempt  to  assign  this
         Agreement  or  any  rights  or  obligations   hereunder  without  first
         obtaining  any consent  which is required by this  Section 13.B will be
         void.  This  Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
         the  parties  hereto  and their  respective  successors  and  permitted
         assigns.  Each  Old  Sullivan  Stockholder  is an  express  third-party
         beneficiary of this Agreement.

                  13.C FURTHER  ASSURANCES.  From time to time prior to, at, and
after the  Closing,  each Party will execute all such  instruments  and take all
such  actions as any other of them,  being  advised by counsel,  may  reasonably
request in connection with carrying out and  effectuating the intent and purpose
hereof,  and  all  transactions  and  things  contemplated  by  this  Agreement,
including the execution and delivery of any and all consents,  confirmatory  and
other instruments,  in addition to those to be delivered at the Closing, and any
and all actions which may  reasonably be necessary to complete the  transactions
contemplated hereby.

                  13.D NOTICES.  All notices,  demands, and other communications
which may or are  required to be given under or with  respect to this  Agreement

                       the Closing) and the Stockholder  Representative given in
                       accordance with this Section 13.D.

                  13.E  CAPTIONS.  The captions of Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for  convenience  only, and will not control or affect the meaning
or construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

                  13.F  LAW  GOVERNING.  THIS  AGREEMENT  WILL BE  GOVERNED  BY,
CONSTRUED,  AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT  REFERENCES  TO THE  PRINCIPLES  OF CONFLICT OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FEDERAL LAW OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNS THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

                  13.G   WAIVER   OF   PROVISIONS.    The   terms,    covenants,
representations,  warranties,  and conditions of this Agreement may be waived as
to any Party only by a written  instrument  executed by such  Party.  The terms,
covenants, representations,  warranties, and conditions of this Agreement may be
waived as to any Old Sullivan  Stockholder only by a written instrument executed
by Sullivan, prior to the Closing, or the Stockholder Representative,  after the
Closing. The failure of any Party or any Old Sullivan Stockholder at any time or
times to require  performance  of any  provision  of this  Agreement  will in no
manner  affect the right at a later date to enforce the same. No waiver by or on
behalf of any Party to this  Agreement  or any Old Sullivan  Stockholder  of any
condition or the breach of any provision,  term,  covenant,  representation,  or
warranty  contained in this Agreement,  whether by conduct or otherwise,  in any
one or more  instances,  will be  deemed  to be or  construed  as a  further  or
continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of any other provision,
term, covenant, representation, or warranty of this Agreement.

                  13.H  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more  counterparts,  and all counterparts so executed will constitute one (1)
agreement  binding on all of the parties  hereto,  notwithstanding  that all the
parties hereto are not signatory to the same counterpart.

                  13.I ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto) and the  confidentiality  agreement  referred to in Section
8.C (including  the Acquiring  Parties'  obligations  with respect  thereto,  as
provided in Section  8.C),  constitute  the entire  agreement  among the parties
hereto  pertaining to the subject  matter hereof and supersede any and all prior
agreements,  understandings,  negotiations,  and  discussions,  whether  oral or
written, between them relating to the subject matter hereof.

                  13.J     ACCESS TO BOOKS AND RECORDS.

                       (1)  Post-Merger   Sullivan  will,  and  will  cause  its
         Subsidiaries  to,  preserve  for not less than five (5) years after the
         Closing Date all books and records included in the


                                       61


<PAGE>

         Station Assets. After such five-year period,  Post-Merger Sullivan will
         not,  and will not cause or permit its  Subsidiaries  to,  destroy  any
         books or records  relating to the  conduct of business of the  Stations
         prior to the Effective Time unless Post-Merger Sullivan first offers to
         transfer such books and records to the Stockholder Representative at no
         cost to the Stockholder Representative,  and if Post-Merger Sullivan is
         requested to do so,  Post-Merger  Sullivan  will  transfer,  or cause a
         Subsidiary of Post-Merger  Sullivan to transfer,  such books or records
         to the Stockholder Representative.

                       (2) At the  request  of the  Stockholder  Representative,
         Post-Merger  Sullivan will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
         permit  the   Stockholder   Representative   (including  its  officers,
         employees,  accountants, and counsel) any access, upon reasonable prior
         written notice during normal  business  hours,  to all of its property,
         accounts,  books, contracts,  records, accounts payable and receivable,
         records of employees,  FCC logs and other  information  concerning  the
         affairs or operation of the Stations as the Stockholder  Representative
         may  reasonably  request  for any  reasonable  purpose  relating to the
         transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  or  the  ownership  or
         operation  of any  Station  prior to the  Effective  Time,  and to make
         extracts   or   copies   from   the   foregoing   at  the   Stockholder
         Representative's  expense. At Post-Merger  Sullivan's request, prior to
         receiving   any   such   requested    information,    the   Stockholder
         Representative  will execute a  confidentiality  agreement with respect
         thereto which is reasonably acceptable to Post-Merger Sullivan.

                  13.K  PUBLIC  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Prior to the  Closing,  no Party
will, except by mutual agreement of Sullivan and Sinclair  (including  agreement
as to  content,  text and method of  distribution  or  release),  make any press
release or other public  announcement or disclosure  concerning the transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  except  as may  be  required  by  any  Legal
Requirement  (including filings and reports required to be made with or pursuant
to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission); provided that, prior to
making any such announcement or disclosure required by any Legal Requirement, to
the extent practicable, the disclosing Party gives each Person named above prior
written notice of the context,  text and content of, the method of  distribution
or release of, and all other material facts concerning, such disclosure.

                  13.L  DISCLOSURE.  If and to the extent  that any  information
required to be furnished  by Sullivan in any  attached  Schedule is contained in
this Agreement or in any attached  Schedule,  such information will be deemed to
have been included in each other attached  Schedule in which such information is
required to be included to the extent its  relevance to such latter  Schedule is
reasonably  apparent.  By including any  information  in any attached  Schedule,
Sullivan  will  not be  deemed  to  have  admitted  or  acknowledged  that  such
information  is material to or outside the  ordinary  course of the  business of
Sullivan or any Station.

                  13.M     DEFINITIONAL PROVISIONS.

                           (1) TERMS DEFINED IN APPENDIX.  Each capitalized term
         which  is used  and not  otherwise  defined  in this  Agreement  or any
         attached  Schedule has the meaning  which is specified for such term in
         the Appendix which is attached to this Agreement.

                       (2)  MATERIALITY.  For purposes of Sections  9.A(2),  and
         10.A(2),  materiality  (as  embodied  in the  phrase  "in all  material
         respects"  will be measured by reference to the business or  operations
         of the  Stations,  taken as a whole,  the value of the Station  Assets,
         taken as a whole, or the ability of Sullivan or Sinclair and the Merger
         Sub, taken as a whole,  as the case may be, to perform or carry out the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as the context requires.

                       (3)  KNOWLEDGE.  As  used  in this  Agreement,  the  term
         "knowledge"  of  Sullivan  will  refer  only to the  actual  knowledge,
         without any particular inquiry (except as specified in this Agreement),
         of the  Corporate  Personnel,  Andrew  Banks and Royce  Yudkoff,  after
         inquiry of the general managers of the Stations; and the "knowledge" of
         Sinclair  or the Merger  Sub will  refer only to the actual  knowledge,
         without any particular  inquiry (except as specified in this Agreement)
         of David Smith and David Amy.

                       (4)   INTERPRETATION.   Words  used  in  this  Agreement,
         regardless of the gender and number  specifically  used, will be deemed
         and  construed  to include  any other  gender,  masculine,  feminine or
         neuter,  and any other  number,  singular  or  plural,  as the  context
         requires.  Whether or not used in  conjunction  with the words "without
         limitation" or words of similar import, the term "including" as used in
         this Agreement imports that the items referred to are illustrative only
         and do not purport to be a complete listing of the items of the type in
         question. The wording of the provisions of this Agreement is the result
         of arms-length negotiations among the parties to this Agreement and was
         selected by them to reflect  their  mutual  intentions;  therefore,  no
         party will be deemed the  "drafter"  of this  Agreement  and no rule of
         strict construction will be applied against or in favor of any party to
         this Agreement.

                  13.N     ARBITRATION.

                       (1)  GENERALLY.  Except  as  expressly  provided  in  the
         Estimate  Escrow  Agreement or the  Indemnity  Escrow  Agreement or for
         purposes of pursuing  any remedy  pursuant to Section  12.B(3)(b),  the
         arbitration  procedures described in this Section 13.N will be the sole
         and exclusive  method of resolving and remedying  claims  arising under
         this  Agreement  and  the  other  Transaction  Documents  ("Disputes");
         provided  that nothing in this Section 13.N will  prohibit a Party from
         instituting  litigation to enforce any Final Arbitration Award.  Except
         as  otherwise  provided  in the  Commercial  Arbitration  Rules  of the
         American  Arbitration  Association  as in effect from time to time (the
         "AAA Rules"), the arbitration procedures described in this Section 13.N
         and any  Final  Arbitration  Award  will be  governed  by,  and will be
         enforceable  pursuant to, the Uniform  Arbitration  Act as in effect in
         the State of New York from time to time.  No Person will be entitled to
         claim or recover punitive damages in any such proceeding.

                       (2) NOTICE OF ARBITRATION.  If a Party asserts that there
         exists a Dispute,  then such Person (the "Disputing  Person") will give
         each other  Person  involved in such Dispute a written  notice  setting
         forth the nature of the  asserted  Dispute.  If all such Persons do not
         resolve any such asserted Dispute prior to the tenth Business Day after
         such  notice  is  given,   then  the  Disputing   Person  may  commence
         arbitration pursuant to this Section 13.N


                                       63


<PAGE>

         by giving each other Person  involved in such Dispute a written  notice
         to that effect (an  "Arbitration  Notice"),  setting  forth any matters
         which are required to be set forth therein in  accordance  with the AAA
         Rules. Unless otherwise notified, the Acquiring Parties are entitled to
         assume that the  Stockholder  Representative  is  authorized  to act on
         behalf of each Old Sullivan Stockholder with respect to any Dispute.

                       (3) SELECTION OF ARBITRATOR. The Persons involved in such
         Dispute will attempt to select a single arbitrator by mutual agreement.
         If no such  arbitrator is selected prior to the twentieth  Business Day
         after the related Arbitration Notice is given, then an arbitrator which
         is  experienced  in matters of the type which are the subject matter of
         the Dispute will be selected in accordance with the AAA Rules.

                       (4)  CONDUCT  OF  ARBITRATION.  The  arbitration  will be
         conducted  under the AAA Rules,  as modified  by any written  agreement
         among the Persons involved in such Dispute. The arbitrator will conduct
         the  arbitration  in a manner so that the final result,  determination,
         finding,  judgment or award  determined by the  arbitrator  (the "Final
         Arbitration Award") is made or rendered as soon as practicable, and the
         Persons involved in such Dispute will use reasonable efforts to cause a
         Final  Arbitration Award to occur not later than the sixtieth day after
         the arbitrator is selected.  Any Final  Arbitration Award will be final
         and binding upon the Persons  involved in such Dispute,  and there will
         be no appeal  from or  reexamination  of any Final  Arbitration  Award,
         except as provided in the Uniform  Arbitration Act, as in effect in the
         State of New York from time to time.

                       (5)  ENFORCEMENT.   A  Final  Arbitration  Award  may  be
         enforced in any state or federal  court  having  jurisdiction  over the
         subject matter of the related Dispute.

                       (6) EXPENSES. The prevailing Person(s) in any arbitration
         proceeding  in  connection  with this  Agreement  will be  entitled  to
         recover from the non-prevailing  Person(s) their reasonable  attorneys'
         fees and  disbursements  in addition  to any damages or other  remedies
         awarded to such prevailing Person(s),  and the non-prevailing Person(s)
         will be required to pay all other costs and  expenses  associated  with
         the  arbitration;  provided  that (i) if an  arbitrator  is  unable  to
         determine that a Person is a prevailing  Person in any such arbitration
         proceeding, then such costs and expenses will be equitably allocated by
         such  arbitrator  upon the  basis of the  outcome  of such  arbitration
         proceeding,  and (ii) if such  arbitrator  is unable to  allocate  such
         costs and  expenses  in such a manner,  then the costs and  expenses of
         such  arbitration  will be paid  one-half by Sullivan  and  one-half by
         Sinclair,  and each Party will pay the out-of-pocket  expenses incurred
         by it. As part of any  Final  Arbitration  Award,  the  arbitrator  may
         designate  the  prevailing  Person(s)  for  purposes  of  this  Section
         13.N(6).  Except as provided in the  preceding  sentences,  each Person
         involved in a Dispute will bear its own costs and  expenses  (including
         legal fees and disbursements) in connection with any such proceeding or
         submission.

                  13.O     STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE.

                       (1) APPOINTMENT;  AUTHORITY  GENERALLY.  On behalf of the
         Old Sullivan  Stockholders,  Sullivan  hereby appoints ABRY Partners as
         the initial Stockholder


                                       64



<PAGE>

         Representative  under this  Agreement,  to serve in accordance with the
         terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement,  and ABRY Partners,
         by its execution of this Agreement,  hereby agrees to act as such, upon
         the terms, conditions and provisions of this Agreement.  From and after
         the Closing,  the Stockholder  Representative will be authorized to act
         on behalf of the Old  Sullivan  Stockholders  in  accordance  with this
         Agreement.

                       (2)  AUTHORIZATION.  The Stockholder  Representative,  in
         such  capacity,  will be  entitled to take all actions on behalf of the
         holders of Sullivan  Shares or the Old  Sullivan  Stockholders,  as the
         case may be, with respect to this  Agreement  and the other  agreements
         contemplated hereby, and omit to take any action, each as directed by

                                    (a) prior to the Effective Time, the holders
                  of capital  stock of Sullivan  having a majority of the voting
                  power represented by the outstanding capital stock of Sullivan
                  at the time in question, and

                                    (b) after the  Effective  Time,  Persons who
                  immediately  prior to the Effective Time held Sullivan  Shares
                  which  represented  a  majority  of the  voting  power  of the
                  Sullivan Shares,

         (in either case, the "Majority Sullivan Stockholders"). The Stockholder
         Representative  may be removed  and  replaced  from time to time as the
         representative  of  the  holders  of the  Sullivan  Shares  or the  Old
         Sullivan  Stockholders by written notice given by the Majority Sullivan
         Stockholders  to  Sullivan  (prior  to  the  Effective  Time)  and  the
         Acquiring Parties.

                       (3) RESPONSIBILITY.  The Stockholder  Representative will
         have no duties or responsibilities  except those expressly set forth in
         this Agreement or any other  agreement  which may be entered into by it
         hereunder.  The Stockholder  Representative will have no responsibility
         for the validity of this Agreement or any agreement referred to in this
         Agreement or for the  performance  of any such  agreements by any party
         thereto or for the  interpretation of any of the provisions of any such
         agreements.  The Stockholder  Representative's  liability in fulfilling
         its duties will be limited to bad faith,  willful  misconduct  or gross
         negligence  on  its  part.  The  Stockholder   Representative  will  be
         protected in acting upon any  certificate,  notice or other  instrument
         whatsoever  received by the  Stockholder  Representative  as to its due
         execution,  the validity and  effectiveness of its provisions,  and the
         truth  and  accuracy  of any  information  therein  contained  that the
         Stockholder  Representative in good faith believes to be genuine and to
         have been  signed or  presented  by a proper  Person  or  Persons.  The
         Stockholder  Representative  may, in its sole discretion,  consult with
         and obtain  advice from legal counsel and any other Person in the event
         of any  question as to any of the  provisions  of this  Agreement,  any
         other  agreement  entered  into in  connection  herewith  or its duties
         hereunder or thereunder.  The reasonable cost of such services,  to the
         extent  not borne by  Sullivan,  will be borne  among the Old  Sullivan
         Stockholders who held Sullivan Shares  immediately  prior to the Merger
         Effective Time, pro rata in accordance  with the respective  amounts of
         the  Merger  Consideration  to be  received  by them in  respect of the
         Sullivan Shares.

                       (4)    RESIGNATION;    REPLACEMENT.    The    Stockholder
         Representative will


                                       65


<PAGE>

         have the right,  in its sole  discretion,  to resign as the Stockholder
         Representative (in its capacity as the representative of the holders of
         Sullivan Shares or the Old Sullivan Stockholders) at any time by giving
         at least  30 days  prior  written  notice  to  Sullivan  (prior  to the
         Effective  Time) and the  Acquiring  Parties.  In such event,  Sullivan
         (prior to the  Effective  Time) or the Majority  Sullivan  Stockholders
         (after the Effective Time) will promptly  appoint  another  Stockholder
         Representative  to represent the holders of Sullivan Shares and the Old
         Sullivan  Stockholders  and  give  notice  of  such  selection  to  the

acknowledge  that  Sullivan  has  executed  this  Agreement  without  having the
opportunity  to request of personnel of the  Stations  information  which may be
material to the preparation of the attached  Schedules referred to in Article IV
(and that, therefore,  some or all of such attached Schedules may not be correct
and complete and, as a result, some or all of the representations and warranties
set forth in Article IV which refer to such  attached  Schedules may not be true
and correct).  On or prior to March 9, 1998, Sullivan may deliver to Sinclair an
amendment and restatement of any such attached Schedule, or any portion thereof,
or a supplement to any such attached Schedule or any portion thereof,  which may
be required in order to accurately depict facts and circumstances which exist on
the date of this Agreement (or any other applicable date referred to in any such
representation  or warranty),  and the attached  Schedule or portion  thereof in
question will be deemed to have been so amended and restated or modified, as the
case may be, as of the time of the execution and delivery of this Agreement. The
Acquiring  Parties' sole and exclusive  remedy under this Agreement with respect
to any matter which may be disclosed by any such  amendment and  restatement  or
supplement  will be  Sinclair's  right (if any) to terminate  this  Agreement as
described in Section 12.A(2)(b).

                  13.Q  TREATMENT  OF  STATION  KOKH.   Each   Acquiring   Party
acknowledges  that,  notwithstanding  any  language  to  the  contrary  in  this
Agreement, Sullivan has not made and will not make any representation,  warranty
or  certification  of any kind with  respect to  Station  KOKH  (including  with
respect to the assets,  liabilities and operations related to Station KOKH), and
no  representation  or warranty  set forth in Article  IV, and no  certification
relating thereto delivered  pursuant to Sections 3.I, will be deemed to apply to
Station KOKH  (including to any related  asset,  liability or  operations).  The
Annualized  Trailing Cash Flow,  the Gross  Revenues,  the Current  Assets,  the
Current  Liabilities  and the Sullivan  Receivables  will be determined  without
regard to the results of operations and assets of Station KOKH.

and officers of the Merger Sub  immediately  prior to the Effective Time will be

representations and warranties:

                  4.A  ORGANIZATION.  Sullivan  is a  corporation  which is duly
organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware.  From and  after the  Spin-  Off,  Sullivan  will be  qualified  to do
business or have  similar  status under the laws of each  jurisdiction  in which
such  qualification is required by applicable Legal  Requirements.  Sullivan has
the power and authority to carry on the business  being  conducted by it, to own
and operate the Station  Assets  owned and operated by it, and to enter into and
consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  to be consummated by it pursuant to
this Agreement.

                  4.B  ACTION.  Each action  necessary  to be taken by or on the
part of Sullivan in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the  consummation  of the  transactions  contemplated  to be  consummated by
Sullivan  pursuant to this  Agreement and  necessary to make the same  effective
will be duly and validly  taken by, and be effective  at, the time by which such
action  is  required  to be taken.  This  Agreement  has been  duly and  validly
authorized,  executed,  and delivered by Sullivan and  constitutes its valid and
binding agreement,  enforceable  against Sullivan in accordance with and subject
to its  terms,  subject  to the  effect of  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,
reorganization,  fraudulent conveyance,  arrangement, moratorium or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors  generally and the  availability  of equitable
remedies.

                  4.C  FCC  AUTHORIZATIONS.  As of  the  time  of  the  Closing,
Sullivan  will be the  holder of the FCC  Authorizations.  As of the time of the
Closing, except as set forth on the attached Schedule 4C, (i) the Authorizations
will  constitute  all of the  licenses  and  authorizations  required  under the
Communications Act, or the current rules, regulations,  and policies of the FCC,
for the operation of the Stations as now conducted;  (ii) the FCC Authorizations
will be in full force and effect and are subject to or scheduled  for renewal on
the respective dates specified

                                        5


<PAGE>



on the attached Schedule 4C (unless  theretofore  renewed after the date of this
Agreement);  (iii) the FCC Authorizations  will be valid for the full respective
terms  thereof;  (iv)  Sullivan  will  have no reason  to  believe  that the FCC
Authorizations will not be renewed for a full and customary term in the ordinary
course with no  materially  adverse  conditions  (except with respect to general
rule-making  and similar  matters  relating  generally to  television  broadcast
stations  by  reason  of  any  action  or  omission  of  Sinclair  or any of its
Subsidiaries);  (v)  there  will not be not  pending,  or, to the  knowledge  of
Sullivan,  threatened,  any  action  by or  before  the FCC to  revoke,  cancel,
rescind,  modify,  or  refuse  to renew in the  ordinary  course  any of the FCC
Authorizations,  and there will not be pending, or, to the knowledge of any such
Person,   threatened,   issued,  or  outstanding  by  or  before  the  FCC,  any
investigation,  order to show  cause,  notice of  violation,  notice of apparent
liability, or notice of forfeiture or complaint against Sullivan with respect to
any Station,  in each case other than by reason of any actual or alleged  action
or  omission of Sinclair or any of its  Subsidiaries;  (vi)  Sullivan  will have
complied  in  all   material   respects   with  the  FCC   Authorizations,   the
Communications Act, and the current rules,  regulations and policies of the FCC;
and (vii) all documents required by 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3526 to be kept in each
Station's  public  inspection  file  are in such  file  and  such  file  will be
maintained in proper order and complete up to and through the Closing Date.

                  4.D  CONDITION OF ASSETS.  Except as set forth on the attached
Schedule 4D, the material  tangible  assets of Sullivan and the  improvements on
any real  property  which are used by it (a) at the time of the  Spin-Off and on
the Closing Date will in all material  respects be in good and technically sound
operating  condition  (ordinary  wear and tear  excepted) and are not in need of
repair and in a condition  which would be sufficient to permit the owner thereof
to operate the  Stations  (in the manner in which the  Stations  are operated or
programmed  by Sullivan  Holdings  and its  Subsidiaries  as of the date of this
Agreement)  in  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  FCC  Authorizations,  the
Communications  Act and current FCC rules and regulations (if such owner had the
right to use the Station  Assets not owned by Sullivan and such  Station  Assets
were in at least such  condition),  and (b) have in all material  respects  been
maintained in a manner  consistent  with  generally  accepted  standards of good
engineering  practice and to the knowledge of Sullivan,  all applicable federal,
state and local statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations,  including, without
limitation, all applicable tower painting and lighting requirements.

                  4.E TITLE, ETC. Immediately after the Spin-Off,  Sullivan will
have good title to, or a valid  leasehold  in, the tangible  assets and personal
property  included  in the  Station  Assets,  and all such  assets and  personal
property  will  on  the  Closing  Date  (after  the  repayment  in  full  of the
indebtedness of Sullivan and all related interest and other  obligations and the
release of all related  Liens and the Mission  Guarantees)  be free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Encumbrances. Sullivan possesses (and immediately
after the Merger, will possess) adequate rights, licenses, or other authority to
use the call letters presently used by the Stations, free and clear of all Liens
other than Permitted Encumbrances.

                  4.F LITIGATION.  Except as set forth on the attached  Schedule
4F:

                           (1) on the date of this  Agreement,  Sullivan  is not
         operating  under or subject to or in default with respect to any order,
         writ, injunction,  or decree of any court or federal, state, municipal,
         or  other  governmental  department,   commission,  board,  agency,  or
         instrumentality  arising  out of a  proceeding  to which it is or was a
         party, and on the Closing Date, no such item will have or reasonably be
         expected to result in a Material Adverse


                                       6


<PAGE>

         Change; and

                           (2)  on the  date  of  this  Agreement,  there  is no
         litigation  pending by or  against,  or to the  knowledge  of  Sullivan
         threatened against, Sullivan which interferes with, or could reasonably
         be expected to interfere  with,  (a) the  operations of the Stations as
         presently  conducted  or (b) the  ability of  Sullivan to carry out the

has no debt,  liability or obligation of any kind,  whether  accrued,  absolute,
contingent  or  otherwise,  including  any liability or obligation on account of
Taxes or any governmental charges or penalty,  interest or fines, which would be
required to be reflected in its balance sheet  prepared in accordance  with GAAP
and  which  would  have,  or  which  in  the  case  of  contingent  or  inchoate
liabilities, would have if accrued or absolute, a material adverse effect on the
financial condition of Sullivan,  viewed as a whole with Sullivan Holdings,  its
Subsidiaries and Sullivan Three as of the Closing Date, other than any liability
or obligation (a) reflected in any Sullivan Holdings  Financial  Statement,  (b)
identified  with  particularity  in any attached  Schedule or arising  under any
Contract  which is described,  or which is not required to be described,  on any
attached Schedule or the Contracts Schedule, (c) incurred in the ordinary course
of business  since  September  30,  1997,  (d) incurred in  connection  with the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement,  or (e) pursuant to the promissory
note issued to Sullivan  Holdings and its  Subsidiaries  in connection  with the

plan" (as such term is  defined in Section  3(a) of ERISA),  whether  written or

respect to any of its assets or otherwise) with respect to any employee  pension
benefit  plan  subject to Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Tax Code or
Title IV of ERISA  (including  any  multiemployer  plan).  No employee or former
employee of Sullivan, and no beneficiary of any such employee or former employee
is, by reason of such employee's or former  employee's  employment,  entitled to
receive  any  benefits,  including  death or medical  benefits  (whether  or not
insured) beyond retirement or other termination of employment as

described in Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 106,  other than
continuation coverage mandated under Section 4980B of the Tax Code or comparable
state law.

                  4.O BROKERS.  There is no broker or finder or other Person who
would  have any  valid  claim  against  Sullivan  or any  Acquiring  Party for a
commission  or  brokerage  fee  in  connection   with  this   Agreement  or  the

a material  fact set forth in this  Article IV  contains  any  statement  of any
material  fact  which is  untrue  in any  material  respect  or omits to state a
material  fact which is necessary in order to make the  statements  set forth in
this Article IV not misleading in any material respect.

and in good  standing (or has  comparable  active  status) under the laws of the
State of Delaware and will have the corporate  power and authority to enter into
and consummate the transactions contemplated to be consummated by it pursuant to
this Agreement.

                  5.B CORPORATE ACTION.  Each action necessary to be taken by or
on the  part of  either  Sinclair  or the  Merger  Sub in  connection  with  the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the  consummation  of  transactions
contemplated  hereby  to be  consummated  by it and  necessary  to make the same
effective duly and validly taken by, and be effective at, the time by which such
action  is  required  to be taken.  This  Agreement  has been  duly and  validly
authorized,  executed,  and delivered by each of Sinclair and the Merger Sub and
constitutes a valid and binding agreement,  enforceable  against each of them in
accordance  with and subject to its terms,  subject to the effect of  applicable

moratorium or similar laws  affecting the rights of creditors  generally and the
availability of equitable remedies.

                                       10


<PAGE>

the execution and delivery by Sinclair or the Merger Sub of this Agreement,  nor
the  consummation  by  Sinclair  or the  Merger  Sub of the Merger and the other
transactions  contemplated  by this  Agreement  to be  consummated  by it,  will
constitute,  or, with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both, would
constitute,  a material  violation of or would conflict in any material  respect
with or result in any material breach of or any material  default under,  any of
the terms, conditions,  or provisions of any Legal Requirement to which Sinclair
or the Merger Sub is subject,  or of Sinclair's or the Merger Sub's  certificate
of  incorporation  or  by-laws or similar  organizational  documents,  or of any
material contract,  agreement, or instrument to which Sinclair or the Merger Sub
is a party or by which Sinclair or the Merger Sub is bound.

would have any valid claim against Sullivan (except after the Effective Time) or
any Old Sullivan  Stockholder  for a commission  or brokerage  fee in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions  contemplated  hereby as a result of any
agreement or understanding of or action taken by Sinclair, the Merger Sub or any
Affiliate of any of them.

Merger Sub will, at the time of the filing of the  applications for the Required
FCC Consent described in Section 6.A, be legally and financially qualified under
the  Communications  Act, and the rules and  regulations  promulgated by the FCC
thereunder, to control Sullivan (in the case of Sinclair) or be the successor by
merger to Sullivan and the holder of the FCC  Authorizations (in the case of the
Merger Sub). To Sinclair's and the Merger Sub's knowledge,  no fact exists as of
the date of this  Agreement  that  would,  under  the  Communications  Act,  the
existing  rules,  regulations,  policies,  and practices of the FCC or any other
Legal Requirement, disqualify either Sinclair or the Merger Sub as the direct or
indirect holder of any FCC Authorization or as owner and operator of the related
Station Assets or any related Station.

                  5.F LITIGATION.  There is no litigation pending by or against,
or to Sinclair's or the Merger Sub's  knowledge  (after due inquiry)  threatened
against,  Sinclair or the Merger Sub related to or affecting  Sinclair's  or the
Merger Sub's  ability  fully to carry out the  transactions  contemplated  to be
consummated  by them  pursuant  to this  Agreement.  There  are no  attachments,
executions,  or  assignments  for the  benefit  of  creditors  or  voluntary  or
involuntary  proceedings in bankruptcy contemplated by, or, to Sinclair's or the
Merger Sub's knowledge,  threatened or pending  against,  Sinclair or the Merger
Sub.

                  5.G DISCLOSURE.  To Sinclair's and the Merger Sub's knowledge,
no statement of a material fact set forth in this Article V contains a statement
of any material fact which is untrue in any material respect or omits to state a
material  fact which is necessary in order to make the  statements  set forth in
this Article V not misleading in any material respect.

                      APPLICATIONS FOR REQUIRED FCC CONSENT

                  6.A  PREPARATION  AND FILING.  Within 30  Business  Days after
Sinclair's or its own written  request after the Spin-Off,  each of Sullivan and
Sinclair will, and will cause its  Subsidiaries to, complete the portions of the
applications  for the Required FCC Consent  which pertain to it and jointly file
such  applications  with the FCC. Each of Sullivan and Sinclair  will,  and will
cause its  Subsidiaries  to,  diligently  take or cooperate in the taking of all
steps which are  reasonably  within its ability to take and which are necessary,
proper,  or desirable to expedite the  prosecution of such  applications  and to
cause the Required FCC Consent expeditiously to become Granted and expeditiously
to become a Final Order.

                  6.B CERTAIN  ACTIONS.  Sullivan  will  refrain from making any
filing or  announcement  or taking (or causing or assisting  any other Person to
take) any other action which  reasonably could be expected to delay the Required
FCC Consent  being  Granted or  becoming a Final  Order in any  respect  without
Sinclair's prior written consent.  Without limiting Section 6.D,  Sinclair will,
and  will  cause  its  Subsidiaries  to,  refrain  from  making  any  filing  or
announcement  or taking (or causing or  assisting  any other Person to take) any
other  action  which  reasonably  could be  expected to delay the  Required  FCC
Consent being Granted or becoming a Final Order in any respect without the prior
written   consent  of  Sullivan  (or,   after  the  Closing,   the   Stockholder
Representative).

                  6.C NOTICE OF OBJECTIONS,  ETC. Sullivan will promptly provide
Sinclair (or, after the Closing, the Stockholder  Representative) with a copy of
any  pleading,  order,  or other  document  served on Sullivan  relating to such
applications (other than any of the same which is addressed to or states that it
is to be  served  upon or  delivered  to the  Person  to whom such copy is to be
provided  or such  Person's  communications  counsel).  Sinclair  will  promptly
provide Sullivan (or, after the Closing, the Stockholder  Representative) with a
copy of any pleading,  order, or other document served on Sinclair or any of its
Subsidiaries  relating to such applications (other than any of the same which is
addressed  to or states that it is to be served upon or  delivered to the Person
to whom such copy is to be provided or such Person's communications counsel).

                  6.D PROHIBITED ACTIONS.  Sinclair will not, and will not cause
or permit any of its Subsidiaries  to, make any "major  amendment" (as that term
is used in  Section  73.3578(b)  of the  rules of the FCC (Ch.  47  C.F.R.))  in
respect of any such  application  other than (i) with prior  written  consent of
Sullivan  (prior to the Closing) or the  Stockholder  Representative  (after the
Closing),  (ii) in order to reflect  any  change in the  proposed  operating  or
ownership  structure of the Merger Sub or any Station which the FCC or its staff
has  indicated to Sinclair or any  Affiliate or agent of Sinclair is a condition
to the Required  FCC Consent to be Granted,  or (iii) if required by a change in
the rules,  regulations  or  policies of the FCC to  disclose  any  attributable
interest  which  Sinclair  or any of its  Subsidiaries  may be deemed to have by
virtue of any local marketing,  time brokerage or similar  arrangement in effect
on the date of this Agreement.

                  permit that would  materially  restrict any Station's  present
                  operations  or  make  any  material   adverse  change  in  the
                  buildings or leasehold  improvements  which constitute Station
                  Assets;

                  its terms terminate at or prior to the time of the Closing;

                                    (e) cause any of its assets or properties to
                  become   subject  to  any  Lien,   other  than  any  Permitted
                  Encumbrance;

                                    (f)  commit  any  material   breach  of  any
                  material Contract to which it is a party; or

                                    (g) change any material tax election if such
                  change  could  reasonably  be  expected  to  adversely  affect
                  Post-Merger  Sullivan,  except to the extent  required  by any
                  Legal Requirement, any Contract or GAAP.

                           (4)  NO  PREMATURE  ASSUMPTION  OF  CONTROL.  Nothing
         contained in this Agreement will give any Acquiring  Party any right to
         control the  programming,  operations,  or any other matter relating to
         the Stations  prior to the Closing,  and  Sullivan  will have  complete
         control of the programming,  operations, and all other matters relating
         to the Stations up to the time of the Closing.

                  7.B ORGANIZATION/GOODWILL. After the Spin-Off and until to the
Closing,   Sullivan  will  use  reasonable  efforts  to  preserve  the  business
organization  of Sullivan with respect to the Stations and preserve the goodwill
of the Stations'  suppliers,  customers,  and others, to the extent such Persons
have business  relations with  Sullivan.  This Section 7.B will not apply to the
Corporate Personnel, with respect to continued service by them after the Closing
(it being  understood  that the  Corporate  Personnel  intend  to  resign  their
respective positions with Sullivan effective as of the Effective Time).

                  7.C ACCESS TO  FACILITIES,  FILES,  AND RECORDS.  From time to
time at the request of Sinclair  after the  Spin-Off  and prior to the  Closing,
Sullivan will give or cause to be given to the officers, employees, accountants,
counsel, and representatives of Sinclair and the Merger Sub

                                    (a)   access   (in  the   presence   of  any
                  representative  designated by Sullivan, at Sullivan's option),
                  upon reasonable prior notice, during normal business hours, to
                  all  facilities,   property,  accounts,  books,  deeds,  title
                  papers, insurance policies, licenses,  agreements,  contracts,
                  commitments,    records,   equipment,   machinery,   fixtures,
                  furniture,  vehicles,  accounts  payable and  receivable,  and
                  inventories  of Sullivan  (but, in any event,  not  personnel,
                  unless Sullivan  otherwise  consents) related to the Stations,
                  including  for  purposes  of  permitting  Sinclair  to perform
                  "Phase One" (and,  after  consulting  with  Sullivan as to the
                  scope thereof, "Phase Two") environmental surveys with respect
                  to the Station Assets, and


                                       14


<PAGE>

                                    (b) all such other information in Sullivan's
                  possession con cerning the affairs of the Stations as Sinclair
                  may reasonably request,

         in each case at Sinclair's  expense;  provided that the foregoing  does
         not disrupt or interfere  with the business and  operations of Sullivan
         or any Station in any material respect  ("materiality," for purposes of
         this   proviso,   being   determined   by  reference  to  each  Station
         individually, and not taken as a whole).

                  7.D HART-SCOTT-RODINO  MATTERS.  Within thirty (30) days after
Sinclair's  or its own request  after the  Spin-Off,  Sullivan will complete all
documents (if any) required to be filed with the Federal Trade  Commission  (the
"FTC") and the United  States  Department of Justice (the "DOJ") with respect to
itself and/or its Affiliate(s) and concerning the Merger in order to comply with
the  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Act and together  with Sinclair  and/or the  appropriate
Affiliate(s) of Sinclair who are required to join in such filings, will file the
same with the FTC and the DOJ.  Sullivan  will  promptly  furnish all  materials
thereafter  required by the FTC, the DOJ or any other governmental entity having
jurisdiction  over such filings,  and will take all reasonable  actions and will
file and use  reasonable  efforts to have  declared  effective  or approved  all
documents  and  notifications  with  any  such  governmental  entity,  as may be
required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act or other federal antitrust laws for the
consummation of the Merger.

                  7.E  CONSENTS.  Except as  provided  in Article VI and Section
7.D, it is agreed that (1) as among Sullivan and the Acquiring Parties,  it will
be the sole  responsibility  of the  Acquiring  Parties  to  timely  obtain  all
Acquiring Party Consents,  (2) so long as Sullivan complies with its obligations
pursuant to the following sentence and Article VI and Section 7.D, Sullivan, the
Old Sullivan Stockholders and the Stockholder  Representative will not be liable
to any  Person  for any  failure  to obtain or other  absence  of any  effective
Acquiring  Party Consent,  and (3) except as provided in Sections 10.C and 10.D,
the absence of any effective  Consent will not excuse any  Acquiring  Party from
consummating  the Merger.  Sullivan will use reasonable  efforts  (without being
required  to make any  payment  not  specifically  required  by the terms of any
licenses,  leases,  and  other  contracts),   including  executing  any  related
agreement or undertaking which does not take effect until the Effective Time, to
obtain  the  Sullivan  Consents  and to assist  the  Acquiring  Parties  (at the
Acquiring Parties' request and expense) to (a) timely obtain all Acquiring Party
Consents or, in the absence of any Acquiring  Party Consent (where  applicable),
one or more  replacement  agreements,  and (b) cause each Consent or replacement
agreement to become  effective  as of the time of the Spin-Off or the  Effective
Time, as applicable.

                  7.F NOTICE OF PROCEEDINGS. After the Spin-Off and prior to the
Closing,  Sullivan will promptly  notify Sinclair in writing upon becoming aware
of any  order  or  decree  or any  complaint  praying  for an  order  or  decree
restraining or enjoining the consummation of the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated by Sullivan,  or upon receiving
any notice from any governmental department, court, agency, or commission of its
intention to institute an  investigation  into or institute a suit or proceeding
to  restrain  or  enjoin  the  consummation  of the  Merger  or any  such  other
transaction,  or to nullify or render ineffective this Agreement,  the Merger or
any such other transaction if consummated.

not use or disclose to any Person  (except to its  agents,  representatives  and
advisors,  to its  lenders  and  securityholders  and their  respective  agents,
representatives  and advisors,  or as may be required by any Legal  Requirement)
any confidential  information  received from any Acquiring Party or any of their
respective agents,  representatives  and advisors (each a "disclosing party" for

is or was  known  to any  Sullivan-Related  Entity  at the  time of its  initial
disclosure by a disclosing party to any Sullivan-Related  Entity; (b) has become
or becomes  publicly  known or available  other than through  disclosure  by any
Sullivan-Related   Entity;   (c)  is  or   was   rightfully   received   by  any

perform all conditions and obligations on its part to be fulfilled and performed
under this  Agreement and to cause the conditions set forth in Articles IX and X
to be fulfilled and cause the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by
this  Agreement  in  connection  with the  Closing to be fully  carried  out. In
addition, promptly after Sullivan becomes aware prior to the Closing of a breach
of any fact or circumstance  which  constitutes or would  constitute a breach of
any other  Party's  representation  or  warranty  set  forth in this  Agreement,
Sullivan  will give such Party notice  thereof so that such Party may attempt to
cure the same.

                  7.I NOTICE OF CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS.  Sullivan will give prompt
written notice to Sinclair if, after the Spin-Off and prior to the Closing:  (1)
Sullivan  receives  notice from any Market  Cable  System  currently  carrying a
Station's signal of such Market Cable System's  intention to delete such Station
from  carriage or change such  Station's  channel  position on such Market Cable
System,  or (2) Sullivan  becomes aware of any breach of any  representation  or
warranty of Sullivan set forth in Article IV.

                  7.J  UPDATED  INFORMATION.   Sullivan  agrees  to  provide  to
Sinclair  and the  Merger  Sub at or prior  to the  Closing,  for  informational
purposes only, copies of all material  Contracts in existence at the time of the
Closing and which are entered into after the Spin-Off and prior to the Closing.

                  7.K  NON-SOLICITATION.  After  the  Spin-Off  and prior to the
Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement,  each of ABRY Partners and
Sullivan  will not,  and each of them will not  cause  (and will use  reasonable
efforts not to permit) any of its Subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers,
employees,  representatives  or agents to,  directly or indirectly  solicit,  or
initiate,  entertain or enter into any  discussions  or  transactions  with,  or
encourage  or provide  any  information  to, any Person  (other  than any Person
described in Section 7.C),  concerning any sale of any of the assets of Sullivan
(other than any sale which is not  prohibited by Section  7.A(3)) or any merger,
stock


                                       16

acquisition or similar transaction involving Sullivan (other than an issuance of
capital stock or capital stock  equivalents by Sullivan);  provided that nothing
in this Section 7.K will prohibit ABRY Partners or Sullivan from furnishing,  or
causing  or  permitting  any other  Person to  furnish,  information  concerning
Sullivan to any governmental authority or court of competent jurisdiction or any
other Person as may be required by any Legal Requirement.

Affiliate(s) of Sullivan who are required to join in such filings, will file the

other federal antitrust laws for the consummation of the Merger.

                  8.B   CONFIDENTIAL   INFORMATION.   If  for  any   reason  the
transactions  contemplated  in  this  Agreement  are  not  consummated,  each of
Sinclair  and the Merger Sub will not use or disclose  to any Person  (except to
its agents,  representatives  and advisors,  to its lenders and their respective
agents,  representatives  and  advisors,  or as may  be  required  by any  Legal
Requirement) any confidential  information received from Sullivan Holdings,  any
of its Subsidiaries, Sullivan or any of their respective agents, representatives
and advisors (each a "disclosing party" for purposes of this Section 8.B) in the

this   Agreement);   or   (d)  is  or  was   independently   developed   by  any
Sinclair-Related  Entity. In addition,  the Merger Sub agrees to be bound by the
same obligations as Sinclair is bound pursuant to the confidentiality  agreement
dated as of November 20, 1997 between Sinclair and Sullivan Broadcasting,  which
confidentiality  agreement  will  survive  the  execution  and  delivery of this
Agreement and will survive the execution and termination of this Agreement,  and
no provision of this Section 8.B will be deemed to supersede or in any way limit
any obligation or right under such confidentiality agreement.

conditions  set forth in Articles IX and X to be fulfilled  and cause the Merger

of the jurisdiction of its  incorporation to a name which does not include,  and
is not confusingly similar to, the name "Sullivan" and will cease the use of all

continue to use its present  corporate  name until such time as such name change
is effective and to the extent necessary to accomplish such name change, and may
endorse checks and other instruments in such name.

                  enforcement  of this  Agreement  against  Sullivan,  including
                  specific  enforcement  of Sullivan's  obligation to consummate

                  performance  unless (i) each  Acquiring  Party has complied in
                  all material respects with its material obligations under this

                  condition to closing which has not been satisfied or waived in
                  writing  is  caused  solely  by a breach  by  Sullivan  of its

                  and the  Stockholder  Representative  given in accordance with
                  this Section 13.D.

                  13.E  CAPTIONS.  The captions of Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for  convenience  only, and will not control or affect the meaning
or construction of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

                  13.F  LAW  GOVERNING.  THIS  AGREEMENT  WILL BE  GOVERNED  BY,
CONSTRUED,  AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE  WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT  REFERENCES  TO THE  PRINCIPLES  OF CONFLICT OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FEDERAL LAW OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNS THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

                  13.G   WAIVER   OF   PROVISIONS.    The   terms,    covenants,
representations,  warranties,  and conditions of this Agreement may be waived as
to any Party only by a written  instrument  executed by such  Party.  The terms,
covenants, representations,  warranties, and conditions of this Agreement may be
waived as to any Old Sullivan  Stockholder only by a written instrument executed
by Sullivan, prior to the Closing, or the Stockholder Representative,  after the
Closing. The failure of any Party or any Old Sullivan Stockholder at any time or
times to require  performance  of any  provision  of this  Agreement  will in no
manner  affect the right at a later date to enforce the same. No waiver by or on
behalf of any Party to this  Agreement  or any Old Sullivan  Stockholder  of any
condition or the breach of any provision,  term,  covenant,  representation,  or
warranty  contained in this Agreement,  whether by conduct or otherwise,  in any
one or more  instances,  will be  deemed  to be or  construed  as a  further  or
continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of any other provision,
term, covenant, representation, or warranty of this Agreement.

                  13.H  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more  counterparts,  and all counterparts so executed will constitute one (1)
agreement  binding on all of the parties  hereto,  notwithstanding  that all the
parties hereto are not signatory to the same counterpart.

                  13.I ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This Agreement (including the Schedules
and Exhibits hereto) and the  confidentiality  agreement  referred to in Section
8.C (including  the Acquiring  Parties'  obligations  with respect  thereto,  as
provided in Section 8.C), constitute the entire agreement among


                                       27


<PAGE>

the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and
all prior agreements,  understandings,  negotiations,  and discussions,  whether
oral or written, between them relating to the subject matter hereof.

                  13.J     ACCESS TO BOOKS AND RECORDS.

                           (1)  Post-Merger  Sullivan  will,  and will cause its
         Subsidiaries  to,  preserve  for not less than five (5) years after the
         Closing  Date all books and records  included  in the  Station  Assets.
         After such five-year  period,  Post-Merger  Sullivan will not, and will
         not cause or permit its  Subsidiaries  to, destroy any books or records
         relating  to the  conduct  of  business  of the  Stations  prior to the
         Effective  Time unless  Post-Merger  Sullivan  first offers to transfer
         such books and records to the Stockholder  Representative at no cost to
         the  Stockholder   Representative,   and  if  Post-Merger  Sullivan  is
         requested to do so,  Post-Merger  Sullivan  will  transfer,  or cause a
         Subsidiary of Post-Merger  Sullivan to transfer,  such books or records
         to the Stockholder Representative.

                           (2) At the request of the Stockholder Representative,
         Post-Merger  Sullivan will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
         permit  the   Stockholder   Representative   (including  its  officers,
         employees,  accountants, and counsel) any access, upon reasonable prior
         written notice during normal  business  hours,  to all of its property,
         accounts,  books, contracts,  records, accounts payable and receivable,
         records of employees,  FCC logs and other  information  concerning  the
         affairs or operation of the Stations as the Stockholder  Representative
         may  reasonably  request  for any  reasonable  purpose  relating to the
         transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  or  the  ownership  or
         operation  of any  Station  prior to the  Effective  Time,  and to make
         extracts   or   copies   from   the   foregoing   at  the   Stockholder
         Representative's  expense. At Post-Merger  Sullivan's request, prior to
         receiving   any   such   requested    information,    the   Stockholder
         Representative  will execute a  confidentiality  agreement with respect
         thereto which is reasonably acceptable to Post-Merger Sullivan.

                  13.K  PUBLIC  ANNOUNCEMENTS.  Prior to the  Closing,  no Party
will, except by mutual agreement of Sullivan and Sinclair  (including  agreement
as to  content,  text and method of  distribution  or  release),  make any press
release or other public  announcement or disclosure  concerning the transactions
contemplated  by  this  Agreement,  except  as may  be  required  by  any  Legal
Requirement  (including filings and reports required to be made with or pursuant
to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission); provided that, prior to
making any such announcement or disclosure required by any Legal Requirement, to
the extent practicable, the disclosing Party gives each Person named above prior
written notice of the context,  text and content of, the method of  distribution
or release of, and all other material facts concerning, such disclosure.

                  13.L  DISCLOSURE.  If and to the extent  that any  information
required to be furnished  by Sullivan in any  attached  Schedule is contained in
this Agreement or in any attached  Schedule,  such information will be deemed to
have been included in each other attached  Schedule in which such information is
required to be included to the extent its relevance to such latter Schedule is


                                       28


<PAGE>

reasonably  apparent.  By including any  information  in any attached  Schedule,
Sullivan  will  not be  deemed  to  have  admitted  or  acknowledged  that  such
information  is material to or outside the  ordinary  course of the  business of
Sullivan or any Station.

                  13.M     DEFINITIONAL PROVISIONS.

                           (1) TERMS DEFINED IN APPENDIX.  Each capitalized term
         which  is used  and not  otherwise  defined  in this  Agreement  or any
         attached  Schedule has the meaning  which is specified for such term in
         the Appendix which is attached to this Agreement.

                           (2) KNOWLEDGE.  As used in this  Agreement,  the term
         "knowledge"  of  Sullivan  will  refer  only to the  actual  knowledge,
         without any particular inquiry (except as specified in this Agreement),
         of the  Corporate  Personnel,  Andrew  Banks and Royce  Yudkoff,  after
         inquiry of the general managers of the Stations; and the "knowledge" of
         Sinclair  or the Merger  Sub will  refer only to the actual  knowledge,
         without any particular  inquiry (except as specified in this Agreement)
         of David Smith and David Amy.

                           (3)  INTERPRETATION.  Words  used in this  Agreement,
         regardless of the gender and number  specifically  used, will be deemed
         and  construed  to include  any other  gender,  masculine,  feminine or
         neuter,  and any other  number,  singular  or  plural,  as the  context
         requires.  Whether or not used in  conjunction  with the words "without
         limitation" or words of similar import, the term "including" as used in
         this Agreement imports that the items referred to are illustrative only
         and do not purport to be a complete listing of the items of the type in
         question. The wording of the provisions of this Agreement is the result
         of arms-length negotiations among the parties to this Agreement and was
         selected by them to reflect  their  mutual  intentions;  therefore,  no
         party will be deemed the  "drafter"  of this  Agreement  and no rule of
         strict construction will be applied against or in favor of any party to
         this Agreement.

                  13.N     ARBITRATION.

                           (1)  GENERALLY.  Except as expressly  provided in the
         Indemnity  Escrow  Agreement  or for  purposes of  pursuing  any remedy
         pursuant to Section 12.B(3)(b), the arbitration procedures described in
         this  Section 13.N will be the sole and  exclusive  method of resolving
         and  remedying  claims  arising  under  this  Agreement  and the  other
         Transaction  Documents  ("Disputes");  provided  that  nothing  in this
         Section  13.N will  prohibit a Party  from  instituting  litigation  to
         enforce any Final Arbitration  Award.  Except as otherwise  provided in
         the   Commercial   Arbitration   Rules  of  the  American   Arbitration
         Association  as in effect  from time to time  (the  "AAA  Rules"),  the
         arbitration  procedures  described  in this  Section 13.N and any Final
         Arbitration Award will be governed by, and will be enforceable pursuant
         to, the Uniform  Arbitration  Act as in effect in the State of New York
         from  time to time.  No Person  will be  entitled  to claim or  recover
         punitive damages in any such proceeding.

<PAGE>

                           (2) NOTICE OF  ARBITRATION.  If a Party  asserts that
         there exists a Dispute,  then such Person (the "Disputing Person") will
         give each  other  Person  involved  in such  Dispute  a written  notice
         setting forth the nature of the asserted  Dispute.  If all such Persons
         do not resolve any such asserted  Dispute  prior to the tenth  Business
         Day after such notice is given,  then the Disputing Person may commence
         arbitration  pursuant to this  Section 13.N by giving each other Person
         involved  in  such  Dispute  a  written   notice  to  that  effect  (an
         "Arbitration Notice"),  setting forth any matters which are required to
         be set forth therein in accordance with the AAA Rules. Unless otherwise
         notified,  the  Acquiring  Parties  are  entitled  to  assume  that the
         Stockholder  Representative  is authorized to act on behalf of each Old
         Sullivan Stockholder with respect to any Dispute.

                           (3) SELECTION OF ARBITRATOR.  The Persons involved in
         such  Dispute  will  attempt  to select a single  arbitrator  by mutual
         agreement.  If no such  arbitrator  is selected  prior to the twentieth
         Business  Day after the related  Arbitration  Notice is given,  then an
         arbitrator  which is  experienced  in matters of the type which are the
         subject  matter of the Dispute will be selected in accordance  with the
         AAA Rules.

                           (4) CONDUCT OF ARBITRATION.  The arbitration  will be
         conducted  under the AAA Rules,  as modified  by any written  agreement
         among the Persons involved in such Dispute. The arbitrator will conduct
         the  arbitration  in a manner so that the final result,  determination,
         finding,  judgment or award  determined by the  arbitrator  (the "Final
         Arbitration Award") is made or rendered as soon as practicable, and the
         Persons involved in such Dispute will use reasonable efforts to cause a
         Final  Arbitration Award to occur not later than the sixtieth day after
         the arbitrator is selected.  Any Final  Arbitration Award will be final
         and binding upon the Persons  involved in such Dispute,  and there will
         be no appeal  from or  reexamination  of any Final  Arbitration  Award,
         except as provided in the Uniform  Arbitration Act, as in effect in the
         State of New York from time to time.

                           (5)  ENFORCEMENT.  A Final  Arbitration  Award may be
         enforced in any state or federal  court  having  jurisdiction  over the
         subject matter of the related Dispute.

                           (6)  EXPENSES.   The  prevailing   Person(s)  in  any
         arbitration  proceeding  in  connection  with  this  Agreement  will be
         entitled to recover from the non-prevailing  Person(s) their reasonable
         attorneys' fees and  disbursements  in addition to any damages or other
         remedies awarded to such prevailing  Person(s),  and the non-prevailing
         Person(s)  will  be  required  to pay  all  other  costs  and  expenses
         associated with the arbitration;  provided that (i) if an arbitrator is
         unable to determine  that a Person is a  prevailing  Person in any such
         arbitration proceeding,  then such costs and expenses will be equitably
         allocated  by such  arbitrator  upon the basis of the  outcome  of such
         arbitration  proceeding,  and  (ii) if such  arbitrator  is  unable  to
         allocate  such costs and expenses in such a manner,  then the costs and
         expenses of such  arbitration  will be paid  one-half  by Sullivan  and
         one-half  by  Sinclair,  and  each  Party  will  pay the  out-of-pocket
         expenses  incurred by it. As part of any Final  Arbitration  Award, the
         arbitrator may designate the prevailing  Person(s) for purposes of this
         Section 13.N(6).  Except as provided in the preceding  sentences,  each
         Person involved in a 


                                       30


<PAGE>



         Dispute will bear its own costs and expenses  (including  legal feesand
         disbursements) in connection with any such proceeding or submission.

                  13.O     STOCKHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE.

                           (1) APPOINTMENT;  AUTHORITY  GENERALLY.  On behalf of
         the Old Sullivan  Stockholders,  Sullivan hereby appoints ABRY Partners
         as the initial  Stockholder  Representative  under this  Agreement,  to
         serve in accordance  with the terms,  conditions and provisions of this
         Agreement,  and ABRY  Partners,  by its  execution  of this  Agreement,
         hereby agrees to act as such, upon the terms, conditions and provisions
         of  this  Agreement.  From  and  after  the  Closing,  the  Stockholder
         Representative  will be authorized to act on behalf of the Old Sullivan
         Stockholders in accordance with this Agreement.

                           (2) AUTHORIZATION. The Stockholder Representative, in
         such  capacity,  will be  entitled to take all actions on behalf of the
         holders of Sullivan  Shares or the Old  Sullivan  Stockholders,  as the
         case may be, with respect to this  Agreement  and the other  agreements
         contemplated hereby, and omit to take any action, each as directed by

                                    (a) prior to the Effective Time, the holders
                  of capital  stock of Sullivan  having a majority of the voting
                  power represented by the outstanding capital stock of Sullivan
                  at the time in question, and

                                    (b) after the  Effective  Time,  Persons who
                  immediately  prior to the Effective Time held Sullivan  Shares
                  which  represented  a  majority  of the  voting  power  of the
                  Sullivan Shares,

         (in either case, the "Majority Sullivan Stockholders"). The Stockholder
         Representative  may be removed  and  replaced  from time to time as the
         representative  of  the  holders  of the  Sullivan  Shares  or the  Old
         Sullivan  Stockholders by written notice given by the Majority Sullivan
         Stockholders  to  Sullivan  (prior  to  the  Effective  Time)  and  the
         Acquiring Parties.

                           (3)  RESPONSIBILITY.  The Stockholder  Representative
         will have no duties or  responsibilities  except  those  expressly  set
         forth in this  Agreement  or any other  agreement  which may be entered
         into by it  hereunder.  The  Stockholder  Representative  will  have no
         responsibility  for the  validity of this  Agreement  or any  agreement
         referred  to in this  Agreement  or for  the  performance  of any  such
         agreements by any party thereto or for the interpretation of any of the
         provisions of any such  agreements.  The  Stockholder  Representative's
         liability  in  fulfilling  its  duties  will be  limited  to bad faith,
         willful  misconduct or gross  negligence on its part.  The  Stockholder
         Representative will be protected in acting upon any certificate, notice
         or   other   instrument   whatsoever   received   by  the   Stockholder
         Representative as to its due execution,  the validity and effectiveness
         of its  provisions,  and the  truth  and  accuracy  of any  information
         therein  contained that the  Stockholder  Representative  in good faith
         believes to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by a proper
         Person or Persons. The Stockholder Representative may, in its sole 


                                       31


<PAGE>

         discretion,  consult with and obtain  advice from legal counsel and any
         other Person in the event of any  question as to any of the  provisions
         of this  Agreement,  any other  agreement  entered  into in  connection
         herewith or its duties hereunder or thereunder.  The reasonable cost of
         such services, to the extent not borne by Sullivan, will be borne among
         the Old Sullivan  Stockholders  who held  Sullivan  Shares  immediately
         prior to the Effective Time, pro rata in accordance with the respective
         amounts of the Merger  Consideration  to be received by them in respect
         of the Sullivan Shares.

                           (4)   RESIGNATION;   REPLACEMENT.   The   Stockholder
         Representative  will have the right, in its sole discretion,  to resign
         as  the   Stockholder   Representative   (in   its   capacity   as  the
         representative  of the holders of Sullivan  Shares or the Old  Sullivan
         Stockholders)  at any time by  giving  at least 30 days  prior  written
         notice to  Sullivan  (prior to the  Effective  Time) and the  Acquiring
         Parties.  In such event,  Sullivan (prior to the Effective Time) or the
         Majority Sullivan Stockholders (after the Effective Time) will promptly
         appoint another Stockholder  Representative to represent the holders of
         Sullivan  Shares and the Old Sullivan  Stockholders  and give notice of
         such   selection  to  the  Acquiring   Parties  and  the  Old  Sullivan
         Stockholders  (after  the  Effective  Time).  Such  resignation  of the
         Stockholder  Representative  will be  effective  upon such notice being
         given  and such new  Stockholder  Representative's  acceptance  of such
         appointment and will relieve the resigning  Stockholder  Representative
         of all duties and responsibilities of the Stockholder Representative in
         such capacity thereafter arising.

                  13.P COMPLETION OF SULLIVAN'S SCHEDULES. The Acquiring Parties
acknowledge  that  Sullivan  has  executed  this  Agreement  without  having the
opportunity  to request of personnel of the  Stations  information  which may be
material to the preparation of the attached  Schedules referred to in Article IV
(and that, therefore,  some or all of such attached Schedules may not be correct
and complete and, as a result, some or all of the representations and warranties
set forth in Article IV which refer to such  attached  Schedules may not be true
and correct).  On or prior to March 9, 1998, Sullivan may deliver to Sinclair an
amendment and restatement of any such attached Schedule, or any portion thereof,
or a supplement to any such attached Schedule or any portion thereof,  which may
be required in order to accurately depict facts and circumstances which exist on
the date of this Agreement (or any other applicable date referred to in any such
representation  or warranty),  and the attached  Schedule or portion  thereof in
question will be deemed to have been so amended and restated or modified, as the
case may be, as of the time of the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

                  13.Q  TREATMENT  OF  STATION  KOKH.   Each   Acquiring   Party
acknowledges  that,  notwithstanding  any  language  to  the  contrary  in  this
Agreement,  Sullivan  has made  and will  make no  representation,  warranty  or
certification  of any kind with respect to Station KOKH  (including with respect
to the assets,  liabilities  and  operations  related to Station  KOKH),  and no
representation  or  warranty  set  forth in  Article  IV,  and no  certification
relating thereto  delivered  pursuant to Section 3.C, will be deemed to apply to
Station KOKH (including to any related asset, liability or operations).
