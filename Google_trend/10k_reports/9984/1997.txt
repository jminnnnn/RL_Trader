            Item 1.   Business.
                      ---------
                      The Company was organized as a Delaware corporation
            in 1925.  The Company is in three businesses:  Bowman
            Distribution, a distributor of consumable repair and
            replacement products for industrial, heavy equipment, and
            transportation maintenance markets; Associated Spring, a
            manufacturer and distributor of custom-made springs and other
            close-tolerance engineered metal components; and Barnes
            Aerospace, a manufacturer of precision machined and
            fabricated assemblies for the aircraft and aerospace
            industries and a refurbisher of jet engine components.*

                      Bowman Distribution.  Bowman Distribution is
                      -------------------
            engaged in distributing in the United States, Canada, the
            United Kingdom and France a variety of replacement parts and
            other products, including fasteners and special purpose
            hardware, automotive parts, automotive specialties and
            accessories, general purpose electric and gas welding
            supplies, industrial maintenance supplies, and industrial
            aerosols such as adhesives, lubricants, and sealants.

                      The products sold by Bowman Distribution are, for
            the most part, not manufactured by the Company, but are
            obtained from a number of outside suppliers.  The vast
            majority of the products are repackaged and sold under
            Bowman's labels.

                      Sales by Bowman Distribution in the United States
            and Canada are primarily to industrial and food processing
            plants, chemical and petrochemical process industries,
            contractors, new-car dealers, garages, service stations,
            operators of vehicle fleets, railroads, electric utilities,
            and airline ground maintenance facilities.

                      In 1992, the Company sold substantially all of the
            assets of the Pioneer division of Bowman.

                      Associated Spring.  Associated Spring manufactures
                      -----------------
            and distributes a wide variety of custom metal parts for
            mechanical purposes.  It is equipped to produce practically
            every type of spring requiring precision engineering, as well
            as an extensive



            -----------------------
                      *As used in this annual report, "Company" refers to
            the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries except where
            the context requires otherwise, and "Associated Spring,"
            "Barnes Aerospace," and "Bowman Distribution" refer to the
            above-defined businesses, but not to separate corporate
            entities.

                                          1

            variety of precision metal components and assemblies.  Its
            products range in size from fine hairsprings for instruments
            to large springs for heavy machinery, and its output of a
            given metal part may vary in amount from a few units to
            several million.  Associated Spring does not produce leaf
            springs or bed springs.

                      Associated Spring's custom metal parts are sold in
            the United States and through the Company's foreign
            subsidiaries to manufacturers in many industries, chiefly for
            use as components in their own products.  Custom metal parts
            are sold primarily through Associated Spring's sales
            employees.  In view of the diversity of functions which
            Associated Spring's custom metal parts perform, Associated
            Spring's output is characterized by little standardization,
            with the major portion being manufactured to customer
            specifications.

                      The automotive and automotive parts industries
            constitute Associated Spring's largest single custom metal
            parts market.  Other important outlets include manufacturers
            of industrial and textile machinery, motors, generators,
            electronic equipment, aircraft, diesel and other internal
            combustion engines, household appliances and fixtures,
            hardware, office equipment, agricultural equipment, railroad
            equipment, general machinery, and scientific instruments.

                      The Associated Spring Distribution division is
            engaged in the distribution of industrial products to the
            tool and die market, of which die springs manufactured
            primarily by Associated Spring are the principal item.  It
            also distributes certain standard parts manufactured by
            Associated Spring consisting primarily of stock wire and flat
            springs which are sold under the Company's SPEC registered
            trademark.

                      Associated Spring also has manufacturing operations
            in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, and Singapore, and distribution
            operations in the United Kingdom and France.  In 1994, it
            closed its spring manufacturing plants in Gardena,
            California, and Monterrey, Mexico.  The Company has retained
            a minority interest of 15% in its former subsidiary in
            Argentina.

                      The Company is a partner in a joint venture
            corporation in the United States with NHK Spring Co., Ltd. of
            Japan.  The joint venture corporation, NHK-Associated Spring
            Suspension Components Inc. ("NASCO"), has a manufacturing
            facility in Bowling Green, Kentucky.  It manufactures and
            sells hot-wound coil springs for automotive suspension
            systems and counterbalance torque bars for trunk lids. 
            Barnes Group owns a minority interest of 45% in NASCO.

                      Barnes Aerospace.  Barnes Aerospace is engaged in
                      ----------------
            the advanced fabrication and precision machining of
            components for jet engines and airframes as well as the
            repair and overhaul of jet engine components.  Windsor
            Manufacturing, Windsor Airmotive, and Advanced Fabrications
            constitute the Barnes Aerospace Group.

                                          2
<PAGE>



                      Windsor Manufacturing manufactures machined and
            fabricated parts as well as assemblies.  It specializes in
            the machining of difficult-to-process aircraft engine
            superalloys.  Manufacturing processes include computer
            numerically controlled machining, electrical discharge
            machining, laser drilling, creep-feed grinding, and automated
            deburring.  Customers include gas turbine engine
            manufacturers for commercial and military jets as well as
            land-based turbines.

                      Windsor Airmotive specializes in refurbishing jet
            engine components.  Electron beam welding and plasma spray
            are two of the major processes used in this division, and
            customers include approximately 30 airlines and engine
            overhaul businesses worldwide and the U.S. military.  In
            1995, Windsor Airmotive's Singapore operations moved into a
            larger facility.

                      Advanced Fabrications, through its Jet Die and
            Flameco plants, specializes in hot forming and fabricating
            titanium and other high-temperature alloys such as hastelloy
            and inconel for use in precision details and assemblies for
            aircraft engine and airframe applications.  It utilizes
            advanced manufacturing processes including superplastic
            forming and diffusion bonding.

                      Segment Analysis.  The analysis of the Company's
                      ----------------
            revenue from sales to unaffiliated customers, operating
            income, and identifiable assets by industry segments and geo-
            graphic areas appearing on pages 27 and 28 of the Company's
            1996 Annual Report to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13 to
            this report, is incorporated by reference.

                      Competition.  The Company competes with many other
                      -----------
            companies, large and small, engaged in the manufacture and
            sale of custom metal parts (including aerospace components).
             The Company believes Associated Spring is the largest
            domestic manufacturer of precision springs used for
            mechanical purposes.  The Company also faces active
            competition in the products sold by Bowman Distribution.  The
            principal methods of competition for the Company's three
            businesses include service, quality, price, reliability of
            supply, and also, in the case of Associated Spring and Barnes
            Aerospace, technology and design.

                      Backlog.  The backlog of the Company's orders
                      -------
            believed to be firm amounted to $151,142,000 at the end of
            1996, as compared with $111,125,000 at the end of 1995.  Of
            the 1996 year-end backlog, $103,357,000 is attributable to
            the Barnes Aerospace Group and all of the balance is
            attributable to the Associated Spring Group.  $12,078,000 of
            Barnes Aerospace's backlog is not expected to be shipped in
            1997.  Substantially all of the remainder of the Company's
            backlog is expected to be shipped during 1997.

                      Raw Materials and Customers.  None of the Company's
                      ---------------------------
            divisions or groups are dependent upon any single source for
            any of their principal raw materials or products for resale,
            and all such materials and products are readily available. 
            No one customer accounted for more than 10% of total sales in
            1996.  Automotive manufacturers and manufacturers of
            electronic products are important customers of Associated
            Spring.  Sales by Barnes Aerospace to two domestic jet engine
            manufacturers accounted for approximately 50% of its
            business.  Bowman Distribution is not dependent on any one or
            a few customers for a significant portion of its sales.

                      Research and Development.  Although most of the
                      ------------------------
            products manufactured by the Company are custom parts made to
            the customers' specifications, the Company is engaged in
            continuing efforts aimed at discovering and implementing new
            knowledge that is useful in developing new products or
            services or improving significantly an existing product or
            service.  The Company spent approximately $3,957,000 on its
            research and development activities in 1996, as compared to
            expenditures of approximately $3,087,000 in 1995 and
            $2,640,000 in 1994.  There were no significant customer-
            sponsored research and development activities.

                      Patents and Trademarks.  Patents, licenses,
                      ----------------------
            franchises and concessions are not material to any of the
            Company's businesses.

                      Employees.  As of the date of this report, the
                      ---------
            Company employs approximately 3,800 persons.

                      Environmental Laws.  Compliance with federal,
                      ------------------
            state, and local laws which have been enacted or adopted
            regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or
            otherwise relating to the protection of the environment has
            not had a material effect and is not expected to have a
            material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or
            competitive position of the Company.


            Item 2.        Properties.
                           ----------
                      The Company and its Canadian subsidiary operate 12
            manufacturing plants and 14 warehouses at various locations
            throughout the United States and Canada, of which all of the
            plants and 6 of the warehouses are owned in fee, and the
            others are leased.  Of the properties which are owned, none
            is subject to any encumbrance.  The Company's other foreign
            subsidiaries own or lease plant or warehouse facilities in
            the countries where their operations are conducted.  The
            listing of the facility locations of each of the Company's
            businesses contained in the Directory of Operations on the
            inside front cover of the 1996 Annual Report to Stockholders,
            included as Exhibit 13 to this report, is incorporated by
            reference.

                      The Company believes that its owned and leased
            properties have been adequately maintained, are in
            satisfactory operating condition, are suitable and adequate
            for the business activities conducted therein, and have
            productive capacities sufficient to meet current needs.


            Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.
                      -----------------
                      There are no material pending legal proceedings to
            which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party, or
            of which any of their property is the subject.

1.2 The Closing.

                  The Company agrees to sell to you and you agree to purchase
from the Company, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the
principal amount of the Notes set forth opposite your name on Exhibit A hereto
at 100% of the principal amount thereof.

                  The closing of your purchase shall be held at 9:00 a.m. on

1.3 Purchase for Investment.

                  You represent to the Company that you are purchasing the Notes
for investment for your own account and the account of your affiliated entities
and with no present intention of distributing or reselling the Notes or any part
thereof to anyone other than an affiliated entity, but without prejudice,
however, to your right at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any

understood that, in making the representations set out in Sections 2.9 and 2.11,
the Company is relying, to the extent applicable, upon your representation as

                  Simultaneously herewith the Company is executing separate
agreements (the "Other Agreements") with the other purchasers named in Exhibit A

Other Purchasers agrees to purchase from the Company Notes in the principal
amount set forth opposite its name on Exhibit A and makes the same
representations to the Company as you have made in Section 1.3. The purchase
made by each purchaser is to be a separate purchase from the Company, and each
sale and delivery of Notes to each

<PAGE>
                                       -4-




purchaser is to be a separate sale and delivery by the Company to such

SECTION 2. WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS

                  The Company warrants and represents to you that:

2.1 Subsidiaries.

                  Exhibit C to this Agreement correctly identifies (i) each of

to own of each Subsidiary, free and clear in each case of any Lien. All such
shares have been duly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable.

2.2 Corporate Organization and Authority.

                  The Company, and each Subsidiary,

                  (a)      is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
                           in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction
                           of incorporation,

                  (b)      has all requisite power and authority and all
                           necessary licenses, permits, franchises and other

                           the nature of its activities makes such qualification
                           necessary and where the failure to be so qualified
                           would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
                           or Subsidiary's business or financial position.

                                      -5-




2.3 Business, Property, Indebtedness and Liens.

                  (a) The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 1990 filed by the Company with the Securities and
Exchange Commission and previously delivered to you correctly describes the
general nature of the business and principal Properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

                  (b) Exhibit C correctly lists all outstanding Indebtedness for
borrowed money (including all Capitalized Leases) of, and all Liens (other than
those (x) permitted by clauses (i) - (v) of Section 7.6(a) and (y) those on
Property which individually does not have a fair market value in excess of
$500,000 and which, when aggregated with other Property subject to Liens not
included pursuant to this clause (y), does not have a fair market value in
excess of $2,000,000) on Property of, the Company and its Subsidiaries. Neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the
future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of its Property,
whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be subject to a Lien not permitted
by Section 7.6(a).

2.4 Financial Statements.

                  (a) The consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31 in the years 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989,
and 1990 and the related statements of income, retained earnings and changes in
financial position or cash flows for the fiscal years ended on such dates, all
accompanied by reports thereon containing opinions without qualification, except
as therein noted, by Ernst & Young (or its predecessor, Arthur Young & Company),
independent certified public accountants, and the consolidated balance sheets of
the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1991 and the
related statements of income, retained earnings and cash flows for the 6-month
period then ended, certified by the Company's chief financial officer or chief
accounting officer, have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles consistently applied, and present fairly the financial
position of the Company and its Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and
the results of their operations for such periods.

                  (b) Since December 31, 1990 there have been no materially
adverse changes in the Properties, business, prospects, profits or financial
condition of the Company or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

<PAGE>
                                      -6-




2.5 Full Disclosure.

                  The financial statements referred to in Section 2.4 do not,
nor does this Agreement or the Private Placement Memorandum contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit a material fact necessary to make the
statements contained therein or herein not misleading. The descriptions set
forth in Exhibit F of certain other written materials which may have been
furnished to you by the Company is correct. There is no agreement, restriction
or other factual matter which the Company has not disclosed to you in writing
which so far as the Company can now reasonably foresee, will have a material
adverse impact on the longterm financial condition or prospects of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or the ability of the Company to perform this Agreement.

2.6 Pending Litigation; Compliance with Law.

                  There are no proceedings or investigations pending, or to the
knowledge of the Company threatened, against or affecting the Company or any
Subsidiary in or before any court, governmental authority or agency or
arbitration board or tribunal which, so far as the Company can now reasonably
foresee, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse impact
on the longterm financial condition or prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, or would impair the ability of the Company to perform this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in default with respect to
any order of any court, governmental authority or agency or arbitration board or
tribunal or in violation of any laws or governmental rules or regulations where,
so far as the Company can now reasonably foresee, such default or violation will
have a material adverse impact on the longterm financial condition or prospects
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or the ability of the Company to perform
this Agreement.

2.7 Title to Properties.

                  Except where the failure to possess good and marketable title
in fee simple or good title, as the case may be, would not have a material
adverse impact on the Company or on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, the Company, and each Subsidiary, has good and marketable title in fee
simple (or its equivalent under applicable law) to all the real Property, and
has good title to all the other Property, it purports to own, including that
reflected in the most recent balance sheet referred to in Section 2.4 (except as
sold or otherwise disposed of in the ordinary course of business), free from
Liens not permitted by Section 7.6(a).

<PAGE>
                                      -7-




2.8 Patents and Trademarks.

                  The Company, and each Subsidiary, owns or possesses all the
patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses and rights
with respect to the foregoing necessary for the present and planned future
conduct of its business, without any conflict with the rights of others known by
Senior Management.

2.9 Sale is Legal and Authorized.

                  The sale of the Notes by the Company and compliance by the
Company and each Subsidiary with all of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the Notes:

                  (a)      have been duly authorized and are within the
                           corporate powers of the Company and each Subsidiary;
                           and

                  (b)      are legal and will not conflict with, constitute a
                           violation of, or result in the creation of any Lien
                           upon any Property of the Company or any Subsidiary
                           under the provisions of, any agreement, charter
                           instrument, by-law or other instrument to which the
                           Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any
                           of them or their respective Properties may be bound.

The Company is not a party to any agreement, or subject to any charter or other
corporate restriction, which restricts its right or ability to incur
Indebtedness, other than this Agreement and the agreements listed on Exhibit C.

2.10 No Defaults.

                  No event has occurred and no condition exists which, upon the
issue of the Notes, would constitute a Default or an Event of Default. The
Company is not in violation (whether or not temporarily waived) of any term of
any charter instrument or by-law and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
in default under any agreement or other instrument with respect to borrowed
money. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of any term of any
other agreement or instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of
its Property may be bound which violation, individually or in the aggregate with
other violations, will have a materially adverse impact on the longterm business
or prospects of the Company or the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

                                       -8-




2.11 Governmental Consent.

                  Neither the nature of the Company or of any Subsidiary, or of
any of their respective businesses or Properties, nor any relationship between
the Company or any Subsidiary and any other Person, nor any circumstance in
connection with the offer, issue, sale or delivery of the Notes or the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement is such as to require a
consent, approval or authorization of, or filing, registration or qualification
with, any governmental authority on the part of the Company or any Subsidiary in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement or the
offer, issue, sale or delivery of the Notes.

2.12 Taxes.

                  Consolidated Federal income tax returns for the Company and
its Domestic Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service for
all years up to and including the year ended December 31, 1987. The Company and
each of its Subsidiaries have filed or caused to be filed all Federal, state and
local tax returns which, to the knowledge of Senior Management are required to
be filed and have paid or caused to be paid all taxes as shown on such returns
or on any assessment received by it or by any of them, to the extent that such
taxes have become due, except any such tax or assessment the validity of which
is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to
which the Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, has set aside on its books
adequate reserves to the extent the Company or any Subsidiary and a nationally
recognized independent certified public accountant believes such reserves are
necessary. To the extent that the Company in good faith believes is necessary,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have set up reserves which are believed by the
Company to be adequate for the payment of additional taxes. All assessed
deficiencies resulting from examinations by the Internal Revenue Service up to
and including the year ended December 31, 1987 have been discharged, reserved
against or will not impair the Company's ability to repay the Loans.

2.13 Use of Proceeds.

                  The Company will apply the proceeds from the sale of the Notes
to refinance outstanding Indebtedness for borrowed money. None of the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement (including, without limitation
thereof, the use of the proceeds from the sale of the Notes) will violate or
result in a violation of Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or any regulations issued pursuant thereto, including, without

<PAGE>
                                       -9-




limitation, Regulations G, T and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, 12 C.F.R., Chapter II.

2.14 Private Offering.

                  Neither the Company nor Chemical Bank (the only Person
authorized or employed by the Company as agent, broker, dealer or otherwise in
connection with the offering or sale of the Notes or any similar Security of the
Company) has offered any of the Notes or any similar Security of the Company for
sale to, or solicited offers to buy any thereof from, or otherwise approached or
negotiated with respect thereto with, any prospective purchaser, other than the
purchasers of the Notes and not more than twenty-five other institutional
investors, each of whom was offered all or a portion of the Notes at private
sale for investment. The Company agrees that neither the Company nor anyone
acting on its behalf will offer the Notes or any part thereof or any similar
Securities for issue or sale to, or solicit any offer to acquire any of the same
from, anyone so as to bring the issuance and sale of the Notes within the
provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

2.15 ERISA.

                  (a) Relationship of Vested Benefits to Pension Plan Assets.
The present aggregate value of all benefits vested under all qualified "defined
benefit pension plans", as such term is defined in Section 3 of ERISA,
maintained by the Company and its Related Persons, or in which employees of the
Company or any Related Person are entitled to participate, as from time to time
in effect (herein called the "Pension Plans"), did not, as of January 1, 1990,
the last annual valuation date, exceed the actuarial or market value of the
assets of the Pension Plans allocable to such vested benefits.

                  (b) Prohibited Transactions. Neither the Company or any
Related Person nor any of the Pension Plans nor any trusts created thereunder,
nor any trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction", as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, or described in Section 406 of ERISA, which could
subject the Company, any Related Person, any of the Pension Plans, any such
trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party dealing with the
Pension Plans or any such trust to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions
imposed by said Section 4975 or by Section 502(i) of ERISA.

                  (c) Reportable Events. Since December 31, 1986, neither any of
the Pension Plans nor any such trusts have been terminated, nor have there been
any "reportable events", as that

term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, since the effective date of ERISA.

                  (d) Accumulated Funding Deficiency. Neither any of the Pension

maturity, the Company will prepay, and there shall become due and payable,
$3,076,923.08 principal amount of the Notes on March 16 and September 16 in each

with interest accrued thereon to the date of prepayment.

                  (b) The acquisition of any Notes by the Company shall not
reduce or otherwise affect its obligation to make any prepayment required by
Section 5.1(a). Upon any exercise by the Company of the prepayment option in

pro rata basis to reflect such reduction in outstanding principal amount.

5.2 Option to Prepay.

                  The Company may make optional prepayments to prepay the Notes
in whole or in part, in multiples of $1,000,000, at any time at a price equal to

Makewhole Price applicable at such time with respect to the amount of the Notes
being prepaid.

5.3 Notice of Optional Prepayment.

                  The Company will give notice of any optional prepayment of the
Notes to each holder of the Notes not less than 10 Business Days nor more than

section of this Agreement under which the prepayment is to be made, (c) the

date, and (d) the accrued interest applicable to the prepayment, and setting
forth a detailed calculation of what the Makewhole Price would be if the Notes
were being prepaid on the date of such notice. Notice of prepayment having been
so given, the principal amount of the Notes specified in such notice, together
with the premium, if any, and accrued interest thereon, shall become due and
payable on the prepayment date. The Company will provide a supplemental notice
by courier or facsimile confirmed by telephone to be received by each holder of
the Notes by 2:00 p.m., Hartford, Connecticut time, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the date fixed for prepayment which will set forth a

5.4 Partial Payment Pro Rata.

                  If there is more than one Note outstanding at any time the
aggregate principal amount of each required or optional partial payment of the
Notes shall be allocated among the outstanding Notes in proportion, as nearly as
practicable, to the respective unpaid principal amounts of the Notes. For the
purpose of this Section 5.4 only, any Notes reacquired by the Company shall be
deemed to be outstanding.

SECTION 6. REGISTRATION; SUBSTITUTION OF NOTES

6.1 Registration of Notes.

                  The Company will cause to be kept at its office maintained
pursuant to Section 7.3, a register for the registration and transfer of the

and the names and addresses of the transferees of any of the Notes will be

shall be deemed and treated as the owner and holder thereof for all purposes of
this Agreement, and the Company shall not be affected by any notice or knowledge
to the contrary.

maintained pursuant to Section 7.3, the Company, upon request, will execute and
deliver, at its expense (except as provided below), new Notes in exchange

whether or not any such provision is made pursuant to this Section 7.6(b).

                  (a) If an Event of Default described in Section 9.1(f) or
9.1(g) occurs, the entire outstanding principal amount of the Notes shall
automatically become due and payable, without the taking of any action on the
part of any holder of the Notes or any other Person and without the giving of
any notice with respect thereto. If an Event of Default described in Section
9.1(a) or 9.1(b) exists, any holder of Notes may, at its option, exercise any
right, power or remedy permitted by law, including but not limited to the right
by notice to the Company to declare the Notes held by such holder to be
immediately due and payable. If any other Event of Default exists, the holder or
holders of at least 51% in outstanding principal amount of the Notes (exclusive
of Notes owned by the Company, Subsidiaries and Affiliates) may exercise any
right, power or remedy permitted by law, including but not limited to the right
by notice to the Company to declare all the outstanding Notes immediately due
and payable. Upon any such acceleration the principal of the Notes declared due
or automatically becoming due shall be immediately payable together with all
interest accrued thereon without any presentment, demand, protest or other
notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived, and the Company
will immediately pay the greater of (x) the principal of and interest accrued on
such Notes and (y) the Makewhole Price applicable at such time to such Notes;
provided that the Makewhole Price shall not be applicable upon any such
declaration if the only Event of Default existing at such time is the Event of
Default described in Section 9.1(f).

                  (b) No course of dealing or delay or failure on the part of
any holder of the Notes to exercise any right shall operate as a waiver of such
right or otherwise prejudice such holder's rights, powers and remedies. The
Company will pay or reimburse the holders of the Notes, to the extent permitted
by law, for all costs and expenses, including but not limited to reasonable
attorneys' fees, incurred by them in collecting any sums due on the Notes or in
otherwise enforcing any of their rights.

9.3 Annulment of Acceleration of Notes.

                  If a declaration is made pursuant to Section 9.2(a), the
holders of at least 51% of the outstanding principal amount

<PAGE>
                                      -28-




of the Notes may annul such declaration and the consequences thereof if no
judgment or decree has been entered for the payment of any monies due pursuant
to such declaration and if all sums payable under the Notes and this Agreement
(except principal, interest or premium which has become due solely by reason of
such declaration) have been duly paid. No such annulment shall extend to or
waive any subsequent Default or Event of Default.

the most recently published issue of the United States Federal Reserve Bulletin
or its successor publication) most nearly equal to the Weighted Average Life to
Maturity of the Notes (or portions thereof) to be prepaid or repaid at the time.
If there are United States Treasury obligations listed in such publication with

portion thereof, at the time of the determination thereof, means the number of
years obtained by dividing the then Remaining Dollar-years of such Notes or

each then remaining required repayment or redemption (including repayment or
redemption at final maturity) by (B) the number of years (calculated at the
nearest one-twelfth) which will elapse between the date as of which the
calculation is made and the date that such required repayment is due and (2)
totaling all the products obtained in (1).

10.2 Accounting Principles.

                  Where the character or amount of any asset or liability or
item of income or expense is required to be determined or any consolidation or
other accounting computation is required to be made under this Agreement, this
shall be done in accordance with GAAP.

10.3 Directly or Indirectly.

                  Where any provision in this Agreement refers to any action
which a Person is prohibited from taking, the provision shall be applicable
whether such action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person, including
actions taken by or on behalf of any partnership in which such Person is a
general partner and all liabilities of such partnerships shall be considered
liabilities of such Person for purposes of this Agreement.

10.4 Governing Law.

                  This Agreement and the Notes shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with Connecticut law.

         proceeds from the sale of the Notes) will violate or result in a
         violation of Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
         amended, or any regulations issued pursuant thereto, including, without
         limitation, Regulations G, T and X of the Board of Governors of the
         Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R., Chapter II; and

                  (9) Exempted Offering--the issuance, sale and delivery of the
         Notes under the circumstances contemplated by the Agreement are
         exempted transactions under the registration provisions of the
         Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and do not, under existing law,
         require the registration of the Notes under the Securities Act of 1933,
         as amended, or qualification of an indenture under the Trust Indenture
         Act of 1939.

                  (10) Litigation--there is no action, suit or proceeding at law
         or in equity or any investigation pending, or to the best knowledge of
         such counsel threatened, against or affecting the Company or any
         Subsidiary in or before any court, governmental authority or agency or
         arbitration board or tribunal which, individually or in the aggregate
         will have a material adverse impact on the longterm financial condition
         or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or the ability of the
         Company to perform the Agreement.

from time to time, grant Incentives under the Plan to, and only to, Senior
Executives.

the Plan shall not exceed the sum of (i) 500,000 shares, (ii) the number of
shares of such stock available for the granting of options under the 1966 Plan
immediately prior to its expiration, and (iii) the number of shares of such
stock covered by outstanding options (or installments thereof) granted under the
1966 Plan which, after its expiration, shall terminate or expire in whole or in
part without being exercised. Charges against such aggregate number are governed
by the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section 4, paragraph (h) of section

because of the termination without exercise or payment, in whole or in part, of
such Incentive, the shares as to which the Incentive was not exercised or paid
shall no longer be charged against the aggregate and individual limitations in
paragraph (a) of this section 4 and may again be made subject to Incentives.

(d) The Committee may permit the voluntary surrender of all or a portion of any
Incentive granted under this Plan to be conditioned upon the granting to the
employee of a new Incentive for the same or a different number of shares or
amount of other payment as the Incentive surrendered, or may require such
voluntary surrender as a condition to a grant of a new Incentive to such
employee. Such new Incentive shall be exercisable at the price, during the
period, and in accordance with any other terms or conditions specified by the
Committee at the time the new Incentive is granted, all determined in accordance

exercise, or any other terms or conditions of the Incentive surrendered.

5. OPTIONS

Incentives in the form of Options shall be subject to the following provisions:

(a) The Option price per share shall not be less than 85% of the Fair Market
Value at the time of the grant of the Option. In no event shall the Option price
be less than the par value of the stock.

(b) Subject to the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (f) of this section 5 and
the provisions of paragraph (a) of section 12 relating to absence on leave, an
Option granted under the Plan may not be exercised unless, at the time of such
exercise, the optionee shall be in the employ of the Company or a Subsidiary and
shall have completed at least 12 months of continuous employment with the
Company or a Subsidiary or both, from the date of the grant of his Option.

(c) Each Option shall expire at such time as the Committee may determine at the
time the Option shall be granted but not later than ten years from the date such
Option shall have been granted or, if earlier, one year following the optionee's
Normal Retirement Date.

(d) Any Option granted under the Plan may be exercised solely by the person to
whom granted (or by his guardian or legal representative) except as provided in
paragraph (f) (i) of this section 5 in the case of such person's death.

(e) After completion of the required period of employment specified in the
Option grant, the Option may be exercised, in whole or in part, at any time or
from time to time during the balance of the term of the Option, except as
limited by provisions contained in the Option (including provisions regarding
exercise in installments).

employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries, except as follows:

    or within 90 days after termination of such employment, the Option
    theretofore granted to him may only be exercised by his legal representative
    within the period of one year following his death, and in no event after the
    date of expiration of his Option, and then only as and to the extent that he
    was entitled to exercise it at the date of his death; however, in the case
    of any Option exercisable in installments, if the optionee shall die while
    employed by the Company or a Subsidiary or within 90 days after terminating
    employment by Early Retirement or by retiring on or after his Normal
    Retirement Date, such Option may be exercised as to any or all shares which
    would have been purchasable in the following installment period if the
    optionee had not died.

    (ii) If the optionee elects Early Retirement, he may exercise his Option on,
    or any time within one year following the date of such Early Retirement (but
    in no event after the date of expiration of his Option) as to any or all
    shares purchasable on such date and also, in the case of any Option
    exercisable in installments, as to any or all shares which would have been
    purchasable in the following installment period if such retirement had not
    occurred.

    (iii) If the optionee terminates employment by retiring on or after his
    Normal Retirement Date, he may exercise his Option on, or at any time within
    one year following, his Normal Retirement Date (but in no event after the
    date of expiration of his Option) as to any or all shares purchasable on the
    date of exercise.

    (iv) If the optionee terminates employment prior to his Normal Retirement
    Date for any reason other than by death or Early Retirement, he may exercise
    his Option, on the date of such termination or any time within 90 days
    following such termination (but in no event after the date of expiration of
    his Option), as to any or all shares purchasable on the date of his
    termination of employment.

(g) Shares purchased upon exercise of an Option shall be paid for in full at the
time of exercise in cash or, with the consent of the Committee, in whole or in
part in shares of Common Stock (based on their Fair Market Value on the date of
exercise).

(h) The forms of Option authorized by the Plan may contain such other provisions
as the Committee shall deem advisable. Without limiting the foregoing and if so
authorized by the Committee, the Company may, with the consent of the optionee,
and at any time or from time to time, cancel all or a portion of any Option
granted under the Plan then subject to exercise and discharge its obligation in
respect of the Option either by payment to the optionee of an amount of cash
equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value, at such time, of the
shares subject to the portion of the Option so cancelled over the aggregate
purchase price of such shares, or by issuance or transfer to the optionee of
shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value, at such time, equal to any such
excess, or by a combination of cash and shares. Upon any exercise of an Option
or upon any such payment of money or issuance of shares, (i) there shall be
charged against the aggregate and individual limitations in paragraph (a) of
section 4 a number of shares equal to (A) the number of shares so issued plus
(B) the number of shares purchasable with the amount of any cash paid to the
optionee on the basis of the Fair Market Value as of the date of payment; and
(ii) the number of shares subject to the portion of the Option so cancelled,
less the number of shares so charged against such limitations, shall thereafter
be available for other grants of Incentives and shall no longer be charged
against the individual's maximum limitation.

6. STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS

(a) A Stock Appreciation Right may be granted (i) in connection with any Option
granted under the Plan, either at the time of the grant of such Option or at any
time thereafter during the term of the Option, (ii) in connection with any
Option theretofore granted under the 1966 Plan, or (iii) independently of the
grant of an Option.

(b) A Stock Appreciation Right shall entitle the holder thereof, upon exercise
of the Stock Appreciation Right, to receive a number of shares of Common Stock,
or cash or a combination of cash and shares (as the Committee in its discretion
may elect), determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section 6.

                                                                              17

<PAGE>
================================================================================

(c) A Stock Appreciation Right shall be subject to the following terms and
conditions and to such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan
as shall from time to time be approved by the Committee:

  (i) If granted in connection with an Option, a Stock Appreciation Right shall
  be exercisable at such time or times and by such person or persons and to the
  extent, but only to the extent, that the Option to which it relates shall be
  exercisable; provided, however, that such Right (A) shall not be exercisable
  during the first six months following the date of its grant and (B) shall be
  exercisable only during the ten-day periods (the "Exercise Periods") beginning
  on the third business day following the date of release of a summary statement
  of the Company's quarterly or annual sales and earnings and ending on the
  twelfth business day following such date of release.

  (ii) If granted independently of an Option, a Stock Appreciation Right shall
  be subject to the following provisions:

    (A) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (c) (ii)
    and the provisions of paragraph (a) of section 12 relating to absence on
    leave, such Stock Appreciation Right may not be exercised unless, at the
    time of such exercise, the grantee shall be in the employ of the Company or
    a Subsidiary and shall have completed at least 12 months of continuous
    employment with the Company or a Subsidiary or both, from the date of the
    grant of such Right.

    (B) Such Stock Appreciation Right shall expire at such time as the Committee
    may determine at the time the Right shall be granted but not later than ten
    years from the date such Right shall have been granted or, if earlier, one
    year following the employee's Normal Retirement Date.

    (C) Any such Stock Appreciation Right granted under the Plan may be
    exercised solely by the person to whom granted (or by his guardian or legal
    representative) except as provided in subparagraph (E) (1) of this
    paragraph (c) (ii) in the case of such person's death.

    (D) After completion of the required period of employment specified in the
    related Stock Appreciation Right agreement, such Right may be exercised, in
    whole or in part, at any time or from time to time during the balance of the
    term of the Right, except as limited by provisions contained in such
    agreement (including provisions regarding exercise in installments) and
    except that any such Right shall only be exercised during the Exercise
    Periods defined in paragraph (c) (i) of this section 6.

    (E) Such Stock Appreciation Right shall terminate if and when the grantee
    shall cease to be an employee of the Company or a Subsidiary, except as
    follows:

    (1) If the grantee shall die while employed by the Company or a Subsidiary
    or within 90 days after termination of such employment, the Stock
    Appreciation Right theretofore granted to him may only be exercised by his
    legal representative within the period of one year following his death, and
    in no event after the date of expiration of the Stock Appreciation Right,
    and then only as and to the extent that he was entitled to exercise it at
    the date of his death; however, in the case of any Stock Appreciation Right
    exercisable in installments, if the grantee shall die while employed by
    the Company or a Subsidiary or within 90 days after terminating employment
    by Early Retirement or by retiring on or after his Normal Retirement Date,
    such Right may be exercised as to all or that portion of such Right which
    would have been exercisable in the following installment period if the
    grantee had not died.

    (2) If the grantee elects Early Retirement, he may exercise his Stock
    Appreciation Right on, or any time within the one year following the date of
    such Early Retirement (but in no event after the date of expiration of such
    Right) as to all or a portion of such Right exercisable on such date and
    also, in the case of any such Right exercisable in installments, as to all
    or a portion of such Right which would have been exercisable in the
    following installment period if such retirement had not occurred.

    (3) If the grantee terminates employment by retiring on or after his Normal
    Retirement Date, he may exercise his Stock Appreciation Right on, or at any
    time within one year following, his Normal Retirement Date (but in no event
    after the date of expiration of such Right) as to all or a portion of such
    Right exercisable on the date of exercise.

18

<PAGE>
================================================================================

    (4) If the grantee terminates employment prior to his Normal Retirement Date
    for any reason other than by death or Early Retirement, he may on the date
    of such termination or within 90 days following such termination (but in no
    event after the date of expiration of his Stock Appreciation Right) exercise
    such Right if and to the extent that he was entitled to exercise it at the
    date of such termination.

(d) Upon exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right, the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive a number of shares equal in Fair Market Value to (1 ) the
amount by which the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of
such exercise shall exceed the Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on
the date of grant of the related Option, or, in the case of any such Right
granted independently of an option, on the date of grant of such Right (except
that if any such Right shall be granted in connection with an Option previously
outstanding under the Plan or the 1966 Plan, and if such Right shall so provide,
the Fair Market Value of a share of Common stock on the date of grant of such
Right, if such Fair Market Value is lower than the Fair Market Value at the time
of grant of the related Option, may be used instead of the Fair Market Value at
the time of grant of the related Option), multiplied by (2) the number of shares
in respect of which such Right shall have been exercised. Settlement for any
fraction of a share due shall be made in cash. The Committee may settle all or
any part of the Company's obligation arising out of an exercise of any such
Right by the payment of cash equal to the aggregate value of the shares of
Common Stock that it would otherwise be obligated to deliver under the
provisions of this paragraph (d).

(e) Upon exercise of any Stock Appreciation Right, (i) there shall be charged
against the aggregate and individual limitations in paragraph (a) of section 4 a
number of shares equal to (A) the number of shares issued to the grantee under
paragraph (d) of this section 6 plus (B) the number of shares purchasable with
the amount of any cash paid to the grantee on the basis of the Fair Market Value
as of the date of payment; and (ii) the portion of the Incentive in respect of
which such Right shall have been exercised shall be cancelled and the number of
shares subject to such portion, less the number of shares so charged against
such limitations, shall thereafter be available for other grants of Incentives
and shall no longer be charged against the individual's maximum limitation.

7. INCENTIVE STOCK RIGHTS

(a) An Incentive Stock Right will consist of incentive stock units, each of
which will be equivalent to one share of the Company's Common Stock. An
Incentive Stock Right wi11 be evidenced by an agreement in form approved by the
Committee,will be nontransferable, will entitle the holder to receive shares of
Common Stock, without payment to the Company, after the lapse of the incentive
period or periods established by the Committee and wi11 be subject to the
limitations in paragraph (a) of section 4. Holders of Incentive Stock Rights
will be entitled, from the date of the award, to receive from the Company cash
payments equal to the amount of dividends declared on the number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the number of incentive stock units held by them, such
payments to be made on the Company's dividend payment dates.

(b) In the event of termination of employment by reason of death, Disability or
Early Retirement during an incentive period, the Committee may provide that such
period will lapse on the date of termination with respect to that proportion of
the incentive stock units that are to vest at the close of such period as the
number of full months in such period up to the date of termination bears to the
number of months in such period. To the extent that incentive periods have not
lapsed prior to the termination of employment for the foregoing or any other
reason, the Incentive Stock Right will terminate on termination of employment.

(c) After the lapse of the incentive period and the issuance of shares, there
will be charged against the aggregate and individual limitations in paragraph
(a) of section 4 the number of shares equal to the number of shares issued.

                                                                              19

================================================================================

8. PERFORMANCE UNIT AWARDS

(a) A Performance Unit Award will consist of performance units granted to Senior
Executives selected by the Committee. Performance units may be granted alone or
in conjunction with and related to an Option. When granted in conjunction with
an Option, the number of performance units, unless otherwise provided by the
Committee, will be equal to the number of shares under the related Option. To
the extent that the Committee elects to pay performance units granted with a
related Option, there will be a proportionate reduction in the number of shares
available under such Option and any related Stock Appreciation Right. To the
extent the related Option or a Stock Appreciation Right granted in connection
with such Option is exercised, the related number of performance units will be
proportionately reduced.

(b) The Committee will establish an initial value for each performance unit at
the time of grant. At that time the Committee will also establish performance
targets to be achieved during the award period of not less than one year set by
the Committee. The value of the performance units at the end of the award period
will be determined by the degree to which the performance targets are achieved.
However, in no event will the value be greater than the initial value
established at the time of the grant. Performance Unit Awards will be subject to
the limitations in paragraph (a) of section 4 and will be evidenced by
agreements setting forth the initial value for each performance unit, the
performance targets and award period and such other terms and conditions not
inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may determine.

(c) Payment, if any, at the end of the award period will be made in cash, shares
of Common Stock, or both, as determined by the Committee. A Performance Unit
Award granted alone, not in conjunction with an Option, is automatically payable
if the conditions are met. A Performance Unit Award granted in conjunction with
an Option is payable only at the election of the Committee, as an alternative to
the continuance of the related option and any related Stock Appreciation Right.
The Committee may make this election to pay only during the first two months
after the end of the award period. If the election to pay is not made, the
Performance Unit Award terminates and the related Option and Stock Appreciation
Right continue in effect.

(d) In the event of termination of employment by reason of death, Disability, or
Early Retirement prior to the end of the award period, or if employment
terminates for any other reason during the final year of the award period
(excepting termination for cause), a pro rata portion of the value of the
performance units at the end of the award period will be paid to the employee
(or his estate in the case of death), unless the Committee determines that a
different portion be payable or elects to terminate the award. Upon termination
of employment under any other circumstances, the Performance Unit Award will
terminate.

(e) Upon payment of a Performance Unit Award there shall be charged against the
aggregate and individual limitations in paragraph (a) of section 4 a number of
shares equal to (i) the number of shares issued to the employee in respect of
the Performance Unit Award plus (ii) the number of shares purchasable with the
amount of any cash paid to the employee in respect of the Performance Unit Award
on the basis of the Fair Market Value as of the date of payment.

(f) The Committee may make such adjustments to the publicly reported amounts of
the Company's consolidated earnings or book values it deems appropriate for
changes in accounting practices or principles, for material acquisitions or
dispositions of stock or property, for recapitalizations or reorganizations or
for any other events with respect to which the Committee determines such an
adjustment to be appropriate in order to avoid distortion in the operation of
the Plan.

9. ADJUSTMENT PROVISIONS

The Options granted under the Plan shall contain such provisions as the
Committee may determine with respect to adjustments to be made in the number and
kind of shares covered by such Options and in the Option price in the event of a
reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend, combination of
shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering or any other change in the
corporate structure of shares of the Company; and in the event of any such
change, the aggregate number and kind of shares available under the Plan and the
maximum number of shares that may be charged under the Plan on account of any
one individual shall be appropriately adjusted. In the event of any such change,
equitable adjustments shall also be made by the Committee in its discretion in
the terms and conditions of any Stock Appreciation Right, Incentive Stock Right
and Performance Unit Award granted under the Plan.

Committee and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the Committee, shall
be fully as effective as if made by a unanimous vote at a meeting duly called
and held. The Committee may appoint a Secretary, shall keep minutes of its
meetings and shall make such rules and regulations for the conduct of its
business and for the carrying out of the Plan as it shall deem appropriate.

(c) Incentives under the Plan shall be granted in accordance with the

other reason, if such absence is approved by the Committee, shall not be
considered an interruption or termination of employment for any purpose of the
Plan, or Incentives granted thereunder, except that no Incentive may be granted
to an employee while he is absent on leave.

(b) Incentives may be granted under the Plan from time to time in substitution
for non-qualified stock options and/or stock appreciation rights held by

Company or a Subsidiary as the result of a merger or consolidation of the
employing corporation with the Company or a Subsidiary, or the acquisition by
the Company or a Subsidiary of the assets of the employing corporation, or the
acquisition by the Company or a Subsidiary of stock of the employing corporation
as the result of which it becomes a Subsidiary. Further, Stock Appreciation
Rights may be granted under the Plan from time to time in connection with
nonqualified stock options assumed by the Company or a Subsidiary as part of any
such merger, consolidation or acquisition. The terms and conditions of the
substituted Incentives or related Stock Appreciation Rights so granted may vary
from the terms and conditions set forth in sections 5 and 6 to such extent as
the Board may deem appropriate to conform in whole or in part to the provisions
of the substituted incentives.

(c) Nothing in the Plan nor in any instrument executed pursuant thereto shall
confer upon any employee any right to continue in the employ of the Company or a
Subsidiary.

(d) No shares of Common Stock shall be sold, issued or transferred pursuant to,
or accepted as payment of the Option price of, an Incentive unless and until
there has been compliance, in the opinion of the Company's General Counsel, with
all applicable legal requirements, including without limitation those relating
to securities laws and stock exchange listings.

(e) No employee (individually or as a member of a group), and no beneficiary or
other person claiming under or through him, shall have any right, title or
interest in or to any shares of Common Stock allocated or reserved for the Plan

shall have been sold, issued or transferred to him.

                                                                              21

shall be assignable or subject to any encumbrance, pledge or charge of any
nature, whether by operation of law or otherwise, (ii) shall be subject to
execution, attachment or similar process, or (iii) shall be transferable other
than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and every Incentive and
all rights under the Plan shall be exercisable during the employee's lifetime
only by him or by his guardian or legal representative.

(h) Nothing in the Plan is intended to be a substitute for, or shall preclude or
limit the establishment or continuation of, any other plan, practice or
arrangement for the payment of compensation or fringe benefits to any employee
which the Company or any Subsidiary now has or may hereafter put into effect,
including without limitation, any retirement, pension, savings or thrift,
insurance, death benefit, stock purchase, incentive compensation or bonus plan.

13. AMENDMENT OR DISCONTINUANCE OF PLAN

materially increases the benefits accruing to participants under the Plan, (iii)

                                  THE CREDITS

         2.01. Revolving Credit Loans.

         (a) Revolving Credit Commitments. Subject to the terms and conditions
and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each
Lender, severally and not jointly, agrees (such agreement being herein called
such Lender's "Revolving Credit Commitment") to make loans (the "Revolving
Credit Loans") to the Borrower from time to time on or after the date hereof and
to but not including the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. A Lender shall have no
obligation to make any Revolving Credit Loan to the extent that the aggregate
principal amount of such Lender's Revolving Credit Loans at any time would
exceed such Lender's Revolving Credit Committed Amount at such time. Each
Lender's "Revolving Credit Committed Amount" at any time shall be equal to the
amount set forth as its "Initial Revolving Credit Committed Amount" below its
name on the signature pages hereof, as such amount may have been reduced
pursuant to Section 2.02(d) hereof at such time, and subject to transfer to
another Lender as provided in Section 9.14 hereof. The sum of the Revolving
Credit Committed Amounts of the Lenders shall not exceed $100,000,000 at any
time.

         (b) Nature of Credit. Within the limits of time and amount set forth in
this Section 2.01, and subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrower
may borrow, repay and reborrow Revolving Credit Loans hereunder.

         (c) Revolving Credit Notes. The obligation of the Borrower to repay the
unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans made to it by each Lender
and to pay interest thereon shall be evidenced in part by promissory notes of
the Borrower, one to each Lender, dated the Closing Date (the "Revolving Credit
Notes") in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, with the blanks
appropriately filled, payable to the order of such Lender in a face amount equal
to such Lender's Initial Revolving Credit Committed Amount.

         (d) Maturity. To the extent not due and payable earlier, the Revolving
Credit Loans shall be due and payable on the Revolving Credit Maturity Date.

         2.02. Fees; Reduction of the Committed Amounts.

         (a) Commitment Fee. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account
of each Lender a commitment fee (the "Commitment Fee") equal to 0.250% per annum
(based on a year of 365 or 366 days and actual days elapsed), for each day from
and including the Closing Date and to but not including the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date, of the amount (not less than zero) equal to (i) such Lender's
Revolving Credit Committed Amount on such day, minus (ii) such Lender's
Revolving Credit Loans outstanding on

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

such day. Such Commitment Fee shall be due and payable for the preceding period
for which such fee has not been paid (x) on each Regular Payment Date and (y) on
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. The Commitment Fee shall be increased to
0.375% for each day on which the aggregate Revolving Credit Loans of all Lenders
outstanding exceeds 75% of the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments of all
Lenders.

         (b) Closing Fee. On the Closing Date, the Borrower shall pay to the
Agent for the account of each Lender a closing fee equal to 0.05% of such
Lender's Revolving Credit Committed Amount.

         (c) Other Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent an agency fee and
other fees at the times and in the amounts previously agreed upon among the
Agent and the Borrower.

         (d) Optional Reduction of the Revolving Credit Committed Amounts. The
Borrower may at any time or from time to time reduce Pro Rata the Revolving
Credit Committed Amounts of the Lenders to an aggregate amount (which may be
zero) not less than the sum of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans plus the
principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans not yet outstanding as to which
notice has been given by Borrower under Section 2.05 hereof. Any reduction of
the Revolving Credit Committed Amounts shall be in an aggregate amount not less
than $5,000,000 which is an integral multiple of $1,000,000. Reduction of the
Revolving Credit Committed Amounts shall be made by providing not less than 10
days notice (which notice shall be irrevocable) to such effect to the Agent.

         2.03. Extension of Revolving Credit Maturity Date. On and after the
first Anniversary Date hereof, the Revolving Credit Maturity Date may be
extended for successive one year periods at the request of the Borrower with the
express consent of each Lender as provided below. Not later than the date 60
days prior to each Anniversary Date, the Borrower shall, at its option, in a
written notice to the Agent request (an "Extension Request") that the Revolving
Credit Maturity Date be extended for a period of one year. The Agent shall
promptly inform the Lenders of such Extension Request. Each Lender that agrees
with such Extension Request shall deliver to the Agent its express written
consent thereto no later than such Anniversary Date. If (i) any Lender notifies
the Agent in writing prior to such Anniversary Date that it will not consent to
such Extension Request or (ii) all of the Lenders have not in writing expressly
consented to any such Extension Request as provided in the preceding sentence,
then the Agent shall so notify the Borrower and the Borrower, at its option, may
replace each Lender which has not agreed to such Extension Request (a
"Nonextending Lender") with another commercial lending institution (a
"Replacement Lender") by giving (not later than 90 days after such Anniversary
Date) notice of the name of such Replacement Lender to the Agent. Upon notice
from


                                      -16-

<PAGE>
the Agent, each Nonextending Lender shall promptly (but in no event later than
the date which is 120 days after such Anniversary Date) assign all of its
interests hereunder to such Replacement Lender in accordance with the provisions
of Section 9.14(c) hereof. If, prior to the date which is 120 days after such
Anniversary Date some, but not all, of the Lenders have agreed to such Extension
Request, and each Nonextending Lender has not been replaced by the Borrower in
accordance with the terms of this Section 2.03, the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date shall be extended in accordance with such Extension Request; provided,
however, that on the original Revolving Credit Maturity Date (as such date may
have been previously extended), the Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
account of such Nonextending Lender such Nonextending Lender's Pro Rata share of
all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans, together with interest thereon, and all
fees due and payable to such Nonextending Lender and the total Revolving Credit
Commitment shall be irrevocably reduced by an amount equal to the Commitment of
each Nonextending Lender. If all Lenders consent to any such Extension Request
(or, if any Nonextending Lenders are replaced in accordance with this Section),
then as of 5:00 p.m. Pittsburgh time on the date which is 120 days after such
Anniversary Date the Revolving Credit Maturity Date shall be deemed to have been
extended for, and shall be the date, one year after the then effective Revolving
Credit Maturity Date.

         2.04. Maximum Aggregate Amount of Revolving Credit Loans. No Loan shall
be made or requested or permitted to remain outstanding hereunder if the making 
or maintenance of such Loan would cause the aggregate amount of all Revolving
Credit Loans outstanding hereunder to exceed the sum of the aggregate Revolving
Credit Committed Amounts of all Lenders.

         2.05. Making of Loans. Whenever the Borrower desires that the Lenders
make Revolving Credit Loans, the Borrower shall provide Standard Notice to the
Agent setting forth the following information (a separate notice being required
for each such type of Loans):

                  (a) The date, which shall be a Business Day, on which such
         proposed Loans are to be made;

                  (b) The aggregate principal amount of such proposed Loans,
         which shall be the sum of the principal amounts selected pursuant to
         clause (c) of this Section 2.05, and which shall be an integral
         multiple of $1,000,000 not less than $5,000,000;

                  (c) The interest rate Option or Options selected in accordance
         with Section 2.06(a) hereof and the principal amounts selected in
         accordance with Section 2.06(d) hereof of the Base Rate Portion and
         each Funding Segment of the CD Rate Portion and the Euro-Rate Portion,
         as the case may be, of such proposed Loans; and

         Loans, the Funding Period to apply to such Funding Segment, selected in
         accordance with Section 2.06(c) hereof.

Standard Notice having been so provided, the Agent shall promptly notify each
Lender of the information contained therein and of the amount of such Lender's
Loan. Unless any applicable condition specified in Article IV hereof has not
been satisfied, on the date specified in such Standard Notice each Lender shall
make the proceeds of its Loan available to the Agent at the Agent's Office, no
later than 12:00 o'clock Noon, Pittsburgh time, in funds immediately available

Agent and to but excluding the date of repayment on one or more bases selected
by the Borrower from among the interest rate Options set forth below. Subject to
the provisions of this Agreement the Borrower may select different Options to
apply simultaneously to different Portions of the Loans and may select different
Funding Segments to apply simultaneously to different parts of the CD Rate
Portion or the Euro-Rate Portion of the Loans. Each selection of a rate Option
shall apply separately and without overlap to the Revolving Credit Loans as a
class. The aggregate number of Funding Segments applicable to the CD Rate
Portion and the Euro-Rate Portion of the Revolving Credit Loans at any time
shall not exceed six unless otherwise permitted by the Agent.

                  (i) Base Rate Option: A rate per annum (computed on the basis
         of a year of 365 or 366 days and actual days elapsed) for each day
         equal to the Base Rate for such day plus the Applicable Margin for such
         day. The "Base Rate" for any day shall mean the greater of (A) the
         Prime Rate for such day or (B) 0.50% plus the Federal Funds Effective
         Rate for such day, such interest rate to change automatically from time
         to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Prime
         Rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate.

                  (ii) CD Rate Option: A rate per annum (based on a year of 360
         days and actual days elapsed) for each day equal to the CD Rate for
         such day plus the Applicable Margin for such day. "CD Rate" for any day
         shall mean for each Funding Segment of the CD Rate Portion
         corresponding to a proposed or existing CD Rate Funding Period the rate
         per annum determined by the Agent by adding

                           (A) the rate per annum (which shall be the same for
                  each day in such CD Rate Funding Period) determined

                                      -18-

<PAGE>

         in good faith by the Agent in accordance with its usual procedures
         (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) to be
         the arithmetic average of the rates offered to the Reference Banks at
         or about 11:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the first day of such CD Rate
         Funding Period by dealers of recognized standing in negotiable
         certificates of deposit for the purchase at face value of negotiable
         certificates of deposit of major money center banks for delivery on
         such day in amounts comparable to such Funding Segment and having
         maturities comparable to such CD Rate Funding Period plus

                 (B) the Assessment Rate.

         "Assessment Rate" for any day shall mean the rate per annum (rounded
upward to the nearest 1/100 of 1%) determined in good faith by the Agent in
accordance with its usual procedures (which determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error) to be the maximum effective rate per annum payable by a
depository institution insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (or
any successor) for such day as an assessment for insurance on Dollar time
deposits, exclusive of any credit that is or may be allowed against such
assessment on account of assessment payments made or to be made by such
depository institution. The CD Rate shall be adjusted automatically as of the
effective date of each change in the Assessment Rate. The CD Rate Option shall
be calculated in accordance with the foregoing if any Lender is actually
required to pay FDIC assessments or, if required to pay such assessments, is
required to pay such assessments at the "Assessment Rate" as herein defined.

         The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and to the Lenders
of the CD Rate determined or adjusted in accordance with the definition of CD
Rate, which determination or adjustment shall be conclusive if made in good
faith.

         (iii) Euro-Rate Option: A rate per annum (based on a year of 360 days
and actual days elapsed) for each day equal to the Euro-Rate for such day plus,
in each case, the Applicable Margin for such day. "Euro-Rate" for any day, as
used herein, shall mean for each Funding Segment of the Euro-Rate Portion
corresponding to a proposed or existing Euro-Rate Funding Period the rate per
annum determined by the Agent to be the rate of interest (which shall be the
same for each day in such Euro-Rate Funding Period) determined in good faith by
the Agent in accordance with its usual procedures (which determination shall be
conclusive absent manifest error) to be the average of the rates per annum for
deposits in Dollars offered to the Reference Banks in the London interbank
market at approximately 11:00 a.m., London time,

                                      -19-

<PAGE>

         two Business Days prior to the first day of such Euro-Rate Funding
         Period for delivery on the first day of such Euro-Rate Funding Period
         in amounts comparable to such Funding Segment and having maturities
         comparable to such Funding Period.

                  The Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower and to the
         Lenders of the Euro-Rate determined in accordance with the definition
         of the Euro-Rate, which determination shall be conclusive if made in
         good faith.

                  (b) Applicable Margins. The "Applicable Margin" and interest
rate Option for any day shall mean the percentage set forth below:

</TABLE>


                  (c) Funding Periods. At any time when the Borrower shall
select, convert to or renew the CD Rate Option or the Euro-Rate Option to apply
to any part of the Loans, the Borrower shall specify one or more periods (the
"Funding Periods") during which each such Option shall apply, such Funding
Periods being as set forth below:

Interest Rate Option                         Available Funding Periods

CD Rate Option                               30, 60, 90 or 180 days or such
                                             longer period as may be offered by

                                      -20-

<PAGE>

provided, that:

                  (i) Each CD Rate Funding Period which would otherwise end on a
         day which is not a Business Day shall be extended to the next
         succeeding Business Day;

                  (ii) Each Euro-Rate Funding Period shall begin on a Business
         Day, and the term "month", when used in connection with a Euro-Rate
         Funding Period, shall be construed in accordance with prevailing
         practices in the interbank eurodollar market at the commencement of
         such Euro-Rate Funding Period, as determined in good faith by the Agent
         (which determination shall be conclusive);

                  (iii) The Borrower may not select a Funding Period that would
         end after the Revolving Credit Maturity Date; and

                  (iv) The Borrower shall, in selecting any Funding Period,
         allow for scheduled mandatory payments of the Loans.

         (d) Transactional Amounts. Every selection of, conversion from,
conversion to or renewal of an interest rate Option and every payment or
prepayment of any Loans shall be in a principal amount such that after giving
effect thereto the aggregate principal amount of the Base Rate Portion of the
Revolving Credit Loans shall be $1,000,000 and integral multiples thereof, and
the aggregate principal amount of each Funding Segment of the CD Rate Portion or
the Euro-Rate Portion of the Revolving Credit Loans shall be $5,000,000 and
integral multiples of $1,000,000 thereof.

         (e) CD Rate or Euro-Rate Unascertainable; Impracticability. If

                  (i) on any date on which a CD Rate or a Euro-Rate would
         otherwise be set the Agent (in the case of clauses (A) or (B) below)
         shall have determined in good faith (which determination shall be
         conclusive absent manifest error) that:

                           (A) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
                  ascertaining such CD Rate or Euro-Rate, or

                           (B) a contingency has occurred which materially and
                  adversely affects the secondary market for negotiable
                  certificates of deposit maintained by dealers of recognized
                  standing or the interbank eurodollar market, as the case may
                  be, or

                  (ii) at any time any Lender shall have determined in good
         faith (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error)
         that the making, maintenance or funding of any part of the CD Rate
         Portion or the Euro-Rate Portion has


                                      -21-

<PAGE>

         been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Lender or a
         Notional Euro-Rate Funding Office in good faith with any Law or
         guideline or interpretation or administration thereof by any
         Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or
         administration thereof or with any request or directive of any such
         Governmental Authority (whether or not having the force of law);

then, and in any such event, the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, may
notify the Borrower of such determination (and any Lender giving such notice
shall notify the Agent). Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice
(which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation
of each of the Lenders to allow the Borrower to select, convert to or renew the
CD Rate Option or Euro-Rate Option, as the case may be, shall be suspended until
the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, shall have later notified the
Borrower (and any Lender giving such notice shall notify the Agent) of the
Agent's or such Lender's determination in good faith (which determination shall
be conclusive absent manifest error) that the circumstance giving rise to such
previous determination no longer exist.

         If any Lender notifies the Borrower of a determination under subsection
(ii) of this Section 2.06(e), the CD Rate Portion or the Euro-Rate Portion, as
the case may be, of the Loans of such Lender (the "Affected Lender") shall,
subject to Section 2.12(b) hereof, automatically be converted to the Base Rate
Option as of the last day of the then current Funding Period with respect to
such Loans (in the case of a determination that the making, maintenance or
funding of any CD Rate Portion or Euro-Rate Portion of such Loans is
impracticable) and the last day on which the making, maintenance or funding of
any CD Rate Portion or Euro-Rate Portion of such Loans is not unlawful (in the
case of a determination that the making, maintenance or funding of any CD Rate
Portion or Euro-Rate Portion of such Loans is unlawful) and accrued interest
thereon shall be due and payable on such date.

         If at the time the Agent or a Lender makes a determination under
subsection (i) or (ii) of this Section 2.06(e), the Borrower previously has
notified the Agent that it wishes to select, convert to or renew the CD Rate
Option or the Euro-Rate Option, as the case may be, with respect to any proposed
Loans but such Loans have not yet been made, such notification shall be deemed
to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option
instead of the CD Rate Option or the Euro-Rate Option, as the case may be, with
respect to such Loans or, in the case of a determination by a Lender, such Loans
of such Lender.

         2.07. Conversion or Renewal of Interest Rate Options.

         (a) Conversion or Renewal. Subject to the provisions of Section 2.12(b)
hereof, so long as no Event of Default or



                                      -22-

<PAGE>

Potential Default shall have occurred or be continuing hereunder, the Borrower
may convert any part of its Loans from any interest rate Option or Options to
one or more different interest rate Options and may renew the CD Rate Option or
the Euro-Rate Option as to any Funding Segment of the CD Rate Portion or the
Euro-Rate Portion:

                  (i) At any time with respect to conversion from the Base Rate
         Option; or

                  (ii) At the expiration of any Funding Period with respect to
         conversions from or renewals of the CD Rate Option or the Euro-Rate
         Option, as the case may be, as to the Funding Segment corresponding to
         such expiring Funding Period.

Whenever the Borrower desires to convert or renew any interest rate Option or
Options, the Borrower shall provide to the Agent Standard Notice setting forth
the following information:

                  (w) The date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the
         proposed conversion or renewal is to be made;

                  (x) The principal amounts selected in accordance with Section
         2.06(d) hereof of the Base Rate Portion and each Funding Segment of the
         CD Rate Portion and the Euro-Rate Portion, as the case may be, to be
         converted from or renewed;

                  (y) The interest rate Option or Options selected in accordance
         with Section 2.06(a) hereof and the principal amounts selected in
         accordance with Section 2.06(d) hereof of the Base Rate Portion and
         each Funding Segment of the CD Rate Portion and the Euro-Rate Portion,
         as the case may be, to be converted to; and

                  (z) With respect to each Funding Segment to be converted to or
         renewed, the Funding Period selected in accordance with Section 2.06(c)
         hereof to apply to such Funding Segment.

Standard Notice having been so provided, on and after the date specified in such
Standard Notice, interest shall be calculated upon the principal amount of the
Loans as so converted or renewed. Interest on the principal amount of any part
of the Loans converted or renewed (automatically or otherwise) shall be due and
payable on the conversion or renewal date.

                  (b) Failure to Convert or Renew. Absent payment of a Loan or
due notice from the Borrower of conversion or renewal in the circumstances
described in Section 2.07(a)(ii) hereof, any part of the CD Rate Portion or
Euro-Rate Portion for which such notice is not received shall be converted
automatically to the Base Rate Option on the last day of the expiring Funding
Period.

         2.08. Prepayments Generally. Whenever the Borrower desires or is
required to prepay any part of its Loans, it shall provide Standard Notice to
the Agent setting forth the following information:

         proposed prepayment is to be made;

                  (b) The total principal amount of such prepayment, which shall
         be the sum of the principal amounts selected pursuant to clause (c) of
         this Section 2.08; and

                  (c) The principal amounts selected in accordance with Section
         2.06(d) hereof of the Base Rate Portion and each part of each Funding
         Segment of the CD Rate Portion and the Euro-Rate Portion, as the case
         may be, to be prepaid.

Standard Notice having been so provided, on the date specified in such Standard
Notice, the principal amounts of the Base Rate Portion and each part of the CD
Rate Portion and the Euro-Rate Portion specified in such notice, together with
interest on each such principal amount to such date, shall be due and payable.

         2.09. Prepayments. (a) The Borrower shall have the right at its option
from time to time to prepay its Revolving Credit Loans in whole or part without
premium or penalty (subject, however, in the case of clause (iii) below, to
Section 2.12(b) hereof):

                  (i) At any time (other than a time when Standard Notice
         requesting the making of Revolving Credit Loans bearing interest under
         the Euro-Rate Option has been given by the Borrower but such Loans have
         not yet been made) with respect to any part of the Base Rate Portion;

                  (ii) At the expiration of any Funding Period with respect to
         prepayment of the CD Rate Portion or the Euro-Rate Portion, as the case
         may be, with respect to any part of the Funding Segment corresponding

         as the case may be, with respect to any part of the Funding Segment

         indemnity payment set forth in Section 2.12(b) hereof.

         (b) All prepayments shall be made in accordance with Section 2.08
hereof.



                                      -24-

Lender as provided in Section 2.06(e) hereof and payments to a Lender subject to

to make a Revolving Credit Loan shall not relieve any other Lender of its
obligation to lend hereunder, but neither the Agent nor any Lender shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Lender to make a Revolving Credit Loan.

                  (b) Payments Generally. All payments and prepayments to be
made by the Borrower in respect of principal, interest, fees, indemnity,
expenses or other amounts due from the Borrower to the Agent for the account of

from time to time in funds immediately available at such account. Any payment or
prepayment received by the Agent or such Lender after 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh
time, on any day shall be deemed to have been received on the next



                                      -25-

<PAGE>

succeeding Business Day. The Agent shall distribute to the Lenders all such
payments received by it from the Borrower as promptly as practicable after
receipt by the Agent.

          (c) Interest on Overdue Amounts. To the extent permitted by law, after
there shall have become due (by acceleration or otherwise) principal, interest,
fees, indemnity, expenses or any other amounts due from the Borrower hereunder
or under any other Loan Document, such amounts shall bear interest for each day
until paid (before and after judgment), payable on demand, at a rate per annum
based on a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed
(in the case of any Portion of Loans bearing interest at the Base Rate Option)
and 360 days and actual days elapsed (in the case of any Portion of Loans
bearing interest at the CD Rate Option or the Euro-Rate Option) which for each
day shall be equal to the following:

                  (i) In the case of any part of the CD Rate Portion or
         Euro-Rate Portion of any Loans, (A) until the end of the applicable
         then-current Funding Period at a rate per annum 200 basis points above

         accordance with the following clause (ii); and

                  (ii) In the case of any other amount due from the Borrower

         current Base Rate.

                  2.12. Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances.

         (a) Increased Costs or Reduced Return Resulting From Taxes, Reserves,
Capital Adequacy Requirements, Expenses, Etc. If any Law or change therein or
guideline or interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority
charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance with any
request or directive of any Governmental Authority (whether or not having the
force of law) adopted or made after the date hereof:

                  (i) subjects any Lender or any Notional Euro-Rate Funding
         Office to any tax or changes the basis of taxation with respect to this
         Agreement, the Notes, the Loans or payments by the Borrower of
         principal, interest, commitment fee or other amounts due from the
         Borrower hereunder or under the Notes (except for taxes on the overall
         net income or overall gross receipts of such Lender or such Notional
         Euro-Rate Funding Office imposed by the jurisdictions (federal, state
         and local) in which the Lender's principal office or Notional Euro-Rate
         Funding Office is located),

                  (ii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve,
         special deposit or similar requirement against credits or commitments
         to extend credit extended by, assets (funded or contingent) of,
         deposits with or for the account of, other

         Office (other than requirements expressly included herein in the
         determination of the CD Rate, the Euro-Rate, or the determination of
         additional interest pursuant to Section 2.12(c) hereof, as the case may
         be, hereunder),

                  (iii) imposes, modifies or deems applicable any capital
         adequacy or similar requirement (A) against assets (funded or
         contingent) of, or credits or commitments to extend credit extended by,
         any Lender or any Notional Euro-Rate Funding Office, or (B) otherwise
         applicable to the obligations of any Lender or any Notional Euro-Rate
         Funding Office under this Agreement, or

                  (iv) imposes upon any Lender or any Notional Euro-Rate Funding
         Office any other condition or expense directly related to this
         Agreement, the Notes or its making, maintenance or funding of any Loan

and the result of any of the foregoing is determined by any Lender to increase
the cost to, reduce the income receivable by, or impose any expense (including
loss of margin) upon such Lender, any Notional Euro-Rate Funding Office or, in
the case of clause (iii) hereof, any Person controlling a Lender, with respect
to this Agreement, the Notes or the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan
(or, in the case of any capital adequacy or similar requirement, to have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or controlling Person's
capital, taking into consideration such Lender's or controlling Person's
policies with respect to capital adequacy) by an amount which such Lender deems
to be material (such Lender being deemed for this purpose to have made,
maintained or funded each Funding Segment of the CD Rate Portion and the
Euro-Rate Portion from a Corresponding Source of Funds), such Lender may from
time to time promptly notify the Borrower of the amount determined in good faith
(using any averaging and attribution methods) by such Lender (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) to be necessary to
compensate such Lender or such Notional Euro-Rate Funding Office for such
increase, reduction or imposition. Each Lender will notify the Borrower and the
Agent of any event occurring after the date of this Agreement which will entitle
such Lender to compensation pursuant to this Section 2.12 as promptly as
practicable after it obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such
compensation. Each Lender will furnish the Borrower and Agent with a statement
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis, the manner of calculation and the
amount of each request by such Lender for compensation from the Borrower under
this Section 2.12. Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrower to such
Lender 20 days after such notice is given.


                                      -27-

<PAGE>
          (b) Funding Breakage. In addition to the compensation required under
Section 2.12(a) hereof, the Borrower shall indemnify each Lender against any
loss or expense (including loss of margin) which such Lender has incurred as a
consequence of:

                  (i) any payment, prepayment or conversion of any part of any
         Funding Segment of any CD Rate Portion or Euro-Rate Portion of the
         Loans on a day other than the last day of the corresponding Funding
         Period (whether or not such payment, prepayment or conversion is
         mandatory or automatic and whether or not such payment or prepayment is
         then due),

                  (ii) any attempt by the Borrower to revoke (expressly, by
         later inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or in part any notice
         stated herein to be irrevocable (the Agent having in its sole
         discretion the options (A) to give effect to such attempted revocation
         provided that indemnity under this Section 2.12(b) is obtained or (B)
         to treat such attempted revocation as having no force or effect, as if
         never made), or

                  (iii) any default by the Borrower in the performance or
         observance of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or
         the Notes, including without limitation any failure of the Borrower to
         pay when due (by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest,
         commitment fee, facility fee or any other amount due hereunder or under
         any Note.

          If any Lender sustains or incurs any such loss or expense it shall
from time to time notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing setting forth in
reasonable detail the amount determined in good faith by such Lender (which
determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) to be necessary to
indemnify such Lender for such loss or expense. Such amount shall be due and
payable by the Borrower to the Agent for the account of such Lender, 20 days
after such notice is given.

                  (c) Additional Interest. (i) So long as any Lender shall be
         required under regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal
         Reserve System to maintain reserves with respect to liabilities or
         assets consisting of or including loans made with reference to the CD
         Rate, such Lender may require the Borrower to pay, but only in respect
         of any period during which such reserves shall actually be maintained
         by such Lender, additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of
         the CD Rate Portion of the Loans, at an interest rate per annum equal
         at all times during each CD Rate Funding Period to the difference
         obtained by subtracting (A) the CD Rate for such CD Rate Funding Period
         from (B) the rate obtained by dividing such CD Rate referred to in
         clause (A) above by that percentage equal to 100% minus the CD Rate
         Reserve Percentage of such Lender for such CD Rate Funding Period.



                                      -28-

<PAGE>

                  (ii) So long as any Lender shall be required under regulations
         of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to maintain
         reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or
         including Eurocurrency Liabilities, such Lender may require the
         Borrower to pay, but only in respect of any period during which such
         reserves shall actually be maintained by such Lender, additional
         interest on the unpaid principal amount of the Euro-Rate Portion of the
         Loans, at an interest rate per annum equal at all times during each
         Euro-Rate Funding Period to the difference obtained by subtracting (A)
         the Euro-Rate for such Euro-Rate Funding Period from (B) the rate
         obtained by dividing such Euro-Rate referred to in clause (A) above by
         that percentage equal to 100% minus the Euro-Rate Reserve Percentage of
         such Lender for such Euro-Rate Funding Period.

                  (iii) If any Lender shall claim entitlement to any additional
         amount pursuant to this Section 2.12(c), then such Lender shall deliver
         to the Borrower a certificate setting forth the basis for the
         determination thereof as promptly as practicable. More than one such
         certificate may be so delivered. Each such certificate shall be
         conclusive and binding for all purposes as to the amount due absent
         manifest error. The Borrower shall pay to such Lender the amount shown
         as due on any such certificate within 20 days after its receipt of the
         same.

         2.13. HLT Classification. The Agent shall promptly give notice to the
Borrower and each Lender if at any time

         (a) the Agent determines in its reasonable judgment (based upon any Law
or guideline or interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental
Authority charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or
compliance with any request or directive of any Governmental Authority (whether
or not having the force of law), now existing or hereafter adopted), that any
portion of the Loans under this Agreement should be classified as a "highly
leveraged transaction" (or any similar or successor classification then in
effect) (an "HLT Classification"),

         (b) the Agent is informed by any Governmental Authority that any
portion of the Loans under this Agreement are or should be subject to HLT
Classification, or

         (c) any Lender is informed by any Governmental Authority that any
portion of the Loans under this Agreement contemplated hereby are or should be
subject to HLT Classification, and such Lender in its discretion gives notice of
such fact to the Agent.


                                      -29-

<PAGE>

In such event the parties hereto shall commence negotiations in good faith with
a view to agreeing on revised interest rates, fees and other terms and
conditions hereof, consistent with then-current market requirements for
transactions subject to HLT Classification. If the parties hereto fail to agree
on such matters in their respective absolute discretion within 30 days of the
notice given by the Agent referred to above, then the Agent, acting at the
request of the Required Lenders, may give a further notice to the Borrower, and
effective as of the date of such further notice (i) each Applicable Margin set
forth in Section 2.06(b) hereof shall be increased by 2.50%, and (ii) the
percentage applicable to calculation of the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee in
Section 2.02(a) hereof shall be increased by .250%. Except as set forth above,
this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

         2.14 Taxes.

         (a) Payments Net of Taxes. All payments made by the Borrower under this
Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without reduction or withholding
for or on account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings, now or
hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed by any Governmental
Authority, and all liabilities with respect thereto, excluding

                  (i) in the case of the Agent and each Lender, income or
         franchise taxes imposed on the Agent or such Lender by the jurisdiction
         under the laws of which the Agent or such Lender is organized or any
         political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein or as a
         result of a connection between such Lender and any jurisdiction other
         than a connection resulting solely from this Agreement and the
         transactions contemplated hereby, and

                  (ii) in the case of each Lender, income or franchise taxes
         imposed by any jurisdiction in which such Lender's lending offices
         which make or book Loans are located or any political subdivision or
         taxing authority thereof or therein

(all such non-excluded taxes, levies, imposts, deductions, charges or
withholdings being hereinafter called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are required to be
withheld or deducted from any amounts payable to the Agent or any Lender under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Borrower shall pay the relevant
amount of such Taxes and the amounts so payable to the Agent or such Lender
shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Agent or such Lender
(after payment of all Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable
hereunder at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents. Whenever any Taxes are paid by the Borrower with respect
to payments made in connection with this Agreement, as promptly as possible

                                      -30-

<PAGE>

thereafter, the Borrower shall send to the Agent for its own account or for the
account of such Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original
official receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof.

          (b) Indemnity. The Borrower hereby indemnifies the Agent and each of
the Lenders for the full amount of all Taxes attributable to payments by or on
behalf of the Borrower hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents, any
such Taxes paid by the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, any present or
future claims, liabilities or losses with respect to or resulting from any
omission to pay or delay in paying any Taxes (including any incremental Taxes,
interest or penalties that may become payable by the Agent or such Lender as a
result of any failure to pay such Taxes), whether or not such Taxes were
correctly or legally asserted. Such indemnification shall be made within 30 days
from the date such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, makes written demand
therefor.

          (c) Withholding and Backup Withholding. Each Lender that is
incorporated or organized under the laws of any jurisdiction other than the
United States or any State thereof agrees that, on or prior to the Closing Date
(or, with respect to any Lender which becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.14 hereof, the Transfer Effective Date), it will furnish to the
Borrower and the Agent

                  (i) two valid, duly completed copies of United States Internal
         Revenue Service Form 4224 or United States Internal Revenue Form 1001
         or successor applicable form, as the case may be, certifying in each
         case that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents without deduction or withholding
         of any United States federal income taxes, and

                  (ii) a valid, duly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-8
         or W-9 or successor applicable form, as the case may be, to establish
         an exemption from United States backup withholding tax.

Each Lender which so delivers to the Borrower and the Agent a Form 1001 or 4224
and Form W-8 or W-9 applicable forms (the "Forms") agrees to deliver to the
Borrower and the Agent two further copies of the Forms, or other manner of
certification, as the case may be, on or before the date that any such form
expires or becomes obsolete or otherwise is required to be resubmitted as a
condition to obtaining an exemption from withholding tax, or after the
occurrence of any event requiring a change in the most recent form previously
delivered by it, and such extensions or renewals thereof as may reasonably be
requested by the Borrower and the Agent, certifying in the case of a Form 1001
or Form 4224 that such Lender is entitled to receive payments under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document without deduction or

                                      -31-

<PAGE>

withholding of any United States federal income taxes, unless in any such cases
an event (including any changes in Law) has occurred prior to the date on which
any such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
inapplicable or which would prevent such Lender from duly completing and
delivering any such letter or form with respect to it and such Lender advises
the Borrower and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without
any deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax, and in the
case of a Form W-8 or W-9, establishing an exemption from United States backup
withholding tax. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.14 or pursuant to Section 2.12 if the obligation to pay such
additional amounts would not have arisen but for the failure by any Lender to
comply with its obligations hereunder, or if such Lender shall have delivered
the appropriate Forms and such Lender is not entitled to exemption from
deduction or withholding of U.S. federal income tax in respect of payments made
by the Borrower hereunder for any reason other than a change in U.S. law or
regulations or in the official interpretation thereof after the date of delivery
of such Forms.

         2.15. Funding by Branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate.

         (a) Notional Funding. Each Lender shall have the right from time to
time, prospectively or retrospectively, without notice to the Borrower, to deem
any branch, subsidiary or affiliate of such Lender to have made, maintained or
funded any part of the Euro-Rate Portion at any time. Any branch, subsidiary or
affiliate so deemed shall be known as a "Notional Euro-Rate Funding Office."
Such Lender shall deem any part of the Euro-Rate Portion of the Loans or the
funding therefor to have been transferred to a different Notional Euro-Rate
Funding Office if such transfer would avoid or cure an event or condition
described in Section 2.06(e)(ii) hereof or would lessen compensation payable by
the Borrower under Sections 2.12(a) or 2.14(b) hereof, and provided that such
Lender determines in its sole discretion that such transfer would be practicable
and would not have a material adverse effect on such part of the Loans, such
Lender or any Notional Euro-Rate Funding Office (it being assumed for purposes
of such determination that each part of the Euro-Rate Portion is actually made
or maintained by or funded through the corresponding Notional Euro-Rate Funding
Office). Notional Euro-Rate Funding Offices may be selected by such Lender
without regard to such Lender's actual methods of making, maintaining or funding
Loans or any sources of funding actually used by or available to such Lender.

         (b) Actual Funding. Each Lender shall have the right from time to time
to make or maintain any part of the Euro-Rate Portion by arranging for a branch,
subsidiary or affiliate of such Lender to make or maintain such part of the
Euro-Rate Portion.


                                      -32-

<PAGE>
Such Lender shall have the right to (i) hold any applicable Note payable to its
order for the benefit and account of such branch, subsidiary or affiliate or
(ii) request the Borrower to issue one or more promissory notes in the principal
amount of such Euro-Rate Portion, in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A with the blanks appropriately filled, payable to such branch,
subsidiary or affiliate and with appropriate changes reflecting that the holder
thereof is not obligated to make any additional Loans to the Borrower. The
Borrower agrees to comply promptly with any request under subsection (ii) of
this Section 2.15(b). If any Lender causes a branch, subsidiary or affiliate to
make or maintain any part of the Euro-Rate Portion hereunder, all terms and
conditions of this Agreement shall, except where the context clearly requires
otherwise, be applicable to such part of the Euro-Rate Portion and to any note
payable to the order of such branch, subsidiary or affiliate to the same extent
as if such part of the Euro-Rate Portion were made or maintained and such note
were a Revolving Credit Note payable to such Lender's order.

                                   ARTICLE III
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         The Borrower hereby represents and warrants to the Agent and each
Lender as follows:

         3.01. Corporate Status. The Borrower and each Subsidiary thereof (a)
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation; (b) has corporate power and authority
to own its property and to transact the business in which it is engaged or
presently proposes to engage; and (c) is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in all jurisdictions in which the
ownership of its properties or the nature of its activities or both makes such
qualification necessary, except for matters that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.01 hereof states
as of the date hereof the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Borrower and each
Subsidiary.

         3.02. Corporate Power and Authorization. The Borrower has the corporate
power to execute, deliver and perform the Loan Documents to be executed by it,
has the power to borrow hereunder and has taken all necessary corporate action
and obtained all necessary consents and approvals to authorize the borrowings
hereunder on the terms and conditions of this Agreement, has taken all necessary
action, corporate or otherwise, to authorize the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to be executed by it.
No consent or approval of stockholders of the Borrower generally, no consent or
approval of any landlord or mortgagee, and no waiver of any Lien of right or
distraint or other similar right, is or will be required in


                                      -33-

<PAGE>

connection with the execution, delivery or performance by it, or the validity,
enforcement or priority, of the Loan Documents to be executed by it.

         3.03. Execution and Bindinq Effect. This Agreement and each other Loan
Document to which the Borrower is a party has been, or upon its execution and
delivery will be, duly executed and delivered by the Borrower and each
constitutes, or upon its execution and delivery will constitute, the valid and
legally binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other similar laws, now or hereafter
in effect, relating to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights
generally and except that the remedy of specific performance and other equitable
remedies are subject to judicial discretion. There is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower,
threatened against or affecting the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which
questions the validity or the enforceability of any of the Loan Documents.

         3.04. Governmental Approvals and Filings. No approval, order, consent,
authorization, certificate, license, permit or validation of, or exemption or
other action by, or filing, recording or registration with, or notice to, any
Governmental Authority (collectively, "Governmental Action") is or will be
necessary or advisable in connection with execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, consummation by the Borrower of the
transactions herein or therein contemplated, or performance of or compliance
with the terms and conditions hereof or thereof. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary thereof is subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act or the Investment Company Act of 1940
or to any Federal or state statute or regulation limiting the Borrower's ability
to incur Indebtedness for money borrowed. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary thereof is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

         3.05. Absence of Conflicts. The execution and delivery by the Borrower
of this Agreement and each other Loan Document to which it is a party and
performance by it hereunder and thereunder, will not violate any Law (including,
without limitation, Regulations G, U, T and X of the Federal Reserve Board) and
will not conflict with or result in a breach of any order, writ, injunction,
ordinance, resolution, decree, or other similar document or instrument of any
court or governmental authority, bureau or agency, domestic or foreign, or its
certificate of incorporation or by-laws or create (with or without the giving of
notice or lapse of time, or both) a default under or breach of any agreement,
bond, note or indenture to which it is a party (by successor in interest or
otherwise), or by which it is

                                      -34-

<PAGE>

bound or any of its properties or assets is affected, or result in the
imposition of any Lien of any nature whatsoever upon any of the properties or
assets owned by or used in connection with the business of the Borrower or any
of its Subsidiaries.

         3.06. Audited Financial Statements. The Borrower has heretofore
furnished to the Agent and each Lender consolidated balance sheets of the
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1990 and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and changes in
stockholders' equity for the fiscal year then ended, as examined and reported on
by Ernst & Young, independent certified public accountants for the Borrower, who
delivered an unqualified opinion in respect thereof. Such financial statements
(including the notes thereto) present fairly the financial condition of the
Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of the end of each such fiscal
year and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the fiscal
years then ended, all in conformity with GAAP.

         3.07. Absence of Undisclosed Material Liabilities. Except as disclosed
in writing by the Borrower to the Lenders and except as to the possible effect
of the application of FAS 106, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary of the
Borrower has any liability or obligation of any nature whatever (including
without limitation Environmental Matters) which, to the knowledge of any
Responsible Officer, will more likely than not have a Material Adverse Effect.
As of September 30, 1991, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary of the
Borrower has any Indebtedness other than the Indebtedness of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries set forth on Schedule 3.07 hereto.

         3.08. Absence of Material Adverse Change. Except as to the possible
effect of the application of FAS 106, since December 31, 1990, there has been no
change in the business, properties, assets or financial condition of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole which is likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         3.09. Accurate and Complete Disclosure. The Borrower has furnished to
the Lenders copies of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1990, its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June
30, 1991 and its Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 1990. None of
such documents contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state any material fact necessary to make such information (taken as a whole)
not misleading at such time in light of the circumstances in which it was
provided.

         3.10. Margin Regulations. No part of the proceeds of any Loan hereunder
will be used for the purpose of buying or carrying any "margin stock", as such
term is used in Regulations G and U of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, as amended from time to time, except margin stock issued by the

                                      -35-

<PAGE>

Borrower, or to extend credit to others for the purpose of buying or carrying
any "margin stock." Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof is engaged
in the business of extending credit to others for the purpose of buying or
carrying "margin stock." Neither the making of any Loan nor any use of proceeds
of any such Loan will violate or conflict with the provisions of Regulation G,
T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as amended
from time to time.

         3.11. Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.11 hereof states as of the Closing Date
each Subsidiary of the Borrower and the percentage of outstanding shares owned
by the Borrower and by each Subsidiary. The outstanding shares of each
Subsidiary of the Borrower have been duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid and nonassessable. The Borrower and each Subsidiary thereof owns
beneficially and of record and has good title to all of the shares represented
by the ownership percentage shown in such Schedule 3.11, free and clear of any
Lien. There are no options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, conversion rights,
exchange rights, preemptive rights or other rights, agreements or arrangements
(contingent or otherwise) which may in any circumstances now or hereafter
obligate any Subsidiary to issue any shares of its capital stock or any other
securities. As of the Closing Date, no Subsidiary has outstanding any class of
preferred stock or any class of common stock with a prior right to dividends.

          3.12. Partnerships, etc. As of the Closing Date, neither the Borrower
nor any Subsidiary thereof is a partner (general or limited) of any partnership,
is a party to any joint venture or owns (beneficially or of record) any material
equity or similar interest in any Person (including but not limited to any
interest pursuant to which the Borrower or such Subsidiary has or may in any
circumstance have an obligation to make capital contributions to, or be
generally liable for or on account of the liabilities, acts or omissions of such
other Person), except for the partnership interests set forth in Schedule 3.12
hereof.

         3.13. Litigation. Except as disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the
Lenders, there is no pending or (to the Borrower's knowledge) threatened action,
suit, proceeding or investigation by or before any Governmental Authority
against or affecting the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower, which will
more likely than not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         3.14. Absence of Events of Default. No event has occurred and is
continuing and no condition exists which constitutes an Event of Default or
Potential Default.

         3.15. Insurance. The policies, binders or self-insurance programs for
fire, liability, product liability, worker's compensation, vehicular and other
insurance currently



                                      -36-

<PAGE>

held by or on behalf of the Borrower and each Subsidiary thereof insure its
properties and business activities against such losses and risks as are adequate
to protect its properties in accordance with customary industry practice when
entered into or renewed. To the best knowledge of the Borrower, all such
policies, binders and self-insurance programs are in full force and effect.
Neither the Borrower nor, to the best knowledge of the Borrower, any of its
Subsidiaries has received notice from any insurer or agent of such insurer that
substantial capital improvements or other expenditures will have to be made in
order to continue such insurance and, to the best knowledge of the Borrower, no
such improvements or expenditures are required. Neither the Borrower nor, to the
best knowledge of the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries has received notice of
cancellation of any material insurance policy or binder.


         3.16. Title to Properties. Except where the failure to possess good and
marketable title in fee simple or good title, as the case may be, would not have
a Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower and each Subsidiary thereof has good and
marketable title in fee simple to all real property owned or purported to be
owned by it and necessary for the operation of its business and good title to
all other property of whatever nature owned or purported to be owned by it,
including but not limited to all property reflected in the most recent audited
balance sheet referred to in Section 3.06 hereof or submitted pursuant to
Section 5.01(a) hereof, as the case may be (except as sold or otherwise disposed
of in the ordinary course of business after the date of such balance sheet or,
after the Closing Date, as otherwise expressly permitted by the Loan Documents)
in each case free and clear of all Liens, other than Liens permitted by Section
6.02 hereof.

         3.17. Intellectual Property. The Borrower and each Subsidiary thereof
owns, or is licensed or otherwise has the right to use, all the patents,
trademarks, service marks, names (trade, service, fictitious or otherwise),
copyrights, technology (including but not limited to computer programs and
software), processes, data bases and other rights, free from burdensome
restrictions, necessary to own and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as presently conducted and presently planned to be conducted without
conflict with the rights of others.

         3.18. Taxes. Consolidated federal income tax returns for the Borrower
and its domestic Subsidiaries have been examined by the IRS for all years up to
and including the year ended December 31, 1987. The Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries have filed or caused to be filed all federal, state and local tax
returns which, to the knowledge of any Responsible Officer of the Borrower, are
required to be filed and have paid or caused to be paid all taxes as shown on
such returns or on any assessment received by it or by any of them, to the
extent that such taxes have become due, except any such tax or assessment the
validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings


                                      -37-

<PAGE>
and with respect to which the Borrower or a Subsidiary of the Borrower, as
appropriate, has set aside on its books adequate reserves to the extent the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower and a nationally recognized
independent certified public accountant believes such reserves are necessary. To
the extent that the Borrower in good faith believes is necessary, the Borrower
and its Subsidiaries have set up reserves which are believed by the Borrower to
be adequate for the payment of additional taxes. All assessed deficiencies
resulting from examinations by the IRS up to and including the year ended
December 31, 1987 have been discharged, reserved against or will not impair the
Borrower's ability to repay the Loans.

         3.19. Employee Benefits. (a) No borrowing contemplated by this
Agreement is a transaction which is subject to the prohibitions of Section 406
of ERISA or in connection with which a tax could be imposed pursuant to Section
4975 of the Code or a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA
(assuming that monies other than monies representing plan assets are borrowed
hereunder). Neither the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries nor any other Person,
including any fiduciary, has engaged in any prohibited transaction (as defined
in Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) which could subject any of
the Benefit Plans, the Borrower, or any Subsidiary (or any entity which they
have an obligation to indemnify) to any tax or penalty imposed under 4975 of the
Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA or any other material liability under a foreign
law of similar nature which alone or together with any other item described in
this Section 3.19 would have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any
member of their respective Controlled Group) (i) has incurred or expects to
incur any liability under Title IV of ERISA or Section 502(g) of ERISA or any
analogous provision relating to Section 515 of ERISA or (ii) has become subject
or expects to be subject to the lien described in Section 412(n) of the Code,
which alone or together with any other item described in this Section 3.19 would
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) The Pension Plans do not have an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 of ERISA. No Pension Plan has benefit liabilities as defined in Section
4001(a)(16) of ERISA which exceed the assets of such Pension Plan by such an
amount that the termination of such Pension Plan alone or together with any
other item described in this Section would have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Borrower has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS with respect
to all Pension Plans except for such Pension Plans with respect to which the
failure to receive such a favorable determination would not alone or together
with any other item described in this Section 3.19 have a Material Adverse
Effect and nothing has happened since the date of such letter that has adversely
affected such

                                      -38-

<PAGE>

qualification. There is no Lien outstanding or security interest given in
connection with a Pension Plan or under Title IV of ERISA which would exceed the
percentage limitations of Section 6.02(g) hereof. As of the date hereof, the
Borrower has filed all required notices with respect to any terminated Benefit
Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA, no objections relating to any such
termination by the IRS or the PBGC are pending and the time period for making
such objections has lapsed.

          (d) Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries (including any
member of their respective Controlled Group) is in default in any material
respect under any Benefit Plan and all Benefit Plans are administered in
accordance with their terms and are in all material respects in compliance with
all applicable Laws, except where any such default or failure to comply would
not alone or together with any other item described in this Section 3.19 have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         3.20 Environmental Matters

         (a) The Borrower and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, to its knowledge,
has been operated in compliance with all applicable Requirements of Law, except
for matters which, individually or in the aggregate, are not likely to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) The Borrower and each Subsidiary of the Borrower, to its knowledge,
has not received notice from any governmental authority that any of them is a
potentially responsible party under any Requirements of Law at any disposal site
containing Hazardous Materials, nor received any notice that any lien under any
Requirements of Law against any property of the Borrower or Subsidiary of the
Borrower exists, except for matters which, individually or in the aggregate, are
not likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (f) Additional Matters. All corporate and other proceedings,

<PAGE>

                  (b) Representations and Warranties. Each of the
         representations and warranties made by the Borrower herein shall be
         true and correct in all material respects on and as of such date as if
         made on and as of such date (except with respect to representations and
         warranties which specifically refer to an earlier date, which shall be

                  (d) No Violations of Law, etc. Neither the making nor use of

                                    ARTICLE V
                             AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS

         The Borrower hereby covenants to the Agent and each Lender as follows:

         5.01. Basic Reporting Requirements.

         (a) Annual Audit Reports. The Borrower shall deliver to the Agent, with
a copy for each Lender, as soon as available, but in any event within 90 days

the Borrower as at such last day of the fiscal year, and the related
consolidated statement of income, consolidated statement of changes in common
shareholders equity and consolidated statement of cash flows for such fiscal
year, each prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as required by any change in
accounting principles or concurred in by the Borrower's independent certified
public accountants), in reasonable detail, and, as to the financial statements,

principles with which such accountants concur and other than any other
qualification which the Agent and the Required Lenders deem, in their reasonable
judgment, to be immaterial) by Ernst & Young or another firm of independent
certified public

successor thereto), and (ii) all reports, proxy statements, financial statements

          (f) Further Information. The Borrower will promptly furnish to the
Agent, with a copy for each Lender, such other information and in such form as
the Agent or any Lender may reasonably request from time to time.

          (g) Notice of Certain Events. Promptly upon becoming aware of any of

         any notices from the PBGC to the Borrower with respect to the intent of
         the PBGC to institute involuntary proceedings.

                  (iii) Any Environmental Claim pending or threatened against
         the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower, which Environmental
         Claim, if adversely resolved, individually or in the aggregate, could
         have a Material Adverse Effect; provided, however, that no such notice
         is required to be given with respect to any Environmental Claim if the
         Borrower reasonably determines that its liability, if any, with respect
         to such Environmental Claim will not exceed $1,000,000.

         (h) Visitation; Verification. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, permit the Lenders to make or cause to be made,

affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries with the

accountants, all at all such reasonable times and as often as any Lender may
reasonably require, in order to assure that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
are and will be in compliance with their respective obligations under the Loan
Documents or to evaluate the Lenders' investment in the then outstanding Notes.


                                      -43-

<PAGE>

          The Agent shall promptly deliver to each Lender copies of all notices,
financial statements and other information received pursuant to this Section
5.01.

          5.02. Insurance. The Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, maintain, at its expense, and keep in effect with responsible
insurance companies, such liability insurance for bodily injury and third party
property damage as is customary in the case of corporations engaged in the same
or similar business or having similar properties, similarly situated. The
Borrower shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep and maintain,
at its expense, its real and personal property insured against loss or damage by
fire, theft, explosion, spoilage, and all other risks ordinarily insured against
by other owners or users of such properties in similar businesses in an amount
equal to the full replacement or cash value thereof, subject to deductible
amounts which the Borrower, in its reasonable judgment, deems prudent.

         5.03. Payment of Taxes and Other Potential Charges and Priority Claims.
Except for situations where the failure to pay or discharge would not have a
Material Adverse Effect, the Borrower shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to,
pay or discharge

                  (a) on or prior to the date on which penalties are imposed by
         a taxing authority with respect thereto, all taxes, assessments and
         other governmental charges imposed upon it or any of its properties;

                  (b) on or prior to the date when due, all lawful claims of
         materialmen, mechanics, carriers, warehousemen, landlords and other
         like Persons which, if unpaid, might result in the creation of a Lien
         upon any such property; and

                  (c) on or prior to the date when due, all other lawful claims
         which, if unpaid, might result in the creation of a Lien upon any such
         property or which, if unpaid, might give rise to a claim entitled to
         priority over general creditors of the Borrower or such Subsidiary in a
         case under Title 11 (Bankruptcy) of the United States Code, as amended;

provided, that unless and until foreclosure, distraint, levy, sale or similar
proceedings shall have been commenced the Borrower or such Subsidiary need not
pay or discharge any such tax, assessment, charge or claim so long as (x) the
validity thereof is contested in good faith and by appropriate proceedings
diligently conducted, (y) such reserves or other appropriate provisions as are
required by GAAP shall have been made therefor, and (z) such failure will not
have a Material Adverse Effect.

         5.04. Preservation of Corporate Status. The Borrower shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, do, or cause

                                      -44-

to be done, all things necessary to preserve, renew and keep in full force and
effect its corporate existence, permits and franchises, and use its best efforts
to comply with all Laws (including without limitation environmental Laws)
applicable to it except where such noncompliance could not have Material Adverse
Effect; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.04 shall prevent the
abandonment or termination of the Borrower's authorization to do business in any
foreign jurisdiction or of the corporate existence, rights and franchises of any
Subsidiary of the Borrower if such abandonment or termination is in the interest
of the Borrower and not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Lenders.

          5.05. Governmental Approvals and Filings. The Borrower shall, and
shall cause each Subsidiary to, keep and maintain in full force and effect all
Governmental Actions necessary, if any, in connection with execution and
delivery of any Loan Document, consummation of the transactions hereon or
therein contemplated, performance of or compliance with the terms and conditions
hereof or thereof or to ensure the legality, validity, binding effect,
enforceability or admissibility in evidence hereof or thereof.

          5.06. Maintenance of Properties. The Borrower shall, and shall cause
each Subsidiary to, maintain or cause to be maintained in good repair, working
order and condition the properties now or hereafter owned, leased or otherwise
possessed by it which are necessary for the effective conduct of its business
and shall make or cause to be made all needful and proper repairs, renewals,
replacements and improvements thereto so that they are able to serve the
functions for which they are currently being used.

         5.07. Avoidance of Other Conflicts. The Borrower shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, violate or conflict with, be in violation
of or conflict with, or be or remain subject to any liability (contingent or
otherwise) on account of any violation or conflict with its articles of
incorporation or by-laws (or other constituent documents) except for matters
which, individually or in the aggregate could not have a Material Adverse
Effect.

         5.08. Financial Accounting Practices. The Borrower shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of record and account in
accordance with normal business practice.

         5.09. Use of Proceeds. The Borrower shall apply the proceeds of Loans

                                      -45-

<PAGE>

         5.10. Continuation of or Change in Business. Neither the Borrower nor
any Subsidiary shall engage in any line of business if as a result thereof the
business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole would be
substantially different from what it was at December 31, 1990 as described in
the Borrower's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
1990.

         5.11. Consolidated Tax Return. The Borrower shall not, and shall not
suffer any of its Subsidiaries to, file or consent to the filing of any
consolidated income tax return with any Person other than the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries.

Subsidiaries incorporated in the United States to

                  (a) comply with all applicable provisions of ERISA now and
         hereafter in effect, non-compliance with which would have a Material
         Adverse Effect; and

                  (b) as soon as possible and, in any event, within 10 days
         after the Borrower knows or has reason to know that a Reportable Event
         has occurred with respect to a Pension Plan, that a transaction
         prohibited under ERISA or the Code has occurred resulting in a material
         liability to a Benefit Plan, the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
         (or any entity which they have an obligation to indemnify), that an
         accumulated funding deficiency has been incurred or an application is
         to be or has been made to the Secretary of the Treasury for a waiver of
         the minimum funding standard with respect to an accumulation funding
         deficiency of $100,000 or more, that a failure to make timely
         contributions to a Pension Plan may give or has given rise to a lien in
         a material amount, that an amendment to a Pension Plan may require or
         requires the granting of a security interest in a material amount, that
         proceedings are likely to be or have been instituted to terminate a
         Pension Plan, or that the Borrower, any of its Significant Subsidiaries
         or a member of their respective Controlled Group will or may incur any
         material liability under Section 502(g) or any analogous provision
         relating to Section 515 or Title IV of ERISA, the Borrower will deliver
         to the Lenders a certificate of a financial officer setting forth
         details as to such occurrence and action, if any, which the Borrower,
         such Subsidiary or the respective member of their Controlled Group is
         required or proposes to take, together with any notices required or
         proposed to be filed with or by the Borrower, such Subsidiary or the
         member of their respective Controlled Group, the PBGC or the plan
         administrator with respect thereto. For purposes of this Section, an
         item is material if alone or taken with any other item in this Section,
         it results in a liability of $1,000,000 or more. Copies of any notices
         required to be delivered to the Lenders hereunder shall be delivered
         not later than 10

                                      -46-

<PAGE>

         days after the later of the date such notice has been filed with the
         IRS or the PBGC or received by the Borrower, any of its Subsidiaries or
         members of their respective Controlled Group. Upon the request of the
         Agent or any of the Lenders made from time to time, the Borrower will
         deliver a copy of the most recent actuarial report and annual report

or hereafter acquired, or assign, or permit any of its Subsidiaries to assign,
any right to receive income, except:

         (a)      liens incurred or pledges and deposits made in connection with

(e)      zoning restrictions, easements, licenses, reservations, restrictions on
         the use of real property or minor irregularities incident thereto which
         do not in the aggregate materially detract from the value of the
         property or assets of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may
         be, or impair the use of such property in the operation of its
         business;

(f)      purchase money liens on real property or equipment (which are filed
         against the real property or equipment within 180 days of purchase)

         properties and assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries at the end
         of the preceding fiscal year.

                  6.03. Indebtedness. The Borrower shall not, and shall not

provided, however, that (i) the total Indebtedness of the Borrower's
Subsidiaries shall not at any time exceed $50,000,000, and (ii) the total
Indebtedness of the Borrower's domestic Subsidiaries shall not at any time
exceed $10,000,000 (excluding from the calculation thereof any pre-existing
Indebtedness of a newly-acquired domestic Subsidiary for a period not exceeding
30 days after the acquisition of such domestic Subsidiary if, on each day from

pre-existing Indebtedness, the Borrower or such domestic Subsidiary has in place
a committed credit facility acceptable to the Agent which is sufficient to
permit the Borrower or such domestic Subsidiary to borrow sufficient funds to
repay such Indebtedness and comply with the limitations on Indebtedness set
forth in this Section 6.03).

          6.04. Limitation on Restrictions on Dividends by Subsidiaries, etc.

Subsidiary Investment from time to time to (w) declare and pay Stock Payments
with respect to capital stock owned by the Borrower or any Subsidiary, (x) pay
any obligations from time to time owed to the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or (y)
make loans or advances to the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or (z) transfer any of
its properties or assets to the Borrower or any Subsidiary; provided, however,
that such restrictions may be permitted with respect to any Subsidiary or
Subsidiary Investment in which the Borrower or a Subsidiary directly or
indirectly owns less than 80% of the Voting Stock and in which the Borrower's or
such Subsidiary's cumulative investment since the Closing Date (in terms of cash
invested in and/or assets contributed to the entity) (i) individually is less
than 10% of the book value of the assets of the Borrower and its consolidated
subsidiaries, and (ii) when taken together with all such Subsidiaries and
Subsidiary Investments subject to any such restrictions in which the Borrower or
a Subsidiary directly or indirectly owns less than 80% of the Voting Stock, is
less than 15% of the book value of the assets of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries.

         6.05. Mergers; Acquisitions. The Borrower shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, consolidate with or
merge into any Person or permit any Person to merge into it; provided, however,
that (a) any Subsidiary of the Borrower may be merged into the Borrower or any
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Borrower, (b) the Borrower or any Subsidiary of
the Borrower may merge or consolidate with another Person or business, if the
Borrower or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is the surviving corporation,
(c) the Borrower or any

                                      -49-

<PAGE>

Subsidiary of the Borrower may consolidate with another Person in a transaction
where the Borrower or Subsidiary is not the surviving corporation if (i) the
continuing or surviving entity shall assume in writing all of the Obligations of
the Borrower under this Agreement and the Notes, (ii) the continuing or
surviving entity shall not, immediately after such merger or consolidation, be
in default of any of the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement or the
Notes, (iii) the continuing or surviving entity shall be a corporation organized
under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, (iv) after
giving effect to such consolidation or merger no Potential Default or Event of
Default would then exist and (v) such consolidation or merger shall not have a
Material Adverse Effect.

         6.06. ERISA Obligations. Except for matters which are not likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary shall at
any time

                  (a) engage in any "prohibited transaction" as such term is
         defined in Section 4975 of the Code or described in Section 406 of
         ERISA;

                  (b) fail timely to make any required installment to a Pension

         not waived or extended;

                  (d) permit the occurrence of any "reportable event" with
         respect to a Pension Plan as such term is defined in Section 4043 of
         ERISA;

                  (e) become obligated to contribute to any "multiemployer plan"
         as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA;

                  (f) amend any Pension Plan such that security would have to be
         provided to such Pension Plan under Section 401(a)(29) of the Code; or

                  (g) permit any Pension Plan to be terminated other than in a
         "standard termination" as defined in Section 4041(b) of ERISA.

         6.07. Leases. The Borrower shall not, and shall not permit any
Subsidiary to, at any time enter into or suffer to remain in effect any lease,
as lessee, of any property, or agree, become or remain liable (contingently or
otherwise) to any of the foregoing, except leases which on any date in the
aggregate will

                                      -50-

<PAGE>

not result in the payment or accrual by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries of a
total of more than 15% of the book value (computed in accordance with GAAP) of
all properties and assets of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries in
the twelve month period after such date.

of business, sell, convey, assign, lease, transfer, abandon or otherwise dispose
of, voluntarily or involuntarily, any of its properties, now owned or hereafter
acquired, or agree, become or remain liable (contingently or otherwise) to do
any of the foregoing, if, as a result of such sale, conveyance, assignment,
lease, transfer, abandonment or other disposition, the aggregate net book value
or fair market value, whichever shall be higher, of all property and assets
sold, conveyed, assigned, leased, transferred, abandoned or otherwise disposed
of by the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in the then current fiscal year of the
Borrower would exceed an amount equal to 10% of the book value (computed in
accordance with GAAP) of all properties and assets of the Borrower and its
consolidated Subsidiaries at the end of the preceding fiscal year.

          6.09. Transactions with Affiliates. Neither the Borrower nor any
Subsidiary shall enter into any transaction (except transactions which do not in
any one calendar year involve in the aggregate an amount in excess of $500,000),
including without limitation the purchase, sale or exchange of property or the
rendering of any service, with any Affiliate (excluding any wholly-owned
Subsidiary) except in the ordinary course of and pursuant to the reasonable
requirements of the Borrower's or such Subsidiary's business and upon fair and
reasonable terms no less favorable to the Borrower or such Subsidiary than would
obtain in a comparable arm's-length transaction with a Person not an Affiliate.

         6.10. Loans, Advances and Investments. The Borrower shall not, and
shall not permit any Subsidiary to, at any time make or permit to exist any

(i) marketable direct obligations of, or marketable obligations guaranteed by,
the United States of America or Canada, or marketable obligations of any
instrumentality or agency thereof, the payment of the principal and interest of
which is unconditionally guaranteed by the United States of America or

Borrower's Consolidated Net Worth within any four year period commencing on the
Closing Date, or (f) such other investments in an aggregate amount not to exceed
$250,000 as the Borrower or a Subsidiary may elect.

         principal or face amount, individually or in the aggregate outstanding
         at any time, in excess of $5,000,000, so that, as a result of any such
         failure to perform, the Indebtedness included therein or secured or
         covered thereby may at the time be declared due and payable prior to
         the date on which such Indebtedness would otherwise become due and
         payable;

                  (g) One or more final judgment or judgments which are not

                  (j) A proceeding shall have been instituted in respect of the

                  (i) Declare the Commitments terminated, whereupon the
         Commitments will terminate and any fees hereunder shall be immediately
         due and payable without presentment, demand, protest or further notice

         shall immediately accrue.

          (b) If an Event of Default specified in subsection (j) or (k) of

                  Finally, the balance, if any, after all of the Obligations
         have been satisfied and all Commitments shall have terminated, to the
         Borrower or as otherwise required by law.

contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Loan Document:

                  (a) The Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities
         except those expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan
         Documents, and no implied duties or responsibilities on the part of the
         Agent shall be read into this Agreement or any Loan Document or shall
         otherwise exist.

                  (b) The duties and responsibilities of the Agent under this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be mechanical and
         administrative in nature, and the Agent shall not have a fiduciary
         relationship in respect of any Lender.

                  (c) The Agent is and shall be solely the agent of the Lenders.
         The Agent assumes no, and shall not at any time be deemed to have, any
         relationship of agency or trust with or any other duty or
         responsibility to, the Borrower, and Subsidiary of the Borrower or any
         other Person (except only for (i) its relationship as agent for, and
         its express duties



                                      -56-

<PAGE>

         and responsibilities to, the Lenders and (ii) its express duties and
         responsibilities to, the Borrower, all as provided in this Agreement
         and the other Loan Documents).

                  (d) The Agent shall not be under any obligation to take any
         action hereunder or under any other Loan Document if the Agent believes
         in good faith after consultation with counsel that taking such action
         may conflict with any Law or any provision of this Agreement or any
         other Loan Document, or may require the Agent to qualify to do business
         in any jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified.

          8.03. Exercise of Powers. The Agent shall take any action of the type
specified in this Agreement or any other Loan Document as being within the
Agent's rights, powers or discretion in accordance with directions from the
Required Lenders (or, to the extent this Agreement or such Loan Document
expressly requires the direction or consent of some other Person or set of
Persons, then instead in accordance with the directions of such other Person or
set of Persons). In the absence of such directions, the Agent shall have the
authority (but under no circumstances shall be obligated), in its sole
discretion, to take any such action, except to the extent this Agreement or such
Loan Document expressly requires the direction or consent of the Required
Lenders (or some other Person or set of Persons), in which case the Agent shall
not take such action absent such direction or consent. Any action or inaction
pursuant to such direction, discretion or consent shall be binding on all the
Lenders. The Agent shall not have any liability to any Person as a result of (x)
the Agent acting or refraining from acting in accordance with the directions of
the Required Lenders (or other applicable Person or set of Persons), (y) unless
expressly required to act under the terms hereof, the Agent refraining from
acting in the absence of instructions to act from the Required Lenders (or other
applicable Person or set of Persons), whether or not the Agent has discretionary
power to take such action, or (z) the Agent taking discretionary action it is
authorized to take under this Section absent gross negligence or willful
misconduct.

          8.04. General Exculpatory Provisions. Notwithstanding anything to 
the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement or any other Loan Document:

                  (a) The Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or
         omitted to be taken by it under or in connection with this Agreement or
         anY other Loan Document, unless caused by its own gross negligence or
         willful misconduct.

                  (b) Except for the records to be maintained by the Agent
         pursuant to Section 9.02, the Agent shall not be responsible for (i)
         the execution, delivery, effectiveness, enforceability, genuineness,
         validity or adequacy of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii)
         any recital,


                                      -57-

<PAGE>
         representation, warranty, document, certificate, report or statement
         in, provided for in, or received under or in connection with, this
         Agreement or any other Loan Document or (iii) any failure of the
         Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or Lender to perform any of
         their respective obligations under this Agreement or any other Loan
         Document.

                  (c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the Agent
         shall not be under any obligation to ascertain, inquire or give any
         notice relating to (i) the performance or observance of any of the
         terms or conditions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document on the
         part of the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower, (ii) the
         business, operations, condition (financial or otherwise) or prospects
         of the Borrower or any other Person, or (iii) except to the extent set
         forth in Section 8.05(f) hereof, the existence of any Event of 
         Default or Potential Default.

                  (d) The Agent shall not be under any obligation, either
         initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any
         notices, reports or information of any nature, whether in its
         possession presently or hereafter, except for such notices, reports and
         other information expressly required by this Agreement or any other
         Loan Document to be furnished by the Agent to such Lender.

                  8.05. Administration by the Agent.

          (a) The Agent may rely in good faith upon any notice or other
communication of any nature (written or oral, including but not limited to
telephone conversations, whether or not such notice or other communication is
made in a manner permitted or required by this Agreement or any Loan Document)
purportedly made by or on behalf of the proper party or parties, and Agent shall
not have any duty to verify the identity or authority of any Person giving such
notice or other communication.

          (b) The Agent may consult with legal counsel (including, without
limitation, in-house counsel for the Agent or in-house or other counsel for the
Borrower), independent public accountants and any other experts selected by it
from time to time, and the Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted to be taken in good faith by it in accordance with the advice of such
counsel, accountants or experts.

         (c) The Agent may conclusively rely upon the truth of the statements
and the correctness of the opinions expressed in any certificates or opinions
furnished to the Agent in accordance with the requirements of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document. Whenever the Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable
that a matter be proved or established with respect to the Borrower or any
Lender, such matter may be established by a


                                      -58-

<PAGE>

certificate of the Borrower or Lender, as the case may be, and the Agent may
conclusively rely upon such certificate (unless other evidence with respect to
such matter is specifically prescribed in this Agreement or another Loan
Document).

          (d) The Agent may fail or refuse to take any action unless it shall be
indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction from time to time against any and all
amounts, liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature which
may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Agent by reason of taking
or continuing to take any such action.

          (e) The Agent may perform any of its duties under this Agreement or
any other Loan Document by or through agents or attorneys-in-fact. The Agent
shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it with reasonable care.

          (f) The Agent shall not be deemed to have any knowledge or notice of
the occurrence of any Event of Default or Potential Default unless the Agent has
actual knowledge or has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring
to this Agreement, describing such Event of Default or Potential Default, and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default." If the Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to each Lender.

         8.06. Lender Not Relying on Agent or Other Lenders. Each Lender
acknowledges as follows: (a) Neither the Agent nor any other Lender has made any
representations or warranties to it, and no act taken hereafter by the Agent or
any other Lender shall be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by
the Agent or such other Lender to it. (b) It has, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and based upon such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit and legal analysis
and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. (c) It
will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, and
based upon such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
time, make its own decisions to take or not take action under or in connection
with this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         8.07. Indemnification. Each Lender agrees to reimburse and indemnify
the Agent and its directors, officers, employees and agents (to the extent not
reimbursed by the Borrower and without limitation of the obligations of the
Borrower to do so), Pro Rata, from and against any and all amounts, losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs or disbursements of any kind or nature (including,
without limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Agent or such other Person in connection with any

                                      -59-

<PAGE>

investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding commenced or threatened,
whether or not the Agent or such other Person shall be designated a party
thereto) that may at any time be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the
Agent or such other Person as a result of, or arising out of, or in any way
related to or by reason of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, any
transaction from time to time contemplated hereby or thereby, or any transaction
financed in whole or in part or directly or indirectly with the proceeds of any
Loan, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any portion of such amounts,
losses, liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs or disbursements resulting from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Agent or such other Person, as finally determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction.

          8.08. Agent in its Individual Capacity. With respect to its
Commitments and the Obligations owing to it, the Agent shall have the same
rights and powers under this Agreement and each other Loan Document as any other
Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the terms
"Lenders," "holders of Notes" and like terms shall include the Agent in its
individual capacity as such. The Agent and its affiliates may, without liability
to account, make loans to, accept deposits from, acquire debt or equity
interests in, act as trustee under indentures of, and engage in any other
business with, the Borrower and any stockholder, Subsidiary or Affiliate of the
Borrower, as though the Agent were not the Agent hereunder.

         8.09. Holders of Notes. The Agent may deem and treat the Lender which
is payee of a Note as the owner and holder of such Note for all purposes hereof
unless and until a Transfer Supplement with respect to the assignment or
transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Agent in accordance with Section
9.14 hereof. Any authority, direction or consent of any Person who at the time
of giving such authority, direction or consent is shown in the Register as being
a Lender shall be conclusive and binding on each present and subsequent holder,
transferee or assignee of any Note or Notes payable to such Lender or of any
Note or Notes issued in exchange therefor.


          8.10. Successor Agents. The Agent may resign at any time by giving 30
days' written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower. The Agent may be
removed by the Required Lenders upon 30 days' written notice thereof to the
Agent, the Lenders and the Borrower. Upon receipt of notice of any such
resignation or removal, the Borrower shall have the right to appoint a successor
Agent; provided, that the Required Lenders shall have the right to disapprove
such successor Agent. If no successor Agent shall have been so appointed and
consented to, and shall have accepted such appointment, within 20 days after
such notice of resignation or removal, then the Required Lenders shall appoint a
successor Agent to succeed to the obligations of the Agent hereunder. Each


                                      -60-

<PAGE>

successor Agent shall be a commercial bank or trust company organized under the
laws of the United States of America or any State thereof. Upon the acceptance
by a successor Agent of its appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the properties, rights,
powers, privileges and duties of the former Agent, without further act, deed or
conveyance. Upon the effective date of resignation or removal of a retiring
Agent, such Agent shall be discharged from its duties under this Agreement and
the other Loan Documents, but the provisions of this Agreement shall inure to
its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted by it while it was Agent under
this Agreement. If and so long as no successor Agent shall have been appointed,
then any notice or other communication required or permitted to be given by the
Agent shall be sufficiently given if given by the Required Lenders, all notices
or other communications required or permitted to be given to the Agent shall be
given to each Lender, and all payments to be made to the Agent shall be made
directly to the Borrower or Lender for whose account such payment is made.

          8.11. Calculations. The Agent shall not be liable for any calculation,
apportionment or distribution of payments made by it in good faith except for
gross negligence. If such calculation, apportionment or distribution is
subsequently determined to have been made in error, the sole recourse of any
Lender to whom payment was due but not made shall be to recover from the other
Lenders any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to be
entitled or, if the amount due was not paid by the Borrower, to recover such
amount from the Borrower.

         8.12. Funding by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have been notified in
writing by any Lender not later than the close of business on the day before the
day on which Loans are requested by the Borrower to be made that such Lender
will not make its ratable share of such Loans, the Agent may assume that such
Lender will make its ratable share of the Loans, and in reliance upon such
assumption the Agent may (but in no circumstances shall be required to) make
available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that any
Lender fails to make such payment to the Agent on such date, such Lender shall
pay such amount on demand (or, if such Lender fails to pay such amount on
demand, the Borrower shall pay such amount on demand), together with interest,
for the Agent's own account, for each day from and including the date of the
Agent's payment to and including the date of repayment to the Agent (before and
after judgment) at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for the first day and
thereafter at the rate or rates per annum applicable to such Loans. All payments
to the Agent under this Section shall be made to the Agent at its Office in
Dollars in funds immediately available at such Office, without set-off,
withholding, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature.

                                   ARTICLE IX
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

         9.01. Holidays. Whenever any payment or action to be made or taken
hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be stated to be due on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment or action shall be made or taken on
the next following Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in
computing interest or fees, if any, in connection with such payment or action.

         9.02. Records. The unpaid principal amount of the Loans owing to each
Lender, the unpaid interest accrued thereon, the interest rate or rates
applicable to such unpaid principal amount, the duration of such applicability,
each Lender's Committed Amount and the accrued and unpaid Commitment Fees shall
at all times be ascertained from the records of the Agent, which shall be
conclusive absent manifest error.

         9.03. Amendments and Waivers. Neither this Agreement nor any Loan
Document may be amended, modified or supplemented except in accordance with the
provisions of this Section. The Required Lenders and the Borrower may from time
to time amend, modify or supplement the provisions of this Agreement or any
other Loan Document for the purpose of amending, adding to, or waiving any
provisions or changing in any manner the rights and duties of the Borrower, the
Agent or any Lender. Any such amendment, modification or supplement made by the
Borrower, the Agent and the Required Lenders in accordance with the provisions
of this Section shall be in writing and shall be binding upon the Borrower, each
Lender and the Agent; provided, that no such amendment, modification or
supplement may be made which will:

                  (a) Increase the Committed Amount of any Lender over the
         amount thereof then in effect, subject any Lender to additional
         obligations hereunder or extend the Revolving Credit Maturity Date
         without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby;

                  (b) Reduce the principal amount of or extend the time for any
         payment of any Loan, or reduce the amount of or rate of interest or
         extend the time for payment of interest borne by any Loan or extend the
         time for payment of or reduce the amount of any Commitment Fee or
         reduce or postpone the date for payment of any other fees, expenses,
         indemnities or amounts payable under any Loan Document, without the
         written consent of each Lender affected thereby;

                  (c) Change the definition of "Required Lenders" or amend this
         Section 9.03, without the written consent of all the Lenders;



                                      -62-

<PAGE>

                  (d) Amend or waive any of the provisions of Article IX hereof,
         or impose additional duties upon the Agent or otherwise adversely
         affect the rights, interests or obligations of the Agent, without the
         written consent of the Agent; or

                  (e) Amend Section 2.13 hereof, without the written consent of
         all Lenders.

provided further, that Transfer Supplements may be entered into in the manner
provided in Section 9.14 hereof. Any such amendment, modification or supplement
must be in writing and shall be effective only to the extent set forth in such
writing. Any Event of Default or Potential Default waived or consented to in any
such amendment, modification or supplement shall be deemed to be cured and not
continuing to the extent and for the period set forth in such waiver or consent,
but no such waiver or consent shall extend to any other or subsequent Event of
Default or Potential Default or impair any right consequent thereto.

         9.04. No Implied Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No course of dealing and
no delay or failure of the Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or
privilege under this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall affect any other
or future exercise thereof or exercise of any other right, power or privilege;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege
or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right, power or
privilege preclude any further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or
privilege. The rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders under this
Agreement and any other Loan Document are cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies which the Agent or any Lender would otherwise have hereunder
or thereunder, at law, in equity or otherwise.

         9.05. Notices.

          (a) Except to the extent otherwise expressly permitted hereunder or
thereunder, all notices, requests, demands, directions and other communications
(collectively "notices") under this Agreement or any Loan Document shall be in
writing (including telexes and communication using facsimile machines) and shall
be sent by first-class mail, or by nationally-recognized overnight courier, or
by telex or facsimile (with confirmation in writing mailed first-class or sent
by such an overnight courier), or by personal delivery. All notices shall be
sent to the applicable party at the address stated on the signature pages hereof
or in accordance with the last unrevoked written direction from such party to
the other parties hereto, in all cases with postage or other charges prepaid.
Any such properly given notice shall be effective on the earliest to occur of
receipt, telephone

<PAGE>

confirmation of receipt of telex or facsimile communication, one Business Day
after delivery to a nationally-recognized overnight courier, or five Business
Days after deposit in the mail.

          (b) Any Lender giving any notice to the Borrower shall simultaneously
send a copy thereof to the Agent, and the Agent shall promptly notify the other
Lenders of the receipt by it of any such notice.

          (c) The Agent and each Lender may rely on any notice (whether or not
such notice is made in a manner permitted or required by this Agreement or any
Loan Document) purportedly made by or on behalf of the Borrower, and neither the
Agent nor any Lender shall have any duty to verify the identity or authority of
any Person giving such notice.

         9.06. Expenses; Taxes; Indemnity.

         (a) The Borrower agrees to pay or cause to be paid and to save the
Agent and each of the Lenders harmless against liability for the payment of all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including but not limited to
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Agent, local counsel, auditors,
consulting engineers, appraisers, and all other professional, accounting,
evaluation and consulting costs) incurred by the Agent or, in the case of clause
(iii) below any Lender, from time to time arising from or relating to (i) the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery, administration and performance of
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, (ii) any requested amendments,
modifications, supplements, waivers or consents (whether or not ultimately
entered into or granted) to this Agreement or any Loan Document, and (iii) the
enforcement or preservation of rights under this Agreement or any Loan Document
(including but not limited to any such costs or expenses arising from or
relating to (A) collection or enforcement of an outstanding Obligation or any
other amount owing hereunder or thereunder by the Agent or any Lender, and (B)
any litigation, proceeding, dispute, work-out, restructuring or rescheduling
related in any way to this Agreement or the Loan Documents).

         (b) The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all stamp, document, transfer,
recording, filing, registration, search, sales and excise fees and taxes and all
similar impositions now or hereafter determined by the Agent or any Lender to be
payable in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Documents or any
other documents, instruments or transactions pursuant to or in connection
herewith or therewith, and the Borrower agrees to save the Agent and each Lender
harmless from and against any and all present or future claims, liabilities or
losses with respect to or resulting from any omission to pay or delay in paying
any such fees, taxes or impositions.

                                      -64-

<PAGE>

         (c) The Borrower hereby agrees to reimburse and indemnify each of the
Indemnified Parties from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation,
the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel for such Indemnified Party in
connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding
commenced or threatened, whether or not such Indemnified Party shall be
designated a party thereto) that may at any time be imposed on, asserted against
or incurred by such Indemnified Party as a result of, or arising out of, or in
any way related to or by reason of, any transaction financed in whole or in part
or directly or indirectly with the proceeds of any Loan (and without in any way
limiting the generality of the foregoing, including any violation or breach of
any Requirement of Law or any other Law by the Borrower or any Subsidiary); or
any exercise by the Agent or any Lender of any of its rights or remedies under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document; but excluding any such losses,
liabilities, claims, damages, expenses, obligations, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs or disbursements resulting solely from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Party. If and to the extent
that the foregoing obligations of the Borrower under this subsection (c), or any
other indemnification obligation of the Borrower hereunder or under any other
Loan Document, are unenforceable for any reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to
make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such
obligations which is permissible under applicable Law.

         9.07. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement are intended to be
severable. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held invalid or
unenforceable in whole or in part in any jurisdiction such provision shall, as
to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without in any manner affecting the validity or enforceability
thereof in any other jurisdiction or the remaining provisions hereof in any
jurisdiction.

         9.08. Prior Understandings. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings and agreements, whether
written or oral, among the parties hereto relating to the transactions provided
for herein and therein.

         9.09. Duration; Survival. All representations and warranties of the
Borrower contained herein or in any other Loan Document or made in connection
herewith shall survive the making of, and shall not be waived by the execution
and delivery, of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, any investigation by
or knowledge of the Agent or any Lender, the making of any Loan, or any other
event or condition whatever. All covenants and agreements of the Borrower
contained herein or in any other Loan Document shall continue in full force and
effect from and after

                                      -65-

<PAGE>

the date hereof so long as any Borrower may borrow hereunder and until payment
in full of all Obligations. Without limitation, all obligations of the Borrower
hereunder or under any other Loan Document to make payments to or indemnify the
Agent or any Lender shall survive the payment in full of all other Obligations,
termination of the Borrower's right to borrow hereunder, and all other events
and conditions whatever. In addition, all obligations of each Lender to make
payments to or indemnify the Agent or the other Lenders shall survive the
payment in full by the Borrower of all Obligations, termination of the
Borrower's right to borrow hereunder, and all other events or conditions
whatever.

         9.10. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts each
of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts shall constitute but one and the same instrument.

         9.11. Limitation on Payments. The parties hereto intend to conform to
all applicable Laws in effect from time to time limiting the maximum rate of
interest that may be charged or collected. Accordingly, notwithstanding any
other provision hereof or of any other Loan Document, the Borrower shall not be
required to make any payment to or for the account of any Lender, and each
Lender shall refund any payment made by the Borrower, to the extent that such
requirement or such failure to refund would violate or conflict with nonwaivable
provisions of applicable Laws limiting the maximum amount of interest which may
be charged or collected by such Lender.

         9.12. Set-Off. The Borrower hereby agrees that, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, if any Obligation of the Borrower shall be due and payable (by
acceleration or otherwise), each Lender shall have the right, without notice to
the Borrower, to set-off against and to appropriate and apply to the Obligation
any indebtedness, liability or obligation of any nature owing to the Borrower by
such Lender, including but not limited to all deposits (whether time or demand,
general or special, provisionally credited or finally credited, whether or not
evidenced by a certificate of deposit) now or hereafter maintained by the
Borrower with such Lender. Such right shall be absolute and unconditional in all
circumstances and, without limitation, shall exist whether or not such Lender or
any other Person shall have given notice or made any demand to the Borrower or
any other Person, whether such indebtedness, obligation or liability owed to the
Borrower is contingent, absolute, matured or unmatured (it being agreed that
such Lender may deem such indebtedness, obligation or liability to be then due
and payable at the time of such setoff), and regardless of the existence or
adequacy of any collateral, guaranty or any other security, right or remedy
available to any Lender or any other Person. The Borrower hereby agrees that, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, any Participant and any branch, subsidiary
or affiliate of any Lender

                                      -66-

<PAGE>

or any Participant shall have the same rights of set-off as a Lender as provided
in this Section (regardless of whether such Participant, branch, subsidiary or
affiliate would otherwise be deemed in privity with or a direct creditor of such
Borrower). The rights provided by this Section are in addition to all other
rights of set-off and banker's lien and all other rights and remedies which any
Lender (or any such Participant, branch, subsidiary or affiliate) may otherwise
have under this Agreement, any other Loan Document, at law or in equity, or
otherwise, and nothing in this Agreement or any Loan Document shall be deemed a
waiver or prohibition of or restriction on the rights of set-off or bankers'
lien of any such Person.

         9.13. Sharinq of Collections. The Lenders hereby agree among themselves
that if any Lender shall receive (by voluntary payment, realization upon
security, set-off or from any other source) any amount on account of the Loans,
interest thereon, or any other Obligation contemplated by this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents to be made by the Borrower pro rata to all Lenders in
greater proportion than any such amount received by any other Lender, then the
Lender receiving such proportionately greater payment shall notify each other
Lender and the Agent of such receipt, and equitable adjustment will be made in
the manner stated in this Section so that, in effect, all such excess amounts
will be shared ratably among all of the Lenders. The Lender receiving such
excess amount shall purchase (which it shall be deemed to have done
simultaneously upon the receipt of such excess amount) for cash from the other
Lenders a participation in the applicable Obligations owed to such other Lenders
in such amount as shall result in a ratable sharing by all Lenders of such
excess amount (and to such extent the receiving Lender shall be a Participant).
If all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from the
Lender making such purchase, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other
amounts, if any, required by Law to be paid by the Lender making such purchase.
The Borrower hereby consents to and confirms the foregoing arrangements. Each
Participant shall be bound by this Section as fully as if it were a Lender
hereunder.

         9.14. Successors and Assigns; Participations; Assignments.

         (a) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the Borrower, the Lenders, all future holders of the
Notes, the Agent and their respective successors and assigns, except that the
Borrower may not assign or transfer any of its rights hereunder or interests
herein without the prior written consent of all the Lenders and the Agent, and
any purported assignment without such consent shall be void.

                                      -67-

<PAGE>
          (b) Participations. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its
commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable Law, at any time
sell participations to one or more commercial banks or other Persons (each a
"Participant") in all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation, all or a
portion of its Commitments and the Loans owing to it and any Note held by it);
provided, that

                  (i) any such Lender's obligations under this Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents shall remain unchanged,

                  (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other
         parties hereto for the performance of such obligations,

                  (iii) the parties hereto shall continue to deal solely and
         directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
         obligations under this Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents,

                  (iv) such Participant shall be bound by the provisions of
         Section 9.13 hereof, and the Lender selling such participation shall
         obtain from such Participant a written confirmation of its agreement to
         be so bound,

                  (v) no Participant (unless such Participant is an affiliate of
         such Lender, or is itself a Lender) shall be entitled to require such
         Lender to take or refrain from taking action under this Agreement or
         under any other Loan Document, except that such Lender may agree with
         such Participant that such Lender will not, without such Participant's
         consent, take action of the type described in subsections (a), (b),
         (c), (d) or (e) of Section 9.03 hereof; notwithstanding the foregoing,
         in no event shall any participation by an Lender have the effect of
         releasing such Lenders from its obligations hereunder, and

                  (vi) no Participant shall be an Affiliate of the Borrower.

The Borrower agrees that any such Participant shall be entitled to the benefits
of Sections 2.12, 2.14 and 9.06 with respect to its participation in the
Commitments and the Loans outstanding from time to time but only to the extent
such Participant sustains such losses; provided, that no such Participant shall
be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to such Sections than the
transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in respect of the amount
of the participation transferred to such Participant had no such transfer
occurred.

         (c) Assignments. Any Lender may, in the ordinary course of its
commercial banking business and in accordance with applicable Law, at any time
assign all or a portion of its rights

                                      -68-

<PAGE>
and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including,
without limitation, all or any portion of its Commitments and Obligations owing
to it and any Note held by it) to any Lender, any affiliate of a Lender or to
one or more additional commercial banks or other Persons (each a "Purchasing
Lender"); provided, that

                  (i) any such assignment to a Purchasing Lender which is not a
         Lender shall be made only with the consent of the Borrower and the
         Agent which shall not be unreasonably withheld,

                  (ii) if a Lender makes such an assignment of less than all of
         its then remaining rights and obligations under this Agreement and the
         other Loan Documents, such transferor Lender shall retain, after such
         assignment, a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000 of the Commitments
         and Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding, and such assignment shall
         be in a minimum aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 of the
         Commitments and Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding,

                  (iii) each such assignment shall be of a constant, and not a
         varying, percentage of each Commitment of the transferor Lender and of
         all of the transferor Lender's rights and obligations under this
         Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and

                  (iv) each such assignment shall be made pursuant to a Transfer
         Supplement in substantially the form of Exhibit C to this Agreement,
         duly completed (a "Transfer Supplement").

In order to effect any such assignment, the transferor Lender and the Purchasing
Lender shall execute and deliver to the Agent a duly completed Transfer
Supplement (including the consents required by clause (i) of the preceding
sentence) with respect to such assignment, together with any Note or Notes
subject to such assignment (the "Transferor Lender Notes") and a processing and
recording fee of $2,500; and, upon receipt thereof, the Agent shall accept such
Transfer Supplement. Upon receipt of the Purchase Price Receipt Notice pursuant
to such Transfer Supplement, the Agent shall record such acceptance in the
Register. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and recording, from and
after the Transfer Effective Date specified in such Transfer Supplement

                  (x) the Purchasing Lender shall be a party hereto and, to the
         extent provided in such Transfer Supplement, shall have the rights and
         obligations of a Lender hereunder, and

                  (y) the transferor Lender thereunder shall be released from
         its obligations under this Agreement to the extent so transferred (and,
         in the case of an Transfer Supplement

                                      -69-

<PAGE>

         covering all or the remaining portion of a transferor Lender's rights
         and obligations under this Agreement, such transferor Lender shall
         cease to be a party to this Agreement) from and after the Transfer
         Effective Date.

On or prior to the Transfer Effective Date specified in an Transfer Supplement,
the Borrower, at its expense, shall execute and deliver to the Agent (for
delivery to the Purchasing Lender) new Notes evidencing such Purchasing Lender's
assigned Commitments or Loans and (for delivery to the transferor Lender)
replacement Notes in the principal amount of the Loans or Commitments retained
by the transferor Lender (such Notes to be in exchange for, but not in payment
of, those Notes then held by such transferor Lender). Each such Note shall be
dated the date and be substantially in the form of the predecessor Note. The
Agent shall mark the predecessor Notes "exchanged" and deliver them to the
Borrower. Accrued interest and accrued fees shall be paid to the Purchasing
Lender at the same time or times provided in the predecessor Notes and this
Agreement.

          (d) Register. The Agent shall maintain at its office a copy of each
Transfer Supplement delivered to it and a register (the "Register") for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders and the Commitment of, and
principal amount of the Obligations owing to, each Lender from time to time. The
entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error and the
Borrower, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each person whose name is recorded
in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of the Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any
reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

          (e) Financial and Other Information. The Borrower authorizes the Agent
and each Lender to disclose to any Participant or Purchasing Lender (each, a
"transferee") and any prospective transferee any and all financial and other
information in such Person's possession concerning the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates which has been or may be delivered to such Person by
or on behalf of the Borrower in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan
Document or such Person's credit evaluation of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
and Affiliates.

                  9.15. Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction.

         (a) Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS (EXCEPT
TO THE EXTENT, IF ANY, OTHERWISE EXPRESSLY STATED IN SUCH OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS)
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, CONSTRUED AND ENFORCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CHOICE OF LAW PRINCIPLES.

         (b) Certain Waivers. THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY:

                                      -70-

<PAGE>

         (i) AGREES THAT ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BY ANY PERSON ARISING
FROM OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT OR ANY STATEMENT,
COURSE OF CONDUCT, ACT, OMISSION, OR EVENT OCCURRING IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR
THEREWITH (COLLECTIVELY, "RELATED LITIGATION") MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR
FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION SITTING IN THE CITY AND COUNTY OF NEW
YORK, NEW YORK, AND SUBMITS TO THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS;

         (ii) WAIVES ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY HAVE AT ANY TIME TO THE LAYING
OF VENUE OF ANY RELATED LITIGATION BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT, WAIVES ANY CLAIM
THAT ANY SUCH RELATED LITIGATION HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM, AND
WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO OBJECT, WITH RESPECT TO ANY RELATED LITIGATION BROUGHT IN
ANY SUCH COURT, THAT SUCH COURT DOES NOT HAVE JURISDICTION OVER THE BORROWER;
AND

         (iii) CONSENTS AND AGREES TO SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR OTHER
LEGAL PROCESS IN ANY RELATED LITIGATION BY REGISTERED OR CERTIFIED U.S. MAIL,
POSTAGE PREPAID, TO THE BORROWER AT THE ADDRESS FOR NOTICES DESCRIBED IN SECTION
9.05 HEREOF, AND CONSENTS AND AGREES THAT SUCH SERVICE SHALL CONSTITUTE IN EVERY
RESPECT VALID AND EFFECTIVE SERVICE (BUT NOTHING HEREIN SHALL AFFECT THE
VALIDITY OR EFFECTIVENESS OF PROCESS SERVED IN ANY OTHER MANNER PERMITTED BY
LAW).

         9.16. Replacement of Lender. If (a) a change in control shall have
occurred with respect to any Lender or (b) any Lender shall impose increased
costs on the Borrower pursuant to Section 2.12(a) or 2.12(c) hereof, the
Borrower may, upon not less than 30 Business Days' notice to the Agent, cause a
Replacement Lender reasonably satisfactory to the Agent (which may be one of the
other Lenders) to purchase all of such Lender's interests in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.14(c) hereof.

                               TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT


         THIS TRANSFER SUPPLEMENT, dated as of the date specified in Item 1 of
Schedule I hereto, among the Transferor Lender specified in Item 2 of Schedule I
hereto (the "Transferor Lender"), each Purchasing Lender specified in Item 3 of
Schedule I hereto (each a "Purchasing Lender") and Mellon Bank, N.A., as Agent
for the Lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement described below.

                                    Recitals:

         A. This Transfer Supplement is being executed and delivered in
accordance with Section 9.14(c) of the Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of
December 1, 1991 by and among Barnes Group Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Borrower"), the Lenders parties thereto, and Mellon Bank, N.A., a national
banking association, as Agent (as the same may be amended, modified or
supplemented from time to time, the "Credit Agreement"). Capitalized terms used
herein without definition have the meaning specified in the Credit Agreement.

         B. Each Purchasing Lender (if it is not already a Lender) wishes to
become a Lender party to the Credit Agreement.

         C. The Transferor Lender is selling and assigning to each Purchasing
Lender, and each Purchasing Lender is purchasing and assuming, a certain portion
of the Transferor Lender's rights and obligations under the Credit Agreement,
including, without limitation, the Transferor Lender's Commitments and Loans
owing to it and any Notes held by it (the "Transferor Lender's Interests").

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound,
hereby agree as follows:

         1. Transfer Effective Notice. Upon receipt by the Agent of five
counterparts of this Transfer Supplement (to each of which is attached a fully
completed Schedule I and Schedule II), and each of which has been executed by
the Transferor Lender, by each Purchasing Lender and by any other Person
required by Section 9.14(c) of the Credit Agreement to execute this Transfer
Supplement, the Agent will transmit to the Borrower, the Transferor Lender and
each Purchasing Lender a transfer effective notice, substantially in the form of
Schedule III to this Transfer Supplement (a "Transfer Effective Notice"). The
date specified in such Transfer Effective Notice as the date on which the
transfer effected by this Transfer Supplement shall become effective (the
"Transfer Effective Date") shall be the fifth Business Day following the date of
such Transfer Effective Notice or such other date as shall be agreed upon among
the Transfer Lender, the Purchasing Lender, the Agent and the Borrower. From and
after the Transfer Effective Date each Purchasing Lender (if not already a

Lender party to the Credit Agreement) shall be a Lender party to the Credit
Agreement for all purposes thereof having the respective interests in the
Transferor Lender's interests reflected in this Transfer Supplement.

         2. Purchase Price; Sale. At or before 12:00 Noon, local time at the
Transferor Lender's office specified in Schedule III, on the Transfer Effective
Date, each Purchasing Lender shall pay to the Transferor Lender, in immediately
available funds, an amount equal to the purchase price, as agreed between the
Transferor Lender and such Purchasing Lender (the "Purchase Price"), of the
portion being purchased by such Purchasing Lender (such Purchasing Lender's
"Purchased Percentage") of the Transferor Lender's Interests. Effective upon
receipt by the Transferor Lender of the Purchase Price from a Purchasing Lender,
the Transferor Lender hereby irrevocably sells, assigns and transfers to such
Purchasing Lender, without recourse, representation or warranty (express or
implied) except as set forth in Section 6 hereof, and each Purchasing Lender
hereby irrevocably purchases, takes and assumes from the Transferor Lender such
Purchasing Lender's Purchased Percentage of the Transferor Lender's Interests.
The Transferor Lender shall promptly notify the Agent of the receipt of the
Purchase Price from a Purchasing Lender ("Purchase Price Receipt Notice"). Upon
receipt by the Agent of such Purchase Price Receipt Notice, the Agent shall
record in the Register the information with respect to such sale and purchase as
contemplated by Section 9.14(d) of the Credit Agreement.

         3. Principal, Interest and Fees. All principal payments, interest, fees
and other amounts that would otherwise be payable from and after the Transfer
Effective Date to or for the account of the Transferor Lender in respect of the
Transferor Lender's Interests shall, instead, be payable to or for the account
of the Transferor Lender and the Purchasing Lenders, as the case may be, in
accordance with their respective interests as reflected in this Transfer
Supplement.

         4. Closing Documents. Concurrently with the execution and delivery
hereof, the Transferor Lender will request that the Borrower provide to each
Purchasing Lender (if it is not already a Lender party to the Credit Agreement)
conformed copies of all documents delivered to such Transferor Lender on the
Closing Date in satisfaction of conditions precedent set forth in the Credit
Agreement.

         5. Further Assurances. Each of the parties to this Transfer Supplement
agrees that at any time and from time to time upon the written request of any
other party, it will execute and deliver such further documents and do such
further acts and things as such other party may reasonably request in order to
effect the purposes of this Transfer Supplement.

this Transfer Supplement, the Transferor Lender and each Purchasing Lender
confirm to and agree with each other and the Agent and the Lenders as follows:

                  (a) Other than the representation and warranty that it is the
         legal and beneficial owner of the interest being assigned hereby free
         and clear of any adverse claim, the Transferor Lender makes no
         representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect

         Loan Document, (ii) any recital, representation, warranty, document,

         of the Loan Documents or otherwise from time to time.

                  (b) The Transferor Lender makes no representation or warranty
         and assumes no responsibility with respect to (i) the performance or

         any other Loan Document on the part of the Borrower or any other
         Borrower, (ii) the business, operations, condition (financial or
         otherwise) or prospects of the Borrower or any other Borrower or any
         other Person, or (iii) the existence of any Event of Default or
         Potential Default.

                  (c) Each Purchasing Lender confirms that it has received a
         copy of the Credit Agreement and each of the other Loan Documents,
         together with copies of the financial statements referred to in Section
         3.06 thereof, the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant
         to Section 5.01 thereof, if any, and such other documents and
         information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit and
         legal analysis and decision to enter into this Transfer Supplement.
         Each Purchasing Lender confirms that it has made such analysis and
         decision independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the
         Transferor Lender or any other Lender.

                  (d) Each Purchasing Lender, independently and without reliance
         upon the Agent, the Transferor Lender or any other Lender, and based on
         such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the
         time, will make its own decisions to take or not take action under or
         in connection with the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document.

Gentlemen/Mesdames:

          I am Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Barnes Group
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), and have acted as counsel to the
Borrower in connection with the Revolving Credit Agreement dated as of December
1, 1991 between you and the Borrower (the "Agreement"). This opinion is being
delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 4.01(d) of the Agreement.
Capitalized terms used herein without definition are used as defined in the
Agreement.

          In this connection, I have examined and am familiar with the originals
or copies, certified or otherwise identified to my satisfaction, of the
Agreement, the Revolving Credit Notes, the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
and By-Laws of the Company, as currently in effect, resolutions of the Company's
Board of Directors authorizing the Agreement and the issuance of the Notes, and
such other documents as I have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for
the opinions set forth below. In my examination, I have assumed the genuineness
of all signatures (except for signatures of officers of the Borrower), the legal
capacity of natural persons, the authenticity of all documents submitted to me
as originals, the conformity to original documents of all documents submitted to
me as certified or photostatic copies and the authenticity of the originals of
such copies. As to the facts material to this opinion which I did not
independently establish or verify, I have relied upon statements and
representations of officers and other representatives of the Borrower and
others.

          I am admitted to the bar in the State of Missouri and am not admitted
in any of the jurisdictions in which the Foreign Subsidiaries are incorporated.
With respect to Foreign Subsidiaries, I am generally familiar with their
organizational structure, have put in place

                                                                 .    .    .

procedures designed to ensure their continued qualification to do business and
good standing in their respective jurisdictions, and am generally familiar with
their current business activities and financial status.

         Based upon and subject to the forgoing, I am of the opinion that:

1.       The Borrower is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
         good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, has the
         corporate power to own its property and to carry on its business as now
         conducted and is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where
         such qualification is necessary and in which the failure to be so
         qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect.

2.       Each Subsidiary incorporated in the United States ("Domestic
         Subsidiary") is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
         good standing under the laws of its state of incorporation, has the
         corporate power to own its property and to carry on its business as now
         conducted and is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where
         such qualification is necessary and in which the failure to be so
         qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect. The shares of stock of
         each Domestic Subsidiary purported to be owned by the Borrower are
         validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by the
         Borrower free and clear of any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security
         interest or other encumbrance.

3.       To the best of my knowledge, without any special investigation by me,
         (a) each subsidiary not incorporated in the United States ("Foreign
         Subsidiary") is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
         good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation,
         has the corporate power to own its property and to carry on its
         business as now conducted and is qualified to do business in every
         jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary and in which the
         failure to be so qualified would have a Material Adverse Effect, and
         (b) the shares of stock of each Foreign Subsidiary purported to be
         owned by the Borrower or another Subsidiary are validly issued, fully
         paid and

                                                                 .   .    .

         nonassessable and are owned by the Borrower or another Subsidiary
         (except in the case of Director's qualifying shares) free and clear of
         any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge, security interest or other
         encumbrance.

4.       The Borrower has the corporate power to execute, deliver and perform
         the Agreement, to borrow under the Agreement, and to execute and
         deliver the Notes.

5.       As of the date hereof, the execution, delivery and performance of the
         Agreement, any borrowings under the Agreement and the execution and
         delivery of the Notes by the Borrower, (a) have been duly authorized by
         all requisite corporate action (including, without limitation, any
         requisite action of the stockholders of the Borrower), (b) will not
         violate any provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or
         By-Laws of the Borrower or any Subsidiary and (c) will not be in
         conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute (with due notice or
         lapse of time or both) a default with respect to Indebtedness for
         borrowed money (including but not limited to the Guarantee).

6.       To the best of my knowledge, without any special investigation by me
         other than the laws and documents referred to above, as of the date
         hereof the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement, any
         borrowings under the Agreement and the execution and delivery of the
         Notes by the Borrower (a) will not (i) violate (A) any provision of Law
         (including, without limitation, Regulations G, U, T, and X of the
         Federal Reserve Board), any order of any court or other agency of
         government or (B) any indenture, agreement or other instrument to which
         the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a party, or by which it
         or any of its property is bound, (ii) be in conflict with, result in a
         breach of or constitute (with due notice or lapse of time or both) a
         default under any such indenture, agreement or other instrument or
         (iii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or
         encumbrance of any nature whatsoever upon any property or assets of the
         Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower and (b) do not require the
         Borrower or any Subsidiary to obtain the consent or approval of any
         Federal, State, municipal or other governmental

                                                                 .    .     .

         department, commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality,
         domestic or foreign.

7.       Neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof is subject to
         regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the
         Federal Power Act, or the Investment Company Act of 1940. Neither the
         Borrower nor any Subsidiary thereof is an "investment company" or a
         company "controlled" by an "investment company," within the meaning of
         the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

8.       The Agreement and the Revolving Credit Notes have each been duly
         executed and delivered and, assuming that the Agreement is a valid and
         binding obligation of you, each constitutes the legal, valid and
         binding obligation of the Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in
         accordance with its terms, except (a) that such enforcement may be
         subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
         similar laws nor or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights
         generally, and (b) such enforcement may be subject to general
         principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
         proceeding in equity or at law).

9.       To the best of my knowledge after due inquiry, there is no pending or
         threatened action, suit, proceeding or investigation by or before any
         Governmental Authority against or affecting the Borrower or any
         Subsidiary of the Borrower, which will more likely than not,
         individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

          I am furnishing this opinion to you solely in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement. This opinion is solely for your
benefit and is not to be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to for
any other purpose without my written permission. In connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the law firm of Reed Smith Shaw &
McClay may also rely on this opinion.

                                            Very truly yours,

                                            /s/ John E. Besser

                                                                              to

                        Quarterly Compliance Certificate

         I have conducted a review of the terms and conditions of the Revolving
Credit Agreement dated as of December 1, 1991 (the "Agreement"), the Notes and
the other Loan Documents, and the financial statements of the Borrower. Defined
terms used herein without definition are used as defined in the Agreement. Such
review has not disclosed nor does the signer have any knowledge of the existence
as of the date of this certificate of any condition or event which constitutes a
Potential Default or Event of Default.

         Enclosed are condensed financial statements relating to the most recent
quarter. In my opinion they present fairly the consolidated financial position
of Barnes Group at the end of the quarter and the results of operations for the
indicated periods. These statements were prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles for interim financial statements.

         Also enclosed are true and correct schedules demonstrating compliance
with the covenants contained in Sections 6.01, 6.02 and 6.03 of the Agreement as
of the date of this certificate.

            with the hiring or promotion of such Key Employees and only
            if such Key Employees are not (or, by virtue of such hiring

            requirements under Rule 16a promulgated under the Securities
            Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act").  Any
            Options granted by the CEO shall be (i) evidenced by a

            Committee for such Option and (ii) subject to, if applicable,
            the performance targets and incentive periods most recently

            4.   Stock Subject to the Plan
            ------------------------------
                 (a)  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 9, the
                      aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which
                      may be issued subject to Incentives granted under
                      the Plan shall not exceed the sum of (i) 1,000,000
                      shares and (ii) the number of shares of stock
                      covered by outstanding options (or installments
                      thereof) granted under the 1981 Plan which, after
                      its expiration, shall terminate or expire in whole
                      or in part without being exercised.  Charges
                      against such aggregate number are governed by the
                      provisions of paragraph (c) of this Section 4,
                      paragraph (k) of Section 5, paragraph (e) of
                      Section 6, paragraph (c) of Section 7, and
                      paragraph (e) of Section 8.  No Key Employee may
                      receive grants of Options, Stock Appreciation
                      Rights or Incentive Stock Rights in any year
                      relating to shares of Common Stock which in the
                      aggregate exceed 50,000 shares, which number shall
                      be adjusted pursuant to the terms hereof.

                 (b)  Such shares may be either authorized but unissued
                      shares or shares issued and thereafter acquired by
                      the Company.

                 (c)  If any shares subject to an Incentive shall cease
                      to be subject thereto because of the termination
                      without exercise or payment, in whole or in part,
                      of such Incentive, the shares as to which the
                      Incentive was not exercised or paid shall no longer
                      be charged against the limits in paragraph (a) of
                      this Section 4 and may again be made subject to
                      Incentives.

                 (d)  The Committee may permit the voluntary surrender of
                      all or a portion of any Incentive granted under
                      this Plan conditioned upon the granting to the
                      employee of a new Incentive for the same or a
                      different number of shares or amount of other
                      payment as the Incentive surrendered, or it may
                      require such voluntary surrender as a condition to
                      a grant of a new




                                          4
<PAGE>


                      Incentive to such employee.  Such new Incentive
                      shall be exercisable at the price, during the
                      period, and in accordance with any other terms or
                      conditions specified by the Committee at the time
                      the new Incentive is granted, all determined in
                      accordance with the provisions of this Plan without
                      regard to the price, period of exercise, or any
                      other terms or conditions of the Incentive
                      surrendered.

            5.   Options
            ------------
                 Incentives, in the form of options to purchase shares of
            Common Stock, shall be subject to the following provisions:

                 (a)  The Option price per share shall be determined as
                      of the effective date of the grant and shall not be
                      less than 85% of the Fair Market Value of the
                      Common Stock at the time of the grant of the
                      Option.  In no event shall the Option price be less
                      than the par value of the stock which is the
                      subject of the Option.

                 (b)  Each Option shall expire at such time as the
                      Committee may determine at the time the Option is
                      granted; provided, however, that no Option may,
                      under any circumstances, expire later than ten
                      years from the date such Option shall have been
                      granted.

                 (c)  Any Option granted under the Plan may be exercised
                      solely by the person to whom granted, by his/her
                      guardian or legal representative, or, in the case
                      of death, by an estate.

                 (d)  No Option may be exercised less than 12 months from
                      the date it is granted.  After completion of any
                      additional required period of employment specified
                      in the Option grant, the Option may be exercised,
                      in whole or in part, at any time or from time to
                      time during the balance of


                                          5
<PAGE>

                      the term of the Option, except as limited by
                      provisions contained in the Option (including
                      provisions regarding exercise in installments).

                 (e)  If the optionee terminates employment prior to
                      attaining age 55, the Option shall terminate 90
                      days after termination of employment, except in the
                      case of death or disability.

                 (f)  If employment terminates as a result of death or
                      disability, or if the Optionee terminates
                      employment after attaining age 55, the Option shall
                      terminate five years after termination of
                      employment; provided, however, if the Optionee's
                      employment is terminated upon the request of the
                      Company after the Optionee attains age 55, the
                      Option may be terminated by the Committee effective
                      90 days after termination of employment.

                 (g)  Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 5 to
                      the contrary, (1) the Committee may provide that an
                      Option will terminate prior to time periods
                      specified in paragraphs 5(e) and 5(f) on conditions
                      specified by the Committee and incorporated in an
                      Option Agreement between the Company and the person
                      receiving the option; and (2) in no event may any
                      Option be exercised after the expiration date
                      thereof.

                 (h)  Shares purchased upon exercise of an Option shall
                      be paid for in full within twenty days of the date
                      of exercise in cash or, with the consent of the
                      Committee, in whole or in part in shares of Common
                      Stock based on their Fair Market Value on the date
                      of exercise.

                 (i)  If so authorized by the Committee, the Company may,
                      with the consent of the optionee, and at any time
                      or from time to time, cancel all or a portion of
                      any Option granted under the Plan then subject to
                      exercise and discharge its obligation in respect of
                      the Option either by payment to the





                                          6
<PAGE>






                      optionee of an amount of cash equal to the excess,
                      if any, of the Fair Market Value, at such time, of
                      the shares subject to the portion of the Option so
                      cancelled over the aggregate option price of such
                      shares, or by issuance or transfer to the optionee
                      of shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market Value,
                      at such time, equal to any such excess, or by a
                      combination of cash and shares.

                 (j)  The forms of Option authorized by the Plan may
                      contain such other provisions as the Committee
                      shall deem advisable.

                 (k)  Upon the exercise of an Option there shall be
                      charged against the limits in paragraph (a) of
                      Section 4 the number of shares issued to the
                      optionee.  Upon the cancellation of any Option
                      pursuant to paragraph (i) of Section 5, there shall
                      be charged against the limitations in paragraph (a)
                      of Section 4 a number of shares equal to (A) the
                      number of any shares issued to the optionee plus
                      (B) the number of shares purchasable with the
                      amount of any cash paid to the optionee on the
                      basis of the Fair Market Value as of the date of
                      payment; and the number of shares subject to the
                      portion of the Option so cancelled, less the number
                      of shares so charged against such limitations,
                      shall thereafter be available for other grants of
                      Incentives.

                 (l)  An Option will not be treated as an Incentive Stock
                      Option within the meaning of section 422 of the
                      Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

            6.   Stock Appreciation Rights
            ------------------------------
                 (a)  A Stock Appreciation Right ("SAR") may be granted
                      in connection with any Option granted under the
                      Plan, either at the time of the grant of such
                      Option or at any time thereafter during the term of
                      the Option, or independently of the grant of an
                      Option.

                 (b)  An SAR shall entitle the holder thereof, upon
                      exercise of the SAR, to receive a number of shares
                      of Common Stock or cash or a combination of cash
                      and shares (as the Committee in its discretion may
                      elect) determined pursuant to paragraph (d) of this
                      Section 6.

                 (c)  An SAR shall be subject to the following terms and
                      conditions and to such other terms and conditions
                      not inconsistent with the Plan as shall from time
                      to time be approved by the Committee:

                      (i)  If granted in connection with an Option, an
                           SAR shall be exercisable at such time or times
                           and by such person or persons and to the
                           extent, but only to the extent, that the
                           Option to which it relates shall be
                           exercisable; provided, however, that such SAR
                           shall be exercisable only during the ten-day
                           periods (the "Exercise Periods") beginning on
                           the third business day following the date of
                           release of a summary statement of the
                           Company's quarterly or annual sales and
                           earnings and ending on the twelfth business
                           day following such date of release.

                      (ii) If granted independently of an Option, an SAR
                           shall be subject to the following provisions:

                           (A)  If a person terminates employment prior
                                to attaining age 55, the SAR shall
                                terminate 90 days after the termination
                                of employment, except in the case of
                                death or disability.

                           (B)  If employment terminates as a result of
                                death or disability or if a person
                                terminates employment after attaining age
                                55,

                                the SAR will terminate one year after the
                                termination of employment.

                 (d)  Upon exercise of an SAR, the holder thereof shall
                      be entitled to receive a number of shares equal in
                      Fair Market Value to (1) the amount by which the
                      Fair Market Value of a share of Common Stock on the
                      date of such exercise shall exceed the Fair Market
                      Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of
                      grant of the related Option, or, in the case of any
                      SAR granted independently of an option, on the date
                      of grant of such SAR, multiplied by (2) the number
                      of shares in respect of which the SAR shall have
                      been exercised.  Settlement for any fraction of a
                      share due shall be made in cash.  The Committee may
                      settle all or any part of the Company's obligation
                      arising out of an exercise of any SAR by the
                      payment of cash equal to the aggregate value of the
                      shares of Common Stock that it would otherwise be
                      obligated to deliver under the provisions of this
                      paragraph (d).

                 (e)  Upon exercise of any SAR, (i) there shall be
                      charged against the limitations in paragraph (a) of
                      Section 4 a number of shares equal to (A) the
                      number of shares issued to the grantee under
                      paragraph (d) of this Section 6 plus (B) the number
                      of shares purchasable with the amount of any cash
                      paid to the grantee on the basis of the Fair Market
                      Value as of the date of payment and (ii) the
                      portion of the Incentive in respect of which such
                      SAR shall have been exercised shall be cancelled
                      and the number of shares subject to such portion,
                      less the number of shares so charged against such
                      limitations, shall thereafter be available for
                      other grants of Incentives.

            7.   Incentive Stock Rights
            ---------------------------
                 (a)  An Incentive Stock Right will consist of incentive
                      stock units, each of which will be equivalent to
                      one share of Common Stock.  An Incentive Stock
                      Right will be evidenced by an agreement in form
                      approved by the Committee; will be nontransferable;
                      will entitle the holder to receive shares of Common
                      Stock, without payment to the Company, after the
                      lapse of the incentive period or periods
                      established by the Committee and subject to the
                      satisfaction of any performance goals established
                      by the Committee from the performance criteria set
                      forth in Section 14 hereof with respect to such
                      Incentive Stock Rights; and will be subject to the
                      limitations in paragraph (a) of Section 4.  The
                      terms of the agreement evidencing an Incentive
                      Stock Right shall provide that holders of Incentive
                      Stock Rights will be entitled, from the date of the
                      award, either (1) to receive from the Company cash
                      payments equal to the amount of dividends declared
                      on the number of shares of Common Stock equal to
                      the number of incentive stock units held by them,
                      such payments to be made on or about the Company's
                      dividend payment dates or (2) to be credited with
                      dividend equivalents based upon dividends paid on
                      outstanding shares of Common Stock.  Such dividend
                      equivalents, once credited, shall be converted into
                      a number of additional incentive stock units, as of
                      each dividend payment date, in accordance with the
                      following formula:


                                     (A x B) /C


                      in which "A" equals the number of incentive stock
                      units credited to the holder on the dividend
                      payment date, "B" equals the dividend per share and
                      "C" equals the Fair Market Value per share of
                      Common Stock on the dividend payment date.  If a
                      dividend is paid in property other than cash,
                      dividend equivalents shall be credited, as of the
                      dividend payment date, in accordance with the
                      formula set forth above, except that "B" shall
                      equal


                                         10
<PAGE>


                      the fair market value per share of the property
                      which the holder would have received in respect of
                      the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
                      number of incentive stock units credited to the
                      holder as of the dividend payment date, had such
                      shares been owned as of the record date for such
                      dividend.

                 (b)  If an employee terminates employment prior to
                      attaining age 55, all Incentive Stock Rights will
                      terminate on the date employment terminates, except
                      in the case of death or disability.  Except as
                      otherwise provided in the agreement evidencing the
                      Incentive Stock Right, if employment terminates as
                      a result of death or disability, or after
                      attainment of age 55, the Committee may elect, at
                      any time during or at the end of the Incentive
                      period, to award a portion of the shares of Common
                      Stock that would have been awarded, but for the
                      termination of employment, equal to the number of
                      months in the incentive period prior to the
                      termination date divided by the number of months in
                      the incentive period.

                 (c)  After the issuance of shares in respect of
                      Incentive Stock Rights, there will be charged
                      against the limitations in paragraph (a) of Section
                      4 a number of shares equal to the number of shares
                      so issued.

                 (d)  To the extent not inconsistent with Section 162(m),
                      the Committee may make such adjustments to any
                      performance goals or to the Company's financial
                      results as it deems appropriate for changes in
                      accounting practices or principles, for material
                      acquisitions or dispositions of stock or property,
                      for recapitalizations or reorganizations or for any
                      other events with respect to which the Committee
                      determines such an adjustment to be appropriate in
                      order to avoid distortion in the operation of the
                      Plan.

            8.   Performance Unit Awards
            ----------------------------
                 (a)  A Performance Unit Award will consist of
                      performance units granted to Key Employees selected
                      by the Committee which can be paid in cash or
                      shares of Common Stock.  Performance units may be
                      granted alone or in conjunction with and related to
                      an Option.  When granted in conjunction with an
                      Option, the number of performance units, unless
                      otherwise provided by the Committee, will be equal
                      to the number of shares under the related Option. 
                      To the extent that the Committee elects to pay
                      performance units granted with a related Option,
                      there will be a proportionate reduction in the
                      number of shares available under such Option and
                      any related SAR.  To the extent the related Option
                      or an SAR granted in connection with such Option is
                      exercised, the related number of performance units
                      will be proportionately reduced.

                 (b)  The Committee will establish an initial value for
                      each performance unit at the time of grant.  At
                      that time, the Committee will also establish
                      performance targets (from the performance criteria
                      set forth in Section 14 hereof) to be achieved
                      during the award period of not less than one year
                      set by the Committee.  The value of the performance
                      units at the end of the award period will be
                      determined by the degree to which the performance
                      targets are achieved.  Performance Unit Awards will
                      be subject to the limitations in paragraph (a) of
                      Section 4 and will be evidenced by agreements
                      setting forth the initial value for each
                      performance unit, the performance targets, the
                      award period and such other terms and conditions
                      not inconsistent with the Plan as the Committee may
                      determine.

                 (c)  Payment, if any, at the end of the award period
                      will be made in cash, shares of Common Stock, or
                      both, as determined by the Committee.  In no event
                      shall payment to an individual in respect of any
                      Performance


                                         12

                      Unit Award exceed $250,000 in value.  A Performance
                      Unit Award granted alone, not in conjunction with
                      an Option, is automatically payable if the
                      conditions are met.  A Performance Unit Award
                      granted in conjunction with an Option is payable
                      only if the conditions are met and then at the
                      election of the Committee, as an alternative to the
                      continuance of the related option and any related
                      SAR.  The Committee may make this election to pay
                      only during the first two months after the end of
                      the award period.  If the election to pay is not
                      made, the Performance Unit Award terminates and the
                      related Option and SAR continue in effect.

                 (d)  In the event of termination of employment prior to
                      the end of the award period by reason of death,
                      disability, or termination of employment after
                      attainment of 55 years of age, a pro rata portion
                      of the value of the performance units at the end of
                      the award period will be paid to the employee (or
                      his/her estate in the case of death), unless the
                      Committee determines that a different portion
                      should be payable or elects to terminate the award.
                      Except as otherwise determined by the Committee,
                      upon termination of employment under any other
                      circumstances, the Performance Unit Award will
                      terminate.

                 (e)  Upon payment of a Performance Unit Award, there
                      shall be charged against the aggregate limitations
                      in paragraph (a) of Section 4 a number of shares
                      equal to (i) the number of any shares issued to the
                      employee in respect of the Performance Unit Award
                      plus (ii) the number of shares purchasable with the
                      amount of any cash paid to the employee in respect
                      of the Performance Unit Award on the basis of the
                      Fair Market Value of the Common Stock as of the
                      date of payment.

                 (f)  To the extent not inconsistent with Section 162(m),
                      the Committee may make such adjustments to the
                      performance goals or to the Company's

                                         13
<PAGE>


                      financial results as it deems appropriate for
                      changes in accounting practices or principles, for
                      material acquisitions or disposition of stock or
                      property, for recapitalizations or reorganizations
                      or for any other events with respect to which the
                      Committee determines such an adjustment to be
                      appropriate in order to avoid distortion in the
                      operation of the Plan.

            9.   Adjustment Provisions
            --------------------------
                 The Options granted under the Plan shall contain such
            provisions as the Committee may determine with respect to
            adjustments to be made in the number and kind of shares
            covered by such Options and in the Option price in the event
            of a reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock
            dividend, combination of shares, merger, consolidation,
            rights offering, or any other change in the corporate
            structure or shares of the Company, and in the event of any
            such change, the aggregate number and kind of shares
            available under the Plan and the maximum number of Options,
            Stock Appreciation Rights, and Incentive Stock Rights which
            can be granted to any individual shall be appropriately
            adjusted.  In the event of any such change, equitable
            adjustments shall also be made by the Committee in its
            discretion in the terms and conditions of any SAR, Incentive
            Stock Right, or Performance Unit Award granted under the
            Plan.

            10.  Term
            ---------

                      ----------------------------------
          4.1  The Company shall establish a bookkeeping account on behalf
               of each Participant who elects to defer Compensation to the
               Deferred Compensation Cash Account.  This account shall be
               credited with an amount equal to that portion of the
               Participant's deferred Compensation that the Participant
               elects to defer under this Section 4 at such times as the
               Compensation subject to such deferral would otherwise have
               been paid.  The Company shall not be required to segregate
               or earmark assets with respect to such account and
               Participants shall have no interest in any specific asset as
               a result of the creation of such account.

          4.2  Interest will be credited quarterly on the unpaid amount

               Compensation Cash Account at the end of each quarter.  The
               interest rate shall be the rate of interest for prime
               commercial loans of 90-day maturities charged by Chemical
               Bank (or such other New York City bank as the Benefits
               Committee may select) on the first business day of each
               quarter.

                      -------------------------------------------
          5.1  The Company shall establish a bookkeeping account on behalf
               of each Participant who elects to defer Compensation to the
               Deferred Compensation Phantom Stock Account.  At such times
               as the Compensation subject to such deferral would otherwise
               have been paid, the Deferred Compensation Phantom Stock
               Account shall be credited with a number of Common Stock
               Units (including fractional Common Stock Units) equal to (a)
               that portion of the Participant's Deferred Compensation that
               the Participant elects to defer under this Section 5,
               divided by (b) the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on
               the date such Compensation would otherwise have been paid.
               The Company shall not be required to segregate or earmark
               Common Stock with respect to such account and Participants
               shall have no interest in any specific asset as a result of
               the creation of such account.


          5.2  Each Common Stock Unit shall be credited with dividend
               equivalents based on the value of any dividends which would
               have been paid to the Participant if he or she had owned a
               number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of his

                                          3
<PAGE>




               or her Common Stock Units.  Such dividend equivalents shall
               be converted into additional Common Stock Units for the
               Participant based upon the Fair Market Value of shares of
               Common Stock on the date on which such dividend is paid.

          5.3  In the event of any recapitalization, merger, consolidation,
               stock split or other significant corporate event affecting
               the Common Stock, the Common Stock Units credited to a
               Participant's Deferred Compensation Phantom Stock Account
               shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such event.

          5.4  Payments from the Deferred Compensation Phantom Stock
               Account shall be made only in cash, and only in accordance
               with Section 6 hereof.

          Section 6:  Payments
                      --------
          6.1  Payments from the amount standing to the Participant's
               credit in his or her Deferred Compensation Accounts shall
               begin on the first day of the month following the
               Participant's Retirement; provided, however, that if
               Retirement occurs prior to the Participant's 60th birthday,
               except for reasons of death or disability, said payments
               shall commence on the first day of the month following the
               Participant's 60th birthday.

          6.2  Payments shall be made in a lump sum or in installments as
               elected by the Participant in the initial participation
               form.  Where monthly or annual installments are elected, the
               Company shall conduct the payout so as to make installments
               as substantially equal as possible over the period elected.
               If at Retirement the Participant has amounts credited to the
               Deferred Compensation Cash Account and the Deferred
               Compensation Phantom Stock Account, such installments shall
               be paid in proportionate amounts simultaneously from both
               such accounts.  Amounts paid which relate to a Participant's
               Deferred Compensation Phantom Stock Account shall be based
               upon the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the date
               preceding the date of payment.


          6.3  A Participant may elect a different form of payment by
               filing with the Secretary of the Company a form at any time
               prior to Retirement; provided, however, that such election
               shall be of no force and effect if such Participant's
               Retirement occurs within 12 months of the filing of such
               form.


          6.4  If a Participant dies prior to receiving payment of the full
               amount credited to his or her Deferred Compensation
               Accounts, the remaining balance shall be paid to the
               beneficiary designated in the enrollment form as it falls
               due, or, in the sole discretion of the Benefits Committee,
               in a lump sum amount equal to the then current value of the
               deceased Participant's Deferred Compensation Accounts.  If
               no beneficiary or beneficiaries have been designated, then
               the Participant's estate shall receive a lump-sum amount
               equal to the then value of the Deferred Compensation
               Accounts.

          Section 7:  Administration/Amendment
                      ------------------------
          7.1  This Plan shall be administered by the Benefits Committee,
               whose interpretation of the Plan shall be binding on the
               Participants.

          7.2  This Plan may be amended or terminated by the Board of
               Directors at any time; provided, however, that no such
               amendment or termination shall reduce or cancel any amount
               standing to a Participant's credit in the Deferred
               Compensation Accounts prior to the effective date of such
               amendment or termination.

          7.3  For serious financial reasons, a Participant may apply to
               the Benefits Committee for withdrawal of the funds credited
               to his or her Deferred Compensation Accounts prior to the
               time that they are otherwise payable.  If such application
               for withdrawal is approved by the Benefits Committee, the
               withdrawal will be effective at the later of the dates
               specified in the Participant's application or the date of
               approval by the Benefits Committee.  If at the time of such
               withdrawal the Participant has amounts credited to a
               Deferred Compensation Cash Account and the Deferred
               Compensation Phantom Stock Account, the withdrawal will be
               taken, to the extent practicable, in proportionate amounts
               from both such accounts.  Serious financial reasons shall
               include the following: bankruptcy or impending bankruptcy,
               unexpected and unreimbursed expenses resulting from illness
               or an accident to person or property, and other types of
               unexpected and unreimbursed expenses of a major or emergency
               nature where withdrawal of the funds would be necessary to
               prevent great hardship to the Participant.  Withdrawals for
               foreseeable expenditures normally budgetable such as a down
               payment on a home, vacation expenses, purchase of an
               automobile, or educational expenses will not be permitted.

                    I hereby certify that the foregoing amended and
               restated Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on
               July 19, 1996.

          1.20 "SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT" shall mean the annual Social

               commencement after his Social Security Retirement Age, as
               determined under the Social Security Act in effect on the
               January 1 preceding the date benefits commence, and based
               upon the following assumptions:

               (a)  the Participant had no earnings during the calendar
                    year which includes the date his employment with the
                    Company terminates, or in any subsequent calendar year;

               (b)  the Participant's earnings in each prior year are equal
                    to the maximum amount of wages subject to old age
                    survivor and disability insurance tax under the Federal

               (d)  in the event the Participant's actual retirement is
                    prior to age 62, his Social Security Benefit shall
                    equal the Social Security Benefit otherwise payable at
                    age 62 multiplied by the appropriate factor from the
                    following table, based on the age when benefits

               the Accrued Benefit) commencing on his Normal Retirement
               Date.  The Participant's monthly Normal Retirement Benefit
               shall be equal to one-twelfth of the excess of (a) over the
               sum of (b), (c) and (d), where:

               (a)  equals 55% of his Final Average Compensation multiplied

                    Service to fifteen;
               (b)  equals his Qualified Plan Benefit; and

          3.2  BENEFIT UPON DEFERRED RETIREMENT.  Upon retiring on a
               Deferred Retirement Date, a Participant shall be entitled to
               receive a benefit commencing on the first day of the month
               coincident with or next following the Participant's Deferred
               Retirement Date and continuing monthly for the lifetime of
               the Participant.  The amount of such benefit shall be equal
               to the amount otherwise payable under Section 3.1 based on
               the Participant's Final Average Compensation, Credited
               Service, Qualified Plan Benefit, Social Security Benefit and
               Prior Employer Benefit determined as of the Participant's
               Deferred Retirement Date.

               Retirement Date, and any of conditions (a), (b) or (c)
               immediately below apply, he shall be entitled to a lifetime
               monthly "Early Retirement Benefit" as described in Section
               4.2 below.

               (a)  His retirement was requested by the President and Chief

               as the excess of (a) over the sum of (b), (c) and (d) below,
               where:

               (a)  equals the product of (i), (ii), and (iii) below

                    (i)  equals 55% of his Final Average Compensation,

                    (ii) equals the ratio (not to exceed 1.0) of his
                         Credited Service to the greater of

                              have completed had Credited Service continued
                              to age 62, and

                    (iii)     equals the appropriate factor from the

          5.1  DEATH OF PARTICIPANT PRIOR TO COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFITS.  If
               a Participant dies on or after attaining age 55 and
               completing 5 years of Credited Service, but prior to the
               date his benefits under this Plan commence, his Surviving
               Spouse shall be eligible to receive a monthly lifetime
               benefit commencing on the first day of the month following
               the Participant's death.  The benefit payable to his
               Surviving Spouse shall be equal to the amount which would
               have been payable to the Surviving Spouse if the Participant
               had:

               (a)  terminated employment on the date of death;

               (b)  elected to receive payments in the form of a joint and

                    Contingent Annuitant; and

               (c)  died on the next day.

          5.2  DEATH OF PARTICIPANT AFTER COMMENCEMENT OF BENEFITS.  If a
               Participant dies after the commencement of his benefits
               under this Plan, no death benefit will be payable hereunder

                                     DISABILITY




          6.1  DISABILITY DEFINED.  For purposes of this Plan, a
               Participant shall be deemed to be disabled if he is eligible
               for and receiving Social Security disability benefits.

          6.2  DISABILITY BENEFITS.  No benefits shall be payable hereunder
               solely on account of disability.  However, if a Participant
               is deemed to be disabled under Section 6.1, he shall
               continue to accrue Credited Service until the earliest of
               the following events:

               (a)  the Participant attains his Normal Retirement Date;

               (b)  the Participant elects to retire on an Early Retirement
                    Date;

               (c)  the Participant dies (however, no benefits are payable
                    under the plan on account of death prior to age 55 and
                    completion of 5 years of Credited Service) and

               (d)  the Participant ceases to be disabled.

               The Participant's Compensation during the period of
               disability shall, for purposes of this Plan, be deemed to be
               equal to the Participant's Compensation for the calendar
               year preceding the date on which such disability began.

                        NORMAL AND OPTIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT



          7.1  NORMAL FORM OF PAYMENT.  The normal form of payment under
               this Plan for an unmarried Participant is a single life
               annuity: a benefit payable monthly for the lifetime of the
               Participant, the first payment to be due on the date
               specified in Section 3, 4, or 5 hereof, and the last payment
               to be due on the first day of the calendar month in which
               death occurs.

               The normal form of payment under this Plan for a married
               Participant is a 50% joint and contingent annuity: a benefit
               payable monthly for the lifetime of the Participant with a
               lifetime benefit equal to 50% of such benefit payable
               monthly to the spouse following the death of the
               Participant.

          7.2  OPTIONAL FORMS OF PAYMENT.  In lieu of the normal form of
               payment, a Participant may elect to receive his benefit in
               the form of:

               (a)  a Single Life Annuity, which is a benefit payable
                    monthly for the lifetime of the Participant with no
                    benefits payable after his death;

               (b)  a Joint and Contingent Annuity, which is a benefit
                    payable monthly for the lifetime of the Participant
                    with a benefit equal to 25%,33 1/3%, 50%,66 2/3%, 75%,
                    or 100% (as selected by the Participant) of such
                    benefit payable monthly to the Contingent Annuitant for
                    the lifetime of the Contingent Annuitant; or

               (c)  a Ten Year Certain and Continuous Annuity, which is a
                    benefit payable monthly for the lifetime of the
                    Participant and, in the event of the Participant's
                    death prior to receiving 120 monthly payments, payable
                    monthly to a named Beneficiary until the Participant
                    and Beneficiary together have received 120 monthly
                    payments.  If both the Participant and the Beneficiary
                    die before 120 payments have been made, payments shall
                    be made to the Participant's estate until a total of
                    120 monthly payments have been paid.

               The Participant's benefits shall be paid in an optional form
               if the Participant makes an irrevocable election at least
               twelve months prior to the time benefits under this Plan
               commence.  In the event that a Participant elects a Joint
               and Contingent Annuity and the Contingent Annuitant
               designated by the Participant dies prior to the time
               benefits commence, the election of the optional form of
               payment shall be disregarded.  In the event that a
               Participant elects a Ten Year Certain and Continuous Annuity
               and the Beneficiary designated by the Participant dies prior
               to the time benefits

               commence, the Participant shall designate a new
               Beneficiary.  Elections of optional forms of payment shall be
               filed by the Participant with the Benefits Committee or its
               designee on a form approved by the Benefits Committee.

          7.3  ACTUARIAL EQUIVALENT.  The amount of benefit payable under
               this Plan shall be the actuarial equivalent of the single
               life annuity.  Actuarial equivalence shall be determined
               using the factors specified in the Qualified Plan.

          7.4  DESIGNATION OF CONTINGENT ANNUITANT.  Except as provided
               below, the Participant may designate a Contingent Annuitant
               or Beneficiary or change any prior designation by giving
               written notice to the Benefits Committee at any time prior
               to the date benefits hereunder commence.

               Exception:  The Participant may not change the designation
               of a Contingent Annuitant at any time that is within twelve
               months prior to the date that benefits hereunder commence.
               No such restriction applies to the right of a Participant to
               change the designation of a Beneficiary under subparagraph
               7.2(c). above.

               property interest whatsoever in any such assets of the
               Company.  Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action
               taken pursuant to any provision hereunder, shall create or
               be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary
               relationship between the Company and the Participants,
               Beneficiaries, Contingent Annuitants or any other person.
               Any assets which may be invested to fund benefits provided
               hereunder shall continue for all purposes to be a part of
               the general funds of the Company, and no person other than
               the Company shall by virtue of the provisions of this Plan
               have any interest in such funds.  To the extent that any
               person acquires a right to receive payments from the Company
               under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the
               rights of any unsecured general creditor of the Company.

                                   ADMINISTRATION


          9.1  ADMINISTRATION.  The Committee shall have full power and
               authority to interpret and construe the terms of this Plan,
               and the Committee's interpretations and construction
               thereof, and actions thereunder, or the amount or recipient
               of the benefits to be made therefrom shall be binding and
               conclusive on all persons for all purposes.  No agent or
               representative of the Board shall be liable to any person
               for any action taken or omitted in connection with the
               interpretation and administration of this Plan unless
               attributable to his own willful misconduct or lack of good
               faith.

          9.2  EXPENSES OF ADMINISTRATION.  All expenses incurred in
               connection with the execution of this Plan and in carrying
               out the provisions hereof shall be paid by the Company.

          9.3  INFORMATION FROM PARTICIPANT.  Each Participant shall
               furnish to the Company such information as the Company may
               reasonably request for purposes of the proper administration
               of the provisions of this Plan.

          9.4  NO EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS.  Nothing contained in the Plan shall
               be construed as a contract of employment between the Company
               and a Participant, or as a right of any Participant to be
               continued in the employment of the Company, or as a
               limitation of the right of the Company to discharge any of
               its Participants, with or without cause.  Any benefit
               payable under this Plan shall not be deemed salary,
               earnings, or other compensation to the Participant for the
               purpose of computing benefits to which he may be entitled
               under any qualified retirement plan or other arrangement of
               the Company for the benefit of its employees.

          9.5  RESTRICTIONS ON ALIENATION AND ASSIGNMENT.  Neither a
               Participant nor any Beneficiary or Contingent Annuitant
               shall have the right to assign, transfer, hypothecate,
               encumber, commute or anticipate any interest in any payments
               hereunder, and such payments shall not in any way be subject
               to any legal process to levy upon or attach the sum for
               payment of any such claim against the Participant or any
               Beneficiary or Contingent Annuitant, provided, however, that
               nothing contained herein shall preclude a Participant from
               designating a Beneficiary or Contingent Annuitant to receive
               benefits hereunder in the event of the Participant's death.

                                         14
<PAGE>




          9.6  FACILITY OF PAYMENT.  If  the Company shall find, upon
               receipt of medical evidence or legal representations
               satisfactory to the Committee, that any Participant to whom
               a benefit is payable is unable to care for such person's
               affairs because of illness or accident, any payment due
               hereunder (unless a prior claim therefor shall have been
               made by a duly appointed guardian, conservator or other
               legal representative) may be paid to such Participant's
               spouse, child, parent or brother or sister, or to any person
               or persons determined by the Company to have incurred
               expense for such Participant.  Any payment shall be a
               complete discharge of all liability hereunder.

          9.7  FAILURE TO CLAIM AMOUNTS PAYABLE.   In the event that any
               amount shall become payable hereunder to a Participant or,
               upon a Participant's death, to the Beneficiary, Contingent
               Annuitant, or representative of the Participant's estate,
               and if after written notice from the Company mailed to such
               person's last known address as shown in the Company's
               records and after diligent effort the Company is unable to
               locate such person, the Company shall apply to a court of
               competent jurisdiction for direction as to the distribution
               of such amount.

          9.8  AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION. The Board reserves the right to
               amend and/or terminate the Plan at any time for whatever
               reasons it may deem appropriate, except that no such
               amendment or termination shall adversely affect the benefits
               payable to any person who has begun to receive benefits
               hereunder.

          9.9  GENDER AND NUMBER.  All the words and terms used herein,
               regardless of the number and gender in which they shall be
               used, shall be deemed to include any other number, singular
               and plural, and any other gender, masculine and feminine, as
               the context may require.

          9.10 LAW APPLICABLE.  This Plan shall be governed by the laws of
               the State of Connecticut.

A SALUTE TO OUR EMPLOYEES
WHO HELPED MAKE IT HAPPEN

Flowing through the following financial pages is a
series of employee photos that represent the
thousands of people throughout the company whose
contributions in 1996 helped us achieve record
earnings for the second year in a row. It is
through their efforts that the momentum that began
three years ago has accelerated -- and will
continue to move us ahead in the future. It has
always been a key part of Barnes GroupOs Guiding
Philosophy that Opeople are our most important
resource.O

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Barnes Group Inc. reported all-time records in
sales and earnings in 1996, for the second
consecutive year. Sales were $595.0 million
compared to $592.5 million in 1995. Sales in 1995
increased 4% over 1994. Operating income was up
13% in 1996 to $55.3 million, compared to $48.8
million in 1995. Operating income in 1995
increased 33% over the $36.6 million reported in
1994. Operating income margin has steadily
increased to 9.3% in 1996 compared to 8.2% in 1995
and 6.4% in 1994. The 1996 results reflect profit
growth at all three business segments and solid
sales gains at Barnes Aerospace. The 1995 results
reflected sales and profit improvements at all
three business segments. Cost of sales as a
percentage of sales was 64.7% in 1996, comparable
to the prior two year periods. Selling and
administrative expenses decreased in both 1996 and
1995 versus the previous years.

SEGMENT REVIEW -- SALES AND OPERATING INCOME
Associated Spring segment sales for 1996 were
$279.5 million, up slightly from 1995. Sales in
1995 of $279.0 million were 2% higher than 1994.
This segment reported an 8% increase in operating
income, to a record $45.8 million in 1996. In
1995, Associated Spring reported operating income
of $42.6 million compared to $41.7 million in
1994.

At the segmentOs North American manufacturing
operations, both sales and profits increased,
reflecting a stronger domestic automotive market,
gains in manufacturing efficiencies and lower
material costs. The groupOs distribution business,
which markets die springs and precision stock
springs, also reported sales and profit growth.
Internationally, results were down compared to the
strong results reported in 1995, reflecting a
slowdown in its electronics business and a
softening in Brazil.

Bowman Distribution segment sales for 1996 were
$213.4 million compared to $217.0 million in 1995
and $215.1 million in 1994. While overall North
American sales declined slightly in 1996 versus
1995, good progress was made in penetrating
targeted markets, such as railroad, aerospace,
public utilities and waste management companies
and large customers who look to Bowman for the
full support needed to maintain their operating
facilities. In Europe, BowmanOs sales declined 5%,
as management streamlined its van-based sales
force in an effort to eliminate low margin sales
volume. At the same time, Bowman U.K. reported an
18% increase in its systems business.

Bowman segment operating income in 1996 of $22.0
million increased $4.6 million or 26% from 1995.
The 1995 level of $17.4 million was $4.8 million
above 1994. The gains in operating income reflect
reductions in operating expenses in both North
America and Europe. This lower Ocost to serveO is
essential to BowmanOs strategy of penetrating
targeted markets and large customers where
competitive pricing is a key to success. Also
during 1996, the U.S. and Canadian operations were
integrated into a single, more effective sales and
service organization that is expected to have an
even greater impact on 1997 results.

Barnes Aerospace segment sales were $103.1 million
in 1996, up 6% from 1995, which followed an
increase of 18% from 1994. Sharply higher sales
were reported by the groupOs Repair and Overhaul
business in 1996. The Precision Machining business
also reported sales growth, while sales from the
Advanced Fabrications business were slightly lower
than in 1995. Sales growth in 1995 was driven
primarily by the Advanced Fabrications and
Precision Machining businesses.

Barnes Aerospace operating income was $5.3 million
in 1996 compared to $5.0 million in 1995. In 1994,
the group reported an operating loss of $1.8
million. The increase in 1996 profits reflects the
increased sales volume. The sharply higher

profits in 1995 compared to 1994 reflect the
higher sales volume, increased gross margins and
lower operating costs as a percentage of sales.

NON-OPERATING INCOME/EXPENSE

Other income was $4.1 million in 1996, $4.4
million in 1995 and $4.6 million in 1994. Other
income includes $1.6 million, $1.9 million and
$2.3 million from the companyOs investment in
NASCO, a company jointly owned with NHK Spring
Co., Ltd. of Japan. The 1996 decrease in NASCO
profits reflects increased costs, primarily
interest and depreciation, associated with a major
capacity expansion to meet increased customer
requirements for automotive suspension springs.
Interest income, another component of other
income, was $1.2 million in 1996 compared to $1.4
million in 1995 and $1.3 million in 1994.

Interest expense was consistent over the three
years reflecting comparable borrowing levels and a
relatively stable interest rate environment.

Other expenses decreased in 1996 following an
increase in 1995, primarily due to foreign
exchange and translation losses. These losses were
$0.8 million, $1.1 million and $0.5 million in
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

INCOME TAXES

The companyOs effective income tax rate has
declined steadily over the last three years. The
companyOs effective tax rate was 37.7% in 1996
compared with 39.5% in 1995 and 40.1% in 1994. The
lower rate in 1996 was due in part to lower
foreign losses without tax benefit and higher
foreign income with tax rates lower than the U.S.
statutory tax rate. For further discussion of
income taxes, see Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 20.

NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE

Consolidated net income was $32.6 million in 1996,
$27.5 million in 1995 and $20.3 million in 1994.
On a per share basis, income for 1996 was $4.90,
compared to $4.20 in 1995 and $3.20 in 1994. This
marks the second consecutive year of record
earnings.

INFLATION

Management believes that inflation during the 1994-
1996 period did not have a material impact on the
companyOs historical financial statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The companyOs ability to generate cash from
operations in excess of its capital investment and
dividend requirements is one of its leading
financial strengths. Management anticipates that
operating activities in 1997 will continue to
provide sufficient cash flows to capitalize on
opportunities for business expansion and to meet
all of the companyOs financial commitments.

Management assesses the companyOs liquidity in
terms of its overall ability to generate cash to
fund its operating and investing activities. Of
particular importance in the management of
liquidity are cash flows generated from operating
activities, capital expenditure levels, dividends,
effective utilization of surplus cash positions
overseas and adequate bank lines of credit.

Operating activities are the principal source of
cash flow for the company, generating nearly $46
million of cash flow in 1996 after a record $47
million in 1995. During the past three years,
operating activities provided over $130 million of
cash which the company used, in part, to pay
dividends to stockholders and fund significant
investments in plant and equipment.

CLEVELAND, OHIO]

Investing activities used cash of $32 million in
1996 compared with $37 million in 1995 and $31
million in 1994. Capital expenditures of $34
million in 1996 approached the record level of $36
million in 1995. During the past three years, the
company has invested over $100 million in new
plant and equipment with nearly $70 million of
that invested at Associated Spring. The focus of
these investments is plant and equipment to
support business growth and to improve
productivity and quality. The company expects 1997
capital spending to continue at a strong pace.

Financing activities include net borrowings,
dividend payments and stock transactions. In 1996,
the companyOs financing activities used cash of $7
million compared to $14 million in 1995. The
higher usage of cash in 1995 was due, in part, to
a $7 million debt reduction. In 1996, the annual
cash dividend per share was increased from $1.60
to $1.80. As a result, total cash dividends paid
to stockholders increased to $12 million.

The company has and will continue to utilize
surplus cash from foreign subsidiaries to fund
worldwide cash requirements when it is cost
effective to do so. The repatriation of certain
cash balances to the U.S. could have adverse tax
consequences; however, those balances are
generally available to fund ordinary business
needs worldwide.

To supplement internal cash generation, the
company maintains substantial bank borrowing
facilities. At December 31, 1996, the company had
$150 million of borrowing capacity available under
a revolving credit agreement that expires in 2001.
In addition, the company has available $130
million in uncommitted, short-term bank credit
lines, of which $7.5 million was in use at
December 31, 1996. During 1996 and 1995, the
company maintained long-term debt of $70 million
comprised, in part, of borrowings under its short-
term bank credit lines backed by its long-term
revolving credit agreement. The company considers
this a cost effective way to manage its long-term
financing needs. The company believes its bank
credit facilities coupled with cash generated from
operations are adequate for its anticipated future
requirements.

(All dollar amounts included in the notes are
stated in thousands except per share data and the
tables in Note 14.)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

GENERAL: The preparation of financial statements
requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CONSOLIDATION: The accompanying consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of the
company and all of its subsidiaries. Intercompany
transactions and account balances have been
eliminated. The company accounts for its 45%
investment in the common stock of NASCO, an
automotive suspension spring company jointly owned
with NHK Spring Co., Ltd. of Japan, under the
equity method. Other income in the accompanying
income statements includes $1,550, $1,897 and
$2,314 for the years 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively, of income from the companyOs
investment in NASCO. During 1996, the company
received $709 in dividends from NASCO.

REVENUE RECOGNITION: Sales and related cost of
sales are recognized when products are shipped to
customers.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: All highly liquid
investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less are cash equivalents and are
carried at fair market value.

INVENTORIES: Inventories are valued at the lower
of cost or market. The last-in, first-out (LIFO)
method was used to accumulate the cost of all U.S.
inventories which represent 71% of total
inventories. The cost of foreign subsidiary
inventories was determined using the first-in,
first-out (FIFO) method.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is
provided using accelerated methods over estimated
useful lives, ranging generally from 20 to 50
years for buildings and 3 to 17 years for
machinery and equipment. Maintenance and repairs
charged to expense were $16,179, $15,396 and
$16,341 in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

GOODWILL: Goodwill represents the excess purchase
price over the net assets of companies acquired in
business combinations. Goodwill acquired since
1970 is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years; similar investments for businesses
acquired prior to 1970 (approximately $5,200) are
not being amortized. On a periodic basis, the
company estimates future undiscounted cash flows
of the businesses to which goodwill relates to
ensure that the carrying value of goodwill has not
been impaired. Accumulated amortization was $8,175
and $7,588 at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Assets and
liabilities of foreign operations, except those in
countries with high rates of inflation, are
translated at year-end rates of exchange; revenue
and expenses are translated at average annual
rates of exchange. The resulting translation gains
and losses are reflected in foreign currency
translation adjustments within stockholdersO
equity.

For operations in countries that have high rates
of inflation, translation gains and losses are
included in net income. These losses, along with
those generated from foreign currency
transactions, were $826, $1,078 and $550 in 1996,
1995 and 1994, respectively.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION: The company applies APB
Opinion 25 to account for stock-based
compensation. The FASB issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
OAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation,O (FAS
123) effective for years beginning after December
15, 1995. Under the provisions of this accounting
standard, the company is not required to change
its method of accounting for stock-based
compensation. Had the company adopted FAS 123, the
impact on net income and income per share would
not have been significant.

INCOME PER COMMON SHARE: Income per common share
is based on the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the year. The effect of
common stock equivalents (stock options and
incentive stock rights) is not material. For
purposes of calculating income per share, Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares are considered
outstanding.

The 9.47% Notes are payable in thirteen semi-
annual payments of $3,077 beginning on September
16, 1995, while the 7.13% Notes are payable in
four equal installments of $6,250 beginning on
December 5, 2002. The fair values of these notes
are determined using discounted cash flows based
upon the companyOs estimated current interest rate
for similar types of borrowings.  The carrying
values of other long-term debt, notes payable and
the guaranteed ESOP obligation approximate their
fair value.

The company has a revolving credit agreement with
six banks that allows borrowings up to $150,000
under notes due December 6, 2001. A commitment fee
of .115% per annum is paid on the unused portion
of the commitments.
The company had no borrowings under this agreement
at December 31, 1996 and 1995.

The company has available $130,000 in uncommitted,
short-term bank credit lines, of which $7,500 and
$1,500 were in use at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. The interest rate on these
borrowings was 5.7% and 6.1% at December 31, 1996
and 1995.

The Industrial Revenue Bond, due in 2008, has a
variable interest rate. The interest rate on this
borrowing was 4.5% and 5.9% at December 31, 1996
and 1995, respectively.

At December 31, 1996, the company classified
$7,231 of borrowings under its lines of credit and
$6,154 of its 9.47% Notes due within one year as
long-term debt. The company has both the intent
and the ability, through its revolving credit
agreement, to refinance these amounts on a long-
term basis.

During 1996, the company had outstanding an
interest rate swap, a form of derivative, which
effectively converted $15,385 of its fixed rate
9.47% Notes to floating rate debt with interest
equal to LIBOR plus 83 basis points. The effective
interest rate on the floating rate portion was
6.4% and 6.7% at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively. This swap decreases as the Notes are
repaid. The fair value of the swap is determined
based upon current market prices and was $1,160 at
December 31, 1996. The company does not use
derivatives for trading purposes.

The company guaranteed $8,711 of letters of
credit, bank borrowings and capital lease
obligations related to its 45% investment in
NASCO. In addition, the company has other
outstanding letters of credit totaling $3,854 at
December 31, 1996.

Certain of the companyOs debt arrangements contain
requirements to maintain minimum levels of working
capital and net worth, which as a result, place
limitations on dividend payments and acquisitions
of the companyOs common stock. Under the most
restrictive covenant in any agreement, $52,104 was
available for dividends or acquisitions of common
stock at December 31, 1996.

Interest paid was $5,736, $5,661 and $5,626 in
1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively. Interest

A portion of the deferred income tax assets can be
realized through carrybacks and reversals of
existing taxable temporary differences with the
remainder, net of the valuation allowance,
dependent on future income. Management believes
that sufficient income will be earned in the
future to realize the remaining net deferred
income tax assets. The tax loss carryforwards have
remaining carryforward periods ranging from five
years to unlimited.

The company has not recognized deferred income
taxes on $78,733 of undistributed earnings of its
international subsidiaries since such earnings are
considered to be reinvested indefinitely. If the
earnings were distributed in the form of
dividends, the company would be subject to both
U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes.
Determination of the amount of this unrecognized
deferred income tax liability is not practicable.

7.  COMMON STOCK

In 1996, 1995 and 1994, 129,806, 167,779 and
135,692 shares of common stock were issued from
treasury for the exercise of stock options,
purchases by the Employee Stock Purchase Plan and
various other incentive awards. In 1996 and 1995,
the company acquired 20,604 and 42,236 shares of
the companyOs common stock from its Guaranteed
Stock Plan at a cost of $1,197 and $1,746,
respectively. These acquired shares were placed in
treasury.

In December 1996, the company adopted a new
stockholder rights plan.
The company had adopted a rights plan in 1986,
that expired earlier this year. Under the new
plan, each share of common stock contains one
right (Right) that entitles the holder to purchase
one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock, for two hundred
dollars. The Rights generally will not become
exercisable unless and until, among other things,
any person or group acquires beneficial ownership
of 35% or more of the outstanding stock. The new
Rights are generally redeemable at one cent per
Right at any time until 10 days following a public
announcement that a 35% or greater position in the
companyOs common stock has been acquired and will
expire, unless earlier redeemed or exchanged, on
December 23, 2006.

If, following the acquisition by a person or group
of 35% or more of the outstanding shares of the
companyOs common stock, the company is acquired in
a merger or other business combination or 50% or
more of the companyOs assets or earning power is
sold or transferred, each outstanding Right
becomes exercisable for common stock or other
securities of the acquiring entity having a value
of twice the exercise price of the Right.

8.  PREFERRED STOCK

At December 31, 1996 and 1995, the company had
3,000,000 shares of one dollar par value preferred
stock authorized, none of which were outstanding.

9.  STOCK PLANS

All U.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees
are eligible to participate in the companyOs
Guaranteed Stock Plan (GSP). The GSP provides for
the investment of employer and employee
contributions in the companyOs common stock. The
company guarantees a minimum rate of return on
certain GSP assets.

The GSP is a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership
Plan (ESOP). In 1989, the GSP purchased 579,310
shares of the companyOs common stock at a cost of
$21,000 using the proceeds of a loan guaranteed by
the company. These shares are held in trust and
are issued to employeesO accounts in the GSP as
the loan is repaid. Principal and interest on the
GSP loan are being paid in quarterly installments
through 1999. The loan bears interest based on
LIBOR. At December 31, 1996, the interest rate was
6.4%. Interest of $538, $747 and $653 was incurred
in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

Contributions and certain dividends received are
used in part by the GSP to service its debt.
Contributions include both employee contributions
up to a maximum of 10% of eligible pay and company
contributions.

The company contributions are equal to the amount
required by the Plan to pay the principal and
interest due under the Plan loan plus that
required to purchase any additional shares
required to be allocated to participant accounts,
less the sum of participant contributions and
dividends received by the GSP. The GSP used
$1,642, $1,459 and $1,323 of company dividends for
debt service in 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.
The company expenses all cash contributions made
to the GSP. Compensation expense was $1,666,
$2,019 and $2,268 in 1996, 1995 and 1994,
respectively. In addition to the company shares
held in trust, the GSP also purchases the
companyOs common stock on the open market to meet
its requirements. As of December 31, 1996, the GSP
held 1,149,622 shares of the companyOs common
stock, of which 165,855 shares were unallocated.

For financial statement purposes, the company
reflects its guarantee of the GSPOs debt as a
liability with a like amount reflected as a
reduction of stockholdersO equity.

The company has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan
under which eligible employees may elect to have
up to 10% of base compensation deducted from
payroll for the purchase of the companyOs common
stock at 85% of market value on the date of
purchase. The maximum number of shares which may
be purchased under the Plan is 675,000. During
1996, 17,845 shares (21,012 and 22,367 shares in
1995 and 1994, respectively) were purchased. As of
December 31, 1996, 204,026 shares may be issued in
the future.

The 1991 Barnes Group Stock Incentive Plan
authorizes the granting of incentives to officers
and other executives in the form of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, incentive stock rights
and performance unit awards. A predecessor plan
that provided for similar incentives expired in
1991. Options granted under that plan continue to
be exercisable and any options that terminate
without being exercised become available for grant
under the 1991 Plan. A maximum of 1,051,714 common
shares are subject to issuance under this plan
after December 31, 1996. As of December 31, 1996,
there were 583,630 shares available for future
grant (160,570 at December 31, 1995). Compensation
cost related to these plans was $904 and $128 in
1996 and 1994, respectively. No amount was
recorded in 1995.



Data relating to options granted under these plans

Incentive Stock Rights entitle the holder to
receive shares of the companyOs common stock
without payment, after the lapse of the incentive
period and subject to the satisfaction of
established performance goals. Additionally,
holders are credited with dividend equivalents,
which are converted into additional incentive
stock units, based on dividends paid on
outstanding shares. In 1996, 108,000 incentive
stock units were granted, of which 36,500 are
subject to performance goals. All units granted
have a five year incentive period. During 1996, an
additional 2,087 units were credited to holders
for dividend equivalents and 5,000 units were
forfeited.

10.  PENSION PLANS

The company has noncontributory defined benefit
pension plans covering a majority of its worldwide
employees at Associated Spring, Bowman
Distribution and at its Executive Office. Plan
benefits for salaried and non-union hourly

average salary. Plans covering union hourly
employees provide benefits based on years of
service. The company funds U.S. pension costs in

A deferred tax asset is included in the
accompanying balance sheet recognizing the future
tax benefit of the postretirement benefit
obligations (See Note 6).

Cash payments made in 1996, 1995 and 1994 for
postretirement benefits were $5,194, $5,210 and
$4,828, respectively.

The companyOs accumulated benefit obligations take
into account certain cost-sharing provisions. The
annual assumed rate of increase in the cost of
covered benefits (i.e., healthcare cost trend
rate) is assumed to be 9.0% for 1996, gradually
reducing to 5.0% by the year 2001. A one
percentage point increase in the assumed
healthcare cost trend rate would increase the
accumulated benefit obligations by approximately
$2,175 at December 31, 1996, and would have
increased 1996 expense by approximately $168.

Discount rates of 7.75%, 7.25% and 8.25% were used
in determining the accumulated benefit obligation
at December 31, 1996, 1995 and 1994, respectively.

12.  LEASES

The company has various noncancellable operating
leases for buildings, office space and equipment.
Capital leases were not significant. Rent expense
was $6,268, $5,866 and $6,072 for 1996, 1995 and
1994, respectively. During 1997, both Associated
Spring and Bowman Distribution will relocate to
new headquarters facilities under operating
leases. Minimum rental commitments under
noncancellable leases in years 1997 through 2001
are $3,327, $3,612, $2,268, $2,292, $2,420 and
$13,349 thereafter.

13.  SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On February 21, 1997, the Board of Directors
authorized, subject to stockholder approval, an
amendment to the CompanyOs Restated Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended, providing for an
increase in the number of shares of authorized
common stock from 20,000,000 to 60,000,000 and a
reduction in the par values of the common stock
and preferred stock from one dollar to one cent
per share (the OAmendmentO.) The Amendment is
being presented to stockholders for approval at
the companyOs April 2, 1997 Annual Meeting of
Stockholders. On February 21, 1997, the Board of
Directors also authorized (a) a three-for-one
stock split of the companyOs common stock in the
form of a 200% stock dividend for stockholders of
record on April 3, 1997, subject to stockholder
approval of the Amendment, and (b) the transfer
from stated capital to surplus of all capital in
excess of the aggregate par value of the companyOs
issued shares, subject to effectiveness of the
stock split. If the stock split is effected, the
number of shares of issued common stock will
triple, per share data for all periods presented
will decrease accordingly, adjustments will be
made to all outstanding stock options and other
stock-based awards and the Board-authorized
transfer from stated capital to surplus will
occur.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF
BARNES GROUP INC.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in stockholders'
equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of
Barnes Group Inc. and its subsidiaries at December
31, 1996 and 1995, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1996,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

<FN>
(1)  All per-share data, other than earnings per
     common share, are based on common shares
     outstanding at the end of each year. Earnings
     per common share are based on weighted
     average common shares outstanding during each
     year.
(2)  Includes a $3.4 million pretax, $2.0 million
     after-tax charge ($.33 per share) against
     income related to the plant consolidation and
     work force reduction at Barnes Aerospace and
     a $1.5 million charge without tax benefit
     ($.24 per share) for a plant consolidation at
     Associated SpringOs Mexican operations.
(3)  Includes a $17.8 million pretax, $10.7
     million after-tax charge ($1.73 per share)
     against income related to the costs of plant
     closings at Associated Spring, Barnes
     Aerospace charges on a terminated contract
     and restructuring of Bowman U.S. sales
     organization. These charges were partially
     offset by a $5.0 million pretax gain, $3.7
     million after-tax ($.60 per share) from the
     sale of BowmanOs Pioneer division.
(4)  Barnes Group adopted three new accounting
     standards in 1992 retroactive to the
     beginning of the year. Included is a one-time
     $39.7 million after-tax charge ($6.41 per
     share) to comply with FAS 106 and 112 which
     changes the accounting for certain
     postretirement and postemployment benefits to
     the accrual method and an additional $1.0
     million income tax charge ($.15 per share)
     for FAS 109, which changed income tax
     accounting.
