          Item 1.   Business.
                    ---------
                    The Company  is in  three businesses:   Bowman  Distri-
          bution,  a  distributor  of  consumable  repair  and  replacement
          products for  industrial,  heavy  equipment,  and  transportation
          maintenance  markets;  Associated  Spring,  a  manufacturer   and
          distributor of  custom-made springs  and  other  close -tolerance
          engineered metal components; and Barnes Aerospace, a manufacturer
          of precision machined and fabricated assemblies for the  aircraft
          and  aerospace  industries  and  a  refurbisher  of  jet   engine
          components.*

                    Bowman Distribution.  Bowman Distribution is engaged in
                    -------------------
          distributing in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and
          France  a  variety  of  replacement  parts  and  other  products,
          including fasteners  and  special  purpose  hardware,  automotive
          parts, automotive  specialties and  accessories, general  purpose
          electric  and  gas   welding  supplies,  industrial   maintenance
          supplies, and industrial aerosols such as adhesives,  lubricants,
          and sealants.

                    The products sold by  Bowman Distribution are, for  the
          most part, not manufactured by the Company, but are obtained from
          a number of outside suppliers.  The vast majority of the products
          are repackaged and sold under Bowman's labels.

                    Sales by Bowman Distribution  in the United States  and
          Canada are primarily  to industrial and  food processing  plants,
          chemical and petrochemical process industries,  contractors, new
          car dealers,  garages,  service stations,  operators  of  vehicle
          fleets,  railroads,  electric   utilities,  and  airline   ground
          maintenance facilities.

                    In 1992,  the Company  sold  substantially all  of  the
          assets of the Pioneer division of Bowman.

                    Associated Spring.  Associated Spring manufactures and
                    -----------------
          distributes a wide variety of  custom metal parts for  mechanical
          purposes.  It is  equipped to produce  practically every type  of
          spring requiring precision engineering,  as well as an  extensive
          variety of precision metal components and assemblies.  Its


          -----------------------
                    *As used in this annual report, "Company" refers to the
          registrant and  its consolidated  subsidiaries except  where  the
          context requires  otherwise,  and  "Associated  Spring,"  "Barnes
          Aerospace," and "Bowman Distribution" refer to the  above-defined
          businesses, but not to separate corporate entities.

                                        - 1 -

          products range in size from  fine hairsprings for instruments  to
          large springs  for heavy  machinery, and  its output  of a  given
          metal part  may  vary in  amount  from  a few  units  to  several
          million.  Associated Spring does not produce leaf springs or  bed
          springs.

                    Associated Spring's custom metal parts are sold in  the
          United States and through  the Company's foreign subsidiaries  to
          manufacturers in many industries,  chiefly for use as  components
          in their own  products.  Custom  metal parts  are sold  primarily
          through Associated  Spring's sales  employees.   In view  of  the
          diversity of  functions which  Associated Spring's  custom  metal
          parts perform,  Associated Spring's  output is  characterized  by
          little standardization, with the major portion being manufactured
          to customer specifications.

                    The  automotive   and   automotive   parts   industries
          constitute Associated Spring's largest single custom metal  parts
          market.    Other  important  outlets  include  manufacturers   of
          industrial and textile machinery, motors, generators,  electronic
          equipment,  aircraft,  diesel   and  other  internal   combustion
          engines, household  appliances  and  fixtures,  hardware,  office
          equipment, agricultural  equipment, railroad  equipment,  general
          machinery, and scientific instruments.

                    The Associated Spring Distribution division is  engaged
          in the distribution of  industrial products to  the tool and  die
          market, of which die springs manufactured primarily by Associated
          Spring are  the  principal item.    It also  distributes  certain
          standard  parts  manufactured  by  Associated  Spring  consisting
          primarily of stock wire and flat springs which are sold under the
          Company's SPEC registered trademark.

                    Associated Spring also has manufacturing operations  in
          Brazil,  Canada,   Mexico,   and  Singapore,   and   distribution
          operations in  the  United Kingdom  and  France.   In  1993,  the
          Company  closed  its  spring  manufacturing  plant  in   Memphis,
          Tennessee and transferred the  warehouse operations conducted  in
          Corry, Pennsylvania to a new warehouse facility  located  in
          Ypsilanti, Michigan.  In 1994, it closed its spring manufacturing
          plants in  Gardena,  California,  and  Monterrey,  Mexico.    The
          Company has retained  a minority interest  of 15%  in its  former
          subsidiary in Argentina.

                    The Company is a partner in a joint venture corporation
          in the United  States with NHK  Spring Co., Ltd.  of Japan.  The
          joint  venture  corporation,  NHK-Associated  Spring  Suspension
          Components  Inc.  ("NASCO"), has a manufacturing facility in
          Bowling Green,  Kentucky.   It manufactures  and sells  hot-wound
          coil springs for automotive suspension systems and counterbalance
          torque bars  for  trunk  lids.   Barnes  Group  owns  a  minority
          interest of 45% in NASCO.

                    Barnes Aerospace.  Barnes Aerospace is engaged in the
                    ----------------
          advanced fabrication and  precision machining  of components  for
          jet engines and airframes as well  as the repair and overhaul  of
          jet engine components.  Windsor Manufacturing, Windsor Airmotive,
          and Advanced Fabrications constitute the Barnes Aerospace Group.

                    Windsor   Manufacturing   manufactures   machined   and
          fabricated parts as well  as assemblies.   It specializes in  the
          machining of difficult-to-process aircraft engine  superalloys. 
          Manufacturing processes include  computer numerically  controlled
          machining,  electrical  discharge   machining,  laser   drilling,
          creep-feed grinding, and automated deburring.  Customers  include
          gas turbine engine manufacturers for commercial and military jets
          as well as land-based turbines.  In 1993, the  operations of the
          Company's Central  Metal Products  plant were  consolidated  with
          Windsor Manufacturing.

                    Windsor  Airmotive  specializes  in  refurbishing   jet
          engine components.   Electron beam welding  and plasma spray  are
          two of the major processes used  in this division, and  customers
          include approximately 30 airlines worldwide and the military.  In
          1995, Windsor  Airmotive's  Singapore  operations  moved  into  a
          larger facility.

                    Advanced Fabrications, through its Jet Die and  Flameco
          plants, specializes in hot  forming and fabricating titanium  and
          other high-temperature alloys such as  hastelloy and inconel for
          use in precision details and  assemblies for aircraft engine  and
          airframe  applications.    It  utilizes  advanced   manufacturing
          processes including superplastic forming and diffusion bonding.

                    Segment  Analysis.    The  analysis  of  the  Company's
                    -----------------
          revenue from sales to unaffiliated customers, operating income,
          and identifiable assets by industry segments and geographic areas
          appearing on pages 26 and 27 of the Company's 1995 Annual Report
          to Stockholders, included as Exhibit 13 to this report, is
          incorporated by reference.

                    Competition.  The Company competes with many other
                    -----------
          companies, large and small, engaged  in the manufacture and  sale
          of custom  metal parts  (including  aerospace components).  The
          Company  believes  Associated  Spring  is  the  largest  domestic
          manufacturer of precision springs used for mechanical purposes. 
          The Company also faces active competition in the products sold by
          Bowman Distribution.   The principal methods  of competition  for
          the Company's three businesses  include service, quality,  price,
          reliability of supply, and also, in the case of Associated Spring
          and Barnes Aerospace, technology and design.

                    Backlog.  The backlog of the Company's orders believed
                    -------
          to be firm amounted to $111,125,000 at the end of 1995, as 
          compared with $108,143,000 at the end of 1994.  Of the 1995 year-
          end backlog, $54,411,000 is attributable to the Barnes  Aerospace
          Group and all of  the balance is  attributable to the  Associated
          Spring Group.   $3,601,000 of Barnes  Aerospace's backlog is  not
          expected to be shipped in 1996.  Substantially all of the remainder
          of the Company's backlog is expected to be shipped during 1996.

                    Raw Materials and Customers.  None of the Company's
                    ---------------------------
          divisions or groups are dependent upon any single source for  any
          of their principal raw materials or products for resale, and  all
          such materials  and  products  are readily  available.    No  one
          customer accounted for  more than 10%  of total sales  in 1995.  
          Automotive manufacturers and manufacturers of electronic products
          are important customers of Associated  Spring.  Sales  by Barnes
          Aerospace to two domestic jet engine manufacturers accounted  for
          approximately 52% of  its business.   Bowman Distribution is  not
          dependent on any one or a few customers for a significant portion
          of its sales.

                    Research and Development.  Although most of the products
                    ------------------------
          manufactured  by  the  Company  are  custom  parts  made  to  the
          customers' specifications, the Company  is engaged in  continuing
          efforts aimed at discovering and implementing new knowledge  that
          is useful in  developing new  products or  services or  improving
          significantly an existing product or service.  The Company  spent
          approximately  $3,087,000   on  its   research  and   development
          activities in 1995, as compared to expenditures of  approximately
          $2,640,000 in  1994  and  $1,846,000 in  1993.    There  were  no
          significant   customer-sponsored    research   and    development
          activities in 1995  and 1994.   Barnes Aerospace divisions  spent
          approximately $495,000 in 1993 on customer-sponsored research and
          development activities.

                    Patents and Trademarks.  Patents, licenses, franchises
                    ----------------------
          and  concessions  are  not  material  to  any  of  the  Company's
          businesses.

                    Employees.  As of the date of this report, the Company
                    ---------
          employs approximately 3,900 persons.

                    Environmental Laws.  Compliance with federal, state, and
                    ------------------
          local laws  which have  been enacted  or adopted  regulating  the
          discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
          to the  protection of  the environment  has  not had  a  material
          effect and is  not expected to  have a material  effect upon  the
          capital expenditures, earnings,  or competitive  position of the
          Company.

          Item 2.   Properties.
                    ----------
                    The Company  and  its Canadian  subsidiary  operate  12
          manufacturing plants  and  15  warehouses  at  various  locations
          throughout the  United States  and Canada,  of which  all of  the
          plants and 6 of the warehouses  are owned in fee, and the  others
          are leased.  Of the properties  which are owned, none is  subject
          to any encumbrance.  The Company's other foreign subsidiaries own
          or lease plant  or warehouse  facilities in  the countries  where
          their operations  are conducted.   The  listing of  the  facility
          locations of each  of the Company's  businesses contained in  the
          Directory of  Operations on  the inside  back cover  of the  1995
          Annual Report to  Stockholders, included  as Exhibit  13 to  this
          report, is incorporated by reference.

                    The  Company  believes  that   its  owned  and   leased
          properties have been adequately  maintained, are in  satisfactory
          operating condition, are suitable  and adequate for the  business
          activities conducted  therein,  and  have  productive  capacities
          sufficient to meet current needs.

          Item 3.   Legal Proceedings.

                       REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS ON
                           FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE


          To the Board of Directors
          of Barnes Group Inc.


          Our audits  of the  consolidated financial  statements for  the
          years ended  December 31,  1995 and  1994  referred to  in  our
          report dated January 23, 1996 appearing on page 28 of the  1995
          Annual Report  to  Stockholders  of Barnes  Group  Inc.  (which
          report and consolidated  financial statements are  incorporated
          by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) also  included
          an audit  of the  Financial Statement  Schedule for  the  years
          ended December 31, 1995 and 1994  listed in Item 14(a) of  this
          Form 10-K.  In our  opinion, this Financial Statement  Schedule
          presents fairly, in all material respects, the information  set
          forth  therein  when  read  in  conjunction  with  the  related
          consolidated financial statements.  The financial statements of
          Barnes Group Inc.  for the year  ended December  31, 1993  were
          audited by  other independent  accountants whose  report  dated
          January 28,  1994 expressed  an  unqualified opinion  on  those
          statements.

                 REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS


          The Stockholders and Board of Directors
          Barnes Group Inc.

          We  have  audited  the   consolidated  statements  of   income,
          stockholders' equity and  cash flows of  Barnes Group Inc.  for
          the year ended December 31, 1993.  Our audit also included  the
          financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item  14(a)
          for  the  year  ended  December  31,  1993.    These  financial
          statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
          management.  Our  responsibility is  to express  an opinion  on
          these financial statements based on our audit.

          We conducted our  audit in accordance  with generally  accepted
          auditing standards.  Those standards  require that we plan  and
          perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about  whether
          the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
          audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  supporting
          the amounts and  disclosures in the  financial statements.   An
          audit also includes  assessing the  accounting principles  used
          and significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as
          evaluating the overall  financial statement  presentation.   We
          believe that  our audit  provides a  reasonable basis  for  our
          opinion.

          In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements  referred
          to  above  present  fairly,  in  all  material  respects,   the
          consolidated results  of operations  and cash  flows of  Barnes
          Group Inc. for the year ended December 31, 1993, in  conformity
          with generally accepted  accounting principles.   Also, in  our
          opinion,  the  related   financial  statement  schedule,   when
          considered in relation to the basic financial statements  taken
          as a  whole,  presents  fairly in  all  material  respects  the
          information set forth therein.

            SECTION 1.  Annual Meetings.

                      The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
                 Corporation for the election of directors and for the
                 transaction of such other business as may properly come
                 before the meeting shall be held at 10:30 A.M. on the first
                 Wednesday in April of each year or on such other date or

                      Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at
                 any time by the Chairman, the President or the Board of
                 Directors.  (As used in these by-laws, the term "Chairman"

            SEC. 4.  Notice of Meetings.

                      Except as otherwise provided by statute, notice of each
                 meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special,
                 shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
                 vote thereat, not less than ten days before the day on which
                 the meeting is to be held, by delivering a written or
                 printed notice thereof to him personally or by posting such
                 notice in a postage prepaid envelope addressed to him at his
                 last known post-office address.  Except as otherwise
                 provided by statute, no publication of any notice of a
                 meeting of the stockholders shall be required.  Every notice
                 of a special meeting of stockholders, besides stating the
                 time and place of the meeting, shall state briefly the
                 objects thereof and no business other than that specified in
                 such notice and matters germane thereto shall be presented
                 at such meeting, except with the unanimous consent in
                 writing of the holders of all the outstanding shares of the
                 Corporation entitled to vote thereon.  Nevertheless, notice
                 of any meeting shall not be required to be given to any
                 stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or by
                 proxy; and if any stockholder shall waive notice of any
                 meeting in person or by attorney thereunto authorized in
                 writing or by telegraph, notice thereof need not be given to
                 him.  Notice of any adjourned meeting of stockholders shall
                 not be required to be given.

       SEC. 5.  Quorum.

                 At each meeting of stockholders the holders of record
            of a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote

                                       2

<PAGE>
            at such meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
            shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for
            the transaction of business; provided that any number of
            stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or
            represented by proxy at any annual election of directors,
            though holding less than a majority of the shares out-
            standing and entitled to vote at such election, may elect
            the directors.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority in
            interest of the stockholders entitled to vote, present in
            person or represented by proxy, or, if no such stockholder
            is present or represented, any officer entitled to preside
            or act as Secretary of such meeting, may adjourn the meeting
            from time to time.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a
            quorum may be present, any business may be transacted which
            might have been transacted at the meeting as originally
            called.

       SEC. 6.  Voting.

                 The Secretary or other officer who has charge of the
            stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least ten days
            before every election of directors, a complete list of the
            stockholders entitled to vote at said election, arranged in
            alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
            stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name
            of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the
            examination of any stockholder during ordinary business
            hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the
            election, either at a place within the city, town or village
            where the election is to be held and which place shall be

                                       3
<PAGE>

                 specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so
                 specified, at the place where said meeting is to be held,
                 and the list shall be produced and kept at the time and
                 place of election during the whole time thereof, and subject
                 to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

                      Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
                 Incorporation or these By-Laws, each stockholder shall at
                 every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in
                 person or by proxy for each share of stock held by such
                 stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three
                 years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer
                 period.  Except where the transfer books of the Corporation
                 shall have been closed or a date shall have been fixed as a
                 record date for the determination of its stockholders
                 entitled to vote, as provided in Section 5 of Article VII of
                 these By-Laws, no share of stock shall be voted on at any
                 election for directors which shall have been transferred on
                 the books of the Corporation within twenty days next pre-
                 ceding such election.  Persons holding shares in a fiduciary
                 capacity shall be entitled to vote the shares so held.  At
                 all meetings of the stockholders all matters, other than
                 those the manner of deciding which is expressly regulated by
                 statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these
                 By-Laws, shall be decided by the vote of a majority in
                 interest of the stockholders present in person or
                 represented by proxy and entitled to vote, a quorum being
                 present.  The vote for directors shall be by ballot.

                 meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of
                 the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs; and (b)

                 any other information relating to such stockholder that

                 the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.

                            ARTICLE II:  BOARD OF DIRECTORS

            SECTION 1.  General Powers.

                      The property, affairs and business of the Corporation
                 shall be managed by the Board of Directors.

            SEC. 2.  Number, Classification, Term of Office, and            
                     Qualifications.

                      The number of directors to constitute the whole Board
                 of Directors shall be nine, but such number may from time to
                 time be increased, or diminished to not less than three, by
                 resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.  The Board of
                 Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly
                 equal in number as may be, with the term of office of one
                 class expiring each year.  At the annual meeting of
                 stockholders in 1970, directors of the first class shall be
                 elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next
                 succeeding annual meeting, directors of the second class
                 shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the
                 second succeeding annual meeting and directors of the third
                 class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at
                 the third succeeding annual meeting.  At each annual meeting
                 of stockholders after 1970, successors to the directors
                 whose terms shall then expire shall be elected to hold
                 office for terms expiring at the third succeeding annual
                 meeting, except that any director elected to a directorship
                 newly created since the last annual meeting shall hold
                 office for the same term as the other directors of the class
                 to which such director has been assigned.  When the number

                                            11
<PAGE>

                 of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or
                 any decrease in directorships shall be so assigned among the
                 classes by the Board of Directors as to make all classes as
                 nearly equal in number as may be.  Each director shall
                 continue in office until his successor shall have been
                 elected and qualified or until his death or until his
                 resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided. 
                 No director need be a stockholder, nor a resident of the
                 State of Delaware.

            SEC. 3.  Election of Directors.

                      At each meeting of the stockholders for the election of
                 directors, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of
                 the votes given at such election.

            SEC. 4.  Place of Meetings, etc.

                      The directors may hold their meetings and have one or
                 more offices, and keep the books of the Corporation, outside
                 of Delaware, at the office or place of business of the
                 Corporation in the City of Bristol, Connecticut, or at such
                 other places as they may from time to time determine.

            SEC. 5.  Time of Meetings, Notices, etc.

                      There shall be a meeting of the Board of Directors for
                 organization, for the election of officers and for the
                 transaction of such other business as may properly come
                 before the meeting on the date of the annual meeting of
                 stockholders or within thirty days thereafter upon the
                 notice hereinafter provided for a special meeting.  The

<PAGE>

                 directors may, however, without notice, hold such meeting in
                 the city where the annual meeting of stockholders is held
                 and immediately following such annual meeting of stock-
                 holders.  At the organizational meeting, the Directors shall
                 elect one of the directors as Chairman of the Board of
                 Directors.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in
                 his/her absence, the Chairman of the Board's Executive
                 Committee, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of
                 Directors.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in
                 his/her absence, the chief executive officer of the Company,
                 shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders.  The
                 Chairman of the Board of Directors may be removed as
                 Chairman of the Board of Directors at any time by the Board
                 of Directors.  The Board of Directors by resolution may
                 provide for the holding of regular meetings and may fix the
                 time of holding such meetings.  Such regular meetings of the
                 Board of Directors may be held without notice.  Special
                 meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the
                 Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Chairman, the
                 President or any three directors.  Unless otherwise
                 specified in the notice or waiver of notice thereof, all
                 meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at the
                 office of the Corporation in Bristol, Connecticut.  Notice
                 of each special meeting shall be mailed to each director
                 addressed to him at his residence or usual place of business
                 at least seven days before the day on which the meeting is
                 to be held or shall be sent to him at such place by
                 telegraph, or telephoned or delivered to him personally, not
                 later than three days before the day on which the meeting is

                                            13
<PAGE>

                 to be held, unless the Chairman of the Board of Directors,
                 the Chairman or the President determines that circumstances
                 require that a meeting be held on shorter notice.  Notice of
                 any meeting need not be given to any director, however, if
                 waived by him in writing or by telegraph.  Any meeting of
                 the Board of Directors shall be a legal meeting without any
                 notice thereof having been given if all the directors shall
                 be present thereat.

            SEC. 6.  Quorum and Manner of Acting.

                      A majority of the directors at the time in office (but
                 not less than one-third of the number necessary to
                 constitute the whole Board) at a meeting duly assembled
                 shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for
                 the transaction of business, subject, however, to the
                 provisions of Section 9 of this Article II.  Except as
                 otherwise provided by law or in these By-Laws, the act of a
                 majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a
                 quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of
                 Directors.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the
                 directors present at any meeting may adjourn the meeting
                 from time to time until a quorum be had.  Notice of any
                 adjourned meeting need not be given.  The directors shall
                 act only as a Board and the individual directors shall have
                 no power as such.

            SEC. 7.  Resignations.

                      Any director may resign at any time by giving written
                 notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman, the

                                            14
<PAGE>

                 President or the Secretary.  Such resignation shall take
                 effect at the time specified therein; and unless otherwise
                 specified therein the acceptance of such resignation shall
                 not be necessary to make it effective.

            SEC. 8.  Removal of Directors.

                      Any director may be removed at any time for cause, at
                 a meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, by the
                 affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds
                 of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation
                 entitled to vote in elections of directors, considered for
                 the purposes of this Section 8 as one class.

            SEC. 9.  Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships.

                      Any vacancy occurring among the directors by death,
                 resignation, removal or otherwise and any newly created
                 directorships may be filled by a majority of the directors
                 then in office, though less than a quorum, or, in the event
                 such directors are unable to act, by the stockholders.  Each
                 director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the
                 unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 
                 Each director elected to a newly created directorship shall
                 hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders.

            chairman, may attend a committee meeting in the place of a
            regular member who is unable to attend.  When attending in
            the place of regular members, alternate members shall have
            all the powers of regular members and their presence shall
            be included in the determination of whether a quorum exists.

       SEC. 2.  Powers of the Executive Committee.
                 During the intervals between the meetings of the Board
            of Directors, the Executive Committee shall possess and may
            exercise the powers of the Board of Directors, in the
            management of the business and affairs of the Corporation,
            and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed
            to all papers which may require it.

            secretary of such committee, may fix its own rules of
            procedure and may meet at such place or places and at such
            time or times as the committee from time to time shall
            determine.  Each such committee shall cause its proceedings
            to be recorded, and the minutes of committee meetings shall
            be distributed to the Board of Directors.

       SEC. 4.  Quorum and Manner of Acting.

                 A majority of the number of regular members of any
            committee of the Board of Directors shall constitute a quorum
            thereof for the transaction of business and the act of a
            majority of those present at a meeting thereof at which a
            quorum shall be present shall be the act of such committee.
            The members of any such committee shall act only1 as a committee
            and the individual members thereof shall have no powers as such.

       SEC. 5.  Removal.

                 Any member of any committee of the Board of Directors,
            may be removed at any time by a vote of the majority of the

            Directors at which a quorum is present.

       SEC. 6.  Vacancies.

            authorize.

       SEC. 2.  Indemnification.

            (a)  Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to
                 be made a party to or is involved in any action, suit
                 or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
                 or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
                 reason of the fact that he/she, or a person of whom
                 he/she is the legal representative, is or was a
                 director or officer of the Corporation or is or was

<PAGE>


                 proceeding is alleged action or inaction in an official
                 capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a
                 director, officer, employee or agent, shall be indemnified
                 and held harmless by the Corporation to the fullest extent
                 permitted by the laws of Delaware, as the same exist or may
                 hereafter be amended, against all costs, charges, expenses,
                 liabilities and losses (including attorneys' fees,
                 judgments, fines, employee benefit plan excise taxes or
                 penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement
                 reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection
                 therewith, and such indemnification shall continue as to a
                 person who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or
                 agent and shall inure to the benefit of his/her heirs,
                 executors and administrators; provided, however, that,
                 except as provided in subdivision (b) of this Section 2, the
                 Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking
                 indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
                 thereof) initiated by such person only if such proceeding
                 (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.  The right to
                 indemnification conferred in this Section 2 shall include
                 the right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses
                 incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of its
                 final disposition; provided, however, that, if the Delaware
                 General Corporation Law requires, the payment of such
                 expenses incurred by a director or officer in his/her
                 capacity as a director or officer (and not in any other
                 capacity in which service was or is rendered by such person

                                       27
<PAGE>

                 while a director or officer, including, without limitation,
                 service to any employee benefit plan) in advance of the
                 final disposition of a proceeding, shall be made only upon
                 delivery to the Corporation of an undertaking, by or on
                 behalf of such director or officer, to repay all amounts so
                 advanced if it shall ultimately be determined that such
                 director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under
                 this subdivision (a) or otherwise.  The Corporation may, by
                 action of the Board, provide indemnification to employees
                 and agents of the Corporation with the same scope and effect
                 as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers.

            (b)  If a claim under subdivision (a) of this Section 2 is
                 not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days
                 after a written claim has been received by the
                 Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter
                 bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
                 unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole
                 or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
                 also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall
                 be a defense to any such action (other than an action
                 brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in
                 defending any proceeding in advance of its final
                 disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
                 required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that
                 the claimant has failed to meet a standard of conduct
                 which makes it permissible under the Delaware law for

                                       28
<PAGE>

                 the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
                 amount claimed.  Neither the failure of the Corporation
                 (including the Board, independent legal counsel, or its
                 stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
                 commencement of such action that indemnification of the
                 claimant is permissible in the circumstances because
                 he/she has met such standard of conduct, nor an actual
                 determination by the Corporation (including the Board,
                 independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that
                 the claimant has not met such standard of conduct,
                 shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption
                 that the claimant has failed to meet such standard of

                 provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws,
                 agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
                 directors or otherwise.

                 on his behalf in connection therewith.

            (f)  The Corporation may enter into agreements with any
                 director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation

       SECTION 1.  Certificate of Stock.

                 Every holder of stock in the Corporation shall be
            entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of
            the Corporation by, the Chairman, the President or a Vice
            President, and the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or
            the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, certifying the
            number of shares owned by him/her in the Corporation.  Any
            of or all the signatures on the certificate may be a
            facsimile.  In case of any officer, transfer agent or
            registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has
            been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such
            officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate
            is issued, the certificate may be issued by the Corporation
            with the same effect as if he/she were such officer,
            transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 
            Certificates representing shares of stock of the Corporation
            shall be in such form as shall be approved by the Board of
            Directors.  There shall be entered upon the stock books of
            the Corporation at the time of issuance of each share the

            owning the shares and the date of issuance thereof.

       SEC. 2.  Transfer of Stock.

                 Transfer of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be
            made on the books of the Corporation by the holder of record
            thereof, or by his/her attorney thereunto duly authorized by

                                       35
<PAGE>

            a power of attorney duly executed in writing and filed with
            the Secretary of the Corporation or any of its transfer
            agents, and on surrender of the certificate or certificates
            representing such shares.  The Corporation and its transfer
            agents and registrars, if any, shall be entitled to treat
            the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the
            absolute owner thereof for all purposes, and accordingly
            shall not be bound to recognize any legal, equitable or
            other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the
            part of any other person whether or not it or they shall
            have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise
            expressly provided by the statutes of the State of Delaware;
            provided, however, that whenever any transfer of shares
            shall be made for collateral security and not absolutely,
            and written notice thereof shall be given to the Secretary
            of the Corporation or to any of its transfer agents, such
            fact shall be expressed in the entry of the transfer.

       SEC. 3.  Lost or Destroyed Certificates.

                 The holder of any shares of the Corporation shall
            immediately notify the Corporation of any loss or
            destruction of the certificate therefor.  The Corporation
            may issue a new certificate in the place of any certificate
            theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost or
            destroyed, but the Board of Directors or Executive Committee
            may require the owner of the lost or destroyed certificate
            or his/her legal representatives to give a bond in such sum,
            not exceeding double the value of the shares, and with such
            surety or sureties, as it may direct, to indemnify the

                                       36

            Corporation and its transfer agents and registrars of
            transfers, if any, against any claim that may be made
            against it on account of the alleged loss or destruction of
            any such certificate or the issuance of such new
            certificate.

       SEC. 4.  Regulations.

                  The Board of Directors may make such rules and
            regulations as it may deem expedient concerning the
            issuance, transfer and registration of certificates for
            shares of the stock of the Corporation.  It may appoint
            transfer agents or registrars of transfers, or both, and may
            require all certificates of stock to bear the signature of
            either or both.

       SEC. 5.  Closing of Transfer Books and Fixing of Record Date.

                 The Board of Directors shall have power to close the
            stock transfer books of the Corporation for a period not
            exceeding seventy days preceding the date of any meeting of
            stockholders or the date for payment of any dividend or the
            date for the allotment of rights or the date when any change
            or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into
            effect; provided, however, that in lieu of closing the stock
            transfer books as aforesaid, the Board of Directors may fix
            in advance a date, not exceeding seventy days preceding the
            date of any meeting of stockholders or the date for the
            payment of any dividend, or the date for the allotment of
            rights, or the date when any change or conversion or

            date for the determination of the stockholders entitled to
            notice of, and to vote at, any such meeting, or entitled to
            receive payment of any such dividend, or to any such
            allotment of rights, or to exercise the rights in respect of
            any such change, conversion or exchange of capital stock,
            and in such case only such stockholders as shall be
            stockholders of record on the date so fixed shall be enti-
            tled to such notice of, and to vote at, such meeting, or to
            receive payment of such dividend, or to receive such
            allotment or rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case
            may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the
            books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed as
            aforesaid.

                    NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and
          the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree

          references in the Rights Agreement (and in any Exhibit thereto)
          to "The Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, National Association"
          shall be deemed to be amended to be references to "Mellon Bank,
          N.A."

                    Section 3.  The legend set forth in Section 3(c) of the
          Rights Agreement is amended, effective as of the Appointment
          Time, to read in its entirety as follows:

               "This certificate also evidences and entitles the holder
               hereof to certain Rights as set forth in the Rights
               Agreement between Barnes Group Inc. (the 'Company') and

               which are hereby incorporated herein by reference and a copy
               of which is on file at the principal offices of the Company.
               Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights
               Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate
               certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this
               certificate.  The Company will mail to the holder of this
               certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement, as in effect on
               the date of mailing, without charge, promptly after receipt
               of a written request therefor."

                    Section 4.  Section 21 of the Rights Agreement is
          amended, effective as of the Appointment Time, to add immediately
          after each use of the word "Connecticut" the phrase "or the
          Commonwealth of Pennsylvania."

                    Section 5.  Section 25 of the Rights Agreement is
          amended, effective as of the Appointment Time, by replacing the
          words:

               "The Connecticut Bank and Trust Company, National
               Association
               One Constitution Plaza
               Hartford, Connecticut  06115
               Attention:  Stock Transfer Department"

               Attention:  Corporate Trust Group"

                    Section 6.  Effective as of the Appointment Time, CBT
          shall no longer be a Rights Agent for any purposes of the Rights
          Agreement, and its agreement or consent shall not be required for
          any amendment thereto or in connection with any action taken
          thereunder.  The parties hereto agree that, effective as of the
          Appointment Time, Mellon shall be vested with the same powers,
          rights, duties, and responsibilities as if it had been originally
          named as a Rights Agent without further act or deed.  CBT agrees
          to deliver and transfer to Mellon any and all books, records,
          funds, certificates, documents, instruments and other property of
          any kind held by it under the Rights Agreement as of the
          Appointment Time and to execute and deliver any further
          assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose.

                    Section 7.  Except as expressly set forth herein, the
          Rights Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

          or on behalf of each of the parties hereto as of the day and year

          right at all times to sell or otherwise dispose of all or any
          part of the Notes under a registration under the Securities Act
          of 1933, as amended, or under a registration exemption available

          Notes to be purchased by you or if the conditions specified in

          relieved of all further obligations under this Agreement. 
          Nothing in this Section shall operate to relieve the Company from
          any of its obligations hereunder or to waive any of your rights

                     surrendered Note;

               (e)   the cost of obtaining the Private Placement Number
                     referred to in Section 3.6;

               (f)   all expenses, including attorneys, fees, relating to
                     any amendments or waivers pursuant to the provisions
                     hereof; and

               (g)   all costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees,
                     incurred by the holder of any Note in enforcing any

                     responding to any subpoena or other legal process
                     issued in connection with this Agreement or the
                     transactions contemplated hereby, including without
                     limitation, costs and expenses incurred in any
                     bankruptcy case.

               The Company will pay all taxes in connection with the
          issuance and sale of the Notes and in connection with any
          modification of the Notes and will save you harmless against any
          and all liabilities with respect to such taxes.  The obligations
          of the Company under this Section 1.5 shall survive the payment
          of the Notes and the termination of this Agreement.

          SECTION 2. WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS

          The Company warrants and represents to you as of the date hereof
          that:

          2.1  Subsidiaries.

               Exhibit C to this Agreement correctly identifies (i) each of
          the Company's active Subsidiaries (indicating which Subsidiaries
          are Domestic Subsidiaries), its jurisdiction of incorporation and
          the percentage of its voting stock owned by the Company and each
          other Subsidiary and (ii) each of the Company's Affiliates (other
          than Subsidiaries) which is a corporation or partnership or which
          is a holder of 5% or more of the voting stock of the Company and
          the nature of the affiliation.  The Company and each Subsidiary
          is the legal and beneficial owner of all of the shares of voting
          stock it purports to own of each Subsidiary, free and clear in
          each case of any Lien.  All such shares have been duly issued and
          are fully paid and non-assessable.


          2.2  Corporate Organization and Authority.

               The Company, and each Subsidiary,

                                   PAGE 3
<PAGE>

               (a)   is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
                     in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
                     incorporation,

               (b)   has all requisite power and authority and all
                     necessary licenses, permits, franchises and other
                     governmental authorizations to own and operate its
                     Properties and to carry on its business as now
                     conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted,
                     and

               (c)   has duly qualified and is authorized to do business
                     and in good standing as a foreign corporation in each
                     jurisdiction where the character of its Properties or
                     the nature of its activities makes such qualification
                     necessary and where the failure to be so qualified
                     would have a material adverse effect on the Company's
                     or Subsidiary's business or financial position.

          2.3  Business, Property, Indebtedness and Liens.

               (a)   The Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
          fiscal year ended December 31, 1994 filed by the Company with the
          Securities and Exchange Commission and previously delivered to
          you correctly describes the general nature of the business and
          principal Properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries.

               (b)   Exhibit C correctly lists all outstanding Indebtedness
          for borrowed money (including all Capitalized Leases) of, and all
          Liens (other than those (x) permitted by clauses (i) - (v) of
          Section 7.6(a) and (y) those on Property which individually does
          not have a Fair Market Value in excess of $500,000 and which,
          when aggregated with other Property subject to Liens not included
          pursuant to this clause (y), does not have a Fair Market Value in
          excess of $2,000,000) on Property of, the Company and its
          Subsidiaries as of September 30, 1995.  Neither the Company nor
          any Subsidiary has agreed or consented to cause or permit in the
          future (upon the happening of a contingency or otherwise) any of
          its Property, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, to be
          subject to a Lien not permitted by Section 7.6(a).

          2.4  Financial Statements.

               (a)   The consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its
          Consolidated Subsidiaries as of December 31 in the years 1991,
          1992, 1993, and 1994 and the related statements of income,
          retained earnings and changes in financial position or cash flows
          for the fiscal years ended on such dates, all accompanied by
          reports thereon containing opinions without qualification, except
          as therein noted, by Ernst & Young or by Price, Waterhouse,
          L.L.P., independent certified public accountants, and the
          consolidated balance sheets of the Company and its Consolidated

                                    PAGE 4
<PAGE>

          Subsidiaries as of June 30, 1995 and as of September 30, 1995, if
          the representation is being made as of the Date of Closing, and
          the related statements of income, retained earnings and cash
          flows for the 6-month or 9-month period, as appropriate,  then
          ended, certified by the Company's chief financial officer or
          chief accounting officer, have been prepared in accordance with
          generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied,
          and present fairly the financial position of the Company and its
          Consolidated Subsidiaries as of such dates and the results of
          their operations for such periods, provided, however, that the
          1995 financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
          generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
          statements.

               (b)   Since December 31, 1994 there have been no materially
          adverse changes in the Properties, business, prospects, profits
          or financial condition of the Company or the Company and its
          Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          2.5  Full Disclosure.

               The financial statements referred to in Section 2.4 do not,
          nor does this Agreement nor the other written materials described
          in Exhibit F furnished to you by the Company contain any untrue
          statement of a material fact or omit a material fact necessary to
          make the statements contained therein or herein not misleading. 
          There is no agreement, restriction or other factual matter
          which the Company has not disclosed to you in writing which so
          far as the Company can now reasonably foresee, will have a
          material adverse impact on the long-term financial condition or
          prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries or the ability of
          the Company to perform this Agreement.

          2.6  Pending Litigation; Compliance with Law.

               There are no proceedings or investigations pending, or to
          the knowledge of the Company threatened, against or affecting the
          Company or any Subsidiary in or before any court, governmental
          authority or agency or arbitration board or tribunal which, so
          far as the Company can now reasonably foresee, individually or in
          the aggregate, will have a material adverse impact on the long-
          term financial condition or prospects of the Company and its
          Subsidiaries, or would impair the ability of the Company to
          perform this Agreement.  Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
          is in default with respect to any order of any court,
          governmental authority or agency or arbitration board or tribunal
          or in violation of any laws or governmental rules or regulations
          where, so far as the Company can now reasonably foresee, such
          default or violation will have a material adverse impact on the
          long-term financial condition or prospects of the Company and its
          Subsidiaries, or the ability of the Company to perform this
          Agreement.

          2.7  Title to Properties.

               Except where the failure to possess good and marketable
          title in fee simple or good title, as the case may be, would not
          have a material adverse impact on the Company or on the Company
          and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, the Company, and each
          Subsidiary, has good and marketable title in fee simple (or its
          equivalent under applicable law) to all the real Property, and
          has good title to all the other Property, it purports to own,
          including that reflected in the most recent balance sheet
          referred to in Section 2.4 (except as sold or otherwise disposed
          of in the ordinary course of business), free from Liens not
          permitted by Section 7.6(a).

          2.8  Patents and Trademarks.

               The Company, and each Subsidiary, owns or possesses all the
          patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights,
          licenses and rights with respect to the foregoing necessary for
          the present and planned future conduct of its business, without
          any conflict with the rights of others known by Senior
          Management.

          2.9  Sale is Legal and Authorized.

               The sale of the Notes by the Company and compliance by the
          Company and each Subsidiary with all of the provisions of this
          Agreement and of the Notes:

               (a)   have been duly authorized and are within the corporate
                     powers of the Company and each Subsidiary; and

               (b)   are legal and will not conflict with, constitute a
                     violation of, or result in the creation of any Lien
                     upon any Property of the Company or any Subsidiary
                     under the provisions of, any agreement, charter
                     instrument, by-law or other instrument to which the
                     Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by which any
                     of them or their respective Properties may be bound.

               The Company is not a party to any agreement, or subject to
          any charter or other corporate restriction, which restricts its
          right or ability to incur Indebtedness, other than this Agreement
          and the agreements listed on Exhibit C.

          2.10 No Defaults.

               No event has occurred and no condition exists which, upon
          the issue of the Notes, would constitute a Default or an Event of
          Default.  The Company is not in violation (whether or not
          temporarily waived) of any term of any certificate of
          incorporation or by-law and neither the Company nor any

                                    PAGE 6
<PAGE>

          Subsidiary is in default under any agreement or other instrument
          with respect to borrowed money.  Neither the Company nor any
          Subsidiary is in violation of any term of any other agreement or
          instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its
          Property may be bound which violation, individually or in the
          aggregate with other violations, will have a materially adverse
          impact on the long-term business or prospects of the Company or
          the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

          2.11 Governmental Consent.

               Neither the nature of the Company or of any Subsidiary, or
          of any of their respective businesses or Properties, nor any
          relationship between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other
          Person, nor any circumstance in connection with the offer, issue,
          sale or delivery of the Notes or the execution, delivery and
          performance of this Agreement is such as to require a consent,
          approval or authorization of, or filing, registration or
          qualification with, any governmental authority on the part of the
          Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the execution,
          delivery and performance of this Agreement or the offer, issue,
          sale or delivery of the Notes.

          2.12 Taxes.

               Consolidated Federal income tax returns for the Company and
          its Domestic Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal
          Revenue Service for all years up to and including the year ended
          December 31, 1989.  The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have
          filed or caused to be filed all Federal, state and local tax
          returns which, to the knowledge of Senior Management are required
          to be filed and have paid or caused to be paid all taxes as shown
          on such returns or on any assessment received by it or by any of
          them, to the extent that such taxes have become due, except any
          such tax or assessment the validity of which is being contested
          in good faith by appropriate proceedings and with respect to
          which the Company or a Subsidiary, as appropriate, has set aside
          on its books adequate reserves to the extent the Company or any
          Subsidiary and a nationally recognized independent certified
          public accountant believes such reserves are necessary.  To the
          extent that the Company in good faith believes is necessary, the
          Company and its Subsidiaries have set up reserves which are
          believed by the Company to be adequate for the payment of
          additional taxes.  All assessed deficiencies resulting from
          examinations by the Internal Revenue Service up to and including
          the year ended December 31, 1989 have been discharged, reserved
          against or will not impair the Company's ability to repay the
          Loans.

          2.13 Use of Proceeds.

               The Company will apply the proceeds from the sale of the
          Notes to refinance outstanding Indebtedness for borrowed money. 
          None of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
          (including, without limitation thereof, the use of the proceeds
          from the sale of the Notes) will violate or result in a violation
          of Section 7 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
          or any regulations issued pursuant thereto, including, without
          limitation, Regulations G, T and X of the Board of Governors of
          the Federal Reserve System, 12 C.F.R., Chapter II.

          2.14 Private Offering.

               The Company has not offered any of the Notes or any similar
          Security of the Company for sale to, or solicited offers to buy
          any thereof from, or otherwise approached or negotiated with
          respect thereto with, any prospective purchaser, other than the
          purchasers of the Notes and not more than five (5) other
          institutional investors, each of whom was offered all or a
          portion of the Notes at private sale for investment.  The Company
          agrees that neither the Company nor anyone acting on its behalf
          will offer the Notes or any part thereof or any similar
          Securities for issue or sale to, or solicit any offer to acquire
          any of the same from, anyone so as to bring the issuance and sale
          of the Notes within the provisions of Section 5 of the Securities
          Act of 1933, as amended.

          2.15 ERISA.

                     ------------------------------------------------------

          Persons, or in which employees of the Company or any Related 
          Person are entitled to participate, as from time to time in effect
          (herein called the "Pension Plans"), did not, as of January 1,
          1994, the last annual valuation date, exceed the actuarial or
          market value of the assets of the Pension Plans allocable to such
          vested benefits.

               (b)   Prohibited Transactions.  Neither the Company or any
                     -----------------------
          Related Person nor any of the Pension Plans nor any trusts
          created thereunder, nor any trustee or administrator thereof, has
          engaged in a "prohibited transaction", as such term is defined in
          Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or
          described in Section 406 of ERISA, which could subject the
          Company, any Related Person, any of the Pension Plans, any such
          trust, or any trustee or administrator thereof, or any party
          dealing with the Pension Plans or any such trust to the tax or

          2.16 Foreign Assets Control Regulations, etc.

               Neither the sale of the Notes by the Company hereunder nor
          its use of the proceeds thereof will violate the Trading with the
          Enemy Act, as amended, or any of the foreign assets control

          of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective real properties

          assets, alleging any damage to the environment or violation of
          any Environmental Laws, except, in each case, such as could not

               not disposed of any Hazardous Materials in a manner contrary
               to any Environmental Laws in each case in any manner that

          SECTION 5. PREPAYMENTS

          5.1  Required Prepayments.

               (a)   In addition to paying the entire remaining principal
          amount and interest due on the Notes at maturity, the Company
          will prepay, and there shall become due and payable,
          $6,250,000.00 principal amount of the Notes on December 5 in each
          year beginning on December 5, 2002 and ending December 5, 2004,
          inclusive.  Each such prepayment shall be at 100% of the

<PAGE>

          principal amount to be prepaid, together with interest accrued
          thereon to the date of prepayment.

               (b)   The acquisition of any Notes by the Company shall not
          reduce or otherwise affect its obligation to make any prepayment
          required by Section 5.l(a).  Upon any exercise by the Company of
          the prepayment option in Section 5.2, each remaining scheduled
          payment of principal shall be reduced on a pro rata basis to
          reflect such reduction in outstanding principal amount.

          5.2  Option to Prepay.

               The Company may make optional prepayments to prepay the
          Notes in whole or in part, in multiples of $1,000,000, at any
          time at a price equal to the greater of (i) the principal amount
          to be prepaid together with accrued interest on the principal
          amount so prepaid to the prepayment date, and (ii) the Makewhole
          Price applicable at such time with respect to the amount of the
          Notes being prepaid.

          5.3  Notice of Optional Prepayment.

               The Company will give notice of any optional prepayment of
          the Notes to each holder of the Notes not less than 10 Business
          Days nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for prepayment,
          specifying (a) such date, (b) the section of this Agreement under
          which the prepayment is to be made, (c) the principal amount of
          the Notes and of such holder's Notes to be prepaid on such date,
          and (d) the accrued interest applicable to the prepayment, and
          setting forth a detailed calculation of what the Makewhole Price
          would be if the Notes were being prepaid on the date of such
          notice.  Notice of prepayment having been so given, the principal
          amount of the Notes specified in such notice, together with the
          premium, if any, and accrued interest thereon, shall become due
          and payable on the prepayment date.  The Company will provide a
          supplemental notice by courier or facsimile confirmed by
          telephone to be received by each holder of the Notes by
          2:00 p.m., Hartford, Connecticut time, on the Business Day
          immediately preceding the date fixed for prepayment which will
          set forth a detailed calculation of the Makewhole Price.

          5.4  Partial Payment Pro Rata.

               If there is more than one Note outstanding at any time, the
          aggregate principal amount of each required or optional partial
          payment of the Notes shall be allocated among the outstanding
          Notes in proportion, as nearly as practicable, to the respective
          unpaid principal amounts of the Notes.  For the purpose of this
          Section 5.4 only, any Notes reacquired by the Company shall be
          deemed to be outstanding.

          the Notes, the transfer thereof and the names and addresses of
          the transferees of any of the Notes will be registered in the

          principal amount not evenly divisible by $100,000), in an
          aggregate principal amount equal to the unpaid principal amount
          of the surrendered Note.  Each such new Note (a) shall be payable
          to such Person as the surrendering holder may request, and (b)
          shall be dated and bear interest from the date to which interest
          has been paid on the surrendered Note or dated the date of the
          surrendered Note if no interest has been paid thereon.  The
          Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
          stamp tax or governmental charge imposed in respect of any
          transfer.

               (a)   in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of
                     indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (provided, if

                     satisfactory), or

               (b)   in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and
                     cancellation of the Note, the Company at its expense

                     dated and bearing interest from the date to which
                     interest has been paid on the lost, stolen, destroyed
                     or mutilated Note or dated the date of such lost,
                     stolen, destroyed or mutilated Note if no interest has

          under the Notes and this Agreement (except principal, interest or
          premium which has become due solely by reason of such
          declaration) have been duly paid.  No such annulment shall extend

            yield to maturity at such time of United States Treasury
            obligations with a remaining life to maturity (as compiled by
            and published in the most recently published issue of the
            United States Federal Reserve Bulletin or its successor
            publication) most nearly equal to the Weighted Average Life to

            obligations listed in such publication with a remaining life to

            Treasury obligation with a remaining life to maturity closest
            to and less than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such
            Notes being prepaid or repaid (or portions thereof) in order to
            calculate the Treasury Constant Yield.  In this event these two

            Constant Yield will be calculated through interpolation of the
            yields on such Treasury obligations.

               Voting Stock - shall mean, with respect to any corporation, 
               ------------
            the capital stock of such corporation having the power to vote
            for a majority of the board of directors of such corporation
            under ordinary circumstances.

               Weighted Average Life to Maturity - of the Notes or any
               ---------------------------------
            portion thereof, at the time of the determination thereof,
            means the number of years obtained by dividing the then
            Remaining Dollar-years of such Notes or portion thereof by the
            then outstanding principal amount of such Notes or portion
            thereof.  The term "Remaining Dollar-years" of any Indebtedness
            for borrowed money means the amount obtained by (1) multiplying
            (A) the amount of each then remaining required repayment or
            redemption (including repayment or redemption at final
            maturity) by (B) the number of years (calculated at the nearest
            one-twelfth) which will elapse between the date as of which the
            calculation is made and the date that such required repayment
            is due and (2) totaling all the products obtained in (1).

          10.2 Accounting Principles.

          item of income or expense is required to be determined or any
          consolidation or other accounting computation is required to be
          made under this Agreement, this shall be done in accordance with
          GAAP.

          SECTION 4.    CORPORATE INCENTIVE FUND
          --------------------------------------
               Prior to March 1st of each year the Committee shall
          establish for the Corporate Incentive Fund a Threshold, a Target
          and a Maximum; provided, however that Net Income shall be used
          rather than Performance Profit.

               The Committee may also designate intermediate levels of Net
          Income between a Threshold and the Maximum and the percent of
          salary which will be paid as an Award if Net Income equals any
          such intermediate point.

               Based on the above determinations by the Committee and the
          total actual base salaries of the participants in each incentive
          fund, the Controller shall calculate the applicable participation
          rates.

               Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, a
          participation rate for performance above the Maximum shall be set
          equal to the participation rate for performance between the
          Target and the Maximum.

               The Incentive Fund available at the end of the year for
          payment of Awards shall be equal to the participation rate(s)
          times the applicable amount by which Performance Profit exceeds
          the profit objective(s).

          SECTION 5.    GROUP GOALS
          -------------------------
               Prior to March 1st of each year the Committee shall

          SECTION 6.  GROUP FUNDS
          -----------------------
               Prior to March 1st of each year, the President and Chief
          Executive Officer (the "CEO") will determine which units, other
          than the Corporate Headquarters, should have separate incentive
          funds.  For each fund he will then set a Threshold, a Target and
          a Maximum.

               The CEO may also designate intermediate levels of
          Performance Profit between the Threshold and the Maximum and the
          percent of salary which will be paid as an Award if Performance
          Profit equals any such intermediate point.

               Based on the above determinations, which shall be submitted
          in writing to the Controller, and the total actual base salaries
          of the participants in each incentive fund, the Controller shall
          calculate the applicable participation rates.  Unless otherwise
          determined by the CEO, participation rates for performance above
          Maximum shall be equal to the applicable fund's participation
          rate for performance between the Target and the Maximum.  The
          Incentive Fund available at the end of the year for payment of
          Awards shall be equal to the participation rate(s) times the
          applicable amount by which Performance Profit exceeds the profit
          objective(s).

          SECTION 7    PARTICIPANTS
          -------------------------
               Prior to March 1st of each year, the CEO, upon the
          recommendations of the group presidents and the senior staff
          officers, shall designate participants in the MICP for the
          current year and the funds in which they shall participate.  The
          CEO shall participate in the Corporate fund.  The designations
          will be incorporated in a memorandum from the CEO to the
          Controller.

               the fund.  The CEO will provide a report to the Committee
               summarizing his determinations made pursuant to this
               paragraph.

               each Incentive Fund, the CEO, upon recommendation from the
               group presidents, shall determine each participant's share
               of the Incentive Funds (except for any Company officer who
               participates in the fund).

          8.5  The CEO shall have full authority to make adjustments to
               Incentive Funds.  He shall also have the authority to
               refrain from making an Award to any participant.  Except for
               persons who retire, die or become permanently disabled
               during the year, a person must be employed by the Company or
               one of its subsidiaries on December 1st in order to receive

          9.2  The Controller shall provide to the Committee an estimate of
               the Corporate Incentive Fund for the year and the estimated
               percent of salaries earned as Awards by participants based
               on the objectives set by the Committee pursuant to Section
               4 hereof.

          9.3  The Committee will then decide the portion of the Corporate

               participants in the fund.

          9.4  In December the Committee shall decide each officer's
               percentage share of his/her applicable fund.

          9.5  After the end of the year and based on the final amount of
               the Corporate Incentive Fund, the CEO, upon recommendation
               from the senior staff officers, shall determine each
               participant's share of the Incentive Funds (except for
               officers of the Company).

          9.6  The Committee shall have full authority to make adjustments
               to the Corporate Incentive Fund.  It shall also have the
               authority to refrain from making an Award to any officer.
               It may also award a bonus in excess of a participant's MICP
               award to any officer and may recommend to the CEO that a
               bonus in excess of a participant's MICP award be paid to a
               specified individual(s).  Except for persons who retire,
               die, or becomes permanently disabled during the year, a
               person must be employed by the Company or one of its
               subsidiaries on December 1st in order to receive an Award,
               unless the Committee decides otherwise in individual cases.

          SECTION 10.    AWARDS ABOVE MAXIMUM
          -----------------------------------
          10.1 Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, no

                            1996 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
                            -----------------------------

          SECTION 1.   PURPOSE
          ---------------------
               The 1996 Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") is designed to
          provide incentive compensation to key executives of Barnes Group
          Inc. (the "Company") and its subsidiaries in a form which
          relates the financial reward to an increase in the value of the
          Company to its shareholders.  The plan shall be administered by
          the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
          "Committee").  This plan shall be effective for awards granted
          with the 1996-1998 Incentive Award Period.

          SECTION 2.    DEFINITIONS
          -------------------------
          2.1  Total Cost of Equity.  Total Cost of Equity equals Average
               --------------------
               Stockholders' Equity, multiplied by a percentage cost of
               equity selected by the Committee which shall be held
               constant throughout the Incentive Award Period.

               Average Stockholders' Equity shall be computed by adding
               stockholders' equity on December 31st of the prior year to
               stockholders' equity at the end of each month of the
               applicable year and dividing the result by 13.

          2.2  Economic Return.  Economic Return for any year equals Cash
               ---------------
               Flow From Operations less the Cost of Equity divided by the
               average number of common shares outstanding for the year.
               In computing Economic Return, the Committee may make
               adjustments for any extraordinary changes which occur during
               an Incentive Award Period.

                                          1
<PAGE>



          2.3  Cash Flow from Operations.  Cash Flow From Operations equals
               -------------------------
               net income, less any dividends on preferred stock, plus
               depreciation and amortization, plus any losses, less any
               gains, on the sale of plant, property and equipment or other
               assets where the gain or loss exceeds $500,000 for each
               individual transaction.

          2.4  Performance Unit.  A Performance Unit is the form of award
               ----------------
               under the LTIP.  Its value in any year is equal to the sum
               of the Economic Returns per share for the current year and
               preceding four years.

          SECTION 3.    ADMINISTRATION
          ----------------------------
               The Committee shall designate participants, award a number
          of Performance Units to each participant, and perform all other
          actions necessary to the proper administration of the LTIP.  The
          interpretation by the Committee of the LTIP and any awards made
          hereunder shall be binding upon the participants and the Company.

          SECTION 4.    PARTICIPANTS
          --------------------------
               Key senior executives of the Company and its subsidiaries
          whose activities can contribute significantly to the performance
          of the Company are eligible to participate in the LTIP.

          SECTION 5.  GRANT OF INCENTIVE AWARDS
          -------------------------------------
          5.1  Prior to March 1 of each year, the Committee shall determine
               whether or not Performance Units will be granted in the
               current year.  If they are to be granted, the Committee
               shall:

                                          2
<PAGE>



               (a)  establish an Incentive Award Period which will commence
               on January 1 of the current year and terminate on
               January 1 of the year selected by the Committee; provided,
               however, that in no event shall it be less than 24 months;
               and

               (b)  designate recipients of Performance Units and the
               number of Performance Units to be awarded to each
               participant.

          5.2  During an Incentive Award Period, new employees and
               employees who are promoted or transferred may be granted new
               or additional Performance Units.

          SECTION 6.    PAYMENT
          ---------------------
          6.1  Incentive award payments shall be calculated by multiplying
               the number of Performance Units held by a participant times
               the increase, if any, in the value of the Performance Unit
               between the beginning and end of the Incentive Award Period.

          6.2  If a participant becomes employed by the Company after the
               beginning of an Incentive Award Period, payment under any
               such Performance Unit will be reduced by multiplying its
               value by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
               number of full calendar months of the Incentive Award Period
               during which the Participant was employed by the Company,
               and the denominator of which shall be the number of calendar
               months in the Incentive Award Period.

          6.3  Notwithstanding anything in the LTIP to the contrary, the
               amount of payment made to each participant shall be in the
               sole discretion of the Committee.  The amount of all such
               payments shall be determined by the Committee within 90 days
               after the end of the Incentive Award Period.

                                          3
<PAGE>



          6.4  The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine
               whether all or any portion of any payment made with respect
               to the Performance Units held by each participant shall be
               deferred and credited to a participant's Incentive Deferred
               Compensation Account.

          6.5  As soon as practical after the amount of any award is
               determined, it shall be paid in cash to the participant or
               all or part of it shall be credited to the participant's
               Incentive Deferred Compensation Account, all in accord with
               the procedures specified in paragraph 9.

          SECTION 7.   EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR DEATH
          ---------------------------------------------------------
               If a participant ceases to be an employee prior to the end
          of an Incentive Award Period other than by reason of death,
          disability, or retirement after attaining age 55, then the
          Performance Units granted to the participant shall terminate.  If
          a participant ceases to be an employee because of death,
          disability, or retirement after attaining age 55, then payment
          under his Performance Units may be adjusted as set forth in
          paragraph 6.2.

          SECTION 8.    TRANSFERABILITY
          -----------------------------
               Performance Units and any amount standing to a person's
          credit in the Incentive Deferred Compensation Account may not be
          transferred or assigned by a participant except by will or by the
          laws of descent and distribution.

          SECTION 9.    INCENTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNT
          -----------------------------------------------------
          9.1  To the extent that the Committee decided to defer payment of
               any award made under the LTIP, the amount of such deferred
               award shall be credited to the

                                         4

               Company's Incentive Deferred Compensation Account.  The
               Company shall not be required to segregate or earmark assets
               with respect to such account and participants shall have no
               interest in any specific asset as a result of the creation
               of such account or of any award under the LTIP.  All funds
               in such accounts shall be available for general corporate
               purposes.

          9.2  Interest will be credited quarterly on the unpaid amount
               standing to any participant's credit in the Incentive
               Deferred Compensation Account at the end of each quarter.
               On or as soon as practical after the first business day of
               January, the Company will pay to each participant who is
               less than 60 years old the interest credited to his account
               with respect to the prior year.  No cash payment will be
               made to participants who are employed by the Company and who
               have attained age 60.

          9.3  The interest rate for purposes of computing interest under
               paragraph 9.2 shall be the rate of interest for prime
               commercial loans of 90-day maturities charged by Chemical
               Bank (or such other New York City bank as the Committee may
               select) on the first business day of each quarter.

          9.4  Payments from the amount standing to a participant's credit
               in the Incentive Deferred Compensation Account shall begin
               on the first day of the month following the month in which
               the participant ceases to be an employee of the Company.
               Payments shall be made in 120 monthly installments (as equal
               as possible); provided, however, that, except if otherwise
               decided by the Committee, the entire amount then standing to
               the participant's credit in the Incentive Deferred
               Compensation Account shall be paid in one lump sum to any
               person whose employment is terminated other than by death or
               by early or normal retirement

                                          5

               under the applicable retirement plan.  Notwithstanding
               anything in this section to the contrary, the Committee may
               in its discretion either:

          (i)  without the consent of the participant, advance the time of
               payment of any unpaid portion of the award; or

          (ii) if the consent of the participant is obtained, further defer
               the time of payment of any unpaid portion of the award to a
               time not later than 15 years after the termination of the
               participant's employment.

          9.5  No amendment or termination of the LTIP shall reduce or
               cancel any amount standing to a participant's credit in the
               Incentive Deferred Compensation Account, prior to the
               effective date of such amendment or termination.

          9.6  In the event of the death of a participant while there is
               still an amount standing to the participant's credit in the
               Incentive Deferred Compensation Account, the amount shall be
               paid to the beneficiary designated by the participant in
               installments; provided, however, that (a) if the beneficiary
               is the participant's estate, the funds shall be paid in a
               lump sum, and (b) notwithstanding anything in this section
               to the contrary, the Committee may advance the time of
               payment to a beneficiary of any unpaid funds credited to the
               Incentive Deferred Compensation Account.  In the absence of
               a designated beneficiary, any amount standing to the
               participant's credit in the Incentive Deferred Compensation
               Account shall be paid in a lump sum to the participant's
               estate.

          SECTION 10.    AMENDMENT
          ------------------------
               The LTIP may be amended at any time by the Committee.

     Amended:  2/16/96

                 Barnes Group Inc.
                 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

                 SALES

                 In 1995, sales were $593 million, up 4% from 1994.  Sales in
                 1994 were $569 million, a 13% increase over 1993's level of
                 $502 million.

                 Associated Spring's 1995 sales increased 2% to $279 million,
                 following an increase of 17% in 1994.  In North America, sales
                 were down slightly, reflecting in part, a softening of the
                 U.S. durable goods market and labor issues at its Bristol,
                 Connecticut plant.  Internationally, the group reported very
                 strong sales growth, led by its Singapore operation which
                 continued its penetration of the electronics industry.  The
                 group's distribution business, which markets die springs and
                 precision stock springs, also reported good sales growth.

                 Bowman Distribution's 1995 sales were $217 million, up
                 slightly from 1994.  Sales in 1994 were $215 million, 11%
                 higher than 1993's level of $193 million.  Sales from Bowman
                 U.S., the group's largest business unit, kept pace with the
                 prior year.  Bowman's sales in Europe increased nearly 15%
                 reflecting progress in the development of new systems business
                 in the U.K.  Bowman's Canadian business showed slight
                 year-over-year gains in sales.

                 Barnes Aerospace's sales were $97 million in 1995, up 18% from
                 1994, following an increase of 7% in 1994.  Sharply higher
                 sales were reported by both the group's Advanced Fabrications
                 and Precision Machining businesses.  The sales of the group's
                 Repair and Overhaul business were marginally higher than 1994.

                 OPERATING INCOME

                 Consolidated operating income in 1995 was $48.8 million,
                 compared to $36.6 million in 1994 and $12.5 million in 1993.
                 As a result, operating income margin has risen significantly
                 to 8.2%, an improvement of nearly six percentage points in the
                 past two years.  The gain in operating income in 1995 resulted
                 primarily from cost reductions and productivity improvements
                 at Barnes Aerospace and Bowman Distribution, and sharply
                 higher sales volume in Barnes Aerospace.  Increased volume,
                 manufacturing efficiencies and overall containment of costs in
                 all three operating groups contributed to the 1994 gain.  The
                 continued focus on cost control led to lower selling and
                 administrative expenses, as a percent of sales, in both 1995
                 and 1994 compared to previous years.  Operating income in 1993
                 included provisions of $4.9 million for plant consolidations
                 and work force reductions.

                 Associated Spring's increase in operating income, to a record
                 $42.6 million, kept pace with its sales growth.  Strong profit
                 gains overseas, driven by higher sales volume and
                 manufacturing efficiencies, offset lower year-over-year
                 results in its North American manufacturing operations.

                 Bowman's operating income in 1995 of $17.4 million was $4.8
                 million above the 1994 level. This gain reflects sharply lower
                 selling and administrative expenses, primarily at Bowman U.S.

                 Barnes Aerospace's operating income was $5.0 million in 1995
                 compared to an operating loss of $1.8 million in 1994.  The
                 1994 operating loss included $1.1 million of severance costs
                 recognized in the fourth quarter.  The sharply higher profits
                 in 1995 reflect higher sales volume coupled with ongoing
                 productivity improvements and cost containment. The
                 improvements in sales volume, gross margins and operating
                 costs, resulted in the group reporting operating income for
                 four consecutive quarters.

                 Statements on pages 26-27 for further information about the

                 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS


                 NON-OPERATING INCOME/EXPENSE

                 Other income was $4.4 million in 1995, $4.6 million in 1994
                 and $4.1 million in 1993 and includes $1.9 million, $2.3
                 million and $1.7 million, respectively, from the company's
                 investment in NASCO, a company jointly owned with NHK Spring
                 Co., Ltd. of Japan.  Interest income, another major component
                 of other income, increased 10% in 1995 to $1.4 million,
                 primarily due to higher levels of short-term investments in
                 Brazil.

                 Interest expense increased slightly in 1995, following a
                 decrease in 1994.  The impact of lower debt in 1995 was
                 largely offset by higher interest rates.

                 Other expenses increased in 1995, following a decrease in
                 1994, primarily due to higher foreign exchange and translation
                 losses.  These losses were $1.1 million, $0.5 million and $1.7
                 million in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

                 INCOME TAXES

                 The company's effective tax rate was 39.5% in 1995 compared
                 with 40.1% in 1994 and 47.8% in 1993.  Note 6 of the Notes to
                 Consolidated Financial Statements on page 22 contains an
                 explanatory table showing the factors affecting the company's
                 effective tax rate in each of these years.

                 NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE

                 Consolidated net income was $27.5 million in 1995, $20.3
                 million in 1994 and $4.4 million in 1993.  On a per share
                 basis, income for 1995 was $4.20 compared to $3.20 in 1994 and
                 $.70 in 1993.

                 INFLATION

                 Management believes that inflation during the 1993-1995
                 period did not have a material impact on the company's
                 historical financial statements.

                 FINANCIAL CONDITION

                 The company's financial condition, as presented in its
                 statement of cash flows and balance sheet, is strong.  The
                 following is a discussion of the significant elements of these
                 financial statements.

                 CASH FLOWS

                 Operating activities are the principal source of cash flow for
                 the company.  In 1995, operating activities generated a record
                 $47 million in cash flow, $10 million more than 1994 and $28
                 million more than 1993.  During the past three years,
                 operating activities provided over $104 million in cash which
                 the company used to pay dividends to stockholders and fund
                 significant investments in new plant and equipment.

                 Investing activities utilized cash of $37 million in 1995
                 compared with $31 million in 1994. Capital expenditures
                 increased to $36 million in 1995, 12% over 1994 and 61% over
                 1993.  Management continued to invest heavily to improve
                 quality and productivity while adding capacity.  During the
                 past three years the company has invested nearly $90 million
                 in new plant and equipment with over 65% of that at Associated
                 Spring.  In 1996, capital expenditures are expected to exceed
                 1995, with the level of investments in all three businesses
                 expected to increase.

                 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS



                 The company's financing activities used cash of $14 million in
                 1995 compared to $8 million in 1994.  The company continued to
                 use surplus cash generated by its U.S. operations to reduce
                 borrowings under short-term credit lines. Surplus cash from
                 foreign operations was used, in part, to fund strategic
                 investments in Mexico and Europe.  In 1995, the annual
                 dividend per share increased from $1.45 to $1.60.  As a
                 result, total cash dividends paid to the owners of the company
                 increased by 14% to $10 million.  Cash generated from the
                 exercise of employee stock options partially offset these
                 uses.

                 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

                 The company's liquidity, measured in terms of the level of
                 working capital, increased $7 million in 1995 to $95 million
                 at December 31, 1995.  The current ratio, a key measure of
                 liquidity, improved to 2.2 at December 31, 1995 compared to
                 2.0 at December 31, 1994.

                 In evaluating the company's working capital position,
                 consideration should be given to the fact that the majority of
                 its inventories are accounted for on a LIFO basis.  If these
                 inventories were stated on a current cost basis, their value
                 would have been higher by $13 million in both 1995 and 1994.

                 The company's ratio of interest-bearing debt to total
                 capitalization improved for the sixth consecutive year to 25%
                 at December 31, 1995 from 28% at December 31, 1994.  For this
                 purpose, total capitalization includes interest-bearing debt,
                 plus other long-term liabilities, accrued long-term retirement
                 benefits and stockholders' equity, excluding the guaranteed
                 ESOP obligation.

                 To supplement internal cash generation in the U.S., the
                 company maintains substantial bank borrowing facilities.  At
                 December 31, 1995, the company had $100 million of borrowing
                 capacity available under a revolving credit agreement which
                 expires in 2000.  In addition, the company has available $135
                 million in uncommitted, short-term bank credit lines, of which
                 $1.5 million was in use at December 31, 1995.  During 1995 and
                 1994, the company maintained long-term debt of $70 million
                 comprised, in part, of borrowings under its short-term bank
                 credit lines backed by its long-term revolving credit
                 agreement.  In December 1995, substantially all of the credit
                 line borrowings were replaced with the proceeds of a $25
                 million private placement with a final maturity in 2005.  This
                 was done to extend the maturity of the company's long-term
                 financing and to secure an additional block of committed
                 funding.  The company believes its bank credit facilities
                 coupled with cash generated from operations are adequate for
                 its anticipated future requirements.

                 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

                 In 1995, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
                 Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,"
                 effective for years beginning after December 15, 1995.  Under
                 the provisions of this accounting standard, the company is not
                 required to change its method of accounting for stock-based
                 compensation.  Management expects to retain its current method
                 of accounting.


                                                                            13

                 Barnes Group Inc.
                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


                 (All dollar amounts included in the notes are stated in 
                 thousands except per share data and the tables in Note 13.)
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. SUMMARY OF    GENERAL:  The preparation of financial statements requires
   SIGNIFICANT   management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
   ACCOUNTING    reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
   POLICIES      financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
                 expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could
                 differ from those estimates.

                 CONSOLIDATION:  The accompanying consolidated financial
                 statements include the accounts of the company and all of its
                 subsidiaries.  Intercompany transactions and account balances
                 have been eliminated.  The company accounts for its 45%
                 investment in the common stock of NASCO, an automotive
                 suspension spring company jointly owned with NHK Spring Co.,
                 Ltd. of Japan, under the equity method.  Other income in the
                 accompanying income statements includes $1,897, $2,314 and
                 $1,734 for the years 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively, of
                 income from the company's investment in NASCO.

                 REVENUE RECOGNITION:  Sales and related cost of sales are
                 recognized when products are shipped to customers.

                 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  All highly liquid investments
                 purchased with a maturity of three months or less are cash
                 equivalents and are carried at fair market value.

                 INVENTORIES:  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or
                 market.  The last-in, first-out (LIFO) method was used to
                 accumulate the cost of all U.S.  inventories which represent
                 69% of total inventories.  The cost of foreign subsidiary
                 inventories was determined using the first-in, first-out
                 (FIFO) method.

                 PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  Property, plant and equipment
                 is stated at cost.  Depreciation is provided using accelerated
                 methods over estimated useful lives ranging generally from 20
                 to 50 years for buildings and 3 to 17 years for machinery and
                 equipment.  Maintenance and repairs charged to expense were
                 $15,396, $16,341 and $12,966 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
                 respectively.

                 GOODWILL:  Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over
                 the net assets of companies acquired in business combinations.
                 Goodwill acquired since 1970 is being amortized on a
                 straight-line basis over 40 years; similar investments for
                 businesses acquired prior to 1970 (approximately $5,200) are
                 not being amortized.  The company has determined that there is
                 no indication of any impairment in the value of goodwill.
                 Accumulated amortization was $7,588 and $7,002 at December 31,
                 1995 and 1994, respectively.

                 FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:   Assets and liabilities of
                 foreign operations, except those in countries with high rates
                 of inflation, are translated at year-end rates of exchange;
                 revenue and expenses are translated at average annual rates of
                 exchange.  The resulting translation gains and losses are
                 reflected in foreign currency translation adjustments within
                 stockholders' equity.

                 For operations in countries that have high rates of inflation, 
                 translation gains and losses are included in net income.  
                 These losses, along with those generated from foreign 
                 currency transactions, were $1,078, $550 and $1,661 in
                 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.
                 
                 INCOME PER COMMON SHARE:  Income per common share is based on
                 the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
                 during the year.  The effect of common stock equivalents
                 (stock options) is not material.  For purposes of calculating
                 income per share, Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares
                 are considered outstanding.

                 Barnes Group Inc.
                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS


                 The company has a revolving credit agreement with five banks
                 that allows borrowings up to $100,000 under notes due December
                 6, 2000.  A commitment fee of .17% per annum is paid on the
                 unused portion of the commitments.  The company had no
                 borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 1995 and 1994.

                 The company has available $135,000 in uncommitted, short-term
                 bank credit lines, of which $1,500 and $30,000 were in use at
                 December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  The interest rate
                 on these borrowings was 6.1% and 6.2% at December 31, 1995 and
                 1994, respectively.

                 At December 31, 1995, the company classified $1,077 of
                 borrowings under its lines of credit and $6,154 of its 9.47%
                 Notes due within one year as long-term debt.  The company has
                 both the intent and the ability, through its revolving credit
                 agreement, to refinance these amounts on a long-term basis.

                 During 1995, the company had outstanding an interest rate
                 swap, a form of derivative, which effectively converted
                 $18,462 of its fixed rate 9.47% Notes to floating rate debt
                 with interest equal to LIBOR plus 83 basis points.  The
                 effective interest rate on this floating rate portion was 6.7%
                 and 7.3% at December 31, 1995 and 1994, respectively.  This
                 swap decreases as the Notes are repaid.  The fair value of the
                 swap is determined based upon current market prices and was
                 $1,914 at December 31, 1995.  The company does not use
                 derivatives for trading purposes.

                 The company guaranteed $9,953 of letters of credit, bank
                 borrowings and capital lease obligations related to its 45%
                 investment in NASCO.  In addition, the company has other
                 outstanding letters of credit totaling $7,004 at December 31,
                 1995.

                 The required principal payments on the Notes are $6,154 in
                 each of the next five years.  As noted above, the 1996
                 maturity has been classified as long-term.

                 Certain of the company's debt arrangements contain
                 requirements to maintain minimum levels of working capital and
                 net worth, which as a result, place limitations on dividend
                 payments and acquisitions of the company's common stock.
                 Under the most restrictive covenant in any agreement, $43,118
                 was available for dividends or acquisitions of common stock at
                 December 31, 1995.

                 Interest paid was $5,661, $5,626 and $5,496 in 1995, 1994 and
                 1993, respectively.

                 A portion of the deferred income tax assets can be realized
                 through carrybacks and reversals of existing taxable temporary
                 differences with the remainder, net of the valuation
                 allowance, dependent on future income.  Management believes
                 that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize
                 the remaining net deferred income tax assets.

                 The company has not recognized deferred income taxes on
                 $69,092 of undistributed earnings of its international
                 subsidiaries since such earnings are considered to be
                 reinvested indefinitely.  If the earnings were distributed in

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. COMMON STOCK  In 1995, 1994 and 1993, 167,779, 135,692 and 70,504 shares of
                 common stock were issued from treasury for the exercise of
                 stock options, purchases by the Employee Stock Purchase Plan
                 and various other incentive awards.  Also in 1995, the company
                 acquired 42,236 shares of the company's common stock from its
                 Guaranteed Stock Plan at a cost of $1,746.  These acquired
                 shares were placed in treasury.

                 Each share of outstanding common stock contains a dividend
                 distribution right (Right) which entitles the holder to
                 purchase 1/100 of a share of Series A Junior Participating
                 Preferred Stock for one hundred dollars.

                 Separate rights certificates will be mailed to stockholders if
                 a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange
                 offer for 50% or more of the outstanding shares of the
                 company's common stock.  The Rights, which have no voting or
                 dividend rights, expire July 29, 1996 and may be redeemed by
                 the company at a price of five cents per Right at any time
                 until the tenth day following public announcement that a
                 person or group has acquired or intends to acquire 50% or more
                 of the outstanding common stock.

                 If, following the acquisition by a person or group of 50% or
                 more of the outstanding shares of the company's common stock,
                 the company is acquired in a merger or other business
                 combination or 50% or more of the company's assets or earning
                 power is sold or transferred, each outstanding Right becomes
                 exercisable for common stock or other securities of the
                 acquiring entity having a value of twice the exercise price of
                 the Right.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. PREFERRED     At December 31, 1995 and 1994, the company had 3,000,000
   STOCK         shares of $1 par value preferred stock authorized, none of
                 which were outstanding.

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. STOCK PLANS   All U.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees are eligible
                 to participate in the company's Guaranteed Stock Plan (GSP).
                 The GSP provides for the investment of employer and employee
                 contributions in the company's common stock.  The company
                 guarantees a minimum rate of return on certain GSP assets.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                 The GSP is a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).
                 In 1989, the GSP purchased 579,310 shares of the company's
                 common stock at a cost of $21,000 using the proceeds of a loan
                 guaranteed by the company.  These shares are held in trust and
                 are issued to employees' accounts in the GSP as the loan is
                 repaid.  Principal and interest on the GSP loan are being paid
                 in quarterly installments through 1999.  The loan bears
                 interest based on LIBOR.  At December 31, 1995 the interest
                 rate was 6.7%.  Interest of $747, $653 and $592 was incurred
                 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

                 Contributions and certain dividends received are used in part
                 by the GSP to service its debt.  Contributions include both
                 employee contributions up to a maximum of 10% of eligible pay
                 and company contributions.

                 The company contributions are equal to the amount required by
                 the Plan to pay the principal and interest due under the Plan
                 loan plus that required to purchase any additional shares
                 required to be allocated to participant accounts, less the sum
                 of participant contributions and dividends received by the
                 GSP.  The GSP used $1,459, $1,323 and $1,277 of company
                 dividends for debt service in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
                 respectively.  The company expenses all cash contributions
                 made to the GSP.  Compensation expense was $2,245, $2,268 and
                 $2,452 in 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively.  In addition to
                 the company shares held in trust, the GSP also purchases the
                 company's common stock on the open market to meet its
                 requirements.  As of December 31, 1995, the GSP held 1,158,819
                 shares of the company's common stock, of which 224,968 shares
                 were unallocated.

                 For financial statement purposes, the company reflects its
                 guarantee of the GSP's debt as a liability with a like amount
                 reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity.

                 The company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under
                 which eligible employees may elect to have up to 10% of base
                 compensation deducted from payroll for the purchase of the
                 company's common stock at 85% of market value on the date of
                 purchase.  The maximum number of shares which may be purchased
                 under the Plan is 675,000.  During 1995, 21,012 shares (22,367
                 and 23,737 shares in 1994 and 1993, respectively) were
                 purchased.  As of December 31, 1995, 221,871 shares may be
                 issued in the future.

                 The 1991 Barnes Group Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the
                 granting of incentives to officers and other executives in the
                 form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, incentive
                 stock rights and performance unit awards.  A predecessor plan
                 which provided for similar incentives expired in 1991.
                 Options granted under that plan continue to be exercisable and
                 any options which terminate without being exercised become
                 available for grant under the 1991 Plan.  A maximum of 660,926
                 common shares are subject to issuance under this plan after
                 December 31, 1995.  Data relating to grants under these plans

                 non-employee director is awarded 2,000 shares of the company's
                 common stock upon retirement.  In 1994, 4,000 shares were

10. PENSION      The company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans
    PLANS        covering a majority of its worldwide employees at Associated
                 Spring, Bowman Distribution and its Executive Office.  Plan
                 benefits for salaried and non-union hourly employees are based
                 on years of service and average salary.  Plans covering union
                 hourly employees provide benefits based on years of service.
                 The company funds U.S. pension costs in accordance with the
                 Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
                 Plan assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                 Significant assumptions used in determining pension expense 
                 and the funded status of the plans were:

</TABLE>
                 The reduction in the weighted average discount rate, from
                 8.25% to 7.25%, increased the projected benefit obligations by
                 approximately $23,016 at December 31, 1995 and will increase
                 annual pension expense by $712.

                 The company has defined contribution plans covering employees
                 of Barnes Aerospace and field sales employees of Bowman
                 Distribution's U.S. operation. Company contributions under
                 these plans are based primarily on the performance of the
                 business unit and employee compensation. Total expense
                 amounted to $1,748, $1,431 and $1,566 in 1995, 1994 and 1993,
                 respectively.

                 The pension agreement between the company and the union
                 representing the three largest Associated Spring plants became
                 subject to renegotiation during the first quarter of 1995.
                 Pension negotiations have been delayed, in part, due to
                 negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement
                 covering workers at Associated Spring's largest plant. The
                 pension negotiation could be further delayed by the fact that
                 the labor agreement covering workers at another large
                 Associated Spring plant is scheduled for renegotiation in
                 1996.

    TIREMENT     insurance benefits for a majority of its retired employees in
    HEALTHCARE   the U.S. and Canada. It is the company's practice to fund

                 Barnes Group Inc.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                 Cash payments made in 1995, 1994 and 1993 for postretirement
                 benefits were $5,210, $4,828 and $4,597, respectively.

                 The company's accumulated benefit obligations take into
                 account certain cost-sharing provisions. The annual assumed
                 rate of increase in the cost of covered benefits (i.e.,
                 healthcare cost trend rate) is assumed to be 10.0% for 1995,
                 gradually reducing to 5.0% by the year 2001. A one percentage
                 point increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would
                 increase the accumulated benefit obligations by approximately
                 $6,664 at December 31, 1995, and would have increased 1995
                 expense by approximately $815.

                 Discount rates of 7.25%, 8.25% and 7.5% were used in
                 determining the accumulated benefit obligations at December
                 31, 1995, 1994 and 1993, respectively. While the reduction in
                 the weighted average discount rate from 8.25% to 7.25%
                 increased the accumulated benefit obligations by $7,213 at
                 December 31, 1995, it will have only a minor impact on the
                 1996 expense.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. LEASES       Rent expense was $5,866, $6,072 and $5,256 for 1995, 1994 and
                 1993, respectively. Minimum rental commitments under
                 noncancellable leases (principally for buildings and
                 equipment) in years 1996 through 2000 are $3,089, $2,198,
                 $1,601, $1,023, $837 and $4,895 thereafter.
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. INFORMATION  The company operates three businesses:
    ON BUSINESS
    SEGMENTS     Associated Spring: manufactures and distributes custom-made
                 springs and other close-tolerance engineered metal components
                 principally to the transportation, electronics and industrial
                 markets. Associated Spring's custom metal parts are sold in
                 the United States and through its foreign subsidiaries.
                 Foreign manufacturing operations are located in Brazil,
                 Canada, Mexico and Singapore. The automotive and automotive
                 parts industries constitute Associated Spring's largest
                 market.

                 Bowman Distribution: distributes fast-moving, consumable
                 repair and replacement products for industrial, heavy
                 equipment and transportation maintenance markets. Bowman
                 Distribution's operations and markets are located primarily in
                 the United States.  Other important locations include Canada
                 and Europe.

                 Barnes Aerospace: manufactures precision machined parts and
                 fabricated assemblies, and refurbishes jet engine components
                 for the aircraft and aerospace industries. Barnes Aerospace's
                 operations and markets are located primarily in the United
                 States.

                 Sales between the business segments and between the geographic
                 areas are accounted for on the same basis as sales to
                 unaffiliated customers. Operating income includes net sales
                 less cost of sales, selling and administrative expenses and
                 the cost of plant closings and restructurings. In 1993, plant
                 closings and restructurings included $3,400 for combining
                 operations of the Aerospace machining units and $1,500 for the
                 consolidation of Associated Spring's operations in Mexico.
                 Other income and expenses are not included in operating
                 income. Corporate assets consist of cash and cash
                 equivalents, deferred income taxes, other assets,
                 transportation equipment and the Executive Office building.
                 Included in the 1995 identifiable international assets are the
                 assets of manufacturing facilities in Singapore ($19,200),
                 Brazil ($14,100), Canada ($18,000) and Mexico ($10,300) and
                 distribution facilities in Canada ($13,100), United Kingdom
                 ($16,300) and France ($8,000). Associated Spring's operation
                 in Singapore was an important contributor to the company's
                 international operating income during each of the three years
                 presented.

                 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. CONTINGENCY  In December, 1991, the company was notified by the McDonnell
                 Douglas Corporation that McDonnell Douglas was terminating for
                 default an $8,200 contract with the company's Advanced
                 Fabrication division.  In 1992, the company wrote off $4,000
                 of net assets related to this contract previously included in
                 its financial statements.  The company believed from the onset
                 that it had legitimate defenses to the default claim.  In
                 June, 1995, this dispute was settled to the satisfaction of
                 both parties with no further financial impact on the results
                 of operations or on the financial position of the company.

                 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


                 TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF BARNES GROUP INC.

                 In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
                 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
                 stockholders' equity and of cash flows present fairly, in all
                 material respects, the financial position of Barnes Group Inc.
                 and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1995 and 1994, and the
                 results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
                 then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
                 principles.  These financial statements are the responsibility
                 of the Company's management; our responsibility is to express
                 an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
                 We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
                 generally accepted auditing standards which require that we
                 plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
                 about whether the financial statements are free of material
                 misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
                 evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
                 financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
                 and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
                 the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
                 our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion
                 expressed above.  The financial statements of Barnes Group
                 Inc. for the year ended December 31, 1993 were audited by
                 other independent accountants whose report dated January 28,
                 1994 expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

(1) All per-share data, other than earnings per common share, are based on
    common shares outstanding at the end of each year. Earnings per common share
    are based on weighted average common shares outstanding during each year.

(2) Includes a $3.4 million pretax, $2.0 million after-tax charge ($.33 per 
    share) against income related to the plant consolidation and work force 
    reduction at Barnes Aerospace and a $1.5 million charge without tax 
    benefit ($.24 per share) for a plant consolidation at Associated Spring's 
    Mexican operations.

(3) Includes a $17.8 million pretax, $10.7 million after-tax charge ($1.73 
    per share) against income related to the costs of plant closings at 
    Associated Spring, Barnes Aerospace charges on a terminated contract and 
    restructuring of Bowman U.S. sales organization. These charges were 
    partially offset by a $5.0 million pretax gain, $3.7 million after-tax
    ($.60 per share) from the sale of Bowman's Pioneer division.

(4) Barnes Group adopted three new accounting standards in 1992 retroactive to
    the beginning of the year. Included is a one-time $39.7 million after-tax
    charge ($6.41 per share) to comply with FAS 106 and 112 which changes the
    accounting for certain postretirement and postemployment benefits to the
    accrual method and an additional $1.0 million income tax charge ($.15 per
    share) for FAS 109, which changed income tax accounting.
