                                        PART I


          Item 1.   Business.
                    ---------
                    The  Company is  in three  businesses:   Bowman Distri-
          bution,  a  distributor  of  consumable  repair  and  replacement
          products  for  industrial,  heavy  equipment,  and transportation
          maintenance   markets;  Associated  Spring,  a  manufacturer  and
          distributor  of  custom-made  springs and  other  close-tolerance
          engineered metal components; and Barnes Aerospace, a manufacturer
          of precision machined and  fabricated assemblies for the aircraft
          and  aerospace  industries  and   a  refurbisher  of  jet  engine
          components.*

                    Bowman Distribution.  Bowman Distribution is engaged in
                    -------------------
          distributing in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and
          France  a  variety  of  replacement  parts  and  other  products,
          including  fasteners and  special  purpose  hardware,  automotive
          parts,  automotive specialties  and accessories,  general purpose
          electric   and  gas  welding   supplies,  industrial  maintenance
          supplies,  and industrial aerosols such as adhesives, lubricants,
          and sealants.

                    The products  sold by Bowman Distribution  are, for the
          most part, not manufactured by the Company, but are obtained from
          a number of outside suppliers.  The vast majority of the products
          are repackaged and sold under Bowman's labels.

                    Sales by  Bowman Distribution in the  United States and
          Canada are  primarily to  industrial plants, chemical  and petro-
          chemical  process  industries,   contractors,  new  car  dealers,
          garages,  service  stations,  operators of  vehicle  fleets,  and
          airline ground maintenance facilities.

                    In  1992, the  Company  sold substantially  all of  the
          assets of the Pioneer division of Bowman.

                    Associated Spring.  Associated Spring manufactures and 
                    -----------------
          distributes a wide  variety of custom metal  parts for mechanical
          purposes.   It is equipped  to produce practically  every type of
          spring requiring  precision engineering, as well  as an extensive
          variety of precision metal components and assemblies.  Its 

                                 
          -----------------------
                    *As used in this annual report, "Company" refers to the
          registrant and  its consolidated  subsidiaries  except where  the
          context  requires  otherwise,  and  "Associated  Spring," "Barnes
          Aerospace," and "Bowman Distribution"  refer to the above-defined
          businesses, but not to separate corporate entities.



                                        - 1 -

          products range  in size from fine hairsprings  for instruments to
          large  springs for  heavy machinery,  and its  output of  a given
          metal  part  may  vary in  amount  from a  few  units  to several
          million.   Associated Spring does not produce leaf springs or bed
          springs.

                    Associated Spring's custom metal  parts are sold in the
          United States  and through the Company's  foreign subsidiaries to
          manufacturers in  many industries, chiefly for  use as components
          in their own  products.   Custom metal parts  are sold  primarily
          through Associated  Spring's sales  employees.   In  view of  the
          diversity of  functions  which Associated  Spring's custom  metal
          parts  perform, Associated  Spring's output  is characterized  by
          little standardization, with the major portion being manufactured
          to customer specifications.

                    The   automotive   and   automotive  parts   industries
          constitute Associated  Spring's largest single custom metal parts
          market.    Other  important  outlets  include   manufacturers  of
          industrial and textile machinery,  motors, generators, meters and
          other electrical  and electronic equipment,  aircraft, diesel and
          other  internal  combustion  engines,  household  appliances  and
          fixtures,  hardware,  office  equipment, agricultural  equipment,
          railroad  equipment, general machinery,  firearms, and scientific
          instruments.

                    The Associated Spring Distribution division  is engaged
          in  the distribution of industrial  products to the  tool and die
          market, of  which die  springs manufactured by  Associated Spring
          are the  principal item.   It  also distributes  certain standard
          parts manufactured by  Associated Spring consisting primarily  of
          stock  wire and flat springs  which are sold  under the Company's
          SPEC  registered  trademark.     The  Company  has  an  exclusive
          marketing agreement with Stroemsholmens  Mekaniska Verkstad AB to
          market Kaller nitrogen  gas springs and systems  in North America
          and other specified countries.

                    Associated Spring also  has manufacturing operations in
          Brazil,  Canada,   Mexico,   and  Singapore,   and   distribution
          operations  in the  United  Kingdom and  France.   In  1992,  the
          Company closed  its spring  manufacturing plant in  Dayton, Ohio.
          In 1993,  the Company  closed its spring  manufacturing plant  in
          Memphis,  Tennessee  and  transferred  the  warehouse  operations
          conducted  in Corry,  Pennsylvania  to a  new warehouse  facility
          located  in Ypsilanti, Michigan.   In 1994, it  closed its spring
          manufacturing  plants  in  Gardena,  California,  and  Monterrey,
          Mexico.  The Company has  retained a minority interest of  15% in
          its former subsidiary in Argentina.

                    The Company is a partner in a joint venture corporation
          in  the United States  with NHK Spring  Co., Ltd. of  Japan.  The
          joint  venture  corporation,  NHK-Associated   Spring  Suspension
          Components

                    Barnes Aerospace.  Barnes Aerospace is engaged in the 
                    ----------------
          advanced fabrication  and precision  machining of  components for
          jet engines and  airframes as well as the  repair and overhaul of
          jet engine components.  Windsor Manufacturing, Windsor Airmotive,
          and Advanced Fabrications constitute the Barnes Aerospace Group.

                    Windsor   Manufacturing   manufactures   machined   and
          fabricated  parts as well as  assemblies.  It  specializes in the
          machining  of  difficult-to-process aircraft  engine superalloys.

          machining,  electrical  discharge   machining,  laser   drilling,
          creep-feed  grinding, and automated deburring.  Customers include
          gas turbine engine manufacturers for commercial and military jets
          as well as  land-based turbines.  In 1993,  the operations of the
          Company's Central  Metal  Products plant  were consolidated  with
          Windsor Manufacturing.

                    Windsor  Airmotive  specializes  in   refurbishing  jet
          engine components.   Electron beam  welding and plasma  spray are
          two of the major  processes used in this division,  and customers

          processes including superplastic forming and diffusion bonding.

                    Segment  Analysis.The analysis of the Company's revenue
                    -----------------
          from  sales  to  unaffiliated  customers, operating  income,  and
          identifiable  assets by  industry segments  and geographic  areas
          appearing on  pages 26 and 27 of the Company's 1994 Annual Report
          to  Stockholders,  included as  Exhibit  13  to this  report,  is
          incorporated by reference.

                    Competition.  The Company competes with many other 
                    -----------
          companies, large and  small, engaged in the  manufacture and sale
          of  custom metal  parts  (including aerospace  components).   The
          Company  believes  Associated  Spring  is  the  largest  domestic
          manufacturer of precision  springs used for  mechanical purposes.
          The Company also faces active competition in the products sold by
          Bowman 

                                        - 3 -

<PAGE>

          Distribution.    The principal  methods  of  competition for  the
          Company's  three  businesses  include  service,  quality,  price,
          reliability of supply, and also, in the case of Associated Spring
          and Barnes Aerospace, technology and design.

                    Backlog. The backlog of the Company's orders believed to
                    -------
          be firm amounted to $108,143,000 at  the end of 1994, as compared
          with $102,596,000  at  the end  of 1993.   Of  the 1994  year-end
          backlog, $53,622,000  is  attributable to  the  Barnes  Aerospace
          Group  and all of the  balance is attributable  to the Associated
          Spring Group.   $16,067,000 of Barnes Aerospace's  backlog is not
          expected  to  be  shipped in  1995.    Substantially  all of  the
          remainder  of the  Company's  backlog is  expected to  be shipped
          during 1995.

                    Raw Materials and Customers.  None of the Company's 
                    ---------------------------
          divisions  or groups are dependent upon any single source for any
          of  their principal raw materials or products for resale, and all
          such  materials  and products  are  readily  available.   No  one
          customer  accounted for  more than  10% of  total sales  in 1994.
          Automotive manufacturers  continue to  be important customers  of
          Associated Spring.  Sales by Barnes Aerospace to two domestic jet
          engine  manufacturers  accounted  for approximately  50%  of  its
          business.   Bowman Distribution is not  dependent on any one or a
          few customers for a significant portion of its sales.

                    Research and Development.  Although most of the products
                    ------------------------
          manufactured  by  the  Company  are  custom  parts  made  to  the
          customers' specifications,  the Company is  engaged in continuing
          efforts aimed at discovering  and implementing new knowledge that
          is useful  in developing  new products  or services  or improving
          significantly an existing product or service.   The Company spent
          approximately   $2,640,000  on   its  research   and  development
          activities in 1994, as  compared to expenditures of approximately
          $1,846,000  in  1993  and $1,145,000  in  1992.    There were  no
          significant    customer-sponsored   research    and   development
          activities   in   1994.     Barnes   Aerospace   divisions  spent
          approximately $495,000 in 1993 on customer-sponsored research and
          development  activities compared to expenditures of approximately
          $6,882,000 in 1992.

                    Patents and Trademarks.  Patents, licenses, franchises 
                    ----------------------
          and  concessions  are  not  material  to  any  of  the  Company's
          businesses.

                    Employees.  As of the date of this report, the Company 
                    ---------
          employs approximately 4,200 persons.

                    Environmental  Laws.  Compliance with federal, state, and
                    ------------------
          local  laws  which have  been enacted  or adopted  regulating the
          discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating
          to  the  protection of  the environment  has  not had  a material
          effect and is  not expected  to have a  material effect upon  the
          capital expenditures, earnings,  or competitive  position of  the
          Company.

                        REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS ON
                            FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE




          To the Board of Directors
          of Barnes Group Inc.


          Our audit of the  consolidated financial statements referred to
          in our report  dated January 23,  1995 appearing on page  28 of
          the 1994  Annual Report  to Stockholders of  Barnes Group  Inc.
          (which  report  and   consolidated  financial  statements   are
          incorporated by reference  in this Annual Report  on Form 10-K)
          also included an audit of the Financial  Statement Schedule for
          the year ended  December 31, 1994 listed in  Item 14(a) of this
          Form 10-K.  In  our opinion, this Financial Statement  Schedule
          presents fairly, in all  material respects, the information set
          forth  therein  when  read  in  conjunction  with  the  related
          consolidated financial statements.

                           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS




          Stockholders and Board of Directors
          Barnes Group Inc.


          We have audited the consolidated  balance sheet of Barnes Group
          Inc.  as  of December  31,  1993 and  the  related consolidated
          statements of  income, stockholders' equity and  cash flows for
          each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 1993.
          Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed 
          in the Index at Item 14(a) for each of the two years in the period
          ended December 31, 1993.  These financial statements and schedule
          are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our 
          responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
          statements and schedule based on our audits.

          We conducted  our audits in accordance  with generally accepted
          auditing standards.   Those standards require that  we plan and
          perform the audit to  obtain reasonable assurance about whether
          the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An
          audit includes examining, on  a test basis, evidence supporting
          the amounts and  disclosures in the  financial statements.   An
          audit also  includes assessing the  accounting principles  used
          and  significant  estimates  made  by management,  as  well  as
          evaluating  the overall  financial statement presentation.   We
          believe that  our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for  our
          opinion.

          In our opinion, the  consolidated financial statements referred
          to  above  present  fairly,   in  all  material  respects,  the
          consolidated  financial  position  of   Barnes  Group  Inc.  at
          December  31,  1993  and   the  consolidated  results  of  its 
          operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the
          period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
          accepted accounting principles.  Also, in our opinion, the
          related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
          to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly
          in all material respects the information set forth therein.

          As  discussed   in  Note   1  to  the   consolidated  financial
          statements, the   Company  changed  its  methods  of accounting
          for income taxes and for certain postretirement and postemployment
          benefits in the year ended December 31, 1992.

                           ARTICLE I:  MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS



             SECTION 1.  Annual Meetings.

                       The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
                  Corporation for the election of directors and for the
                  transaction of such other business as may properly come
                  before the meeting shall be held at 10:30 A.M. on the first
                  Wednesday in April of each year or on such other date or
                  time as may be designated by the Board of Directors.


             SEC. 2.  Special Meetings.

                       Special meetings of the stockholders may be called at
                  any time by the Chairman, the President or the Board of
                  Directors.  (As used in these by-laws, the term "Chairman"
                  means the Chairman of the Company appointed pursuant to
                  Article IV Section 1 unless otherwise specified).


             SEC. 3.  Place of Meetings.

                       All meetings of the stockholders shall be held at such
                  place, within or without the State of Delaware, as may be

                  notice to be given to the stockholders in the manner
                  provided in Section 4 of this Article I.

                                                                         1

             SEC. 4.  Notice of Meetings.

                       Except as otherwise provided by statute, notice of each
                  meeting of the stockholders, whether annual or special,
                  shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to
                  vote thereat, not less than ten days before the day on which
                  the meeting is to be held, by delivering a written or
                  printed notice thereof to him personally or by posting such
                  notice in a postage prepaid envelope addressed to him at his
                  last known post-office address.  Except as otherwise
                  provided by statute, no publication of any notice of a
                  meeting of the stockholders shall be required.  Every notice
                  of a special meeting of stockholders, besides stating the
                  time and place of the meeting, shall state briefly the
                  objects thereof and no business other than that specified in
                  such notice and matters germane thereto shall be presented
                  at such meeting, except with the unanimous consent in
                  writing of the holders of all the outstanding shares of the
                  Corporation entitled to vote thereon.  Nevertheless, notice
                  of any meeting shall not be required to be given to any
                  stockholder who shall attend such meeting in person or by
                  proxy; and if any stockholder shall waive notice of any
                  meeting in person or by attorney thereunto authorized in
                  writing or by telegraph, notice thereof need not be given to
                  him.  Notice of any adjourned meeting of stockholders shall
                  not be required to be given.


             SEC. 5.  Quorum.

                       At each meeting of stockholders the holders of record
                  of a majority of the shares outstanding and entitled to vote

                                                                    2

<PAGE>

                  at such meeting, present in person or represented by proxy,
                  shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for
                  the transaction of business; provided that any number of
                  stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or repre-
                  sented by proxy at any annual election of directors, though
                  holding less than a majority of the shares out-standing and
                  entitled to vote at such election, may elect the directors. 
                  In the absence of a quorum, a majority in interest of the
                  stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or repre-
                  sented by proxy, or, if no such stockholder is present or
                  represented, any officer entitled to preside or act as
                  Secretary of such meeting, may adjourn the meeting from time
                  to time.  At any such adjourned meeting at which a quorum
                  may be present, any business may be transacted which might
                  have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
 

            SEC. 6.  Voting.

                      The Secretary or other officer who has charge of the
                  stock ledger shall prepare and make, at least ten days
                  before every election of directors, a complete list of the
                  stockholders entitled to vote at said election, arranged in
                  alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
                  stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name
                  of each stockholder.  Such list shall be open to the
                  examination of any stockholder during ordinary business
                  hours, for a period of at least ten days prior to the
                  election, either at a place within the city, town or village
                  where the election is to be held and which place shall be
                  specified in the notice of the meeting, or, if not so


                                                                         3

<PAGE>

                  specified, at the place where said meeting is to be held,
                  and the list shall be produced and kept at the time and
                  place of election during the whole time thereof, and subject
                  to the inspection of any stockholder who may be present.

                       Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of
                  Incorporation or these By-Laws, each stockholder shall at
                  every meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in
                  person or by proxy for each share of stock held by such
                  stockholder, but no proxy shall be voted on after three
                  years from its date unless the proxy provides for a longer
                  period.  Except where the transfer books of the Corporation
                  shall have been closed or a date shall have been fixed as a
                  record date for the determination of its stockholders
                  entitled to vote, as provided in Section 5 of Article VII of
                  these By-Laws, no share of stock shall be voted on at any
                  election for directors which shall have been transferred on
                  the books of the Corporation within twenty days next pre-
                  ceding such election.  Persons holding shares in a fiduciary
                  capacity shall be entitled to vote the shares so held.  At
                  all meetings of the stockholders all matters, other than
                  those the manner of deciding which is expressly regulated by
                  statute, by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by these
                  By-Laws, shall be decided by the vote of a majority in
                  interest of the stockholders present in person or repre-
                  sented by proxy and entitled to vote, a quorum being
                  present.  The vote for directors shall be by ballot.

                                                                         4

                  provided in the Certificate of Incorporation of the
                  Corporation with respect to the right of holders of pre-
                  ferred stock of the Corporation to nominate and elect a
                  specified number of directors in certain circumstances. 
                  Nominations of persons for election to the Board of
                  Directors may be made at any annual meeting of stockholders,
                  or at any special meeting of stockholders called for the
                  purpose of electing directors, (a) by or at the direction of
                  the Board of Directors (or any duly authorized committee

                  entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who complies with
                  the notice procedures set forth in this Section 7 of this
                  Article I.

                       In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a

                  must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form
                  to the Secretary of the Corporation.

                  executive offices of the Corporation (a) in the case of an

                  provided, however, that in the event that the annual meeting
                  is called for a date that is not within thirty (30) days

                  than the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following
                  the day on which such notice of the date of the annual
                  meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date of
                  the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs; and (b)

                  information relating to the person that would be required to
                  be disclosed in a proxy statement or other filings required
                  to be made in connection with solicitations of proxies for

                                                                    6

                  holder intends to appear in person or by proxy at the
                  meeting to nominate the persons named in its notice and (v)
                  any other information relating to such stockholder that
                  would be required to be disclosed in a proxy statement or
                  other filings required to be made in connection with solici-

                                                                        7

             SEC. 8.

                  stockholders, other than business that is either (a)
                  specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement
                  thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board of
                  Directors (or any duly authorized committee thereof), (b)
                  otherwise properly brought before the annual meeting by or

                  authorized committee thereof) or (c) otherwise properly
                  brought before the annual meeting by any stockholder of the
                  Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date

                  mination of stockholders entitled to vote at such annual
                  meeting and (ii) who complies with the notice procedures set
                  forth in this Section 8 of this Article I.

                       In addition to any other applicable requirements, for
                  business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by
                  a stockholder, such stockholder must have given timely

                  must be delivered to or mailed and received at the principal
                  executive offices of the Corporation not less than sixty
                  (60) days nor more than ninety (90) days prior to the
                  anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting
                  of stockholders; provided, however, that in the event that
                  the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within
                  thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date,

                                                                      8

                  notice by the stockholder in order to be timely must be so
                  received not later than the close of business on the tenth
                  (10th) day following the day on which such notice of the
                  date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public dis-
                  closure of the date of the annual meeting was made, which-
                  ever first occurs.

                       To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to
                  the Secretary must set forth as to each matter such stock-
                  holder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a
                  brief description of the business desired to be brought
                  before the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting
                  such business at the annual meeting, (ii) the name and
                  record address of such stock-holder, (iii) the class or
                  series and number of shares of capital stock of the
                  Corporation which are owned beneficially or of record by
                  such stockholder, (iv) a description of all arrangements or
                  understandings between such stockholder and any other person
                  or persons (including their names) in connection with the
                  proposal of such business by such stockholder and any
                  material interest of such stockholder in such business and
                  (v) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear
                  in person or by proxy at the annual meeting to bring such
                  business before the meeting.

                       No business shall be conducted at the annual meeting of
                  stockholders except business brought before the annual
                  meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
                  Section 8 of this Article I, provided, however, that, once
                  business has been properly brought before the annual meeting
                  in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this Section

                                                                    9

<PAGE>

                  8 of this Article I shall be deemed to preclude discussion
                  by any stockholder of any such business.  If the Chairman of
                  an annual meeting determines that business was not properly
                  brought before the annual meeting in accordance with the
                  foregoing procedures, the Chairman shall declare to the
                  meeting that the business was not properly brought before
                  the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.

                                                                       10

                              ARTICLE II:  BOARD OF DIRECTORS


             SECTION 1.  General Powers.

                       The property, affairs and business of the Corporation
                  shall be managed by the Board of Directors.


             SEC. 2.  Number, Classification, Term of Office, and
             Qualifications.

                       The number of directors to constitute the whole Board
                  of Directors shall be nine, but such number may from time to
                  time be increased, or diminished to not less than three, by
                  resolution adopted by the Board of Directors.  The Board of
                  Directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly
                  equal in number as may be, with the term of office of one
                  class expiring each year.  At the annual meeting of
                  stockholders in 1970, directors of the first class shall be
                  elected to hold office for a term expiring at the next
                  succeeding annual meeting, directors of the second class
                  shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the
                  second succeeding annual meeting and directors of the third
                  class shall be elected to hold office for a term expiring at
                  the third succeeding annual meeting.  At each annual meeting
                  of stockholders after 1970, successors to the directors
                  whose terms shall then expire shall be elected to hold
                  office for terms expiring at the third succeeding annual
                  meeting, except that any director elected to a directorship
                  newly created since the last annual meeting shall hold
                  office for the same term as the other directors of the class
                  to which such director has been assigned.  When the number

                                                                        11

<PAGE>

                  of directors is changed, any newly created directorships or
                  any decrease in directorships shall be so assigned among the
                  classes by the Board of Directors as to make all classes as
                  nearly equal in number as may be.  Each director shall
                  continue in office until his successor shall have been
                  elected and qualified or until his death or until his
                  resignation or removal in the manner hereinafter provided. 
                  No director need be a stockholder, nor a resident of the
                  State of Delaware.


             SEC. 3.  Election of Directors.

                       At each meeting of the stockholders for the election of
                  directors, the directors shall be elected by a plurality of
                  the votes given at such election.


             SEC. 4.  Place of Meetings, etc.

                       The directors may hold their meetings and have one or
                  more offices, and keep the books of the Corporation, outside
                  of Delaware, at the office or place of business of the
                  Corporation in the City of Bristol, Connecticut, or at such
                  other places as they may from time to time determine.


             SEC. 5.  Time of Meetings, Notices, etc.

                       There shall be a meeting of the Board of Directors for
                  organization, for the election of officers and for the
                  transaction of such other business as may properly come
                  before the meeting on the date of the annual meeting of
                  stockholders or within thirty days thereafter upon the
                  notice hereinafter provided for a special meeting.  The

                                                                     12

<PAGE>

                  directors may, however, without notice, hold such meeting in
                  the city where the annual meeting of stockholders is held
                  and immediately following such annual meeting of stock-
                  holders.  At the organizational meeting, the Directors shall
                  elect one of the director or Chairman of the Board of
                  Directors.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors, or in
                  his/her absence, the Chairman of the Board's Executive
                  Committee, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of
                  Directors.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors may be
                  removed as Chairman of the Board of Directors at any time by
                  the Board of Directors.  The Board of Directors by
                  resolution may provide for the holding of regular meetings
                  and may fix the time of holding such meetings.  Such regular
                  meetings of the Board of Directors may be held without
                  notice.  Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be
                  called by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, the
                  Chairman, the President or any three directors.  Unless
                  otherwise specified in the notice or waiver of notice
                  thereof, all meetings of the Board of Directors shall be
                  held at the office of the Corporation in Bristol,
                  Connecticut.  Notice of each special meeting shall be mailed
                  to each director addressed to him at his residence or usual
                  place of business at least seven days before the day on
                  which the meeting is to be held or shall be sent to him at
                  such place by telegraph, or telephoned or delivered to him
                  personally, not later than three days before the day on
                  which the meeting is to be held, unless the Chairman of the
                  Board of Directors, the Chairman or the President determines
                  that circumstances require that a meeting be held on shorter

                                                                         13

<PAGE>

                  notice.  Notice of any meeting need not be given to any
                  director, however, if waived by him in writing or by
                  telegraph.  Any meeting of the Board of Directors shall be a
                  legal meeting without any notice thereof having been given
                  if all the directors shall be present thereat.


             SEC. 6.  Quorum and Manner of Acting.

                       A majority of the directors at the time in office (but
                  not less than one-third of the number necessary to
                  constitute the whole Board) at a meeting duly assembled
                  shall be necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum for
                  the transaction of business, subject, however, to the
                  provisions of Section 9 of this Article II.  Except as
                  otherwise provided by law or in these By-Laws, the act of a
                  majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a
                  quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of
                  Directors.  In the absence of a quorum, a majority of the
                  directors present at any meeting may adjourn the meeting
                  from time to time until a quorum be had.  Notice of any
                  adjourned meeting need not be given.  The directors shall
                  act only as a Board and the individual directors shall have
                  no power as such.


             SEC. 7.  Resignations.

                       Any director may resign at any time by giving written
                  notice to the Chairman of the Board, the Chairman, the
                  President or the Secretary.  Such resignation shall take
                  effect at the time specified therein; and unless otherwise 

                                                                         14

<PAGE>

                  specified therein the acceptance of such resignation shall
                  not be necessary to make it effective.


             SEC. 8.  Removal of Directors.

                       Any director may be removed at any time for cause, at a
                  meeting of stockholders called for the purpose, by the
                  affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two-thirds
                  of the outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation
                  entitled to vote in elections of directors, considered for
                  the purposes of this Section 8 as one class.


             SEC. 9.  Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships.

                       Any vacancy occurring among the directors by death,
                  resignation, removal or otherwise and any newly created
                  directorships may be filled by a majority of the directors
                  then in office, though less than a quorum, or, in the event
                  such directors are unable to act, by the stockholders.  Each
                  director elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for the
                  unexpired term in respect of which such vacancy occurred. 
                  Each director elected to a newly created directorship shall
                  hold office until the next annual meeting of stockholders.

                                                                      15

                           COMMITTEES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 
             SECTION 1.  How Constituted.

                       The Board of Directors, by resolution or resolutions
                  passed by a majority of the whole Board, may appoint an
                  Executive Committee, an Audit Committee and such other
                  committees as the Board of Directors may determine.  The
                  Executive Committee and Audit Committee shall consist of
                  three or more directors, and each such other committee shall
                  consist of two or more directors, as determined by the Board
                  of Directors.  The Executive Committee shall have the powers

             SECTION 1.  Reimbursement.

                       Each director and officer of the Corporation shall be
                  entitled to reimbursement for his reasonable expenses
                  incurred in connection with his attention to the affairs of
                  the Corporation, including attendance at meetings.  Each
                  employee of the Corporation other than an officer shall be
                  entitled to such reimbursement for his reasonable expenses
                  incurred in connection with his attention to the affairs of
                  the Corporation as the Board of Directors, the Executive

                  (a)  Each person who was or is a party or is threatened to

                       or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative
                       or investigative (hereinafter a "proceeding"), by
                       reason of the fact that he/she, or a person of whom
                       he/she is the legal representative, is or was a
                       director or officer of the Corporation or is or was
                       serving at the request of the Corporation as a
                       director, officer, employee or agent of another
                       corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust
                       or other enterprise, including service with respect to
                       employee benefit plans, whether the basis of such

                       capacity or in any other capacity while serving as a
                       director, officer, employee or agent, shall be
                       indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation to the
                       fullest extent permitted by the laws of Delaware, as
                       the same exist or may hereafter be amended, against all
                       costs, charges, expenses, liabilities and losses
                       (including attorneys' fees, judgments, fines, employee
                       benefit plan excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid
                       or to be paid in settlement reasonably incurred or
                       suffered by such person in connection therewith, and
                       such indemnification shall continue as to a person who
                       has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent
                       and shall inure to the benefit of his/her heirs,
                       executors and administrators; provided, however, that,
                       except as provided in subdivision (b) of this Section
                       2, the Corporation shall indemnify any such person
                       seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding
                       (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if such
                       proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the
                       Board.  The right to indemnification conferred in this
                       Section 2 shall include the right to be paid by the
                       Corporation the expenses incurred in defending any such
                       proceeding in advance of its final disposition;
                       provided, however, that, if the Delaware General
                       Corporation Law requires, the payment of such expenses
                       incurred by a director or officer in his/her capacity
                       as a director or officer (and not in any other capacity
                       in which service was or is rendered by such person

                                                                     27

                       while a director or officer, including, without
                       limitation, service to any employee benefit plan) in
                       advance of the final disposition of a proceeding, shall
                       be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an
                       undertaking, by or on behalf of such director or
                       officer, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
                       ultimately be determined that such director or officer
                       is not entitled to be indemnified under this
                       subdivision (a) or otherwise.  The Corporation may, by
                       action of the Board, provide indemnification to
                       employees and agents of the Corporation with the same
                       scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of
                       directors and officers.

                  (b)  If a claim under subdivision (a) of this Section 2 is
                       not paid in full by the Corporation within sixty days
                       after a written claim has been received by the
                       Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter
                       bring suit against the Corporation to recover the
                       unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole
                       or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid
                       also the expense of prosecuting such claim.  It shall
                       be a defense to any such action (other than an action
                       brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in
                       defending any proceeding in advance of its final
                       disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
                       required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that
                       the claimant has failed to meet a standard of conduct
                       which makes it permissible under the Delaware law for

                                                                       28

                       the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the
                       amount claimed.  Neither the failure of the Corporation
                       (including the Board, independent legal counsel, or its
                       stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the
                       commencement of such action that indemnification of the
                       claimant is permissible in the circumstances because
                       he/she has met such standard of conduct, nor an actual
                       determination by the Corporation (including the Board,
                       independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that
                       the claimant has not met such standard of conduct,
                       shall be a defense to the action or create a
                       presumption that the claimant has failed to meet such
                       standard of conduct.

                  (c)  The right to indemnification and the payment of
                       expenses incurred in defending a proceeding in advance
                       of its final disposition conferred in this Section 2
                       shall not be exclusive of any other right which any
                       person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute,
                       provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws,
                       agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
                       directors or otherwise.

                  (d)  The Corporation may maintain insurance, at its expense,
                       to protect itself and any director, officer, employee
                       or agent of the Corporation or another corporation,
                       partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise
                       against any such expense, liability or loss, whether or
                       not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify

                                                                       29

                       such person against such expense, liability or loss
                       under Delaware law.

                  (e)  To the extent that any director, officer, employee or
                       agent of the Corporation is by reason of such position,
                       or a position with another entity at the request of the
                       Corporation, a witness in any action, suit or
                       proceeding, he shall be indemnified against all costs
                       and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by him or
                       on his behalf in connection therewith.

                  (f)  The Corporation may enter into agreements with any
                       director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation
                       providing for indemnification to the full extent
                       permitted by Delaware law.

                  (g)  For purposes of this Section 2, the term "Board" shall
                       mean the Board of Directors of the Corporation or, to
                       the extent permitted by the laws of Delaware, as the
                       same exist or may hereafter be amended, its Executive
                       Committee.  On vote of the Board, the Corporation may
                       assent to the adoption of this Article V by any
                       subsidiary, whether or not wholly owned.

                  (h)  The rights provided by this Section 2 shall not be
                       available with respect to any claim asserted against
                       the director, officer, employee or agent which is based
                       on matters which antedate the adoption of this Section 

                                                                     30

                       effect prior to April 2, 1987.

                  (i)  If any provision of this Section 2 shall for any reason
                       be determined to be invalid, the remaining provisions
                       hereof shall not be affected thereby but shall remain

                  contract or execute and deliver any instrument in the name
                  of and on behalf of the Corporation, and such authority may
                  be general or confined to specific instances; and, unless so
                  authorized, no officer, agent or employee shall have any
                  power or authority to bind the Corporation by any contract
                  or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable
                  pecuniarily for any purpose or to any amount.

                  registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has
                  been placed upon a certificate shall have ceased to be such
                  officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate
                  is issued, the certificate may be issued by the Corporation
                  with the same effect as if he/she were such officer,

                  agents and registrars, if any, shall be entitled to treat
                  the holder of record of any share or shares of stock as the

                  shall not be bound to recognize any legal, equitable or
                  other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the

                  of the Corporation or to any of its transfer agents, such
                  fact shall be expressed in the entry of the transfer.

                  may issue a new certificate in the place of any certificate
                  theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost or
                  destroyed, but the Board of Directors or Executive Committee
                  may require the owner of the lost or destroyed certificate
                  or his/her legal representatives to give a bond in such sum,
                  not exceeding double the value of the shares, and with such

                  issuance, transfer and registration of certificates for
                  shares of the stock of the Corporation.  It may appoint
                  transfer agents or registrars of transfers, or both, and may
                  require all certificates of stock to bear the signature of

                  or conversion or exchange of capital stock shall go into
                  effect; provided, however, that in lieu of closing the stock
                  transfer books as aforesaid, the Board of Directors may fix

                  allotment or rights, or to exercise such rights, as the case
                  may be, notwithstanding any transfer of any stock on the
                  books of the Corporation after any such record date fixed as
                  aforesaid.

                                                                    38

                                  BARNES GROUP INC.
                                  -----------------
                        MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN
                        --------------------------------------


          SECTION l.   Purpose
          --------------------
               The Management Incentive Compensation Plan ("MICP") is
          designed to provide incentive compensation opportunities to per-
          sons in key positions who contribute importantly to the success
          of Barnes Group Inc. (the "Company").  

          SECTION 2.   Administration
          ---------------------------
               The MICP shall be administered by the Compensation Committee
          of the Board of Directors or its successor (the "Committee"). 
          Amounts paid or projected to be paid under the MICP are referred
          to herein as "Awards".

          SECTION 3.  Incentive Funds
          ---------------------------
          3.1  Prior to March 1st of each year, the Committee will deter-
               mine which units should have separate incentive funds.  For
               each fund it will then set:

               a.   a Performance Profit level above which an Award will be
                    earned (the "Base"),

               b.   the percent of total base salary in the fund which will
                    be paid as an Award if Performance Profit equals the
                    Performance Profit in the current operating plan, and

               c.   the amount of Performance Profit which will yield the
                    maximum payout (the "Maximum").

                    The Committee may also designate an intermediate level
               of Performance Profit between the Base and the Maximum (the

                                          1
<PAGE>

               Management Incentive Compensation Plan
               --------------------------------------

               "Target") and the percent of salary which will be paid as an
               Award if Performance Profit equals the Target.

                    Based on the above determinations by the Committee and
               the total actual base salaries of the participants in each
               incentive fund, the Vice President-Controller shall
               calculate participation rates for each fund.  The Incentive
               Fund available at the end of the year for payment of Awards
               shall be equal to the participation rate(s) times the
               applicable amount by which Performance Profit exceeds the
               profit objective(s).  Performance Profit will be adjusted to
               exclude amounts for any extraordinary and non-recurring
               items designated for exclusion by the Committee or for other
               factors deemed appropriate by the Committee.  

          3.2  For participants in the Corporate Incentive Fund, Net Income
               shall be used for all purposes rather than Performance
               Profit.  Net Income will be adjusted to exclude the after-
               tax effect of any extraordinary and non-recurring items
               designated for exclusion by the Committee or for other
               factors deemed appropriate by the Committee.  

          3.3  The Committee may also elect to use Net Income rather than
               Performance Profit for units based outside the United
               States.

          SECTION 4.  Participants
          ------------------------
               Prior to March 1st of each year, the Chief Executive Officer
          of the Company, upon the recommendations of the group presidents

          Management Incentive Compensation Plan
          --------------------------------------


          and the senior staff officers, shall designate participants in
          the MICP for the current year and the funds in which they shall
          participate.  (The designation will be incorporated in a memo-
          randum from the Chief Executive Officer to the Vice President-
          Controller.)  The Chief Executive Officer shall participate in
          the MICP and in the Corporate Incentive Fund.  New employees and
          persons who are promoted during the year may be added as partici-
          pants during the year by the Chief Executive Officer upon written
          notice to the Vice President-Controller.  

          SECTION 5.  Grant of Awards
          ---------------------------
          5.1  The Committee shall meet each December to make determina-
               tions relating to the Awards to be made under the MICP.

          5.2  The Vice President-Controller shall provide to the Committee
               an estimate of each Incentive Fund for the year and the
               estimated percent of salaries earned as Awards by partici-
               pants based on the objectives set by the Committee pursuant
               to Section 3 hereof.

          5.3  The Committee will then decide the portion of each Incentive
               Fund which will be collectively awarded to the participants
               in the fund; provided, however, that the Incentive Fund may
               not exceed 50% of the total base compensation of all the
               participants in the fund.

          5.4  In December the Committee shall decide each officer's per-
               centage share of his/her applicable fund.  However, no

                                          3
<PAGE>

          Management Incentive Compensation Plan
          --------------------------------------


               officer may be awarded a share which would result in an
               Award which is greater than 50% of his/her base compensation
               for the year with respect to which the Award is made.

                    Each officer's percentage share of the Incentive Fund
               is subject to adjustment if the actual amount of the fund
               determined on the basis of full year actual figures
               increases from the December estimate by an amount such that
               the application of said percentage share would result in an
               Award which exceeded 50%.

                    Any excess amount resulting from the above limitation
               shall be distributed among the other participants unless
               decided otherwise prior to year end.  

          5.5  After the end of the year and based on the final amount of
               each Incentive Fund, the Chief Executive Officer, upon
               recommendation from the group presidents and the senior
               staff officers, shall determine each participant's share of
               the Incentive Funds (except for officers of the Company). 
               However, no participant may be awarded a share which would
               result in an Award which is greater than 50% of his/her base
               compensation for the year with respect to which the Award is
               made.  

          5.6  The Committee shall have full authority to determine that no
               portion of an Incentive Fund will be paid, and to refrain
               from making an Award to any officer.  Except for persons who
               retire, die, or become permanently disabled during the year,

          Management Incentive Compensation Plan
          --------------------------------------


               a person must be employed by the Company or one of its
               subsidiaries on December 1st in order to receive an Award,
               unless the Committee decides otherwise in individual cases.

          SECTION 6.   Payment
          --------------------
          6.1  Prior to March 1st, a report signed by the Vice President,
               Controller and the Chief Financial Officer specifying the
               final Incentive Funds and the percent of salaries to be
               awarded to Participants will be given to the Committee.  

          6.2  Awards shall be paid prior to March 1st, unless otherwise
               decided by the Committee.

          SECTION 7.  General
          -------------------
          7.1  The interpretation of this plan by the Committee and its
               decisions on all questions arising under this plan shall be
               conclusive and binding on all concerned parties.

          7.2  This plan may be amended at any time, including retro-
               actively, by the Committee.

          SECTION l.   PURPOSE
          --------------------
               The Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP") is designed to provide
          incentive compensation to key executives of Barnes Group Inc.
          (the "Company") and its subsidiaries in a form which relates the
          financial reward to an increase in the value of the Company to
          its shareholders.  The plan shall be administered by the
          Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the
          "Committee").

               Equity, except for the cycles prior to the 1995-1997 cycle
               such equity shall be determined without regard for the
               effects of the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
               No. 106 ("FAS 106") and No. 112 ("FAS 112"), and the one-
               time effect of the initial adoption of FAS 109 and the one-
               time FAS 109 adjustment in 1993 of $800,000 resulting from a
               change in the U.S. federal tax rate, multiplied by the sum
               of

               (i)  a risk-free rate of return equal to the average of the
                    interest rates for Treasury Bills of 90-day maturity on
                    the first business day of each month, or such other
                    standard as may be designated by the Committee; plus

                    investment times the average Beta for the Company's
                    stock for each calendar year as published by Value Line
                    or some other source designated by the Committee.

               Average Stockholder's Equity shall be computed by adding
               stockholder's equity on December 31st of the prior year to
               stockholder's equity at the end of each month of the
               applicable year and dividing the result by 13.

          2.2  Economic Return.  Economic Return for any year equals Cash 
               ---------------
               Flow From Operations less the Cost of Equity divided by the
               average number of common shares outstanding for the year. 
               In computing Economic Return, the Committee may make adjust-
               ments for any extraordinary changes which occur during an
               Incentive Award Period.

          2.3  Cash Flow From Operations.  Cash Flow From Operations equals
               -------------------------
               net income, less any dividends on preferred stock, plus
               depreciation and amortization, losses (gains) on sale of
               plant, property and equipment, and other assets, and
               translation losses (gains) as appropriate in computing cash
               provided from operations.  For cycles prior to the 1995-1997
               cycle, cash flows will be determined without regard to FAS
               106, and FAS 112, and the one-time effect of the initial
               adoption of FAS 109 in 1992 and the one-time FAS 109
               adjustment in 1993 of $800,000 resulting from a change in
               the U.S. federal tax rate.  In addition, cash flow from
               operations shall include the increase (decrease) in deferred

               income tax liabilities in all years through 1991 but be
               excluded from the calculation in 1992 and thereafter.  For
               cycles beginning with the 1995-1997 cycle, which include
               1992 in the base period, net income shall exclude the
               cumulative effect of the accounting changes for FAS 106,
               109, and FAS 112.

          2.4  Performance Unit.  A Performance Unit is the form of award 
               ----------------
               under the LTIP.  Its value in any year is equal to the sum
               of the Economic Returns for the five preceding calendar
               years.


          SECTION 3.  ADMINISTRATION
          --------------------------
               The Committee shall designate participants, award a number
          of Performance Units to each participant, and perform all other
          actions necessary to the proper administration of the LTIP.  The
          interpretation by the Committee of the LTIP and any awards made
          hereunder shall be binding upon the participants and the Company.


          SECTION 4.  PARTICIPANTS
          ------------------------

          SECTION 5.  GRANT OF INCENTIVE AWARDS
          -------------------------------------
          5.1  Prior to March 1 of each year, the Committee shall determine
               whether or not Performance Units will be granted in the
               current year.  If they are to be granted, the Committee
               shall:
               (a)  establish an Incentive Award Period which will commence
                    on January 1 of the current year and terminate on
                    January 1 of a year selected by the Committee;
                    provided, however, that in no event shall it be less
                    than 24 months; and
               (b)  designate recipients of Performance Units and the
                    number of Performance Units to be awarded to each
                    participant.
          5.2  During an Incentive Award Period, new employees and
               employees who are promoted or transferred may be granted new
               or additional Performance Units.


          SECTION 6.  PAYMENT
          -------------------
          6.1  Incentive award payments shall be calculated by multiplying
               the number of Performance Units held by a participant times
               the increase, if any, in the value of the Performance Unit
               between the beginning and end of the Incentive Award Period.
          6.2  If a participant has not worked at the Company unit with
               respect to which his Performance Units were granted for the
               entire Incentive Award Period, the Committee may direct that

          ------------------------



               payment under any such Performance Unit will be reduced by
               multiplying its value by a fraction, the numerator of which
               shall be the number of full calendar months of the Incentive
               Award Period during which the Participant worked at said
               Company unit, and the denominator of which shall be the
               number of full calendar months in the Incentive Award
               Period.

          6.3  Notwithstanding anything in the LTIP to the contrary, the
               amount of payment made to each participant shall be in the
               sole discretion of the Committee.  The amount of all such
               payments shall be determined by the Committee within 90 days
               after the end of the Incentive Award Period.

          6.4  The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine
               whether all or any portion of any payment made with respect
               to the Performance Units held by each participant shall be
               deferred and credited to a participant's Incentive Deferred
               Compensation Account.

          6.5  As soon as practical after the amount of any award is deter-
               mined, it shall be paid in cash to the participant or all or
               part of it shall be credited to the participant's Incentive
               Deferred Compensation Account, all in accord with the
               procedures specified in paragraph 9.

          SECTION 7.  EFFECT OF TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT OR DEATH
          --------------------------------------------------------
               If a participant ceases to be an employee prior to the end
          of an Incentive Award Period other than by reason of death,
          disability, or retirement after attaining age 55, then the
          Performance Units granted to the participant shall terminate.  If
          a participant ceases to be an employee because of death,
          disability, or retirement after attaining age 55, then payment
          under his Performance Units may be adjusted as set forth in
          paragraph 6.2.


          SECTION 8.  TRANSFERABILITY
          ---------------------------
               Performance Units and any amount standing to a person's
          credit in the Incentive Deferred Compensation Account may not be
          transferred or assigned by a participant except by will or by the
          laws of descent and distribution.


          SECTION 9.  INCENTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION ACCOUNT
          ---------------------------------------------------

          9.1  To the extent that the Committee decided to defer payment of
               any award made under the LTIP, the amount of such deferred
               award shall be credited to the Company's Incentive Deferred
               Compensation Account.  The Company shall not be required to
               segregate or earmark assets with respect to such account and
               participants shall have no interest in any specific asset as
               a result of the creation of such account or of any award

               under the LTIP.  All funds in such accounts shall be
               available for general corporate purposes.

          9.2  Interest will be credited quarterly on the unpaid amount
               standing to any participant's credit in the Incentive
               Deferred Compensation Account at the end of each quarter. 
               On or as soon as practical after the first business day of
               January, the Company will pay to each participant who is
               less than 60 years old the interest credited to his account
               with respect to the prior year.  No cash payment will be
               made to participants who are employed by the Company and who
               have attained age 60.

          9.3  The interest rate for purposes of computing interest under
               paragraph 9.2 shall be the rate of interest for prime
               commercial loans of 90-day maturities charged by Chemical
               Bank (or such other New York City bank as the Committee may
               select) on the first business day of each quarter.

          9.4  Payments from the amount standing to a participant's credit
               in the Incentive Deferred Compensation Account shall begin
               on the first day of the month following the month in which
               the participant ceases to be an employee of the Company. 
               Payments shall be made in 120 monthly installments (as equal
               as possible); provided, however, that, except if otherwise
               decided by the Committee, the entire amount then standing to
               the participant's credit in the Incentive Deferred
               Compensation Account shall be paid in one lump sum to any

          person whose employment is terminated other than by death or by
          early or normal retirement under the applicable retirement plan.
          Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the
          Committee may in its discretion either:

               (i)  without the consent of the participant, advance the
                    time of payment of any unpaid portion of the award; or

              (ii)  if the consent of the participant is obtained, further
                    defer the time of payment of any unpaid portion of the
                    award to a time not later than 15 years after the ter-
                    mination of the participant's employment.

          9.5  No amendment or termination of the LTIP shall reduce or
               cancel any amount standing to a participant's credit in the
               Incentive Deferred Compensation Account, prior to the
               effective date of such amendment or termination.

          9.6  In the event of the death of a participant while there is
               still an amount standing to the participant's credit in the
               Incentive Deferred Compensation Account, the amount shall be
               paid to the beneficiary designated by the participant in
               installments; provided, however, that (a) if the beneficiary
               is the participant's estate, the funds shall be paid in a
               lump sum, and (b) notwithstanding anything in this section
               to the contrary, the Committee may advance the time of
               payment to a beneficiary of any unpaid funds credited to the
               Incentive Deferred Compensation Account.  In the absence of
               a designated beneficiary, any amount standing to the

<PAGE>
                        (ii)  a stock appreciation right, in accordance
                              with Section 6;

                         (v)  a combination of two or more of the
                              foregoing.

          4.   Stock Subject to the Plan
          ------------------------------
               (a)  Subject to adjustment as provided in Section 9, the
                    aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which may be
                    issued subject to Incentives granted under the Plan
                    shall not exceed the sum of (i) 500,000 shares and (ii)
                    the number of shares of stock covered by outstanding
                    options (or installments thereof) granted under the
                    1981 Plan which, after its expiration, shall terminate
                    or expire in whole or in part without being exercised. 
                    Charges against such aggregate number are governed by
                    the provisions of paragraph (c) of this Section 4,
                    paragraph (j) of Section 5, paragraph (e) of Section 6,
                    paragraph (c) of Section 7, and paragraph (e) of
                    Section 8.

               (b)  Such shares may be either authorized but unissued
                    shares or shares issued and thereafter acquired by the
                    Company.

               (c)  If any shares subject to an Incentive shall cease to be
                    subject thereto because of the termination without
                    exercise or payment, in whole or in part, of such
                    Incentive, the shares as to which the Incentive was not

                                          3

<PAGE>
                    exercised or paid shall no longer be charged against
                    the limits in paragraph (a) of this Section 4 and may
                    again be made subject to Incentives.

               (d)  The Committee may permit the voluntary surrender of all
                    or a portion of any Incentive granted under this Plan
                    conditioned upon the granting to the employee of a new
                    Incentive for the same or a different number of shares
                    or amount of other payment as the Incentive
                    surrendered, or it may require such voluntary surrender
                    as a condition to a grant of a new Incentive to such
                    employee.  Such new Incentive shall be exercisable at
                    the price, during the period, and in accordance with
                    any other terms or conditions specified by the
                    Committee at the time the new Incentive is granted, all
                    determined in accordance with the provisions of this
                    Plan without regard to the price, period of exercise,
                    or any other terms or conditions of the Incentive
                    surrendered.


          5.   Options
          ------------
               Incentives, in the form of options to purchase shares of
          Common Stock, shall be subject to the following provisions:

               (a)  The Option price per share shall be determined as of
                    the effective date of the grant and shall not be less
                    than 85% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock
                    at the time of the grant of the Option.  In no event
                    shall the Option price be less than the par value of
                    the stock which is the subject of the Option.

               (b)  Each Option shall expire at such time as the Committee
                    may determine at the time the Option is granted;
                    provided, however, that no Option may, under any 

                                          4

<PAGE>
                    circumstances, expire later than ten years from the
                    date such Option shall have been granted.

               (c)  Any Option granted under the Plan may be exercised
                    solely by the person to whom granted, by his/her
                    guardian or legal representative, or, in the case of
                    death, by an estate.

               (d)  No Option may be exercised less than 12 months from the
                    date it is granted.  After completion of any additional
                    required period of employment specified in the Option
                    grant, the Option may be exercised, in whole or in
                    part, at any time or from time to time during the
                    balance of the term of the Option, except as limited by
                    provisions contained in the Option (including
                    provisions regarding exercise in installments).

               (e)  If the optionee terminates employment prior to
                    attaining age 55, the Option shall terminate 90 days
                    after termination of employment, except in the case of
                    death or disability.

               (f)  If employment terminates as a result of death or dis-
                    ability, or if the Optionee terminates employment after
                    attaining age 55, the Option shall terminate five years
                    after termination of employment; provided, however, if
                    the Optionee's employment is terminated upon the
                    request of the Company after the Optionee attains age
                    55, the Option may be terminated by the Committee
                    effective 90 days after termination of employment.

               (g)  Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 5 to the
                    contrary, the Committee may provide that an option will
                    terminate prior to time periods specified in paragraphs
                    5(e) and 5(f) on conditions specified by the Committee

                                          5

<PAGE>
                    and incorporated in an Option Agreement between the
                    Company and the person receiving the option.

               (h)  Shares purchased upon exercise of an Option shall be
                    paid for in full within twenty days of the date of
                    exercise in cash or, with the consent of the Committee,
                    in whole or in part in shares of Common Stock based on
                    their Fair Market Value on the date of exercise.

               (i)  If so authorized by the Committee, the Company may,
                    with the consent of the optionee, and at any time or
                    from time to time, cancel all or a portion of any
                    Option granted under the Plan then subject to exercise
                    and discharge its obligation in respect of the Option
                    either by payment to the optionee of an amount of cash
                    equal to the excess, if any, of the Fair Market Value,
                    at such time, of the shares subject to the portion of
                    the Option so cancelled over the aggregate option price
                    of such shares, or by issuance or transfer to the
                    optionee of shares of Common Stock with a Fair Market
                    Value, at such time, equal to any such excess, or by a
                    combination of cash and shares.

               (j)  The forms of Option authorized by the Plan may contain
                    such other provisions as the Committee shall deem
                    advisable.

               (k)  Upon the exercise of an Option there shall be charged
                    against the limits in paragraph (a) of Section 4 the
                    number of shares issued to the optionee.  Upon the
                    cancellation of any Option pursuant to paragraph (h) of
                    Section 5, there shall be charged against the
                    limitations in paragraph (a) of Section 4 a number of
                    shares equal to (A) the number of any shares issued to
                    the optionee plus (B) the number of shares purchasable

                                          6

<PAGE>
                    with the amount of any cash paid to the optionee on the
                    basis of the Fair Market Value as of the date of
                    payment; and the number of shares subject to the
                    portion of the Option so cancelled, less the number of
                    shares so charged against such limitations, shall
                    thereafter be available for other grants of Incentives.

               (l)  An Option will not be treated as an Incentive Stock
                    Option within the meaning or section 422A of the
                    Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


          6.   Stock Appreciation Rights
          ------------------------------
               (a)  A Stock Appreciation Right ("SAR") may be granted in
                    connection with any Option granted under the Plan,
                    either at the time of the grant of such Option or at
                    any time thereafter during the term of the Option, or
                    independently of the grant of an Option.

               (b)  An SAR shall entitle the holder thereof, upon exercise
                    of the SAR, to receive a number of shares of Common
                    Stock or cash or a combination of cash and shares (as
                    the Committee in its discretion may elect) determined
                    pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section 6.

               (c)  An SAR shall be subject to the following terms and
                    conditions and to such other terms and conditions not
                    inconsistent with the Plan as shall from time to time
                    be approved by the Committee:

                    (i)  If granted in connection with an Option, an SAR
                         shall be exercisable at such time or times and by
                         such person or persons and to the extent, but only
                         to the extent, that the Option to which it relates
                         shall be exercisable; provided, however, that such
                         SAR shall be exercisable only during the ten-day

                                          7

<PAGE>
                         periods (the "Exercise Periods") beginning on the
                         third business day following the date of release
                         of a summary statement of the Company's quarterly
                         or annual sales and earnings and ending on the
                         twelfth business day following such date of
                         release.

                   (ii)  If granted independently of an Option, an SAR
                         shall be subject to the following provisions:

                         (A)  If a person terminates employment prior to
                              attaining age 55, the SAR shall terminate 90
                              days after the termination of employment,
                              except in the case of death or disability.

                         (B)  If employment terminates as a result of death
                              or disability or if a person terminates
                              employment after attaining age 55, the SAR
                              will terminate one year after the termination
                              of employment.

               (d)  Upon exercise of an SAR, the holder thereof shall be
                    entitled to receive a number of shares equal in Fair
                    Market Value to (1) the amount by which the Fair Market
                    Value of a share of Common Stock on the date of such
                    exercise shall exceed the Fair Market Value of a share
                    of Common Stock on the date of grant of the related
                    Option, or, in the case of any SAR granted
                    independently of an option, on the date of grant of
                    such SAR, multiplied by (2) the number of shares in
                    respect of which the SAR shall have been exercised. 
                    Settlement for any fraction of a share due shall be
                    made in cash.  The Committee may settle all or any part
                    of the Company's obligation arising out of an exercise
                    of any SAR by the payment of cash equal to the

                                          8

<PAGE>
                    aggregate value of the shares of Common Stock that it
                    would otherwise be obligated to deliver under the
                    provisions of this paragraph (d).

               (e)  Upon exercise of any SAR, (i) there shall be charged
                    against the limitations in paragraph (a) of Section 4 a
                    number of shares equal to (A) the number of shares
                    issued to the grantee under paragraph (d) of this
                    Section 6 plus (B) the number of shares purchasable
                    with the amount of any cash paid to the grantee on the
                    basis of the Fair Market Value as of the date of
                    payment and (ii) the portion of the Incentive in
                    respect of which such SAR shall have been exercised
                    shall be cancelled and the number of shares subject to
                    such portion, less the number of shares so charged
                    against such limitations, shall thereafter be available
                    for other grants of Incentives.


          7.   Incentive Stock Rights
          ---------------------------
               (a)  An Incentive Stock Right will consist of incentive
                    stock units, each of which will be equivalent to one
                    share of Common Stock.  An Incentive Stock Right will
                    be evidenced by an agreement in form approved by the
                    Committee, will be nontransferable, will entitle the
                    holder to receive shares of Common Stock, without
                    payment to the Company, after the lapse of the
                    incentive period or periods established by the
                    Committee and will be subject to the limitations in
                    paragraph (a) of Section 4.  Holders of Incentive Stock
                    Rights will be entitled, from the date of the award, to
                    receive from the Company cash payments equal to the
                    amount of dividends declared on the number of shares of
                    Common Stock equal to the number of incentive stock
                    units held by them, such payments to be made on or
                    about the Company's dividend payment dates.

<PAGE>
               (b)  If an employee terminates employment prior to attaining
                    age 55, all Incentive Stock Rights will terminate on
                    the date employment terminates, except in the case of
                    death or disability.  If employment terminates as a
                    result of death or disability, or after attainment of
                    age 55, the Committee may elect, at the end of the
                    Incentive period, to award a portion of the shares of
                    Common Stock that would have been awarded, but for the
                    termination of employment, equal to the number of
                    months in the incentive period prior to the termination
                    date divided by the number of months in the award
                    period.

               (c)  After the lapse of the incentive period and the
                    issuance of shares, there will be charged against the
                    limitations in paragraph (a) of Section 4 the number of
                    shares equal to the number of shares issued.


          8.   Performance Unit Awards
          ----------------------------
               (a)  A Performance Unit Award will consist of performance
                    units granted to Senior Executives selected by the
                    Committee which can be paid in cash or shares of Common
                    Stock.  Performance units may be granted alone or in
                    conjunction with and related to an Option.  When
                    granted in conjunction with an Option, the number of
                    performance units, unless otherwise provided by the
                    Committee, will be equal to the number of shares under
                    the related Option.  To the extent that the Committee
                    elects to pay performance units granted with a related
                    Option, there will be a proportionate reduction in the
                    number of shares available under such Option and any
                    related SAR.  To the extent the related Option or an
                    SAR granted in connection with such Option is
                    exercised, the related number of performance units will
                    be proportionately reduced.

                                          10

<PAGE>
               (b)  The Committee will establish an initial value for each
                    performance unit at the time of grant.  At that time,
                    the Committee will also establish performance targets
                    to be achieved during the award period of not less than
                    one year set by the Committee.  The value of the
                    performance units at the end of the award period will
                    be determined by the degree to which the performance
                    targets are achieved.  Performance Unit Awards will be
                    subject to the limitations in paragraph (a) of Section
                    4 and will be evidenced by agreements setting forth the
                    initial value for each performance unit, the
                    performance targets, the award period and such other
                    terms and conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as
                    the Committee may determine.

               (c)  Payment, if any, at the end of the award period will be
                    made in cash, shares of Common Stock, or both, as
                    determined by the Committee.  A Performance Unit Award
                    granted alone, not in conjunction with an Option, is
                    automatically payable if the conditions are met.  A
                    Performance Unit Award granted in conjunction with an
                    Option is payable only at the election of the
                    Committee, as an alternative to the continuance of the
                    related option and any related SAR.  The Committee may
                    make this election to pay only during the first two
                    months after the end of the award period.  If the
                    election to pay is not made, the Performance Unit Award
                    terminates and the related Option and SAR continue in
                    effect.

               (d)  In the event of termination of employment prior to the
                    end of the award period by reason of death, disability,
                    or termination of employment after attainment of 55
                    years of age, a pro rata portion of the value of the
                    performance units at the end of the award period will

                                          11


                    be paid to the employee (or his/her estate in the case
                    of death), unless the Committee determines that a
                    different portion should be payable or elects to
                    terminate the award.  Upon termination of employment
                    under any other circum-stances, the Performance Unit
                    Award will terminate.

               (e)  Upon payment of a Performance Unit Award, there shall
                    be charged against the aggregate limitations in
                    paragraph (a) of Section 4 a number of shares equal to
                    (i) the number of any shares issued to the employee in
                    respect of the Performance Unit Award plus (ii) the
                    number of shares purchasable with the amount of any
                    cash paid to the employee in respect of the Performance
                    Unit Award on the basis of the Fair Market Value of the
                    Common Stock as of the date of payment.

               (f)  The Committee may make such adjustments to the publicly
                    reported amounts of the Company's consolidated earnings
                    or book value as it deems appropriate for changes in
                    accounting practices or principles, for material
                    acquisitions or disposition of stock or property, for
                    recapitalizations or reorganizations or for any other
                    events with respect to which the Committee determines
                    such an adjustment to be appropriate in order to avoid
                    distortion in the operation of the Plan.


          9.   Adjustment Provisions
          --------------------------
               The Options granted under the Plan shall contain such
          provisions as the Commit-tee may determine with respect to
          adjustments to be made in the number and kind of shares covered
          by such Options and in the Option price in the event of a
          reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, stock dividend,
          combination of shares, merger, consolidation, rights offering, or
          any other change in the corporate structure or shares of the

                                          12

<PAGE>
          Company, and in the event of any such change, the aggregate
          number and kind of shares available under the Plan shall be
          appropriately adjusted.  In the event of any such change,
          equitable adjustments shall also be made by the Committee in its
          discretion in the terms and conditions of any SAR, Incentive
          Stock Right, or Performance Unit Award granted under the Plan.


          10.  Term

                    to the Plan, by execution and prompt delivery to the
                    employee of instruments approved by the Committee.  Any
                    such grant shall be effective on the date of such
                    determination or, if after, on the date specified in
                    the instrument evidencing the grant.

               (c)  The interpretation and construction by the Committee of
                    any provision of the Plan and of any Incentive granted
                    thereunder shall, unless otherwise determined by the
                    Board, be final and conclusive on all persons having
                    any interest thereunder.

                    service, or other reason, if such absence is approved
                    by the Committee, shall not be considered an

          Section 4:     Delivery of Shares
          ---------------------------------
          4.1  The shares granted under the Plan shall be delivered to each
               Director and transferred on the books  of the Company either
               on the first business day of the month immediately following
               his/her termination as a  Director (the "Delivery Date") or,

               within  60 days  after  the Annual  Meeting of  Stockholders
               following his/her retirement.

          4.2  In the  event of the death of a Director prior to receipt of
               the shares earned pursuant to the grant, the shares shall be
               delivered to the beneficiary  designated by the Director or,
               in  the  absence  of  such designation,  to  the  Director's
               estate.

          4.3  Regardless of any  election by a Director to  defer delivery
               of shares,  the Retirement  Committee may  in its sole  dis-
               cretion deliver to  the Director all shares  the Director is
               entitled to receive  at any  time on or  after the  Delivery
               Date.

          4.4  All  shares  transferred  pursuant  to this  Plan  shall  be
               transferred out of treasury shares to the extent available.


          Section 5:     Dividend Equivalents
          -----------------------------------
          5.1  On  each date on  which dividends  are paid  to stockholders
               with  respect to  the  common  stock  of the  Company,  each
               Director  will be paid an  amount equal to  the dividend per
               share  for the  applicable dividend  payment date  times the
               number of shares the  Director has a right to  receive which
               have not yet been delivered ("the Dividend Equivalent").

          5.2  At the election of a Director, which election may be changed
               from time to time, the  Dividend Equivalent will be invested
               in  the Company's  common stock  in a  similar manner  as is
               authorized through the  Dividend Investment Plan  maintained

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS                    BARNES GROUP INC.

SALES

In 1994, the company's sales of $569 million were up 13.3% over 1993.  Sales
in 1993 were $502 million, 5% below 1992's level of $529 million.  Included
in the 1992 consolidated statement of income was $29 million of sales from
the Pioneer division which was sold at the end of 1992.

Associated Spring's sales for 1994 increased 17% to $272 million, following
an increase of 15% in 1993.  All operating units reported solid sales gains.
Sales were strong in all market sectors, especially transportation and
electronics.  In North America, increased penetration of a strong automotive
market and increases in sales to industrial markets contributed to the sales
gains.  Internationally, the group's Singapore operation continued its
excellent penetration of the electronics industry while Brazil increased its
export sales.  The group's distribution business, which markets die springs
and precision stock springs, also reported good sales growth.

Bowman Distribution's 1994 sales were $215 million, up $22 million or 11%
from 1993.  Bowman U.S., the group's largest business unit, achieved a sales
increase of 12% over 1993.  This sales gain was primarily the result of the
progress made in improving the performance of its field sales organization
and gains in its Custom Service Division.  Sales from Bowman's businesses in
Europe also increased 12% mainly because of the expansion in the U.K. of the
Bowman System business.  Bowman's Canadian business also showed
year-over-year gains in sales, although this increase was dampened when
converted to U.S. dollars due to a weaker Canadian dollar.  Bowman
Distribution's 1993 sales of $193 million were down $45 million from 1992.
As noted above, much of the 1993 sales decline resulted from the sale of
Bowman Distribution's Pioneer division at the end of 1992.

Barnes Aerospace sales were $82 million in 1994, up 7% from 1993, following a
decline of 15% in 1993.  Strong gains were reported by the group's Advanced
Fabrications and its Repair and Overhaul businesses.  The sales of the
group's Precision Machining business were adversely affected by weakness in
both its commercial and military markets.

OPERATING INCOME

Consolidated operating income in 1994 was $36.6 million, compared to $12.5
million in 1993 and $7.3 million in 1992.  Provisions for plant closings and
restructurings taken in both 1993 and 1992 dampened operating earnings in
each of these years.  Excluding these charges, operating income was $17.4
million in 1993 and $25.1 million in 1992.  The gain in operating income in
1994 resulted from the increased volume of business, manufacturing
efficiencies and overall containment of costs.  The focus on cost control led
to lower selling and administrative expenses, stated as a percent of sales,
in 1994, as compared to prior years.

Operating income in 1993 included a $3.4 million charge for a plant
consolidation and work force reduction at Barnes Aerospace and a $1.5 million
charge for a plant consolidation at Associated Spring's Mexican operations. 
Operating income in 1992 included a $4.7 million charge for restructuring the
sales organization at Bowman's U.S. business, a provision of $9.1 million to
cover plant closings at Associated Spring, and a $4.0 million charge
related to the termination of a contract for C-17 aircraft parts at Barnes
Aerospace's Advanced Fabrications business.

Associated Spring's 1994 operating income rose $13.1 million, or 46%, from
the 1993 level before plant closing provisions.  Gains in manufacturing
productivity coupled with excellent control of selling and administrative
expenses resulted in highly leveraged profit growth on the group's strong
sales gain.

Bowman's operating income in 1994 of $12.6 million was $5.9 million above the
1993 level.  This gain reflects a higher sales volume in both the U.S. and
Europe and sharply lower selling and administrative expenses, stated
as a percent of sales. 

                                                                       11


<PAGE>


MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Excluding the 1993 plant closing and restructuring charges, Barnes
Aerospace's operating loss was reduced by $2.7 million in 1994.  The 1994
operating loss of $1.8 million included $1.1 million of severance costs
recognized in the fourth quarter.  The smaller loss in 1994 was due to ongoing
productivity improvements and cost reduction programs.  In addition, the
group's Repair and Overhaul business achieved good profit leverage on
significantly higher sales volume.  On the negative side, the Advanced
Fabrications unit suffered from high development and start-up costs
associated with new business in 1994.

Please refer to Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on
pages 26-27 for further information about the company's operations by
business segment.

NON-OPERATING INCOME/EXPENSE

Other income was $4.6 million in 1994, $4.1 million in 1993 and $3.5 million
in 1992, and includes $2.3 million, $1.7 million and $0.9 million, respectively,
from the company's investment in NASCO, a company jointly owned with NHK
Spring Co., Ltd. of Japan.  Interest income, another component of other
income, increased 56% over 1993 to $1.3 million, primarily due to higher
interest rates on funds invested in Brazil. 

Interest expense decreased slightly in 1994 following a sharp decline in
1993.  In 1994, the impact of lower debt levels was largely offset by higher
interest rates.  Lower debt levels and interest rates caused the decline in
1993.

Other expenses decreased in 1994 following an increase in 1993 primarily due
to foreign exchange and translation losses.  These losses were $0.5 million,
$1.7 million and $0.1 million in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

INCOME TAXES

The company's effective tax rate was 40.1% in 1994 compared with 47.8% in
1993 and 24.0% in 1992.  Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements on page 22 contains an explanatory table showing the factors
affecting the company's effective tax rate in each of these years.

At December 31, 1994, the company had deferred income tax assets of $56.9
million, less a valuation allowance of $6.0 million, and deferred income tax
liabilities of $18.4 million.  Management believes that sufficient income
will be earned in future years to realize the deferred tax assets.

NET INCOME AND NET INCOME PER SHARE

Consolidated income was $20.3 million in 1994, $4.4 million in 1993 and $5.8
million, before the effect of accounting changes, in 1992.  On a per share
basis, income for 1994 was $3.20, compared to $.70 in 1993 and $.94, before
effect of accounting changes, in 1992.  In 1992, after giving effect to
accounting changes, the company had a net loss of $34.9 million, or $5.62
per share.

INFLATION

Management believes that inflation during the 1992-1994 period did not have a
material impact on the company's historical financial statements.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

The company's financial condition, as measured by its statement of cash flows
and balance sheet, remained strong.  The following is a discussion of the
significant elements of these financial statements.

Cash Flows

Operating activities are the principal source of cash flows for the company,
generating $38 million in 1994, $18 million more than 1993.  During the
past three years, operating activities provided over $100 million in
cash which the company used to pay dividends to stockholders and fund
significant investments in new plant and equipment.

 12













<PAGE>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

Investing activities utilized cash of $31 million in 1994 compared with $21
million in 1993.  Capital expenditures of $32 million continued at an
accelerated pace in 1994, 43% higher than 1993 and nearly 100% higher than
1992.  During the past three years the company has invested over $70
million in new plant and equipment with nearly 60% of that invested at
Associated Spring in new equipment aimed at improving quality and
productivity and providing for the manufacture of new products. 
In 1995, capital expenditures are expected to exceed 1994's level, with
the level of investments in all three businesses expected to be up.

The company's financing activities used cash of $8 million in 1994 compared
to $11 million in 1993.  In 1994 and 1993 the company continued to use
surplus cash generated by its U.S. operations to reduce borrowings under
short-term lines of credit.  Cash dividends were increased in the fourth
quarter of 1994 from $.35 per share to $.40 per share.  Partially offsetting
these uses was the cash generated from the issuance of common stock, largely
in response to the exercise of employee stock options.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The company's liquidity, measured in terms of the level of working capital,
was $88 million at December 31, 1994, compared to $87 million at December 31,
1993.  The current ratio, a key measure of liquidity, approximated 2.0 at
both December 31, 1994 and 1993.

In evaluating the company's working capital position, consideration should be
given to the fact that the majority of its inventories are accounted for on a
LIFO basis.  If these inventories were stated on a current cost basis, their
value would have been higher by $13 million in both 1994 and 1993.

The company's ratio of debt to total capitalization improved to 28% at
year-end 1994 from 31% at year-end 1993.  For this purpose, total
capitalization is defined as total interest-bearing debt, plus accrued
long-term retirement benefits, other long-term liabilities and stockholders'
equity, excluding the guaranteed ESOP obligation.

During 1994, the company funded nearly $13 million of cash requirements for
its operations in Mexico and Europe using surplus cash from other foreign
operations.  Foreign cash requirements in 1995 are expected to be funded in
this manner.  To supplement internal cash generation in the U.S., the company
maintains substantial bank borrowing facilities.  At December 31, 1994, the
company had $100 million of borrowing capacity available under a revolving
credit agreement which expires in December of 1999.  In addition, the company
has available approximately $155 million in uncommitted, short-term bank
credit lines, of which $30 million was in use at December 31, 1994.  During
1994 and 1993, the company maintained long-term debt of $70 million,
comprised in part, of borrowings under its short-term bank credit lines
backed by its long-term revolving credit agreement.  The company has found
this to be a cost effective approach to long-term financing and intends to
continue this approach in 1995.  The company believes these bank credit
facilities coupled with cash generated from operations are adequate for its
future requirements.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

As of January 1, 1992, the company recorded the effect of changes in three
accounting principles: one related to postretirement benefits other than
pensions (FAS 106), another for other postemployment benefits (FAS 112), and
a third for income taxes (FAS 109).  The aggregate, one-time effect of these
changes reflected in the 1992 results was a charge of $40.7 million net of
tax benefits, equal to $6.56 per common share.

                                                                       13

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(All dollar amounts included in the notes are stated in thousands except
per share data and the tables in Note 14.)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION:  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the company and all of its subsidiaries.  Intercompany
transactions and account balances have been eliminated.  The company accounts
for its 45% investment in the common stock of NASCO, an automotive suspension
spring company jointly owned with NHK Spring Co., Ltd. of Japan, under
the equity method.  Other income in the accompanying income statements
includes $2,314, $1,734 and $940 for the years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, of income from the Company's investment in NASCO.

Certain reclassifications have been made in the 1993 and 1992 amounts to
conform with the 1994 presentation. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION:  Sales and related cost of sales are recognized when
products are shipped to customers.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  All highly liquid investments purchased with a
maturity of three months or less are cash equivalents and are carried at fair
market value.

INVENTORIES:  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market.  The
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method was used to accumulate the cost of all U.S.
inventories which represent 74% of total inventories.  The cost of foreign
subsidiary inventories was determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO)
method.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost.  Depreciation is provided using accelerated methods over estimated
useful lives ranging generally from 20 to 50 years for buildings, 3 to 17
years for machinery and equipment and 2 to 5 years for tooling.  Maintenance
and repairs charged to expense were $16,341, $12,966 and $11,952 in 1994,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

GOODWILL:  Goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the net assets
of companies acquired in business combinations.  Goodwill acquired since 1970
is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years; similar
investments for businesses acquired prior to 1970 (approximately $5,200) are
not being amortized.  The company has determined that there is no indication
of any impairment in the value of goodwill.  Accumulated amortization was
$7,002 and $6,415 at December 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:  Assets and liabilities of foreign operations,
except those in countries with high rates of inflation, are translated at
year-end rates of exchange; revenue and expenses are translated at average
annual rates of exchange.  The resulting translation gains and losses are
reflected in foreign currency translation adjustments within stockholders'
equity.

For operations in countries that have high rates of inflation, translation
gains and losses are included in net income.  These losses, along with those
generated from foreign currency transactions, were $550, $1,661 and $147 in
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

INCOME (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE:  Income (loss) per common share is based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. 
The effect of common stock equivalents (stock options) is not material. 
For purposes of calculating income per share, Employee Stock Ownership Plan
(ESOP) shares are considered outstanding.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE:  Effective January 1, 1992, the company
adopted three new accounting standards, Statements of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, No. 109 and No. 112.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," requires companies to
recognize the estimated future cost of providing health and other
post-retirement benefits on an accrual basis during the period such benefits
are earned by employees.  These benefits were previously expensed when paid.
The company elected to record the previously unrecognized service cost of
these benefits immediately, reducing 1992 net income by $38,054, ($63,424
less related deferred income tax benefit of $25,370) or $6.14 per share.

                                                            BARNES GROUP INC.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," requires that the liability method be used to calculate deferred
income taxes.  Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities
are recognized on temporary differences between the financial statement and
tax bases of assets and liabilities using applicable tax rates.  The
cumulative effect of this standard was to reduce 1992 net income by $950 or
$.15 per share.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting
for Postemployment Benefits," requires that the cost of benefits provided to
former or inactive employees be recognized on the accrual basis of
accounting.  Previously, the company recognized postemployment benefit costs
(primarily medical benefits provided to certain employees receiving workers'
compensation or long-term disability benefits) when paid.  The cumulative
effect of this change in accounting principle, net of deferred income tax
benefit, reduced 1992 net income by $1,691, or $.27 per share.

2. DIVESTITURE

In December, 1992, the company sold its Pioneer division (formerly part of
the Bowman Distribution business segment) for $17,056 in cash.  The company
recognized a pre-tax gain of $5,000 on the sale.  Sales for Pioneer in 1992
included in the company's consolidated income statement were $29,349.

Senior Notes placed with insurance companies are payable in thirteen
semi-annual payments of $3,077, beginning in September, 1995, and bear
interest at 9.47%. The fair value of these notes is determined using
discounted cash flows based on the company's estimated current interest rate
for similar types of borrowings.  The carrying values of other long-term
debt, notes payable and guaranteed ESOP obligation approximate their fair
value.

The company has a revolving credit agreement with six banks that allows
borrowings up to $100,000 under notes due December 6, 1999.  A commitment fee
of .17% per annum is paid on the unused portion of the commitments.  The
company had no borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

The company has available approximately $155,000 in uncommitted, short-term
bank credit lines, of which $30,000 and $33,500 were in use at December 31,
1994 and 1993, respectively. The interest rate on these borrowings was 6.2%
and 3.4% at December 31, 1994 and 1993.

At December 31, 1994, the company classified $23,000 of borrowings under its
lines of credit and $3,077 of its Senior Notes due within one year as
long-term debt.  The company has both the intent and the ability, through its
revolving credit agreement, to refinance these amounts on a long-term basis.

The company does not use derivatives for trading purposes.  Interest rate
swaps, a form of derivative, are used to manage interest costs.  During 1994
and 1993, the company used two interest rate swaps, one of which matured
in 1994.  Currently, the company maintains an interest rate swap agreement
which effectively converts $20,000 of its fixed rate Senior Notes to floating
rate debt with interest equal to LIBOR plus 83 basis points.  The effective
interest rate on this floating rate portion was 7.3% and 4.2% at December 31,
1994 and 1993, respectively.  The difference between fixed rate and
floating rate interest is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense
in the period incurred.  This swap decreases as the Senior Notes are repaid. 
The fair value of the swap is estimated based upon current settlement prices
and was approximately $710 at December 31, 1994.

The company has guaranteed $7,400 of letters of credit and capital lease
obligations related to its 45% investment in NASCO.  In addition, the company
has other outstanding letters of credit totalling $8,000 at December 31, 1994.

Maturities of long-term debt in each of the next five years are: $3,077,
$6,154, $6,154, $6,154 and $29,154.  As noted, the 1995 maturity has
been classified as long-term.

Certain of the company's debt arrangements contain requirements as to
maintenance of minimum levels of working capital and net worth, and place
certain restrictions on dividend payments and acquisitions of the company's
common stock.  Under the most restrictive covenant in any agreement, $34,009
was available for dividends or acquisitions of common stock at December 31,
1994.

Interest paid was $5,626, $5,496 and $6,650 in the years 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

The company has not recognized deferred income taxes on $60,177 of
undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries
since such earnings are considered to be reinvested indefinitely. 
If the earnings were distributed in the form of dividends, the
company would be subject to both U.S. income taxes and foreign
withholding taxes.  Determination of the amount of this unrecognized
deferred income tax liability is not practicable.

company at a price of five cents per Right at any time until the tenth day
following public announcement that a person or group has acquired or intends
to acquire 50% or more of the outstanding common stock.

If, following the acquisition by a person or group of 50% or more of the
outstanding shares of the company's common stock, the company is acquired in
a merger or other business combination or 50% or more of the company's assets
or earning power is sold or transferred, each outstanding Right becomes
exercisable for common stock or other securities of the acquiring entity
having a value of twice the exercise price of the Right.

9. PREFERRED STOCK

At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the company had 3,000,000 shares of $1 par
value preferred stock authorized, none of which were outstanding.

10. STOCK PLANS

All U.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees are eligible to participate
in the company's Guaranteed Stock Plan (GSP).  The GSP provides for the
investment of employer and employee contributions in the company's
common stock.  The company guarantees a minimum rate of return on certain GSP
assets. 

The GSP is a leveraged Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).  In 1989, the
GSP purchased 579,310 shares of the company's common stock at a cost of
$21,000 using the proceeds of a loan guaranteed by the company.  These
shares are held in trust and are issued to employees' accounts in the
GSP as the loan is repaid.  Principal and interest on the GSP loan are
being paid in quarterly installments through 1999.  The loan bears
interest based on LIBOR.  At December 31, 1994 the interest rate was 6.2%. 
Interest of $653, $592 and $773 was incurred in 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

Contributions and certain dividends received are used in part by the GSP to
service its debt.  Contributions in-clude both employee contributions up to a
maximum of 10% of eligible pay and matching company contributions.

The company contributions are equal to the amount required by the Plan to pay
the principal and interest due under the Plan loan plus that required to
purchase any additional shares required to be allocated to participant
accounts, less the sum of participant contributions and dividends received by
the Plan.  The GSP used $1,323 of company dividends for debt service in 1994,
and used $1,277 in each of the years 1993 and 1992.  The company expenses all
cash contributions made to the GSP.  Compensation expense related to the GSP
was $2,268, $2,452 and $1,682 in 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.  In
addition to the company shares held in trust, the GSP also purchases the
company's common stock on the open market to meet its requirements. 
As of December 31, 1994, the GSP held 1,184,332 shares of the company's
common stock, of which 283,720 shares were unallocated.

                                                                       23

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

For financial statement purposes, the company reflects its guarantee of the
GSP's debt as a liability with a like amount reflected as a reduction of
stockholders' equity.

The company also has an Employee Stock Purchase Plan under which eligible
employees may elect to have up to 10% of base compensation deducted from
payroll for the purchase of the company's common stock at 85% of
market value.  The maximum number of shares which may be purchased
under the Plan is 675,000.  During 1994, 22,367 shares (23,737 and 23,532
shares in 1993 and 1992, respectively) were purchased.  As of December 31,
1994, 242,883 shares may be issued in the future.

The 1991 Barnes Group Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the granting of
incentives to officers and other executives in the form of stock options,
stock appreciation rights, incentive stock rights and performance unit
awards.  A predecessor plan which provided for similar incentives expired
in 1991.  Options granted under that plan continue to be exercisable and
any options which terminate without being exercised become available for
grant under the 1991 Plan.  A maximum of 806,972 common shares are
subject to issuance under this plan after December 31, 1994.

===============================================================================================================================
</TABLE>

A deferred tax asset is included in the accompanying balance sheet
recognizing the future tax benefit of the post-retirement benefit obligations
(See Note 7).

Cash payments made in 1994, 1993 and 1992 for postretirement benefits were
$4,828, $4,597 and $4,229, respectively.

The company's accumulated benefit obligations take into account certain
cost-sharing provisions.  The annual assumed rate of increase in the cost of
covered benefits (i.e., healthcare cost trend rate) is assumed to be 13.0%
for 1994 gradually reducing to 5.0% by the year 2001.  A one percentage point
increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase the
accumulated benefit obligations by approximately $6,030 at December 31, 1994
and would increase 1994 expense by approximately $642.

Discount rates of 8.25%, 7.5% and 9.25% were used in determining the
accumulated benefit obligations at December 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

13. LEASES

Rent expense was $6,072, $5,256 and $5,535 for 1994, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.  Minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases
(principally for buildings and equipment) in years 1995 through 1999 are
$3,705, $2,781, $1,896, $1,521, $998 and $5,258 thereafter.

14. INFORMATION ON BUSINESS SEGMENTS

The company operates three businesses:

ASSOCIATED SPRING manufactures and distributes precision springs and custom
metal parts.

BOWMAN DISTRIBUTION distributes fast-moving, consumable repair and
replacement products for industrial, transportation and heavy equipment
maintenance markets.

BARNES AEROSPACE manufactures and repairs jet engine components and airframe
parts principally for the aircraft and aerospace markets.

The following tables set forth information about the company's operations by
its three business segments and by geographic area.

Sales between the business segments and between the geographic areas are
accounted for on the same basis as sales to unaffiliated customers. 
Operating income includes net sales less cost of sales, selling and
administrative expenses and the cost of plant closings and restructurings. 
In 1993, plant closings and restructurings included $3.4 million for 
combining operations of the Aerospace machining units and $1.5 million for 
the consolidation of Associated Spring's operations in Mexico.  In 1992,
plant closings and restructurings included $9.1 million for closing
Associated Spring plants in Ohio, California and Tennessee and a
distribution facility in Pennsylvania, $4.7 million for restructuring Bowman
Distribution's U.S. sales organization, and $4.0 million related to the
termination of a contract for C-17 aircraft parts made by the Barnes
Aerospace Advanced Fabrications business.  Other income and expenses are not
included in operating income.  Corporate assets consist of cash and cash
equivalents, deferred income taxes, other assets, transportation equipment
and the Executive Office building.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

15. CONTINGENCY

In December, 1991, the company was notified by the McDonnell Douglas
Corporation that McDonnell Douglas was terminating for default an $8,200
contract with the company's Advanced Fabrication unit.  In 1992, the company
wrote off $4,000 of net assets related to this contract previously included
in its financial statements.  The company believes it has legitimate defenses
to the default claim.  While no reasonable estimate of the possible loss or
range of loss can be made at this time, management believes that it is
unlikely that the ultimate resolution of this dispute will have a material
effect on future results of operations of the company.  In management's
opinion, the ultimate resolution of this dispute, regardless of the outcome,
will not have a material effect on the financial position of the company.





REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Barnes Group Inc.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders' equity and of
cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Barnes Group Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1994, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.  These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management; our re-sponsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  We
conducted our audit of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.  The
financial statements of Barnes Group Inc. for the years ended December 31,
1993 and 1992 were audited by other independent accountants whose report
dated January 28, 1994 on those statements included an explanatory paragraph
relative to the change, in 1992, in the methods of accounting for income
taxes and for certain postretirement and postemployment benefits.

(1) All per-share data, other than earnings per common share, are based on
    common shares outstanding at the end of each year.  Earnings per common
    share are based on weighted average common shares outstanding during
    each year.

(2) Includes a $3.4 million pretax, $2.0 million after-tax charge ($.33
    per share) against income related  to the plant consolidation and work
    force reduction at Barnes Aerospace and a $1.5 million charge without
    tax benefit ($.24 per share) for a plant consolidation at Associated
    Spring's Mexican operations.

(3) Includes a $17.8 million pretax, $10.7 million after-tax charge
    ($1.73 per share) against income related to the costs of plant closings
    at Associated Spring, Barnes Aerospace charges on a terminated contract
    and restructuring of Bowman U.S. sales organization.  These charges were
    partially offset by a $5.0 million pretax gain, $3.7 million after-tax
    ($.60 per share) from the sale of Bowman's Pioneer division.

(4) Barnes Group adopted three new accounting standards in 1992 retroactive
    to the beginning of the year.  Included is a one-time $39.7 million
    after-tax charge ($6.41 per share) to comply with FAS 106 and 112
    which changes the accounting for certain postretirement and
    postemployment benefits to the accrual method and an additional
    $1.0 million income tax charge ($.15 per share) for FAS 109, which
    changed income tax accounting.
